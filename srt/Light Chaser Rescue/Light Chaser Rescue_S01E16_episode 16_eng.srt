1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,900
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,200
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,300
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,200
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,500
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,900

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Do you want to hear more from me?

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,400
I do.

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,800
Didn't you want to know

23
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,200
why I gave the house to my ex-wife?

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Many years ago,

25
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,900
I went fishing by the river with my son.

26
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,100
Unfortunately, he drowned.

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,600
My son's gone.

28
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,900
And my wife also left me.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,600
She said that...

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,700
she didn't want to stay in this heart-breaking place.

31
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,400
At that time,

32
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,000
I thought...

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,700
there's nothing in this world to live for.

34
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,500
Once, I had a happy family.

35
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,900
And... it's gone.

36
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,500
I was alive then,

37
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:13,000
but no better than a walking dead.

38
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,800
In the hardest and the saddest time of my life,

39
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,800
I met Qingshan.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,800
He gave me a second life.

41
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
During these years,

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,300
I've done a lot,

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
and saved a lot of people.

44
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,500
Now,

45
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,300
I've lived a worthy life.

46
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
There's no regret.

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,700
Don't say that.

48
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm only sorry to my ex-wife.

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,600
She should have had a happy family.

50
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,800
It's all my fault.

51
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,900
Now there's no family.

52
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,300
And our son is gone.

53
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,400
So, you want to make it up to her.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,200
Make it up?

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,100
A house cannot make it up.

56
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,100
The wallet.

57
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,700
- The wallet. 
 - The wallet.

58
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,500
I'll get it.

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Here.

60
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,400
Open it.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Is this your son?

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,900
His name was Congcong.

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,100
He was very clever.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,500
But he never worked hard.

65
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,000
He was always mischievous.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And he was righteous, too.

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,400
The kids in the neighborhood all liked him.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
A little brat.

69
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,300
Sounds like you.

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
Falcon.

71
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Falcon! Falcon!

72
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
Falcon!

73
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,000
I have a favor to ask you.

74
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Canyou drive faster?

75
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
Sit tight.

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
Got it?

77
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,600
Yes.

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,100
I hope you can do it as soon as possible.

79
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
Rest assured.

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,600
I feel a little hungry.

81
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,300
What do you want to eat?

82
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,200
I can buy you some.

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,300
I want to eat some...

84
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,840
What about...

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,000
some porridge?

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,300
Right. Porridge.

87
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,400
Millet porridge made of chicken soup.

88
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
Good. Wait here.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll buy it for you.

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,400
You should stop talking...

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
and get some good rest.

92
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,400
Yan.

93
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,200
I...

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,500
I am leaving.

95
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:55,400
You're the one I'm most concerned about.

96
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,300
Don't talk nonsense.

97
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,900
I have regarded you as my own daughter

98
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,200
since you were a kid.

99
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,900
I know that.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,100
You... look strong.

101
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,500
But deep inside, you're soft...

102
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,700
and vulnerable.

103
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,700
And when you get hurt, you won't tell anyone.

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,700
You just take it yourself.

105
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,600
Just like your own father.

106
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I know that...

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,000
you can't forgive your father.

108
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,200
But you have him in mind,

109
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,000
and you care about him.

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,700
You've got to tell him yourself.

111
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
I'm leaving.

112
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,500
And your own father's getting old.

113
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,200
There's no time if you don't say it.

114
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,700
The life of a man passes quickly.

115
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,800
And you'll regret it.

116
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,900
Don't. I'm begging you.

117
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,840
Just stop talking.

118
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,200
Get some rest.

119
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,900
Listen to me.

120
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,700
I know that...

121
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,800
many people around you care for you.

122
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm glad.

123
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,700
You must be patient,

124
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,900
and give them more...

125
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,700
Okay.

126
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,200
The photo.

127
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
The photo.

128
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,600
My boy,

129
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,000
Daddy's coming for you.

130
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,600
During these years,

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,300
I've saved a lot of people.

132
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,400
So you won't blame me...

133
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,200
when I see you again.

134
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,600
Dad Fan!

135
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Dad Fan!

136
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,600
Quick, prepare to resuscitate!

137
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,100
Copy that!

138
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,400
Ambulation!

139
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,600
Zhongwen.

140
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,370
 Send your gear here!

141
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,640
 Or I'll write your names on the blackboard!

142
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:51,550
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

143
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,530
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

144
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:06,800

♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

147
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:29,000
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

148
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,830
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

149
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,080

♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

152
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:08,325
♫  At first, words were disdainful reflections  ♫

153
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:15,725
♫  Until the loneliness after the uproar  ♫

154
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:23,325

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,290
End of the silence.

♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

166
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,520
Dear all, today,

167
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm here to meet you as the attorney of Mr. Fan Zhongwen.

168
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,930
On his deathbed,

169
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,960
he appointed me as his executor.

170
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,470
Mr. Fan Zhongwen wants to use all his savings

171
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:12,630
to buy rescue equipment and donate it all to the Light Chaser Rescue.

172
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,750
This is to be executed forthwith.

173
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,270
Thanks to Falcon.

174
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,040
And thanks to you.

175
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,250
Captain Qingshan,

176
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,610
I'm applying to join Light Chaser Rescue Team.

177
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,990
Luo Ben, have you thought it over?

178
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,410
I, Luo Ben,

179
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,660
officially apply to join Light Chaser Rescue Team.

180
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,820
- I volunteer to join Light Chaser Rescue Team. 
 - I volunteer to join Light Chaser Rescue Team.

181
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,290
 I'll follow the volunteer spirit

182
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,120
 of dedication, friendliness, mutual help, and progress.

183
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,070
I'll follow the volunteer spirit

184
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,290
of dedication, friendliness, mutual help, and progress.

185
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,440
 - I'll train hard and diligently.  
 - I'll train hard and diligently.

186
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,670
 I will do everything I can to save lives

187
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,990
 in the face of all kinds of crises.

188
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,170
I will do everything I can to save lives

189
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,830
in the face of all kinds of crises.

190
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,020
Falcon's story is touching.

191
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,380
On behalf of the Disaster Reduction Center of Ministry of Emergency Management

192
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,630
and on my own behalf, I would like to pay tribute to him.

193
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:59,480
I thank you for Falcon.

194
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,550
There's another thing about the insurance of your members.

195
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,340
Several insurance companies have explicitly stated that

196
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,420
they can take care of the insurance at any time.

197
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,460
They're all willing to offer you their service.

198
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,060
Great.

199
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,300
This way, our members will have no worries when they go on missions.

200
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,730
Don't worry.

201
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,880
Since the MEM was established,

202
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,960
the support for public welfare rescue teams will increase.

203
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,540
Thank you.

204
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,630
You loved alcohol.

205
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,520
Today, you can finally drink it up.

206
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,740
Here's to you.

207
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,370
Don't worry.

208
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,550
I'll take care of the gift of your house.

209
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,990
Aunt Yulian should live well for the rest of her life.

210
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,020
The rest of your properties

211
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,560
have been donated to the rescue team as per procedure to maintain the equipment.

212
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,370
Hope you can see your family there.

213
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,330
And you don't need to play someone else's dad anymore.

214
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,720
You have fulfilled his will.

215
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,210
He will be happy.

216
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,340
He donated all his savings to the rescue team.

217
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,820
He doesn't even care about what others are pursuing vigorously.

218
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,460
He's been like this as long as I've known him.

219
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,780
Why do you call him Dad Fan?

220
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,280
When I was in college,

221
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,260
there was a recognition assembly for outstanding student representatives.

222
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,970
I was a representative.

223
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,220
And my parent needed to make a speech.

224
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,190
Since then, he's been Dad Fan.

225
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,030
 Okay. Be quiet.

226
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,220
 Now the assembly officially opens.

227
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,300
 Let's welcome Zhan Yan's father,

228
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:43,240
 Mr. Fan Zhongwen, to make a speech.

229
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,360

230
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:02,490
 Hello, everyone, I'm Zhan Yan's father.

231
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,350
 I'm a little bit nervous.

232
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,110
 I didn't expect so many people here today.

233
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,320
 No wonder Zhan Yan gave me a draft.

234
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,260
 But this morning, I was so hurried that I forgot it.

235
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,020
 To be honest,

236
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:31,430
 everyone wants a beautiful and outstanding daughter like Zhan Yan.

237
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,320
 Mr. Principal, it's so insightful of you to select her as the representative.

238
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,550
I made a draft for him.

239
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,810
But the result was an impromptu...

240
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,910
That rocked the house?

241
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,310
It was a disaster.

242
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,960
Falcon has a strength...

243
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,670
that makes me feel small.

244
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,410
Did it shake your value?

245
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,920
I've joined the rescue team.

246
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:18,280

247
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,920
You drank. I'll drive the car.

248
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,580
You'll be my driver? Such a pleasure.

249
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,930
It's okay.

250
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,320
Mind your own safety belt.

251
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,460
Not late today.

252
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,520
I'll hand in the new chapter next week. Any other commands?

253
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,840
Is the Wonder Eagle in your comic based on Falcon?

254
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,830
I really wanted Falcon to see my work.

255
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,040
I think he would have liked my Wonder Eagle.

256
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,240
But I was late.

257
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,000
Ding Dingding, why do you like drawing comics?

258
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,810
Why are you asking me such a boring question?

259
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:05,500
Your leader's asking. Answer it carefully.

260
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,950
Because I feel there are a lot of regrets in real life.

261
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:19,260
But in the comic world, in my comic world, I can make up for these regrets.

262
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,780
I can create happy endings.

263
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,820
Falcon's revival is in your comic.

264
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,710
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

265
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,000
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

266
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,590
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

267
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,360
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

268
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,350
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

269
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:03,370
♫  I yearn for a galaxy like a night watchman  ♫

270
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:08,380
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

271
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,550
♫  That place that settles the heart is a world filled with dust  ♫

272
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:21,980
♫  Always believe in the extension of light  ♫

273
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:28,740
♫  I will always believe in sincerity and kindness  ♫

274
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,420
♫  All those who are struggling will eventually be magnanimous in the end  ♫

275
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:42,180
♫  Courage will take us to fly above the waves  ♫

276
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,240
♫  The dreams I carry will be burning  ♫

277
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,730
♫  Will be flaming hot  ♫

278
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,780
♫  Will be blooming  ♫

279
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,600

280
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,850
♫  Will be shining  ♫

281
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,250
♫  Becoming light  ♫

282
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,450

283
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,280
Thanks, Grandma Qin.

284
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,320
- You're welcome. 
 - Bye.

285
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,070
How strange.

286
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,120
Come in.

287
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,360
Old He.

288
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,360
Sit down.

289
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:39,870
Casual dressing.

290
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,030
What's going on today?

291
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,510
Old He, I'd like to take a leave.

292
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,240
No problem.

293
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,770
You need some rest.

294
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,050
Others feel stressed if you don't take your holiday.

295
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,010
How long are you leaving?

296
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,650
Half a month, or half a year.

297
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,510
Probably longer.

298
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,730
Are you taking a leave or are you resigning?

299
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,920
We can't do without you. Be aware of that.

300
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,390
Well, Old Gao and you are still taking control.

301
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,100
Are you going to travel around the world?

302
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,880
Why are you leaving so long?

303
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,500
I'm traveling nowhere.

304
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
I just need some rest.

305
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,520
You barely ask me for anything.

306
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,790
I should have said yes.

307
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,570
But it's too hard for me.

308
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:40,230
I don't know what to say.

309
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,790
Take it easy.

310
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,960
If there's anything important, I'll come back.

311
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,110
Okay, then.

312
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,750
That's our deal.

313
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,720
Thanks.

314
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,620
- Bye. 
 - Okay.

315
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,410
Keep in touch.

316
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,840
Today, we're practicing tying knots.

317
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,170
Figure-eight knot.

318
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,470
Fisherman's knot.

319
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,470
Bowline.

320
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,470
Ready.

321
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,740
Start.

322
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,090
Time's up.

323
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,100
Luo Ben, tell me.

324
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,090
What knot is this?

325
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,360
It's a bowline.

326
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,540
Haven't you eaten anything?

327
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,120
Louder!

328
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,770
- It's a bowline! 
 - What's a bowline for?

329
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:24,490
Attach the end of a rope to a natural object for weight bearing.

330
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,170
Which knot did you use when you saved your neighbor who jumped off the building?

331
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,630
- A bowline. 
 - Bullshit!

332
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,560
Peng. Calm down, Peng.

333
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,600
If you had tied a bowline, why would it have come off?

334
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,780
- Peng, calm down. 
 - Why did Falcon get hurt?

335
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,720
- We're teammates. 
 - Right.

336
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,300
Get off!

337
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,430
Answer me. You're a lawyer.

338
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,000
You should be talkative.

339
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,050
Why are you dumb?

340
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,720
You're protecting him?

341
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,350
If he hadn't been self-righteous and couldn't tie a proper knot,

342
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,340
Falcon wouldn't have died!

343
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:00,460
Stop it.

344
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,060
I can't accept this.

345
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,800
I can't understand.

346
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,450
Why do we have to take him?

347
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,340
I don't accept it!

348
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,550
The training ends.

349
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,360
Peng is straightforward.

350
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,680
Don't take it seriously.

351
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,310
I don't blame him.

352
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,930
I should take responsibility for Falcon's death.

353
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,730
I didn't tie the rope tight and properly.

354
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:04,410
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

355
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,700
All of us make mistakes.

356
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,030
No one wanted it.

357
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,990
 Tomorrow is the first day of my diner.

358
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,970
 Do you have time?

359
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,160
 I'll definitely be there to witness the start of your new life.

360
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,470
 Football.

361
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,180
 This equals a foot.

362
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,620
 And this is a ball.

363
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,990
 It means football.

364
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,920
 Football.

365
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,900
Here, your wonton.

366
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,960
- Thank you. 
 - Good appetite.

367
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,830

368
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,090
You're here.

369
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,440
Thanks.

370
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,950
Are you hungry?

371
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,950
Wait for a moment. I'll serve you a few when it's ready.

372
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,930
Excuse me, I want two sets of wonton.

373
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,510
Please wait a minute. It'll be coming soon.

374
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,760
I've got to wait? Forget it then.

375
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,270
Sorry.

376
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,630
 You can't do it all by yourself.

377
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,370
 I can help you.

378
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,440
It's okay.

379
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,970
I get up at 4:00 to make the dough. And I get my diner ready at 6:00.

380
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,820
It's too early for you.

381
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,850

382
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,950
 Exercise time.

383
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:31,290
 I don't want my staff to sit there all day and get really sick when they're young.

384
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,320
 It reduces efficiency.

385
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,750
 I'll check your WeRun at 9:00 to see if it's more than 8,000 steps.

386
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,340
Zhou Mingming, are you out of your mind?

387
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,610
It's just 5:00.

388
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,200
Do you have any humanity at all?

389
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,890
Where are you going?

390
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,310
Do morning exercise in this?

391
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,230
You must be kidding me.

392
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,720
Where are you going indeed?

393
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,300
Okay. I'll ask your brother about it.

394
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,390
Just tell me.

395
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,590
I swear.

396
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:54,220
I'm going to help Xiong Fei with his diner.

397
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,750
Xiong Fei and you?

398
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,000
What a surprise.

399
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,010
What happened?

400
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,750
When did you get started?

401
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,810
Tell me about it when you're back.

402
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,610

403
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,830
I want a bowl of wontons.

404
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,030
- Me, too. 
 - Wait a sec.

405
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,900
Excuse me, I want two bowls.

406
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,000
- Hi, a bowl here. 
 - I didn't expect so many people.

407
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:59,920

408
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,530
Luo Yuan.

409
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:17,620
You've had a tough day.

410
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,360
Thank you.

411
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:29,720
I. am. teaching myself. sign language.

412
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,140
Am I doing it...

413
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,020
doing it right?

414
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,290
Right. Right.

415
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,030
I'll clean these up.

416
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,020
Take a break. I'll do it.

417
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,920
Yuan Yuan, it's time to get up.

418
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,080
Yuan Yuan.

419
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,640
Yuan.

420
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,040
Yuan?

421
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm coming in.

422
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,760
Where is she?

423
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,390
She's been hardworking today.

424
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:46,720
Excuse me. Have you seen this person?

425
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,750
- No. 
 - Thank you.

426
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:51,080
Hello. Have you seen this person?

427

00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,900
Gao Junchi signed a new client today.

Now he's a senior partner.
