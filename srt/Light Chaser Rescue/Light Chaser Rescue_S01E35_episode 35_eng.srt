00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,850
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,950
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,470
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,620
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,270
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,470
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,520
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,550
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,250
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,850
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,270
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,080

20
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:44,680
 If they want to live together,

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,340
 honesty is the most basic thing,

22
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:50,820
 and also the greatest respect for each other.

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,660
You're back.

24
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,339
You look great.

25
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:12,360
 Come back early tonight.

26
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,060
 I need to tell you something.

27
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,119
What's that about? Sounds mysterious.

28
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,960
You should tell us about your big news!

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,399
- I thought we were friends! 
 - Why?

30
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:27,439
I recovered and I'm on duty now. Is that the big news for you?

31
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,920
Drop the act!

32
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,459
You're getting married to Dr. Zhan, aren't you?

33
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,499
You're well-informed!

34
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:38,240
Don't forget to treat us! I'll make you pay!

35
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:44,380
Hey, you're back!

36
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,400
Mr. Luo, your former partner, is about to get married.

37
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,519
I'll leave you to chat.

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,060
Congratulations.

39
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,559
Thanks.

40
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,660
Hello, President Lin.

41
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,540
Yeah, why?

42
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,220
Okay, I'll go for you.

43
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,719
What's up?

44
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,239
Someone wants to adopt Lele. I'm heading to Welfare Center.

45
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:16,720
I'll go with you.

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,240
You legs were hurt. Let me drive.

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,219
Okay, let's go.

48
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,719

49
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,919
It's been a long time!

50
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,870
You've grown up.

51
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,300
President.

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,080
Go ahead.

53
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,119
President, you were talking about Lele's adoption on the phone.

54
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:41,339
I'm here to check on the details about the parents.

55
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:44,819
The adopters are a couple in their thirties.

56
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,239
They don't have a child.

57
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,860
They both work in high-paying jobs with high levels of education.

58
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,320
All their qualifications were checked for adoption.

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,459
They've met Lele. They are very fond of him.

60
00:03:57,459 --> 00:03:58,680
Is that so?

61
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,999
That's great!

62
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,780
What does Lele think?

63
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,599
Lele doesn't hate them.

64
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,340
But he's reluctant to go with them.

65
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,159
President Lin, where's Lele now?

66
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,179
He's in that room.

67
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,059
Lele.

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,120
Did you grow these?

69
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,660
They look lovely.

70
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:48,580
Lele, why don't you want to go home?

71
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,059
I'm afraid.

72
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,039
I'll tell you a secret.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,340
When I was young,

74
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,800
I used to live in a welfare center before I was adopted.

75
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,399
For real.

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,699
Before the adoption, I was scared, too.

77
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:19,339
I was afraid that my new parents wouldn't love me.

78
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:22,259
Turned out,

79
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,019
they were so nice to me.

80
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,900
Sometimes,

81
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:32,359
I think they treated me even better than their own daughter.

82
00:05:33,119 --> 00:05:35,580
Believe me, all right?

83
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,619
Your new parents will be nice to you.

84
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,740
Will you visit us?

85
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,220
Sure!

86
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,519
I'll stay around as you grow up.

87
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:57,080
All right?

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,760
Let's grow the plants together.

89
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,419
All thanks to you.

90
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:09,920
Lele has agreed to join the new family.

91
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,159
I've called the adopters.

92
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:13,840
They'll come for him tomorrow.

93
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,119
Really?

94
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,039
Glad to hear that.

95
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,919
We just remodeled the archives room.

96
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,819
I need to work on the files.

97
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,600
I can't stay with you for long.

98
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,659
How about this?

99
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,439
We're free today.

100
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,259
We want to volunteer for a day.

101
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:32,000
- What do you think? 
 - You're more than welcome!

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,260
We're shorthanded now.

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,899
- Come with me. 
 - Let's go. Come on.

104
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,120
The files here are sorted by the time of registration.

105
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,740
Each pile of files shares the same year.

106
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,379
But it's been a very long time.

107
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,939
Some of the marks on the covers have faded away.

108
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:49,359
The dates have gotten blurry.

109
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:52,819
Please take the files out and find the registration times.

110
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:56,899
Then write it down on the cover.

111
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,039
These files are for you. Thank you so much.

112
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,899
No problem. You can count on us.

113
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
Let's get started.

114
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,270

115
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,959
What's wrong?

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,020
This is mine.

117
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,960
Luo Yang and Pang Xue.

118
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,380
They are my foster parents.

119
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,840
They were so nice to me.

120
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,939
I wouldn't be here...

121
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,839
if it wasn't for their help.

122
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:26,380
You looked so cute!

123
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,939
Right?

124
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:38,590

125
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,360
The kid in the news report, is that you?

126
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,860
Yeah.

127
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,000
That kid is me!

128
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:01,180
The kid Qingshan has been looking for is me.

129
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,299
What a coincidence!

130
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:06,200
I must tell Zhan Yan.

131
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,039
Zhan Yan, I found the kid.

132
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm heading to the headquarters to see the captain.

133
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,139
Zhan Yan.

134
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,000

135
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:47,020
 Zhan Yan, I found the kid.

136
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,400
 I'm heading to the headquarters to see the captain.

137
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,659
Please drive faster. I'm in a hurry.

138
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:05,199
Okay.

139
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,520
Have you handed out the gear?

140
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,659
Captain!

141
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,779
I found the kid.

142
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,379
What?

143
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,300
Really?

144
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,960
Where is he?

145
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,540
How is he doing?

146
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,619
He's doing great, living comfortably.

147
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:37,600
What's more, he just got engaged to the girl he loves.

148
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,130

149
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,420
The adopter's surname is Luo.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,599
Captain,

151
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:10,120
after all these years, the kid you've been looking for is me.

152
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:25,220
The picture in the newspaper.

153
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:28,199
I was wearing the same clothes.

154
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,600
And the time record of registration at the center, all the details match!

155
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,520
Luo Ben, how did you find it?

156
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,200
I found it in the name list Zhan Yan sent me.

157
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,720
She missed it.

158
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,500
As I arrived at the welfare center, the president was sorting the files.

159
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,400
So I volunteered to help her out.

160
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,200
To my surprise,

161
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
I found my own profile there.

162
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,300
Besides, all the materials were kept intact.

163
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,300
Does Yan know this?

164
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,900
I left her a message.

165
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,900
She should be here when she gets off duty.

166
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,800
I want to give her a surprise.

167
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,500
Captain, you've sacrificed so much

168
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,000
to save Yan and me.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,900
I can never repay you.

170
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,800
You have my word.

171
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,200
I won't let you down.

172
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
I will never fail Yan.

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Luo Ben.

174
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,700
Yan.

175
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
Luo Ben is the one I've been looking for.

176
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
Really?

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,700
Zhan Yan.

178
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:18,100
Your father is my captain and my lifesaver!

179
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,700
This must be fate.

180
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,200
I understand.

181
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,300
The earthquake brought us

182
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,200
so much pain and sorrow.

183
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,000
However,

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,200
but now, this happy reunion eases the pain.

185
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
Shouldn't we...

186
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Shouldn't we feel happy about it?

187
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Why...

188
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,200
aren't you happy?

189
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
Luo Ben. Luo Ben...

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
Captain has been looking for you for years.

191
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,600
I'm sure he has a lot to say.

192
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
And this is abrupt.

193
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,900
He needs some time.

194
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah. It's too abrupt.

195
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
- I get it. 
 - I'm still in shock.

196
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,900
Captain, I'm not in a hurry.

197
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,500
We have plenty of time to chat.

198
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,600
No need to hurry.

199
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,400
I can't believe it.

200
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,400
The one I've been looking for has been around me all this time.

201
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,700
Will you tell him the truth?

202
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,800
I don't think we should tell him.

203
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,700
Yan,

204
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,800
after your mom passed away, I owed you too much.

205
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,000
Look at you now.

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,600
Finally, you've put on a smile.

207
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,900
I am happy for you.

208
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,400
I don't want anything,

209
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,000
whatever it is, to bother you.

210
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,400
As for the truth, or the opinions of others, they don't matter at all.

211
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,200
The most important thing is your happiness.

212
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,200
If it didn't matter for real,

213
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,000
you wouldn't have been burdened over these past years.

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,800
You couldn't move on.

215
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
It's too heavy for you.

216
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,200
Only by telling him the truth, will you be relieved.

217
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,600
The secret has been with me for years. I'm used to it.

218
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,300
Besides, I'm aged. Don't mind me.

219
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,600
Things are different for you and Luo Ben.

220
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,400
You just entered a new stage.

221
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,800
There's still a long way to go.

222
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:15,200
It's hard to meet someone you truly love.

223
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,600
It's better if he doesn't know it.

224
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,000
What's done is done.

225
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,600
I already know he's the one you're looking for.

226
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,200
But I didn't tell you.

227
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,100
Because just like you, I wasn't brave enough to tell him the truth.

228
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,000
I didn't want to lose him.

229
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,300
That made me so selfish.

230
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,500
It's all my fault.

231
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,400
Don't blame yourself.

232
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,100
I've figured it out.

233
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,600
If we are to spend the rest of our lives together, we can't make it by hiding the truth.

234
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,400
I have to be honest.

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,200
Don't worry.

236
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,100
Wherever it goes, I'll be here with you.

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,300
Okay.

238
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
Give me some time.

239
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,400
Just go. He's been waiting.

240
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:50,500
Don't! Please!

241
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,800
What's wrong?

242
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,500
What's wrong, Zhan Yan?

243
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,200
Having a nightmare?

244
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
It's just a dream.

245
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
Everything's okay.

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
There, there.

247
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,000
You'll never leave me no matter what. Right?

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,600
Sure.

249
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Destiny brought us together.

250
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
We will never break up.

251
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,700
There, there.

252
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,900
To the headquarters?

253
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,500
Now?

254
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,400
 I'm in the dormitory.

255
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Sure!

256
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,300
I'm on my way to the quarters.

257
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,900
I bought you something. I'm delivering them to you.

258
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,400
I'll be there in a minute.

259
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,600
 Okay.

260
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Luo Ben, take a seat.

261
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,200
Have some water.

262
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
It's almost ready.

263
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
The shelves are very useful.

264
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Yeah.

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,600
You can lay your certificates and awards on the shelf.

266
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,200
I understand that you keep a low profile.

267
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Still, as the captain of the team, you have to impress them with your prestige.

268
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
That way, the new team members will find a great model.

269
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,000
Thanks.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,700
Luo Ben, I'm not as good as you think.

271
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,300
Don't be modest.

272
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,740
I know your character perfectly.

273
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
I want to talk to you.

274
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Luo Ben,

275
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,400
when I find out that you were the kid, I was relieved.

276
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
You're responsible and committed.

277
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,100
Yeah.

278
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,300
Thankfully, I didn't fail you.

279
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,200
For a long time, I wish I could forget the tragedy.

280
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,400
The earthquake gives me endless agony.

281
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,600
Do you know that I keep having the same dream.

282
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,400
In my dream, a pair of hands hold me and rescue me from the ruins.

283
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,200
The hands are warm and strong.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,700
Now, I've finally found you.

285
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,100
They are your hands, Captain.

286
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Luo Ben.

287
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
That wasn't me.

288
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,500
Those were your parents.

289
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,400
When the earthquake struck, your parents protected you under their bodies.

290
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,800
But I...

291
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm not a hero.

292
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,000
What the report said is fake.

293
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Captain, what do you mean by that?

294
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,700
 I see you, Xiaojie!

295
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,000
 Stay still!

296
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,200
 Stay where you are.

297
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Anyone?

298
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,800
 - Hello? 
 - Help us!

299
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,000
 Save our child.

300
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
 Save him first.

301
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,300
 I'll be right back.

302
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,500
 Xiaojie!

303
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,000
That's to say,

304
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,200
you tried to save Zhan Yan's mom first.

305
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Not me.

306
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,900
Right.

307
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,700
And what you did triggered the secondary collapse,

308
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,700
which killed my parents.

309
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,500
- Correct. 
 - No.

310
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,200
The report said clearly

311
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,900
that you came to me first.

312
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,400
Zhan Yan's mom and my parents died in the earthquake.

313
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,000
It was a misunderstanding.

314
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,400
When it collapsed the second time,

315
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,800
your parents held you up astheir last resort.

316
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,200
As I picked you up,

317
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,800
the journalist took the photo.

318
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,600
So, you didn't save me.

319
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,310
What's worse, you were indirectly responsible for my parents' death.

320
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,000
Luo Ben,

321
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,400
over these past years, I've been looking for you.

322
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,800
I wanted to tell you the truth.

323
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,800
Why didn't you tell me the last time I came?

324
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,300
I'd have told him right away if it wasn't you.

325
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
But of all the people...

326
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,600
I can give up my life.

327
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,600
But I must think about Yan.

328
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,800
I didn't want to make it difficult for you.

329
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,900
I couldn't say it out.

330
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,000
Why are you telling me now?

331
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,400
I wanted to bury the secret.

332
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,400
Maintaining the status quo is the best option.

333
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,500
But Yan thinks that is not fair to you.

334
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,700
She convinced me to tell you the truth.

335
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,500
She knew about it!

336
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,200
She didn't get to tell you.

337
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,400
I wanted to give her a surprise.

338
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,300
I thought this was destined happiness.

339
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I'm so stupid.

340
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,700
Don't blame Yan.

341
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,700
It's all my fault.

342
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:39,400
Over the past years, I've devoted myself to public welfare rescue.

343
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,600
I want to ease my guilt by helping others.

344
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,600
Easing your guilt?

345
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,700
Think about my parents!

346
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,800
They could have been saved!

347
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,000
You could have stayed there and waited for rescue!

348
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,800
They'd have stood a better chance.

349
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,400
 Will they find us?

350
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 Remember, honey.

351
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:57,000
 Whether we're by your side or not, take good care of yourself.

352
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,100
 Live a good life.

353
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,900
 Okay?

354
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,500
 Mom, I'm tired.

355
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
 Get some sleep.

356
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,700
 When you wake up, we'll be safe.

357
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,600
 We'll get out.

358
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,100
 Yeah, out.

359
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,200
Luo Ben, what's wrong?

360
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,300
You knew it already.

361
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,900
When did you find it out?

363
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,200
After the proposal.

364
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:23,100
If it wasn't for your dad, when would you have told me the truth?

365
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,800
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

366
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,000
I didn't know how to tell you.

367
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,800
I used to think...

368
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,800
that I was the happiest man on earth.

369
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,700
Turns out,

370
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,800
my life was just a joke.

371
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,300
The man I admire most killed my parents indirectly.

372
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,600
And the one I love has been hiding it from me.

373
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,600
I didn't mean it. Truly.

374
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
I know it's a lot to take in.

375
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,500
The same is true for me.

376
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,300
I was astonished when I found it out.

377
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,000
When you headed to my father that day, I was about to tell you the truth.

378
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,600
Why didn't you tell me?

379
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,600
You could have told me!

380
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,400
Zhan Yan,

381
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,500
I kept visiting the welfare house.

382
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,700
How could you do that?

383
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,600
They were my parents!

384
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,000
Why? Why didn't you tell me the truth?

385
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,300
I trusted you.

386
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,000
I trusted in you. Why are you doing this to me?

387
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,400
Sorry. I'm sorry.

388
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,000
I am!

389
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What can I do to ease your pain?

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
Tell me.

391
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,200

Finally! You pick it up!

422
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
Where are you?

423
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,100
 I'm at the front door of your apartment. There's no one at home.

424
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,200
 The trial materials are in your house. I need them.

425
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,500
 I'll send you the passcode.

426
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,800

434
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:34,440
You're here early!

435
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,939
Going for a business trip?

436
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,719
I moved out of Luo Ben's house.

437
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,520
Moved out?

438
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,099
Did you quarrel?

439
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,980
But why the package?

440
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:52,059
Now that I'm away, why would I leave my stuff there?

441
00:34:52,059 --> 00:34:55,200
To assert sovereignty.

442
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:59,759
If you leave your stuff there, there's always a place for you.

443
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:03,200
And you have a good reason to get back when you change your mind.

444
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,060
I left my stuff at your place.

445
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,380
What about now?

446
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,859
No one is forcing you.

447
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,620
And you retreat.

448
00:35:13,899 --> 00:35:17,900
You and Luo Ben have gone through life and death together.

449
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm sure you can work this out, whatever it is.

450
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,910
I'm afraid it's impossible this time.

451
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,139
What happened exactly? Tell me about it.

452
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:29,739
I could give you some advice.

453
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:31,899
The thing is we both need some time and space.

454
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:34,519
We need to calm down.

455
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:35,699
Calm down?

456
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:39,319
Forget about that! It only makes it worse.

457
00:35:39,319 --> 00:35:41,060
Right? What's the most valuable thing to women?

458
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,899
It's time! You're aging day by day.

459
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:45,919
What do men have? Room! Plenty!

460
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:48,720
If you don't take it, others will.

461
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,999
The competitors will come.

462
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,440
I hope your love theory can work for you and Gao Junchi.

463
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,260
Come on. It's not about him.

464
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,460
I'm talking about you.

465
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,820
 Luo Ben, sorry.

466
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,979
 I'm leaving.

467
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:47,760
 My father is indirectly responsible for the death of your parents in the earthquake.

468
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,239
 It's a shock. Not only to you but to me.

469
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,959
 Neither of us knows how to face the truth.

470
00:36:56,959 --> 00:36:58,980
 If that is so,

471
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,560
 we should give it a little time, and give each other space.

472
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,880
You called in sick.

473
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,080
What's up? How do you feel?

474
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,199
You're burning.

475
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:40,980
- Come on. 
 - I'm tired. That's all. I'll sleep it off.

476
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,320
Did you take your temperature?

477
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:45,560
Where's the thermometer?

478
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,399
Under the cabinet.

479
00:37:55,919 --> 00:37:57,519
Let me see.

480
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:03,979
39.2 degrees. You need to take medicine.

481
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,180
What happened? Does Luo Ben know this?

482
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,919
I'm telling you getting ill is the perfect excuse to go back.

483
00:38:11,919 --> 00:38:13,959
You should inform him.

484
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,640
I don't want his sympathy.

485
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,040
You don't have to be tough.

486
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,260
I'll get you some medicine now.

487
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,800

488
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:33,280
- Hello? 
 - Luo Ben, where are you?

489
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,499
 Zhan Yan is ill.

490
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,680
She's ill?

491
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,359
What happened?

492
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,360
Stop asking.

493
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,819
She's your girlfriend. You should know her better than I do.

494
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,320
 How is she?

495
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,559
 She's at home now.

496
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,259
If you care about her, check on her yourself.

497
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm busy.

498
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,180
What's more important than Zhan Yan?

499
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,480
I don't know what happened. I don't care.

500
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,140
 You shouldn't do this to her.

501
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,539
 When your leg was broken, Zhan Yan took good care of you.

502
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:07,320
Think about it.

503
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:23,560
♫  Everyone has his own story  ♫

504
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,699
Let's continue.

505
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,539
I've combed over the three years...

506
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,260
....all the similar cases over the past three years.

507
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,740
20 percent of them...

508
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,760
♫  We all have our dreams in this world  ♫

509
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,960
Take a break.

510
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,219
I'll get you some coffee.

511
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:54,660
Don't bother.

512
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:58,019
So much for today.

513
00:39:58,019 --> 00:39:59,900
I should go now.

514
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,840
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

515
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,140
♫  I'd always be touched by it  ♫

516
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:14,360
♫  I promise to the beating heart  ♫

517
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:21,540
♫  I love you the way you love me  ♫

518
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,760
♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

519
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,380
It's gone down.

520
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,000
But you're still burning up. 38 degrees Celsius.

521
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
Take some medicine.

522
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,119
What do you want to eat? I'll cook it for you.

523
00:40:38,879 --> 00:40:40,399
I don't want to eat anything.

524
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:42,760
But you need it! You haven't eaten anything today.

525
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,300
That won't do. I'm going to cook.

526
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,200
♫  We all have our dreams in this world  ♫

527
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,119
Need to answer this.

528
00:40:54,100 --> 00:41:00,000
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

529
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,700
Hello, Shen Ruoxi. I'm downstairs.

530
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,459
Why are you calling me?

531
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:06,760
Now that you've gotten here, just come upstairs!

532
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
- How is Zhan Yan? 
  - What do you mean?

533
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,359
High fever, almost 40 degrees. That can't be good.

534
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,100
I'm entrusting her to you. Please look after her.

535
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,819
What? Are you leaving?

536
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:27,220
Luo Ben! Are you a man?

537
00:41:27,919 --> 00:41:29,500
Zhan Yan.

538
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:32,079
Luo Ben!

539
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:39,980
♫  We're all busy living our own life  ♫

540
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,720
Why did you come downstairs?

541
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,760
♫  I'm longing to see you again  ♫

542
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,340
I've been thinking about it.

543
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,299
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

544
00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:59,279
That was because I was afraid.

545
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,319
I was afraid you'd hate my dad.

546
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,680
I was afraid we'd never go back. I was afraid of losing you.

547
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:12,200
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

548
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:14,780
But we had to face it eventually.

549
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,640
I understand.

550
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,719
I'm not qualified to ask for your forgiveness.

551
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:31,740
♫  I love you the way you love me  ♫

552
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,840
♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

553
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:45,200
♫  We'll go after what's appealing to us  ♫

554
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,980
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

555
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:56,680
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

556
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,560
♫  I'll be soft and silent  ♫

557
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,160
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

558
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,180
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

559
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,779
I'm sorry.

560
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:20,680
♫  I'll always believe that you still love  ♫

561
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,600
♫  me like that  ♫

562
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:50,000

563
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,350
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

564
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:05,600
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

565
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,470
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

566
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,550
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

567
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:28,720
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

568
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:36,470
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

569
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:43,720
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

570
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:51,120
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

571
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:59,950
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

572
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:06,100
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

573
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:14,870
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

574
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:22,450
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

575
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,270
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

576
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,000
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

577
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,670
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

578
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,450
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

579
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:41,070
♫  I can't fly  ♫

580
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:44,970
♫  But I can look up  ♫

581
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:52,600
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
