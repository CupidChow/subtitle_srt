Okay, I'll be right there.

What's up?

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,990
Someone wants to adopt Lele.

49
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,050
I'm going to the orphanage.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,420
Then I'll go with you.

51
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,540
You just recovered.

52
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,610
I'll be your driver.

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,610
Okay, let's go.

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,870
a big girl now.

57
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,140
About the same age as you.

Hello, Ms. Lin.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,180
Okay, go play.

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,680
Ms. Lin,

61
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,810
it's hard to explain over the phone,

62
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,930
so I came here

63
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:38,700
for more information

64
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,650
about the foster parents.

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
They are a couple

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,610
in their thirties.

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,440
They have no children

68
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,990
after getting married.

69
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,270
Both of them are well-educated

70
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,610
and have high-paying jobs.

71
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
They fill all our

72
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,020
requirements for adoption.

73
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:54,650
What's more,

74
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,120
they met Lele

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,260
and liked him very much.

76
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:57,980
Really?

77
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,490
That's good.

78
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,020
How about Lele?

79
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,980
What does he think?

80
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,090
Lele didn't reject them.

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,150
But he just refuses to

82
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,540
go home with them.

83
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,050
Ms. Lin,

84
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,870
where is Lele now?

85
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,370
He's in there.

86
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,050
Lele.

87
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,220
Did you plant all these?

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,860
It's beautiful.

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,180
Lele,

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,900
why don't you want to go home?

91
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,050
I'm afraid.

92
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,130
Let me tell you a secret.

93
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,740
In fact, when I was little,

94
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,300
I was also adopted

95
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,100
from an orphanage.

96
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,490
It's true.

97
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,490
At first,

98
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,900
I was also afraid.

99
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,930
I was afraid to go to a new home

100
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,810
and that my foster parents

101
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,540
wouldn't love me.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,450
But you know what?

103
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,610
They were so nice to me.

104
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,100
Sometimes,

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,050
I thought they treated me better

106
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,630
than they did

107
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,610
to their biological daughter.

108
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,780
So Lele, you can trust me

109
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,690
that your new parents

110
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,810
will treat you well, too.

111
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,540
Will you come and visit us?

112
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,420
Of course.

113
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,450
I will

114
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,810
watch you grow up.

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,980
Right?

116
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,860
Come, let's plant these together.

117
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,010
Mr. Luo, you helped a lot.

118
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,220
Lele has agreed to go to his new home.

119
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,170
I've just contacted

120
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,070
the couple,

121
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,740
and they'll come pick him up tomorrow.

122
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,750
Really?

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,930
That's great.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,320
Our file room

125
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,760
was just renovated.

126
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,610
I still have a lot of files to sort out.

127
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,300
Excuse me,
I can't keep you company today.

128
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,250
Ms. Lin, how about this?

129

It's just as well that we're free

130
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,160
for the rest of the day.

131
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,070
Let us volunteer for a day.

132
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:30,920
What do you think?

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,760
Great.

134
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,660
We could use someone
as we're shorthanded.

135

136

All right.

137
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,100
Let's go.

138
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,400
These files

139

are in chronological order

140
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,630
of coming in here.

141
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,310
But some of the files

142
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,870
are too old.

143
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,170
The date on them

144
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,190
can't be seen clearly.

145

146
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,630
take out the information inside,

147
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,610
check it,

148
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,690
and then label the date

149
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,220
on each of the packets.

150
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,160
That's all you have to do.

They were so kind to me.

If it weren't for them,

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,850
I found the kid.

176
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm going to the base now
to find Captain.

177
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,330
Hi, Zhan Yan.

178
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,020
Zhan Yan,

179
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,960
I found the kid.

180
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm going to the base now
to find Captain.

181
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,450
Mister, please hurry. Thank you.

182
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,090
Okay.

183
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,240
Supplies

184
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,480
were distributed already, right?

185
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,450
Captain.

186
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,970
I found the kid.

187
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:21,570
What?

188
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,300
Really?

189
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,260
Where is he?

190
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,540
How is he doing?

191
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,810
He's fine.

192
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,210
He's living comfortably

193
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,500
and

194
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,600
has just

195
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,730
got engaged with

196
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,690
the girl he loves.

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,140
(Adopter Information Luo Yang Pang Xue)

198
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,420
The adopter's name was Luo?

199
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,690
Captain,

200
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,620
the child you've

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,050
been looking for all these years

202
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,380
is me.

203
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,620
Look, in the newspaper,

204
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,510
the clothes this child was wearing

205
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,150
and the clothes I was wearing,

206
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,560
and the time I went to the orphanage

207
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,020
are all matched up.

208
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,620
Luo Ben, how did you find it?

209
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,420
It was on the list

210
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,320
of orphanages

211
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,730
Zhan Yan gave me.

212
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,090
She missed it at the time.

213
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,600
When I was there,

214
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,840
the dean was

215
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,440
sorting out the files.

216
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,360
So I

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,140
helped the dean with it.

218
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,570
And then,

219
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,020
I found my file.

220
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,570
And

221
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,810
the information in it

222
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,570
was well-preserved.

223
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,150
Does Yan know about it?

224
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,450
I've left her a message.

225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,450
She'll be here after she's done.

226
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,930
I want to surprise her.

227
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,210
Captain,

228
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,450
you've sacrificed too much

229
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,870
just to save

230
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,090
Yan and me.

231
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,970
There's nothing I can do
to return your kindness.

232
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,420
But I promise you,

233
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,850
in the future, I will never

234
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,870
fail you and Yan.

235
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,620
Luo Ben…

236
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,260
Yan.

237
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,030
Luo Ben is the child

238
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,330
I've been looking for.

239
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,180
Is that true?

240
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,660
Zhan Yan,

241
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,850
your father

242
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,810
is not only my captain,

243
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,210
he's also the man who saved my life.

244
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,380
That's how

245
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,900
it's meant to be.

246
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,850
I know

247
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,570
the earthquake

248
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,660
has left us

249
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,200
with too much

250
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,540
pain and regret.

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,050
However,

252
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,620
now it's erased

253
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,990
because of our

254
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,420
wonderful reunion.

255
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,970
We…

256
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,730
We should all

257
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,970
be happy about it.

258
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,180
Aren't…

259
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,620
Aren't you happy?

260
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,380
Luo Ben. Luo Ben.

261
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,270
Captain's been
looking for you for years.

262
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,320
He must have a lot

263
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,300
to say to you.

264
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,790
It's just that

265
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,030
it happened so suddenly.

266
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,790
Let's give him some time, okay?

267
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,620
Yeah, it's...

268
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,500
It's too sudden.

269
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,150
I know.

270
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,850
I'm still processing.

271
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,500
Captain,

272
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,380
I'm in no rush.

273
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,090
There's still

274
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,090
plenty of time for us to talk.

275
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,850
Please take your time.

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,900
God played a joke on us.

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,480
How could I have imagined

278
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,810
the person I've been looking for

279
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,810
is just around all the time?

280
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,690
Will you tell him the truth?

281
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,690
I don't think so.

282
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,850
Yan,

283
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,090
since your mother passed away,

284
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,090
I owe you so much.

285
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,970
Now, it's so good to finally

286
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,930
see a smile on your face again.

287
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,570
I'm really happy for you.

288
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,750
So I don't want

289
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,360
anything to

290
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,560
get in the way

291
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,660
of your relationship.

292
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,560
As for the truth,

293
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,750
what people say

294
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,570
doesn't matter anymore.

295
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,930
The most important thing

296
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,020
is your happiness.

297
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,790
If it doesn't matter

298
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,180
to you anymore,

299
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,600
it wouldn't have

300
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,440
been concerning you

301
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,910
for so many years,

302
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,180
and you still can't let it go.

303
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,870
It's too heavy for you.

304
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,930
Now only by telling him the truth

305
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,870
can you

306
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,120
let go of it.

307
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,790
It's been with me

308
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,790
for so many years.

309
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,020
I've got used to it.

310
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,730
And at my age,

311
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,200
it doesn't matter anymore.

312
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,930
But it's different for you and Luo Ben.

313
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,090
You're young.

314
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,090
You still have a long road ahead of you.

315
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,480
It's hard

316
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,790
to meet the right person

317
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,140
in your life.

318
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,930
It's better if he doesn't know.

319
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,730
Sometimes, it's best

320
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,500
to leave the past where it is.

321
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,990
In fact, I knew he's the one

322
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,210
you were looking for all along.

323
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,080
I never told you

324
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,780
because, just like you,

325
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,300
I didn't
have the courage to tell him, either.

326
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,260
I never thought for fear of losing him,

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,500
I'd become so selfish.

328
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,140
This is all because of me.

329
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,660
It's not your fault.

330
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,450
I've realized

331
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,360
if we decide to

332
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,850
spend the rest of our lives together,

333
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,020
hiding is not the answer.

334
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,780
We have to be honest.

335
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,780
Don't worry.

336
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,660
However this plays out,

337
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,300
I will face it with you.

338
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,780
Okay.

339
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,210
I'll think about it.

340
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,730
Go now.

341
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,570
Luo Ben is waiting for you.

342
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,730
No. No, no.

343
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,860
What's wrong?

344
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,970
What's wrong, Zhan Yan?

345
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,420
Did you have a nightmare?

346
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,120
Silly, dreams mean the opposite.

347
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,620
It's okay.

348
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,530
It's going to be all right.

349
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,760
So no matter what,

350
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,380
you'll never leave me, will you?

351
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:14,730
Of course.

352
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,040
We are so destined to be together.

353
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,800
God won't let us

354
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,250
be separated.

355
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,970
It's okay. It's okay.

356
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:37,970
Go to the base?

357
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,530
Now?

358
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,210
I'll wait for you in the dorm.

359
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:43,970
What a coincidence.

360
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,010
I'm on my way there.

361
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,150
I bought something for you.

362
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,580
I'm going to bring it to you.

363
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,770
I'll be here soon.

364
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,770
Okay. Later.

365
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:13,770
Luo Ben.

366
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,660
Take a break.

367
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,770
Have some water.

368
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,620
It's okay. I'll be done in a minute.

369
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,000
These two shelves

370
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,230
can hold a lot of stuff.

371
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,140
Yes.

372
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,770
From now on,

373
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,470
you can put all your certificates

374
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,080
and awards

375
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,250
up here.

376
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,530
I know

377
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,120
you don't like to show off.

378
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,520
But I think you should

379
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,910
build yourself up

380
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,970
as the captain

381
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,520
to set an example

382
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,970
for everyone.

383
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,860
Thank you.

384
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,860
Luo Ben,

385
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,900
I'm not as good as you think.

386
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,190
Don't argue with me on that.

387
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,530
I know very well

388
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,060
what kind of person you are.

389
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,730
I want to talk to you.

390
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,930
Luo Ben,

391
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,670
when I knew

392
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,190
you are that boy,

393
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,340
I was so relieved.

394
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,710
Because you are

395
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,860
a man of responsibility.

396
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,530
Thank you.

397
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,380
I'm glad I didn't let you down.

398
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,100
In fact, I didn't dare

399
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,630
to recall the earthquake

400
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,970
for a long time.

401
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,420
Because there are too many

402
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,770
painful memories for me.

403
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,340
But, you know what?

404
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,420
I've always had the same dream.

405
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,140
In that dream,
a pair of hands always held me

406
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,470
and rescued me

407
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,820
from the rubble.

408
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,930
These hands were warm

409
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,580
and strong.

410
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,730
Now,

411
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,930
I've finally found these hands.

412
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,530
They belong to you,

413
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,060
Captain.

414
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,250
Luo Ben,

415
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:00,660
it was not me.

416
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,930
It was your parents.

417
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,860
When the earthquake hit,

418
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,470
they shielded you

419
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,820
with their bodies.

420
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,380
And I…

421
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm not a hero

422
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,860
at all.

423
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,120
I'm not what

424
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,210
the newspapers reported.

425
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,420
Captain...

426
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,930
What do you mean

427
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,930
by that?

428
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,600
Xiaojie, I can see you.

429
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,870
Don't move.

430
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,820
Don't... Don't move.

431
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,970
Is there anyone out there?

432
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,450
Anyone? Help us.

433
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,810
Save the kid first.

434
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,660
Save my child.

435
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,210
Xiaojie!

436
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,100
So,

437
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:28,490
you saved Zhan Yan's mother first.

438
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,180
Not me.

439
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,210
Yes.

440
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,620
You wanted to save her

441
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,970
but caused the second collapse.

442
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,210
That's why my parents…

443
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,340
Yes.

444
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,290
That's not true.

445
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,120
The newspaper was very clear.

446
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,620
The person you saved first was me.

447
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,230
Zhan Yan's mother and my parents

448
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,230
died in the earthquake.

449
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,140
They made a mistake in that report.

450
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,690
When the second collapse happened,

451
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,560
your parents tried their best

452
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,100
to lift you out.

453
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,290
When I picked you up,

454
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,900
a reporter caught me on camera.

455
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,420
So not only didn't you save me,

456
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,730
but you also
indirectly killed my parents.

457
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,250
Luo Ben,

458
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,210
I've been looking for you

459
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,490
all these years.

460
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,280
I just want to

461
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,630
tell you the truth.

462
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,000
When I came here last time,

463
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,210
why didn't you tell me?

464
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,210
If it was someone else,

465
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,230
I would have told him right away.

466
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,420
But it was you.

467
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,820
I don't care about anything,

468
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,530
but I have to think about Yan.

469
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,060
I don't want to
influence your relationship.

470
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,180
So I couldn't say it.

471
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,760
Then why did you

472
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,140
tell me now?

473
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,380
I wanted to keep it to myself.

474
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,000
It's probably the best choice

475
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,530
to keep things the way they are.

476
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,950
But Yan thought

477
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,490
it's not fair to you.

478
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,380
She was the one who convinced me

479
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,860
to admit it to you.

480
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,930
So she already knew.

481
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,820
She just didn't
get a chance to tell you yet.

482
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,250
And I wanted to surprise her.

483
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,770
I thought it was all

484
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,580
meant to be.

485
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,690
I was so stupid.

486
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,770
Don't blame Yan.

487
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,340
I'm responsible for everything.

488
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,470
For all these years,

489
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,340
I put all my time and energy

490
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,250
into non-profit rescue,

491
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,010
just to help more people

492
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,690
to ease the guilt I felt inside.

493
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,010
Ease your guilt?

494
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,530
Think about my parents.

495
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,430
They could have

496
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,210
had a chance to be saved.

497
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,000
Even if you don't do anything

498
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,450
and wait for the rescuers to come,

499
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,900
they might have survived.

500
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,450
Will they find us?

501
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,730
(Honey, just remember.)

502
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,340
(Whether Mom and Dad
are with you or not in the future,)

503
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,010
(you have to take care of yourself.)

504
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,770
(You must live well.)

505
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:00,290
(Remember?)

506
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,730
(Mom, I'm tired.)

507
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,810
(Go to sleep then.)

508
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,530
(When you wake up,)

509
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,930
(we'll be all out.)

510
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,730
(We'll be out.)

511
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,340
(We will.)

512
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,580
Luo Ben.

513
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,380
What's going on?

514
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,210
You already knew.

515
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,140
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,140
When did you know?

517
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,730
After you proposed.

518
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,860
If your father didn't tell me,

519
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,420
how long will you keep it from me?

520
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,900
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

521
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,040
I just didn't know

522
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,420
how to tell you about it.

523
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,140
I thought

524
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,760
I was the luckiest person

525
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,180
in the world.

526
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,970
But who knew

527
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,800
fate has played

528
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,180
such a big joke on me?

529
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,250
The person I admired most

530
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,490
caused my parents' death collaterally.

531
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,620
And the one I love the most

532
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:11,140
has been hiding it from me.

533
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,180
I wasn't trying to hide it.

534
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:13,970
Really, I...

535
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,910
I know it's hard for you

536
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,100
to accept.

537
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,770
So did I.

538
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,930
When I first found out,

539
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,450
my mind went blank.

540
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,560
On the day you went to see my father,

541
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,910
I made up my mind

542
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,380
to tell you the truth.

543
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,730
Then why didn't you tell me?

544
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,770
Why didn't you?

545
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,730
Zhan Yan,

546
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,730
seeing I go to the orphanages

547
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,290
over and over again every day,

548
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,860
didn't you feel sorry for me at all?

549
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,620
That's my parents.

550
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,530
Why didn't you

551
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,420
tell me the truth?

552
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,900
I trusted you so much.

553
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,000
I trusted you so much!

554
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,430
Why did you do this to me?

555
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,140
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

556
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,100
I'm so sorry.

557
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,490
Is there anything I can do

558
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,770
to make you suffer less?

559
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,970

Where are you?

597
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,760
I'm at your door.

598
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,900
I knocked and no one opened the door.

599
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,010
My court files are at your place,

600
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,180

Why are you here so early?

612
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,330
Going on a business trip?

613
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,210
I moved out of Luo Ben's place.

614
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,020
Moved out?

615
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,890
If you had a fight,

616
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,920
just come back.

617
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,180
But you can't move your stuff.

618
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,850
I'm not even there anymore.

619
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,040
What's the point
of leaving my stuff there?

620
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,100
To mark your territory.

621
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,630
If you're back,

622
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,850
but your stuff is still there,

623
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,670
no one can take your place.

624
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,190
And if you want to go back later,

625
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,730
it gives you

626
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,150
a very natural reason

627
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,660
that your stuff is there.

628
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,230
And now,

629
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,850
no one's pressuring you,

630
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,020
yet you backed out just like that.

631
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,190
You and Luo Ben

632
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,730
went through a lot together.

633
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,580
Is there anything you can't work out?

634
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,810
Maybe this time,

635
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,350
we can't.

636
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,330
Wait, what is it?

637
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:26,940
Tell me,

638
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,730
and I'll give you a tip, okay?

639
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,750
Both of us need

640
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,060
time and space

641
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,810
to calm down.

642
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,290
Calm down?

643
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,810
What are you talking about?

644
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,660
You can't let things calm down.

645
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,660
Wait.

646
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,980
What is
the most valuable thing for women?

647
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:41,890
It's time.

648
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,370
Cuz we're not getting any younger.

649
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,810
And what do men have the most?

650
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:45,810
It's space.

651
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:48,020
If you don't occupy it,
someone else will.

652
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,290
Don't give others any opportunity, ever.

653
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,540
I hope your theory

654
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,370
can be applied to you and Gao Junchi.

655
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,150
Come on.

656
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,270
What? It's not about Gao Junchi and me.

657
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,660
Hey, I'm talking about you.

658
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,020
(Luo Ben, I'm sorry.)

659
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,770
(I left.)

660
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,330
(My father)

661
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,060
(indirectly killed your parents)

662
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,060
(in that earthquake,)

663
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,330
(which is shocking to)

664
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,500
(not only you but me, too.)

665
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:53,850
(Now that we don't know)

666
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,100
(how to deal with it and face it,)

667
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,980
(I think we should)

668
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,630
(give each other)

669
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:02,660
(some time and space.)

670
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,180
I heard you called in sick.

671
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,270
How is it?

672
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,250
What's the problem?

673
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,290
You're burning up.

674
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,270
Come over here.

675
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,150
I'm just a little tired.

676
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,770
I'll be fine after a rest.

677
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,620
Did you take your temperature?

678
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,060
Where's your thermometer?

679
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,890
At the bottom of the bookcase.

680
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:56,810
Let me see.

681
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,770
39.2 degrees.

682
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,250
You should take fever medicine.

683
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,980
Why do you have a fever?

684
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,140
Does Luo Ben know?

685
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:08,810
I'm telling you,

686
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:10,020
getting sick is

687
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,660
the best excuse to get back together.

688
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,250
You'd better let him know.

689
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,940
I don't need his sympathy.

690
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,940

(Shen Ruoxi)

693
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,980
Hello.

694
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:31,850
Luo Ben,

695
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,810
where are you?

696
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,690
Do you know Zhan Yan is sick?

697
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,980
She's sick?

698
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,850
What's wrong with her?

699
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,660
Are you asking me?

700
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,210
She's your girlfriend.

701
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,890
Shouldn't you

702
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,140
know better than I do?

703
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,620
How is she now?

704
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,250
She's at home.

705
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,250
If you care about her,

706
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,580
come and see for yourself.

707

important than Zhan Yan?

710
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,190
I don't care what's going on

711

between you two.

712
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,940
You just can't do that to her.

713
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,730
When your leg was broken,

714
