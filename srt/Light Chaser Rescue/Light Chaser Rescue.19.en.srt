16
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,170
I think that's your brother.

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,000
And Dr. Zhan.

18
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,410
My brother knows I love being here.

19
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,330
So,

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I guess he is here

21
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,690
waiting for me.

22
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,130
Your brother doesn't know where you are.

23
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,610
He is gonna worry about you.

24
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,810
Maybe you should go home.

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,410
No.

26
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,690
I told him

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,650
I want to be alone for a while.

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,720
Actually,

29
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,160
I also support you to study abroad.

30
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:35,880
You can't give up your dream

31
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,490
because of me.

32
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,810
No matter how long
you're gonna stay abroad,

33
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,970
I'll be waiting for you.

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,160
I've been thinking a lot about it

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,880
before I decided
to give up going abroad.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,160
Now my brother tries
to force me to leave,

37
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,810
he is also gonna be against

38
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,760
us being together.

39
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,000
I won't let him decide

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
how I'm gonna live.

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,250
That's why

42
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,600
I'm definitely not leaving this time.

43
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,000
I won't give in.

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Xiong Fei.

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,810
You must support me.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,650
Thank you for being with me today.

47
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,000
I spend a lot of time
at the operating table every day.

48
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,650
It's relaxing

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,530
to see the lake with you.

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,970
I should thank you. Dr. Zhan.

51
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,420
(General Manager)

52
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,810
Zhou Mingming.

53
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,320
How about we go to training
together after work?

54
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,440
Go by yourself.

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,370
I don't have the mood.

56
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,530
What's wrong with you?

57
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,370
Is it because of that guy called Ma?

58
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,250
Don't mention that man.

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,410
I shouldn't have saved him.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
No, you did nothing wrong

61
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,490
to save him.

62
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,440
Can't you even take
such a little setback?

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,930
There are a lot of people like him.

64
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,440
I shouldn't have
gone to so much trouble.

65
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:29,080
Don't you have a swagger or something?

66
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,730
Why would you bother yourself
with this kind of person?

67
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,490
Right?

68
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,930
Hello.

69
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,080
Glory Night Club?

70
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll be right there.

71
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,730
We will encounter

72
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,730
various difficulties
during the rescue process.

73
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,930
We train ourselves hard

74
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,130
every day

75
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,610
to master and improve

76
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,730
various rescue skills

77
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,440
so that we can overcome difficulties

78
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,130
and complete rescue tasks

79
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,050
at critical times,

80
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,960
but there are problems

81
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,050
that can't be solved

82
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,290
by mere technology.

83
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,560
Sometimes,

84
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,960
people don't understand us

85
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,050
and don't trust us.

86
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,730
Some victims

87
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,850
might doubt us.

88
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,440
Some of them even

89
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,170
say something sarcastic or terrible.

90
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,810
What happened to Zhou Mingming

91
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,930
is an example.

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,490
We have to deal with
all kinds of pressure.

93
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,520
We can't be there for our families

94
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,440
and can't juggle our jobs,

95
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,850
but I'm solemnly telling you this,

96
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,170
what we're doing

97
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,960
is saving lives.

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,370
We have clear consciences.

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Now I'm here imploring you

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,520
to get rid of burdens and distractions,

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,610
and do your best

102
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,520
to help others

103
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,200
and save lives!

104
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,440
No matter what happens

105
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,320
to you,

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,730
we will be

107
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,170
there for you!

108
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,050
The Light Chaser Rescue

109
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,170
will always

110
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,250
have your backs!

111
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,490
- Well said!
- Well said!

112
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,320
Mr. Ming.

113
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,690
Mr. Ming, you're late.

114
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,810
Drink more later.

115
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:28,760
Have a good time.

116
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,250
We're leaving then, Mr. Ming.

117
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,290
I haven't seen you in days.

118
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,520
Don't run so fast!

119
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,370
Mr. Ming.

120
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,130
Long time no see.

121
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,850
Long time no see.

122
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,050
Long time no see.

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,370
Your business is growing.

124
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,200
Have fun.

125
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,320
We'll go over there.

126
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:55,960
There you are.

127
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,700
(Ding Dingding)
Our hero!

128
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,690
Our hero!

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,810
There you are.

130
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
What are you guys chanting for?

131
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,290
Guys!

132
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,730
I guess you don't know

133
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,370
that Mingming saved

134
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,400
a drowning man yesterday!

135
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,640
That's awesome.

136
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,370
You don't care about Mingming, do you?

137
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,320
It was on the news.

138
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,850
I have a suggestion.

139
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,610
Let's make a toast

140
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,250
to our big hero!

141
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,760
Come on!

142
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,000
Come on!

143
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,250
Hold on.

144
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,370
Sorry.

145
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,290
I got that wrong.

146
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,520
It was a girl

147
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,560
who saved the drowning man,

148
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,640
not Mingming.

149
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,200
It was Mingming who knocked out

150
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,050
the drowning man.

151
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Was he trying to save people

152
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
or kill people?

153
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,440
It's hilarious.

154
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,400
He was down there screaming for help.

155
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,200
Mr. Ming went straight down
and knocked him out.

156
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,610
Are you drunk?

157
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,080
Do you have common sense?

158
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,810
I did it to save him.

159
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,730
Come on.

160
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,610
You were saved

161
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,640
by that girl.

162
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,490
How can you save people
with what you got?

163
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,440
If you can't stand the heat,

164
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
just get out of the kitchen.

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,640
Come on!

166
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,290
Come on, have a drink!

167
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,440
Have a drink!

168
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,170
Let's drink.

169
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,690
Come on.

170
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,560
Mr. Ming.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,810
Mr. Ming.

172
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,640
Mr. Ming.

173
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,290
Mr. Ming left.

174
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,000
What kind of people are you?

175
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,490
Are you still his friends?

176
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,440
We're just kidding.

177
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,690
Where are you going?

178
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,170
Mom.

179
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,370
I know what happened

180
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,490
in the last two days.

181
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,000
This is the first time

182
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,760
I've ever seen you

183
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,730
take something so seriously.

184
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,570
Son.

185
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:50,970
Everyone has

186
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,490
his strengths and advantages.

187
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
You are kind

188
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,760
and glad to help others,

189
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,040
but have you thought about

190
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,090
if you have the ability

191
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,850
to save lives personally?

192
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,680
If you don't have the ability,

193
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,090
and you insist on doing it,

194
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,090
isn't it depriving someone

195
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,760
of the chance to be saved?

196
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,490
Mom.

197
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
I understand

198
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,520
what you mean.

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,520
You...

200
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,490
Ma'am.

201
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
I think

202
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,280
Mingming really likes doing rescues.

203
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,160
Besides, he's also grown a lot

204
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,450
because of this.

205
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,640
But for a mother,

206
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,640
his safety is the most important thing.

207
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,660
(Ding Dingding)

208
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,450
What?

209
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,730
I've made several calls to you today.

210
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,760
Why didn't you answer?

211
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm your boss. Do I need to

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,160
tell you about my personal life?

213
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,850
You know what,

214
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,130
it was a big loss

215
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,450
that you didn't come
to the rescue team today.

216
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,730
I'll be there tomorrow.

217
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,450
He hung up on me.

218
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,920
Mingming.

219
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,280
You're early today.

220
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,920
Jing.

221
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,210
I want to quit the rescue team.

222
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,450
Zhou Mingming.

223
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,800
I want you to take it back.

224
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,250
It's none of your business.

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,520
You're denying yourself

226
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,760
just because of a few words.

227
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,640
Do you know that Captain Qingshan

228
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,730
stood up for you yesterday?

229
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,250
That has nothing to do with me now.

230
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,370
It was just one setback.

231
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Do you have any idea

232
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,570
how many times

233
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,490
a comic artist gets rejected

234
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,920
before becoming famous,

235
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,400
and how many times an athlete gets hurt

236
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,610
before winning an award?

237
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,920
There is no easy work.

238
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,090
I'm not them.

239
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,090
We're not the same.

240
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,400
Have you made up your mind

241
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,160
to give up?

242
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes.

243
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,850
Would you rather be a coward?

244
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,490
Yes!

245
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,730
Dingding!

246
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,490
Do you want to die?

247
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
No,

248
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,090
but I trust you.

249
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
See, you still

250
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,210
got in the water and saved me.

251
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,940
(Light Chaser Rescue)

252
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,130
Jing.

253
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,210
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,570
I was a little impulsive this morning.

255
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,970
Did you say anything?

256
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,400
I didn't hear you.

257
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,090
I'll make this for you.

258
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,280
Thank you, Jing.

259
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,400
You owe me one.

260
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,800
Shouldn't you take me

261
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,640
to eat something good?

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,000
You'd be dead

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,370
if it wasn't for me.

264
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,250
Why would I treat you to a meal?

265
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,210
Fine.

266
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,640
All right, I'll take you out,

267
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,610
but you have to promise me

268
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,570
that you won't

269
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,280
do anything

270
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
this dangerous again.

271
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,640
Do you hear me?

272
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:13,760
Yes.

273
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,400
Here.

274
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,160
Drink it while it's warm.

275
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,520
Thank you, Jing.

276
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,570
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Thank you.

277
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,280
Hold on!

278
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,370
What a coincidence.

279
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
You look like a mess.

280
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,210
You're not doing any better.

281
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
What do you mean?

282
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,330
I mean, you look

283
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,970
a little tired.

284
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,920
Wait.

285
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,640
Why do I have cramps

286
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,160
in my foot all of a sudden?

287
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,760
I need a second.

288
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,090
Has Luo Yuan contacted you?

289
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,850
Luo Yuan?

290
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,280
Didn't she go abroad?

291
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,970
She should be

292
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,490
in England right now.

293
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll call her later

294
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,280
and see how she is doing.

295
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,130
She didn't go abroad.

296
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,160
She's in hiding.

297
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,520
Hiding?

298
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,040
Yuan is bold.

299
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:41,570
Where is she hiding?

300
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,640
Have you found her?

301
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,250
Is it true that she hasn't
tried to contact you?

302
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,160
Yes.

303
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,250
I think my foot gets better.

304
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,130
I'll go in first.

305
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,880
I was so scared.

306
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,370
(Yuan.)

307
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,370
(Come home.)

308
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,400
(I will go back,)

309
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,090
(just not now.)

310
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,090
(Shouldn't you think about)

311
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,970
(why she tries to avoid you?)

312
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,420
(Xiong Fei)

313
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,570
Hello.

314
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:38,920
Have you met Luo Yuan?

315
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,240
Let's meet tomorrow.

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,480
Brother.

317
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,640
It's good to sit down and talk.

318
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,960
Yuan.

319
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,330
It was bad of me

320
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,850
to force you to go abroad,

321
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,130
but I still think

322
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,920
you shouldn't give up on your future

323
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,810
because of a man.

324
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:01,480
I didn't give up on my future.

325
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,010
There will be another chance.

326
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,480
I will continue my study.

327
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,640
But you're giving up now.

328
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,050
Do you have any idea

329
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,370
how impulsive you are
to make such a choice?

330
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,400
You made me do this.

331
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,330
Let me talk.

332
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,680
We've decided to be together.

333
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,680
Do you ask me out

334
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,850
to say this to me?

335
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,010
Luo Yuan doesn't mind

336
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,680
that I've been to prison before,

337
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,090
and she doesn't mind

338
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,290
I'm just a stallholder.

339
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,290
I'm grateful to her.

340
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,570
I will cherish this relationship.

341
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,850
You are the closest person to Luo Yuan.

342
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,290
I promise

343
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,200
I'll be good to her

344
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,530
and I won't fail her.

345
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,810
If she wants to go abroad
for further study,

346
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,920
she will have my full support.

347
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,640
We're here today

348
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,050
in hopes of

349
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:08,920
having your blessing.

350
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,920
Yuan.

351
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,880
When Mom and Dad left,

352
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,530
I promised them

353
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,400
I would never let you suffer.

354
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,920
I pamper you

355
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,240
because I wish

356
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,720
you can live a happy life

357
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,440
without worries,

358
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,240
instead of setting up a stall

359
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,480
with some guy.

360
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,400
But I want this.

361
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,290
You don't understand now,

362
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
but I'm sure

363
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,530
you'll understand one day.

364
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,640
I'm doing this

365
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,720
all for your own good.

366
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,640
Come home with me.

367
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,130
I've listened to you

368
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,440
my whole life,

369
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,530
but I want to be in charge of

370
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,810
my own relationship.

371
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,570
Don't push me, okay?

372
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,200
He doesn't have the ability

373
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,850
to take care of you.

374
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,570
Does he have the money

375
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,810
to support you through school abroad?

376
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
I can go to work.

377
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,130
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

378
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,570
Really?

379
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,010
Who is giving you

380
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,480
a carefree life?

381
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,050
Who made me

382
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,680
become like this?

383
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,090
Brother.

384
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,090
Brother.

385
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,200
Sorry.

386
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,330
I didn't mean it.

387
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,240
I... I...

388
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,130
Brother.

389
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,570
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,570
I said that out of anger.

391
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,570
It was my bad.

392
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm not a good brother.

393
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
No.

394
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,130
Alright.

395
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,880
I know you didn't say it on purpose.

396
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
Let's go home.

397
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:15,290
Come on.

398
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,300
(Doctor's Office)

399
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,010
Dr. Zhan.

400
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,920
What are you doing here?

401
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,610
I want to learn rescue diving from you.

402
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,090
I heard you've been

403
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,130
having a hard time lately,

404
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
but you look good.

405
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,290
It's in the past.

406
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,570
I'll just keep practicing

407
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,240
if I'm not professional enough.

408
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,370
It's no big deal.

409
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,680
There are so many rescue divers.

410
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,010
Why do you come to me?

411
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,090
Well,

412
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,130
I asked about

413
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,010
your expertise in diving rescues.

414
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,090
You're an expert.

415
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,530
Since I'm going to learn,

416
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,480
I got to learn from

417
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,090
the best.

418
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
But I have no intention
of taking on an apprentice.

419
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,680
I have an idea.

420
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,880
I want to train a team of

421
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,370
professional and top-notch

422
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,610
rescue divers,

423
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,240
and provide rescue teams
all over the country

424
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,330
with relevant training courses.

425
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,680
Everyone will think of us first

426
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,240
when they need

427
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,370
underwater rescue.

428
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Our name will be known
all over the world.

429
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,330
You're pretty ambitious.

430
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,810
Well, Dr. Zhan,

431
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,530
are you interested in

432
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,610
training a key member
of the future team?

433
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,240
I only have time on Sunday.

434
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,330
No problem.

435
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,480
(I had a fever when I was a kid.)

436
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,770
(My brother gave me the wrong medicine)

437
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,530
(and I lost my voice,)

438
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:10,200
(but I never blamed him.)

439
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,400
Intensive training

440
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,570
could strain your muscles.

441
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,090
Thank you.

442
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,440
You didn't answer my call.

443
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
I thought you might be here.

444
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,920
I know you're under pressure.

445
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,920
As doctors, sometimes

446
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,720
we also feel the pressure

447
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,770
is too much to handle.

448
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:32,200
Do you wanna try

449
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,330
my way of alleviating the stress?

450
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,130
Sir, I'll have five lottery tickets.

451
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Okay, wait a minute.

452
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,880
Here are your lottery tickets.

453
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,640
Thank you.

454
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,370
You're welcome.

455
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,370
This is how you relieve stress?

456
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,330
By buying lottery tickets?

457
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,580
(China Welfare Lottery)

458
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,480
So you also want to get rich overnight?

459
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,920
I see.

460
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,200
You're doing this for charity.

461
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,050
If you don't win the prize,

462
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,160
you'll just think of it as a donation.

463
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,130
Would you stop talking?

464
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,770
Have a try.

465
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,720
No.

466
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,610
What if you win the lottery?

467
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,610
Beginners have the best luck.

468
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,400
You didn't win.

469
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,010
You wouldn't look good

470
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,010
if I do.

471
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,010
Okay.

472
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,240
I'll do it.

473
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,370

Get started.

478
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,160
Scratch harder.

479
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,240
I know.

480
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,370
How much?

481
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,090
How much is it?

482
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:21,960
Let me see.

483
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,290
There is nothing.

484
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,810
That's not nice.

485
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,160
Do you like scratching
lottery tickets that much?

486
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,240
Wouldn't you be happy

487
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,680
if you had won?

488
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,130
Wait here for me.

Do you feel better now?

496
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,680
Much better.

497
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,880
We even won

498
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,810
20 yuan.

499
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,530
Of course,

500
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,010
not including the 100 yuan

501
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,050
we spent on lottery tickets.

502
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:32,290
Have you decided

503
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,530
how to spend the 20 yuan?

504
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,200
I got it.

505
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,290
Come with me.

506
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,440
Why don't you eat?

507
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,960
Is there nothing else?

508
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,610
Their lamb loin

509
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,530
is a specialty.

510
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,290
Have a try.

511
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:07,290
All I can think about

512
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,610
is my anatomy class.

513
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,090
How's it?

514
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,400
I guess I'm hungry.

515
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,530
That's easy.

516
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,530
Sir!

517
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,570
I'd like to order!

518
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,920
Well?

519
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,530
You ordered too much.

520
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
Lamb loin and beer

521
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,850
are the perfect match.

522
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,810
How would you come to a place like this?

523
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,330
This is the place

524
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,090
where I took Luo Yuan

525
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,680
to have a barbecue for the first time.

526
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,720
We had no money

527
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,010
when we were in school.

528
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,370
Luo Yuan wanted to have a barbecue,

529
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,530
but she didn't want to
spend too much money.

530
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,440
Later,

531
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,640
I picked up a job.

532
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,240
When I got the money,

533
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,770
I took her here

534
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,680
and we had a good meal.

535
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,440
I told her

536
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,440
at that time

537
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,960
that she would be able
to eat as much as she wants

538
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,440
when I make big money.

539
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
You made it.

540
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,570
I don't want Luo Yuan
to live a hard life.

541
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:51,680
You're a good brother.

542
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,920
Luo Yuan will know it.

543
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,480
That was a great meal.

544
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,200
If Luo Yuan insists on

545
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,720
being with Xiong Fei,

546
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,370
what would you do?

547
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,680
Let me ask you,

548
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,480
if Ding Dingding wants to

549
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,850
be with an unreliable guy,

550
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,160
will you agree?

551
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,050
She's unreliable enough.

552
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,770
I wish someone unreliable

553
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,160
could teach her some lessons.

554
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,610
You all think

555
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm not doing it right.

556
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,160
Let me ask you,

557
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,370
do you also hate

558
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,530
spending time with me

559
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,090
like Luo Yuan does?

560
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,960
No.

561
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,010
So, you like

562
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,850
spending time with me.

563
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,240
No.

564
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,160
Your brother hasn't spoken to you yet?

565
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,050
I didn't know he is so childish.

566
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
I think

567
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,400
he refuses to talk to you

568
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,050
because he wants you
to choose between them

569
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,720
and see who is more important to you,

570
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,010
your brother

571
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,240
or your boyfriend.

572
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,850
I don't want to lose Xiong Fei,

573
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,680
and I don't want to
lose my brother, either.

574
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,050
It's gonna be hard.

575
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,570
I think he is determined

576
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,610
to break up you two.

577
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:35,960
Don't worry.

578
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,400
I'm definitely on your side.

579
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,850
I also want to
teach your brother a lesson,

580
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,640
but he's a lawyer.

581
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,530
He is too eloquent.

582
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,130
I can't outspeak him.

583
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,920
I don't know who can manage him.

584
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,850
Well, well, Luo Ben.

585
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,640
You're on my side, right?

586
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,130
It's useless for me to support you.

587
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,160
You should ask your brother.

588
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,050
You want me to talk to him?

589
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,440
You know your brother.

590
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,810
He listens to no one.

591
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,010
You are different to him.

592
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,280
What do you like about Xiong Fei?

593
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,570
Being with him

594
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,570
makes me feel relaxed,

595
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,010
very happy,

596
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,360
and secure.

597
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,930
His family

598
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:34,800
also gave me a warm feeling

599
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,160
when we first met.

600
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,570
He is a lucky guy.

601
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,220
(Big Bear Wonton)

602
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:55,610
Sir.

603
00:34:56,090 --> 00:34:56,890
Delivery?

604
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,530
You brought me here

605
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,760
on purpose, right?

606
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,640
Did Luo Yuan come to you?

607
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,570
Why would you come if you knew it?

608
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,010
It's no use trying to persuade me.

609
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:14,720
I'm here to see

610
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,640
what else you can do.

611
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,570
All right.

612
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,320
I hope you'll still

613
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,530
feel that confident later.

614
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,010
All right.

615
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,530
Hello, enjoy your meal.

616
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,570
Thank you.

617
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,610
Let me do it.

618
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,840
I've been

619
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,010
protecting Luo Yuan so well

620
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,090
that she grew up

621
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,800
only seeing the good sides of the world.

622
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,050
She is too trusting.

623
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,570
Though I promised Luo Yuan I'd help her,

624
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,090
I didn't tell her

625
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,360
I would bring you here today.

626
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,720
I just want you to see

627
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,970
how they're

628
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,800
living their lives.

629
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,450
As for the rest,

630
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,970
you can use your own judgment.

631
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,050
Mom.

632
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,450
I made you some mung bean soup.

633
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,640
Okay, I'll get the bowl.

634
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,610
Son.

635
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,530
I also learned some
simple sign language.

636
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,050
Really?

637
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,800
Thank

638
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:43,930
you.

639
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,240
You know what,

640
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,570
Xiong Fei still wet his bed

641
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,320
in primary school

642
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,760
because he had

643
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,610
too much mung bean soup that night.

644
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,050
Eat some, Yuan.

645
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,640
Yuan.

646
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,360
I have a secret.

647
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,160
Do you want to hear it?

648
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
Look at your brother's clothes.

649
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,200
Are they inside out?

650
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,760
Brother, you're wearing your clothes
inside out today.

651
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,610
Mom!

652
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,760
Yuan, do you have any secret

653
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,970
to share with me?

654
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,720
What did Yuan say?

655
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,410
It's a secret

656
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:29,930
between us girls.

657
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,010
We can't tell you.

658
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,970
Right, Yuan?

659
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,280
Luo Yuan said

660
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,530
Xiong Fei made her happy.

661
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,970
Now I believe it.

662
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,640
Because there are feelings

663
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,680
that can't be hidden.

664
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,130
She found the kinship and love

665
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,970
she wants from Xiong Fei.

666
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,720
Those are the things

667
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,800
you can't replace.

668
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,640
Be careful, Mom.

669
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,760
Bye!

670
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,760
Let me know when you get home.

671
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,800
Go to work.

672
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:26,970
Brother.

673
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,530
I'm not going back.

674
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:31,970
Xiong Fei.

675
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,280
Are you ready

676
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,640
to be with Luo Yuan?

677
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,840
Yes, I'm ready.

678
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,160
Really?

679
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,840
We're both members
of the Light Chaser Rescue.

680
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,360
We know

681
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,720
what it takes to do rescues.

682
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:52,930
Don't worry.

683
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,130
I can do

684
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,280
anything you can do.

685
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,760
No.

686
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,050
You have to do more.

687
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,610
Luo Yuan is not

688
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,930
an ordinary girl.

689
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,680
She is simpler

690
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,130
and kinder.

691
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,890
She needs more attention and care.

692
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,320
She is also more vulnerable.

693
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,200
When you go do rescues,

694
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
maybe

695
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,490
she is the one

696
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,840
who needs you more.

697
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,720
Tell me

698
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,200
how are you gonna protect her?

699
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,760

Xiong Fei.

701
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,720
If you decide

702
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,450
to be with Luo Yuan,

703
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,050
you have to

704
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,010
promise me one thing.

705
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,240
Go ahead.

706
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,720
Quit the rescue team.

707
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,160
You know

708
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,840
what the rescue team means to Xiong Fei.

709
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:16,640
I know,

710
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,760
but he has to make a choice.

711
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,010
Sorry,

712
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,450
my brother put you on the spot.

713
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,090
I understand.

714
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,800
Just give me some time.

715
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,610
I'll take care of it.

716

(The Second Prison of Linjiang)

717

Kiddo!

718
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:56,410
Kid...

719
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,090
Young man!

720

(Light Chaser Rescue)
It's dangerous

721
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,090
(Qingshan)
to go down there like this.

722
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,320
Call 120!

723
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,890
When the brain is deprived of oxygen
for eight to fifteen seconds,

724
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,490
he will lose consciousness.

725
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,490
If it's between six to ten minutes,

726
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,160
he will fall into a coma,

727
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,360
which might lead to brain death

728
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,280
in serious cases.

729
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,090
May I ask

730
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,130
who are you working for?

731
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,010
We are

732
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,610
a non-profit rescue organization,

734
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,570
Are you still hiring?

735
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,130
Do you want to join us?

736
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,720
Can I?

737
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,890
Why not?

738
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,130
But I've been to prison.

739
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:40,280
What did you say?

740
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,360
I am an ex-con.
