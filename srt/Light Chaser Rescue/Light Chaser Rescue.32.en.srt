16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,010
Stop!

17
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,870
Get back here!

18
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,280
Who are you?

19
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,690
Are you calling the police?

20
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,890
Why are you calling the police?

21
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,130
I'm not a bad guy!

22
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,280
Stop it!

23
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,090
I'm asking you a question!

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,840
Who are you?

25
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,930
Listen, I'm not a bad guy.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,840
This is my buddy's car.

27
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,530
His name is Xiong Fei.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,690
He also lives here.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,370
I'll let you go.

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,370
You need to calm down.

31
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,280
This is my buddy's car.

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,930
He lives right up front.

33
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,210
Do you also live here?

34
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,720
Are you his wife?

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,370
I'm talking to you!

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,970
Are you dumb?

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,530
Don't go!

38
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,880
I won't let you go

39
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,530
if you don't make it clear today!

40
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,370
Why did you pull the door?

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:54,690
Qingzi!

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,690
Let her go!

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
Are you okay?

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,720
Xiong.

45
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,440
This is my wife.

46
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,370
Your wife.

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,760
It's all right.

48
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,130
I'm sorry, man.

49
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,250
I asked her several times,

50
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:15,880
but she wouldn't say anything.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
I don't know what's going on.

52
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,930
I...

53
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,690
She can hear,

54
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,370
but she can't speak.

55
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,410
I see.

56
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,160
That's why she didn't answer me

57
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,250
when I talked to her.

58
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,440
She is dumb.

59
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,880
Sorry.

60
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,160
I didn't know that.

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,000
It's okay.

62
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,000
It's my fault.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,040
I didn't get a chance to tell her.

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,880
Don't be afraid.

65
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,250
This is my friend.

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,600
Don't be afraid.

67
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,440
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,320
Here is your phone.

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
All right, go back to sleep.

70
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,130
It's okay.

71
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,490
Okay.

72
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,550
All right.

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,840
Let's go home.

74
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:01,600
It's all right.

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,370
It's okay.

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,530
What did I do?

78
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,600
He must have scared you.

80
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,400
He said he was a friend of yours.

81
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,520
How come I've never heard you

82
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,200
mention him?

83
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,760
He is Qiangzi,

84
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,760
my cellmate.

85
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,560
He was released a few days ago.

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,000
Though he looks big and tall,

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,810
he is not a bad guy.

88
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,850
He was

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
tricked into a pyramid scheme

90
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,400
and brainwashed

91
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,760
to cheat people around him.

92
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,930
He is not a bad person at heart.

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,440
When I was bullied in prison,

94
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,050
he was the only one
who stepped up to help me.

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,810
Yuan.

96
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,690
Well,

97
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,880
I have something to talk to you.

98
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,520
Well, Qiangzi

99
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:10,850
just got out of jail.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,690
He has no money and no job.

101
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,760
I want to

102
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,130
keep him here to help us.

103
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,370
Just give him a hand.

104
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,080
What's the matter?

105
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,730
Is it because he was in prison?

106
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,640
No.

107
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,850
We're running a wonton stand.

108
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,850
Though this is the first time

109
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,490
we've met,

110
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,520
I can tell he's probably

111
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,610
not cut out for

112
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,400
the service industry.

113
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,490
Don't worry about
him being in jail before.

114
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,050
I was in jail, too.

115
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,690
I'm doing well now.

116
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,290
You're not like him.

117
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,730
I understand

118
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,930
you want to help him,

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,490
but we can help him

120
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,050
in a different way.

121
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,080
We don't have to

122
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,610
keep him here.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,930
Fei.

124
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,560
Why are you still up so late?

125
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,760
What are you talking about?

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,960
Is everything all right?

127
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,690
It's all right, Mom.

128
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,930
We're just trying
to figure something out.

129
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,080
We'll go to sleep soon.

130
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,490
That's good.

131
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,810
You should go to bed early.

132
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,130
- You'll get up early tomorrow.
- Got it.

133
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,610
Well,

134
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,690
just let him stay here for a while.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
He will leave

136
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,250
when he gets a new job,

137
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,490
okay?

138
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,860
(CT Room)

139
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,960
There are a lot of cars today.

140
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,250
Luo Ben will come over

141
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,170
after he parks the car.

142
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,610
Is Luo Ben here?

143
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,370
You had your blood drawn
on an empty stomach this morning.

144
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,080
Are you a little hungry?

145
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,640
I am a little hungry.

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,850
Have your breakfast first.

147
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,490
Okay.

148
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,810
You brought a lot.

149
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Wipe your hands first.

150
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,640
I'll get some water for you.

151
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,170
Put the clothes on

152
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,290
if you feel cold later.

153
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,050
Okay.

154
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,370
You are so lucky

155
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,370
to have such an attentive daughter.

156
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:03,290
Xiong.

157
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,400
Well,

158
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,520
did I upset

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
your wife yesterday?

160
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,520
Did she have a fight with you?

161
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,730
No.

162
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,050
She just didn't know you were there

163
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,200
and was taken aback.

164
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,560
Your wife is beautiful.

165
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,610
She teaches dancing.

166
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,760
That's a good job.

167
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,610
I'm happy for you

168
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,930
that you married such a good wife.

169
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,370
Well,

170
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,440
if your wife doesn't like me
staying here,

171
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,400
you must tell me

172
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,560
and I'll leave.

173
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,520
I can't

174
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,760
let you have a fight

175
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,080
because of me!

176
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,370
I've explained it to her.

177
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,050
Don't worry. Just stay here and help me.

178
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,090
Don't think too much.

179
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,040
Let's go.

180
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:40,850
Okay.

181
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,160
I got it. I got it.

182
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,730
The stand is not big,

183
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,090
but the business is good.

184
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,040
Yeah.

185
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:47,880
You really have your hands full.

186
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,730
It's just it's too hot

187
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,680
in the car.

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,250
Sir.

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,400
Two steamers of wontons.

190
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,160
Two steamers of wontons.

191
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,610
All right, two steamers of wontons.

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,280
Two steamers of wontons.

193
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,280
Big Bear Wontons
makes you explode

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
when you eat them.

195
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
Two steamers.

196
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,160
Here are your two steamers of wontons.

197
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,490
I don't want this one.

198
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,760
Pack some new wontons for me.

199
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,520
But...

200
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,760
Don't you remember

201
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,570
you forgot to wear a mask?

202
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,920
You spat on the wontons

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,640
when you talked.

204
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,970
Little old man!

205
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,130
Do you want to cause trouble?

206
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,920
I only said one word

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,520
when I took off my mask.

208
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,330
How did I

209
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,040
spit on the wontons?

210
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,970
You're standing here

211
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,610
and you're spitting

212
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,610
on my wontons!

213
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,850
Stop talking!

214
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,610
I'm so sorry.

215
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,400
Well, sir,

216
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,610
I'll get you a new steamer of wontons.

217
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,470
Okay? Just a sec.

218
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,130
I don't want it!

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,330
The hygiene here is not up to standard!

220
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,210
I'll file a complaint against you!

221
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,880
Wait.

222
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,370
What did you say?

223
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,760
Sir.

224
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,760
Don't be mad.

225
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,970
I'm sorry. It's our fault

226
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,760
that we're not wearing our masks.

227
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,450
We won't do it again.

228
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,570
Well, it's a hot day,

229
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,730
and it's not easy for us

230
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,400
to run a small business.

231
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,370
Please forgive us.

232
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,130
You can have the wontons for free.

233
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,920
That's not appropriate.

234
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,280
Please take it.

235
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,130
Come back tomorrow if it tastes good.

236
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:53,760
All right?

237
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,280
Fine.

238
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,970
I'll let it go
because of your good attitude.

239
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,040
You should

240
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,370
fire him soon.

241
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,520
I'm so sorry.

242
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,400
Take care.

243
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,490
Get back here!

244
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,680
Stop talking.

245
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,610
All right.

246
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,210
There is no need to make a scene
because of a few words.

247
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,210
Look,

248
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,570
you have to control your temper.

249
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,640
In the service business,

250
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,210
we take a little heat sometimes.

251
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,970
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
my own spit.

253
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,250
I'll eat

254
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,130
Put your mask on now.

255
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:23,850
That's right.

256
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
I'll put on my mask.

257
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,040
Is that your wife?

258
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,210
What is she doing here?

259
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,450
I forgot to do what she told me.

260
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,130
I'm gonna go over there.

261
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:37,760
Serve the customers

262
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,330
if there are any.

263
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,610
No problem. Just go ahead.

264
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,800
Yuan.

265
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,370
I saw it all.

266
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,210
That's what I thought it would be.

267
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,640
He shouldn't stay.

268
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,130
Give him some time

269
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,490
to let him get used to it.

270
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,610
Get used to it?

271
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,330
How long will it take?

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,610
One's temper

273
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,610
can't be changed in a short time.

274
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,760
You're not helping him

275
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,730
in this way.

276
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm able to give him a hand.

277
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,490
I can't let him sleep on the street.

278
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,610
What about me?

279
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,490
You're gonna put my feelings aside

280
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,970
for him?

281
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,280
Yuan, listen to me.

282
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,920
Yuan!

283
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,610
It smells good.

284
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,040
The spicy broth is boiling.

285
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,210
I think we can cook the meat.

286
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,210
That's for us.

287
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,640
You'll eat from the plain broth.

288
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,040
I'll just have a bite.

289
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,280
Didn't the test this morning

290
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,640
come out pretty good?

291
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,880
All right.

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,160
I'll eat from the plain broth

293
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,210
and follow the doctor's advice.

294
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Come on, Zhan Yan.

295
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,880
Well, Captain.

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,140
I'm gonna make you a sauce.

297
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,610
Sit down.

298
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,920
We're breaking the rules

299
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,520
to eat here today.

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,970
Dad, you just had surgery
a few days ago.

301
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,280
He has to keep a light diet

302
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
these days.

303
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,760
Or I'm gonna change

304
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
the plain broth into water.

305
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,610
Don't.

306
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,970
Dr. Zhan.

307
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,680
You don't let him eat from the spicy broth

308
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,090
and you don't even give him
any dipping sauce.

309
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
The sauce is the soul of hot pot.

310
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,490
Who is a doctor, you or I?

311
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,040
If you keep...

312
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,490
All right.

313
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,090
Don't bicker

314
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,370
about this.

315
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,090
All right?

316
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,760
I'll eat from the plain broth.

317
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,610
The broth is ready.

318
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,330
All right.

319
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,640
The plain broth will make

320
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,450
the original flavor of the food

321
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,640
explode completely

322
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,520
on the taste buds.

323
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,400
Zhan Yan.

324
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,450
Bring us

325
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,570
some fruit.

326
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,880
Can I eat fruit?

327
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,820
Of course you can.

328
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,490
You can.

329
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,920
This little girl...

330
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,000
You're smart, boy.

331
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,210
Try this.

332
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,370
How's it?

333
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,680
The spicy one tastes better, right?

334
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,610
Have some more.

335
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,000
Eat quietly.

336
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
I'll just have a few bites.

337
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,570
If Yan finds out,

338
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,210
I'm fine with it,

339
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,450
but you'll be in trouble.

340
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,250
I know.

341
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,210
I mean, how come

342
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,210
the two of us

343
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:33,970
be controlled by a woman?

344
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:34,730
Yeah.

345
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,370
What do you mean by that?

346
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,400
Are you trying to get me on your side

347
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,570
and start a rebellion?

348
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,200
How dare I?

349
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,040
Why would I

350
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,210
ask for trouble?

351
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,370
How is it?

352
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,280
She is coming.

353
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,730
Yeah, eat this.

354
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm eating from the plain broth.

355
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,640
Eat from the plain broth.

356
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,160
Eat from the plain broth.

357
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,800
Here.

358
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,160
It's really good.

359
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,760
Luo Ben, have some fruit, too.

360
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,800
Don't just eat meat.

361
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,490
Okay.

362
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,280
What fruit do you want,

363
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,450
Dr. Zhan?

364
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,880
How about watermelon?

365
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,400
Yan.

366
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,280
Look, my belly is round.

367
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,400
Luo Ben.

368
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,090
You still have work this afternoon.

369
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,160
Go get busy.

370
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,250
You don't need to stay with us.

371
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,160
Okay.

372
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
Yan.

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,370
I want to visit your mom.

374
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,160
Okay.

375
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,090
I didn't expect that my sickness

376
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,970
helped clear the misunderstanding

377
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,520
between me and Yan.

378
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,520
It's a blessing in disguise.

379
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,330
Don't worry, Mom.

380
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,570
I'll take care of Dad from now on.

381
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,160
I used to be a father

382
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,330
with the halo of hero above my head.

383
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,250
Now I can finally be myself

384
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,000
in front of my daughter.

385
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,450
I'm relieved.

386
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,610
I just feel like

387
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm putting more stress

388
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
on my daughter.

389
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,040
It doesn't matter

390
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,450
whether you're a hero or not.

391
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,760
It's just you've bore it

392
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,850
all by yourself,

393
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,330
and it's time for me to help you.

394
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,790
Do you hear it?

395
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,770
(Dear Wife Zhu Xiaojie)

396
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,640
Yan is sensible

397
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,760
and successful now.

398
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,880
I don't have to worry about her.

399
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,880
If I can find

400
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,160
that kid in my lifetime,

401
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
then I can let go of everything

402
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,970
and go to see you.

403
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,640
Don't say that.

404
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,920
I'll help you find that kid.

405
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,000
Yan has Luo Ben by her side now.

406
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,970
I have nothing to worry.

407
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,570
Luo Ben

408
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,490
is the attorney

409
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,160
I told you last time.

410
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,730
He is also

411
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,040
a member of the Light Chaser Rescue now.

412
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I've checked him up.

413
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,920
He is a nice young man

414
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,720
and he is really good

415
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:03,920
to Yan.

416
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,090
I hope they can

417
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,490
get married soon.

418
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Dad.

419
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,520
Are you in such a hurry to marry me off?

420
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,520
Is it because I've set too many rules
for you these days?

421
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,250
It's windy now.

422
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,520
We should go home early.

423
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,000
We're leaving.

424
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,130
Yuan, you're back.

425
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,160
I thought you forgot about me

426
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,800
after you got married.

427
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,490
What happened, Yuan?

428
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,880
Have you been wronged?

429
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,400
Did Xiong Fei

430
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
bully you?

431
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,850
Tell me what happened.

432
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,280
I'll help you.

433
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,050
All right, it's okay.

434
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,010
Is Yuan still mad?

435
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,720
She's not mad.

436
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,850
She just doesn't know what to do.

437
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:25,570
That's why she came home to me.

438
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,130
It's my fault,

439
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:33,850
but I can't

440
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,440
let Qiangzi

441
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,880
live on the street.

442
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,050
When I saw him,

443
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,370
it's like seeing myself

444
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
when I just got out of prison.

445
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,440
I had no purpose and no job.

446
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,200
Almost everyone around me

447
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,640
was judging me.

448
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,440
The neighborhood kids

449
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,010
avoided me when they saw me.

450
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,770
If I hadn't met Captain Qingshan,

451
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,680
I might have

452
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,570
taken the wrong path.

453
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,610
I understand how you feel

454
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,640
and I know you want to help him.

455
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,010
I'm not against it.

456
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,010
But, Xiong Fei,

457
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,050
there are many ways to help him.

458
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,050
You don't have to

459
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,400
keep him by your side,

460
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,050
especially when your family

461
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,610
objects to it.

462
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,290
I don't think your parents
know about this.

463
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm sure

464
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,920
they will also be on Luo Yuan's side

465
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,160
and ask you to send him away

466
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,960
when they find out.

467
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,960
It's not like I haven't thought of
something else.

468
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,570
I had a hard time getting a job.

469
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,240
I finally got a job as a deliveryman,

470
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,400
but I lost it.

471
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,130
You know,

472
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,810
it's not easy for me

473
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,570
to get Qiangzi a job now.

474
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,400
I'll help Qiangzi

475
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,240
find a job.

476
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,640
Before he gets a job,

477
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,240
Luo Yuan will stay at my place.

478
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,850
Thanks.

479
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,610
Don't thank me now.

480
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,200
Xiong Fei, you promised me

481
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,240
you would take good care of Luo Yuan.

482
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,240
But how did you do it?

483
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,160
You just got married,

484
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
and you made her worry

485
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,720
and make her angry.

486
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,720
You even drove her back to my place.

487
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,610
You have a reason this time,

488
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,810
and I'll let it go.

489
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,770
But if it happens again,

490
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,720
I won't forgive you.

491
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,050
Come on.

492
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,440
You brat.

493
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,530
Who is this?

494
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,400
A new character, Zhao Zhenkai.

495
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,200
He is perfect.

496
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,680
He can fly a helicopter.

497
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,770
He is tall and good-looking

498
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,530
and have eyes only for Ding Xiaoxiao.

499
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,370
Well?

500
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,010
I can't believe you let Ding Xiaoxiao

501
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,370
betray Zhou Mengmeng.

502
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,700
It's not a betrayal.

503
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,880
He is just a competent love rival.

504
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,010
It's not necessary.

505
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:42,850
There is no need

506
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
for a third party between them,

507
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,610
especially a competent one.

508
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,370
I object.

509
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,440
Think about it,

510
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,240
now that Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng

511
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,370
are in a relationship,

512
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,960
the plot is kind of boring.

513
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,880
There's nothing I can do

514
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,160
but create new characters.

515
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,680
You resort to a love triangle
when you hit a wall.

516
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,370
I won't call that

517
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,400
an advanced technique.

518
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:00,850
The fans aren't gonna like it.

519
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,810
Listen to me,

520
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,770
delete this guy.

521
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,960
Try something else.

522
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,130
That makes sense.

523
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,880
Then I should focus on

524
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,370
making the love story of Ding Xiaoxiao

525
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,400
and Zhou Mengmeng

526
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,530
more wonderful.

527
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,960
That's the right idea.

528
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:21,770
But I don't have

529
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,530
material about love.

530
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:25,680
I see.

531
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,010
I think I should start finding a backup.

532
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,290
No. Do you hear me?

533
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,720
No backup.
I'm the only man you can have.

534
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:34,290
Do you hear me?

535
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,400
You're strangling me.

536
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,400
Say you are wrong.

537
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,740
Then I should focus on

538
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,080
making the love story of Ding Xiaoxiao

539
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,470
and Zhou Mengmeng

540
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,130
more wonderful.

541
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,340
But I don't have

542
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,050
material about love.

543
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,440
My Goodness.

544
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,400
Zhou Mingming is enlightened.

545
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,160
He sent me many skins.

546
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,770
Who's it?

547
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,720
Hello, this is your package.

548
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,480
Please sign for it.

549
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,770
Okay.

550
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,330
What is it?

551
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,900
Dear Miss Ding Xiaoxiao.

552
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,010
Thank you for working so hard.

553
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,820
I can't stay up late
to draw comics for you.

554
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,170
So,

555
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,680
I asked them

556
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,510
to take care of your skin for me

557
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,290
and make you shine every day.

558
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,330
Okay.

559
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,290
(Silly.)

560
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:54,960
(You bought too much.)

561
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,240
(I can't use them all.)

562
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,200
(Get down here.
There is a car waiting for you.)

563
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,680
(The number is 777.)

564
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:43,160
That's secretive.

565
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,810
What is he trying to do?

566
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,130
Miss Ding, please.

567
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,920
Mingming.

568
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,850
It's ready.

569
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
What is this?

570
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,160

Since we met,

603
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,290
we've done a lot of things together

604
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,440
and talked a lot.

605
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,330
I relive these memories

606
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,960
every time I have a setback

607
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,480
in my life or in my work.

608
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,240

So...

611
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,400
So?

612
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,810
So...

613
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,090
Have a great weekend.

614
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,440
Well?

615
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,400
Now you must have

616
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,480
enough material about love, right?

617
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,570
Did you do this

618
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,570
just to provide me with the material?

619
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Of course.

620
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,610
Do you feel

621
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,370
inspired now?

622
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,570
It's not that hard

623
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,400
to write the story now,

624
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,010
right?

625
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,330
Come on, let me put it on you.

626
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,090
Hurry.

627
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,610
All right.

628
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,440
Well, do you like it?

629
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,010
I like it a lot.

630
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,290
I'm glad you like it.

631
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,240
Let me know

632
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,640
if you lack material again.

633
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,240
I got a lot of plans.

634
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,810
Are you a pig?

635
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,610
Hello.

636
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,370
All right.

637
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,130
Thank you.

638
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,050
Xiong.

639
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,480
Do you have things to do?

640
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,960
Go ahead.

641
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,090
I'll clean this up.

642
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,610
It's okay.

643
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,090
Move this table.

644
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,400
Let's have a drink later.

645
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,200
Okay.

646
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,400
Two beers?

647
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Of course.

648
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,010
- All right.
- Okay.

649
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,400
I'll get them.

650
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,780
(Big Bear Wonton)

651
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,160
You must have been exhausted these days.

652
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,130
Not at all.

653
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,880
The business is good,

654
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,880
and it makes me feel hopeful!

655
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,090
I'm not tired at all.

656
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,810
Qiangzi.

657
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,680
Listen,

658
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,720
you don't need to

659
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,640
work here from tomorrow.

660
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,480
Okay, bro.

661
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,640
I'll leave tomorrow.

662
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:18,680
What are you thinking?

663
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:19,610
Hold on.

664
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,880
I asked you not to work here

665
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,880
because I had a friend

666
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,720
find you something else to do.

667
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,680
What?

668
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,440
Guard a warehouse for a factory.

669
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,880
They provide food and accommodation.

670
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:37,920
Wages are paid monthly.

671
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,370
They'll even buy you insurance.

672
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,990
But they want

673
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,230
someone who can live in the factory

674
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
with no worries.

675
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,050
You meet all the requirements.

676
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,590
I just don't know

677
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,640
if you want to do it.

678
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:55,760
Be careful.

679
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,610
It's okay.

680
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,770
Thank you, bro.

681
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,290
You know what,

682
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,200
it's a trending topic now.

683
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,770
You don't know

684
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,370
how impressive the scene was.

685
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,050
There must be hundreds of drones.

686
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,920
I was shocked

687
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,160
when they were flying towards me.

688
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,330
It was beautiful.

689
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,640
But Zhou Mingming is such an idiot.

690
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,240
When he

691
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,440
took out the box,

692
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,520
I thought it was a ring

693
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,610
and he was gonna ask me to marry him.

694
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,050
It turned out to be a necklace.

695
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,050
He also wished me a good weekend.

696
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,090
I really wanted

697
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,880
to kick him away.

698
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:31,160
Never mind.

699
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,330
He has been busy with work lately,

700
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,370
and he still prepared surprises for me.

701
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,050
I'll let it go.

702
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Why hasn't Xiong Fei come
to take you back?

703
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,880
Did he text you to apologize?

704
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,400
Wait, what is he thinking?

705
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,290
Give me your phone.

706
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I'll call him.

707
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,010
Well,

708
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,200
listen,

709
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,370
don't go back

710
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,770
if he doesn't come to take you back.

711
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,680
You have to stick to your principles,

712
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,480
or you'll be bullied

713
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,160
by him. Do you understand?

714
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,290
I'll give you one more chance.

715
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,810
How many things did you steal?

716
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,330
Give them back to me.

717
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,400
Director.

718
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,710
I've told you

719
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,750
many times.

720
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,850
I didn't take them.

721
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,010
The quantity of the goods

722
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,370
doesn't add up after you got here.

723
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,130
If it wasn't you, could it be me?

724
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,090
I'm not the only one
guarding the warehouse!

725
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,090
A leopard cannot change its spots.

726
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,330
What do you mean?

727
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,010
Qiangzi!

728
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,960
Make it clear!

729
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,440
All right.

730
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,400
Who are you?

731
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,480
Who let you in here?

732
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,090
I'm his friend.

733
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,330
You said he stole your goods,

734
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,010
then show us the evidence.

735
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:50,810
I need more cigarettes.

736
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,160
When are you gonna get me some more?

737
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,720
There are more up there.

738
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,200
If you can't, apologize to him.

739
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,680
Are you speaking up for him

740
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,130
because you're in league?

741
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,240
Did you two work together

742
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,480
and steal my stuff?

743
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,160
Let's go.

744
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,160
How dare you smear my bro!

745
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,720
I'll kick you to death!

746
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,260
(Warehouse)

747
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,880
Well,

748
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
you don't think the director

749
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,770
will suspect us, right?

750
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,850
Don't be afraid.

751
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:46,880
We got Qiangzi

752
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,200
to take the blame for us.

753
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,010
50-50.

754
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,240
Don't forget it.

755
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,400
I know.

756
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,290
I have to paint this afternoon.

757
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,440
I'm gonna take a nap.

758
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,300
(This product is flammable and must be
kept away from fire. No smoking.)

759
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,160
Mr. Wang.

760
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:09,880
Polar Land Group's warehouse

761
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,810
is quite big.

762
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,570
We used to

763
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,960
focus on overseas markets.

764
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,360
Now we want to increase

765
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,090
our brand's popularity in China

766
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,640
and start the domestic
and international circulation.

767
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,930
Mr. Luo.

768
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,360
Our businesses

769
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,800
is just starting up in China.

770
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,130
We don't know well

771
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,930
about the commercial policies.

772
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:27,970
I hope

773
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,930
you can help us

774
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,130
with risk prevention in regard to the law.

775
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:30,970
Don't worry.

776
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,320
Fire!

777
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,680
My material!

778
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,230
I have orders from Russia!

779
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,200
Call 119 now!

780
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,930
Ai Rui'er, give me your scarf.

781
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,720
- Fire!
- Go!

782
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,650
Go!

783
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,090
Hurry!

784
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,570
Get up.

785
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,800
Go!

786
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,050
Is there anyone else?

787
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,280
Is there anyone else?

788
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,450
Is there anyone else?

789
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,610
Get up!

790
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,970
Open the door!

791
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,130
Help! Help!

792
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,890
Make a phone call!

793
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:30,530
Help!

794
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,610
Xiong!

795
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,410
Qiangzi!

796
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,130
Come on, let's go!

797
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,890
Hello, there is a fire here!

798
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:52,970
Fire!

799
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,840
Help! Fire!

800
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,160
Is there anyone else upstairs?

801
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,130
There should be people upstairs.

802
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,160
Run! There's a fire!

803
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,360
Give me one.

804
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,530
Luo Ben!

805
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:16,530
Xiong Fei?

806
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,760
There are people upstairs!

807
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,160
Hurry, get him out of here.

808
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,800
Hold him for me.

809
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,570
Be careful, you guys up there!

810
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,200
Put out the fire!

811
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,240
Is there anyone else?

812
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,280
Is there anyone else?

813
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,090
Be careful!

814
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,640
Hurry.

815
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,970
Are you okay?

816
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,200
- Help!
- Help!

817
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:48,890
- Help!
- Help!

818
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,240
Fire!

819
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:50,930
There is someone!

820
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:55,200
Is there anyone else in there?

821
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,610
I think there are people upstairs!

822
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,090
Is there anyone else?

823
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,050
What is going on?

824
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,530
- Help!
- Help!

825
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,010
Be careful! Don't jump!

826
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,280
Don't jump!

827
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,940
Don't jump!

828
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,240
Are you okay?

829
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,410
I'm fine. Let's go!

830
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,720
Go!

831
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
Help! Save me!

832
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,050
We can't get out! What to do?

833
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,570
Save us!

834
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:05,530
Xiong Fei.

835
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,450
The fire has come up.

836
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,130
We can't go down the stairs.

837
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,240
Use the hose to

838
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,090
send them down through the window.

839
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:13,360
Okay.

840
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,320
What to do?

841
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,640
Luo Ben!

842
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,020
(Flammable)

843
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,200
Hold on tightly!

844
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,450
Hold on tightly!

845
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,130
Don't loosen!

846
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,760
Don't loosen your grip!

847
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,130
Don't loosen!

848
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,450
Have a solid foothold!

849
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,800
Grasp it!

850
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,280
Don't loosen!

851
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,680
Slowly.

852
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:13,970
Be careful!

853
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,490
Don't worry.

854
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
Luo Ben!

855
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:27,800
Luo Ben!

856
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,610
Slow down.

857
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,240
Slowly.

858
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,610
Be careful. Hurry.

859
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:42,240
Are you okay?

860
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,970
You go down first. I'll go after you.

861
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,610
Xiong Fei.

862
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,720
Don't say anything.

863
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,240
You go first.

864
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,240
What am I gonna tell Luo Yuan

865
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,360
if anything happens to you?

866
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,720
Get down after me.

867
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,720
I know.

868
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,320
Luo Ben!

869
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,280
Get down!

870
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,150
Get down!

871
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,320
Be careful.

872
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,010
Be careful. It's too dangerous.

873
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,160
Be careful! Slowly!

874
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,970
Slowly!

875
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,410
Have a solid foothold!

876
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,610
Be careful! Hold on tight!

877
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,760
Step by step!

878
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,360
You're getting close.

879
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,050
Slowly.

880
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,010
It's high.

881
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,130
Make sure to have a solid foothold.

882
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:26,890
Slowly!

883
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,530
Watch out!

884
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,410
Grasp it!

885
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:28,840
Pull!

886
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,280
Slowly.

887
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:37,840
Are you okay?

888
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:38,490
Are you hurt?

889
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:38,930
I'm fine.

890
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,410
Luo Ben, get down!

891
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,970
Luo Ben.

892
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,360
Luo Ben!

893
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,800
The injured person fell from a height

894
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,570
and fractured his leg.

895
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,760
After falling to the ground,

896
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,160
he was squeezed by a heavy object.

897
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:47,280
The examination results suggest

898
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,840
a complication of squeeze syndrome

899
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:51,160
and compartment syndrome,

900
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,090
which can be

901
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,890
life-threatening.

902
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Therefore,

903
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,610
our orthopedic opinion

904
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:58,930
is amputation.

905
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,050
Isn't there a second plan?

906
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,450
Even if

907
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,570
we keep his leg,

908
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,610
there will be serious

909
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,050
limb dysfunction.
