16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,220
He hung up on me.

17
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,020
I told you he has no time.

18
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,660
Let me text him.

19
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,100
Come on, man. Forget it.

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,330
Zhou Mingming…

21
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,300
(Zhou Mingming,)

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,820
(we got lost in the mountains.)

23
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,220
(I don't know where we are now.)

24
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,220
(We got no water)

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,410
(and no food.)

26
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,380
Here we go.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,860
Come on, come on.

28
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,790
Shh.

29
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,370
Mingming.

30
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,770
Hey, Li Jian.

31
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,890
Where are you?

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
We got lost in the mountains.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,650
I don't know where we are.

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,960
Send me the location.

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,610
Stay right there.

36
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,200
Okay.

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,260
I'm sending it to you now.

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,540
The reception's bad.

39
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,650
Such a coward.

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,420
See?

41
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:36,990
Right? Right?

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,540
You went too far.

43
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,490
Did you hear that?

44
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,260
His voice changed.

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,860
You're playing fire.

46
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm just kidding.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,700
No big deal.

48
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,540
Come on.

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,810
Here's to

50
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,300
our reunion.

51
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,080
Cheers!

52
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,180
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

53
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,740
Hello, Light Chaser Rescue.

54
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,700
Hello, Jing.

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,260
It's Mingming.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,370
My friends are lost in the mountains.

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,050
Where are they?

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,020
Come on.

59
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,030
Stand up.

60
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,980
Don't be afraid, all right?

61
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,120
Come here. Come here.

62
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,980
Stand there.

63
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,700
No, strike a pose.

64
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,980
What's up?

65
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,960
Turn your leg a little bit.

66
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,860
A little more.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,540
Yes.

68
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,140
Come on, three, two, one.

69
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,300
Nice legs.

70
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,330
I won again!

71
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,650
You're good.

72
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,930
Boring. I'm out.

73
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,590
You're the one who wants to come,

74
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,600
and now you said it's boring.

75
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,650
What do you want?

76
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,090
Just drop it.

77
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,610
We're running out of road.

78
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,030
I've checked.

79
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,370
There's only one way
through the mountains.

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,810
We'll have to move in on foot.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,810
Bring the kit.

82
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,740
Lead the team.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,860
It's Zhou Mingming.

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,310
Mingming, where are you?

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,870
We're within

86
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,900
walking distance.

87
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,420
You're here?

88
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:30,990
Is there anything

89
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,050
close by?

90
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,960
There are trees all around here.

91
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,370
They look the same.

92
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,120
Let me confirm with you again.

93
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,880
You left the camp

94
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,860
at 10:30,

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,870
and got lost at 11:00.

96
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,690
Is that right?

97
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,240
I think so.

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,340
That shouldn't be far.

99
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,120
Just stay right there.

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,540
We'll be there soon.

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,430
No. Look at all these people.

102
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,930
You're in big trouble this time.

103
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,300
Let's go.

104
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,010
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

105
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,510
Stop eating.

106
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,840
Turn off your cell phones and move.

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,480
What is that for?

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,070
What's wrong?

109
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,870
Why?

110
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,240
We just told him we were lost.

111
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Now they're here.

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,610
If he saw us eating

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,310
and drinking here,

114
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,610
he'd know we lied.

115
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,190
But why bother turning off the phones?

116
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,690
What if he asks us to send the location?

117
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,810
Think about it.

118
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,170
Go, go, go.

119
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,990
I barely ate.

120
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,930
Let's go, let's go.

121
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,490
Slowly, slowly.

122
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,370
Slowly. Be careful.

123
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,160
Come on.

124
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,490
Honey, a little help.

125
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,660
Come on.

126
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,750
Dabao, hurry up.

127
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,430
You go ahead.

128
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,370
I'm right behind you.

129
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,780
(Undeveloped Area No Entry)

130
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,450
Yeah, it's his.

131
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,010
Brand new.

132
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,130
Never been used.

133
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,010
I don't know why they bought them.

134
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,900
Just dumb enough to do it.

135
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,810
Were they hiking

136
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,420
or having a party?

137
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,930
You can keep it.

138
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,660
(Sorry.)

139
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,720
(The subscriber you dialed)

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,490
(cannot be connected for the moment.)

141
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,660
(Please redial later.)

142
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,490
I can't reach him.

143
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,450
I have phone service.

144
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,690
It doesn't seem right.

145
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,660
What's wrong?

146
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,660
The food is still warm.

147
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,220
They should have just left.

148
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,250
What?

149
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,680
Didn't they get lost

150
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,250
two hours ago?

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,980
Are they playing us in this heat?

152
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,540
Are you kidding me?

153
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,190
Is this some kind of prank?

154
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,450
They're nuts.

155
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
We came all the way here

156
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,690
only to be fooled?

157
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,610
Totally a waste of time.

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,810
So ridiculous.

159
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,250
Li Jian!

160
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,860
Yang Zhao!

161
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,490
Get out of here!

162
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,280
I know you are here!

163
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,780
Li Jian, Yang Zhao!

164
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,690
You're not coming out, are you?

165
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,610
Fine, then don't come out!

166
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,190
Let's go.

167
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,160
We have to find them.

168
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,740
They're playing with us.

169
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,180
Even if they are,

170
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,550
we can't leave until

171
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,900
we're sure they're safe.

172
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,690
No life is insignificant.

173
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,120
Do you have any questions?

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,220
No.

175
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,100
No problem.

176
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,010
Centered on the camp,

177
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,180
and with a radius of one kilometer,

178
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,240
spread out.

179
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,250
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,190
Lei Yun,

181
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,420
you guys come with me.

182
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,220
Yes, sir.

183
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,980
Li Jian.

184
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,130
Li Jian.

185
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,860
Li Jian.

186
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,540
Li Jian.

187
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,300
Li Jian, Yang Zhao.

188
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,930
Li Jian.

189
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,050
Li Jian, Dabao.

190
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,300
Yang Zhao.

191
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,450
Li Jian.

192
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,850
Li Jian, Dabao.

193
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,330
Yang Zhao.

194
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,050
There's no signal at all.

195
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,140
Li Jian.

196
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,180
Yang Zhao.

197
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:04,970
Li Jian.

198
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,210
Keep up!

199
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:12,810
Quickly.

200
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,420
(Undeveloped Area No Entry)

201
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,260
(Undeveloped Area No Entry)
They didn't go in there, did they?

202
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,150
From what I understand about him,

203
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,330
they probably did.

204
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,200
Stay safe, everyone.

205
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,720
Keep in touch.

206
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,660
- Understood.
- Understood.

207
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,540
Let's go.

208
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:39,620
Go.

209
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,880
Fine. Bad luck.

210
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,850
So deep in the woods.

211
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,730
Why are they here?

212
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,930
Slowly.

213
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,790
Be careful.

214
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,420
Are you okay?

215
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,450
My feet…

216
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,390
I can't walk anymore.

217
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,790
I can't walk, either.

218
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,360
Look at the bites on my hand.

219
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,850
There are too many bugs.

220
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,120
Please let me be.

221
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,730
If I go any further, I'll die.

222
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,730
You've had your little joke.

223
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,020
Let's go back.

224
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,930
I told Zhou Mingming

225
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,080
we got lost half an hour after

226
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,850
leaving the camp.

227
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,330
If we go back now,

228
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,020
he'd know we're lying.

229
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,140
So what if he knows that?

230
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,260
Just apologize.

231
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,620
We're friends. No big deal.

232
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,660
If you don't go,
we'll leave without you.

233
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,050
Let's go.

234
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,260
Go back the way we came.

235
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,540
Careful, careful.

236
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,690
Slowly.

237
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,510
Be careful.

238
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,210
Be careful.

239
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,840
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

240
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,510
Come on.

241
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,500
I'm okay.

242
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,730
Watch your step, everyone.

243
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,810
Which way shall we go?

244
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,900
South.

245
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,970
Take a break.

246
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,050
We've been looking for so long.

247
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,030
If they were just

248
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,420
hiding around the camp,

249
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,730
we would've found them by now.

250
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,390
That makes sense.

251
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,020
Dapeng.

252
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,510
Have some water, Dapeng.

253
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,510
No need. Keep it.

254
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,750
Snail, Flying Fish,

255
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,850
found anything?

256
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,500
Negative.

257
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,620
Negative.

258
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,450
Wait a minute.

259
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,780
What is it?

260
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,620
I just dropped this bottle here.

261
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,500
What does that mean?

262
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,140
It means we're lost.

263
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,620
Turn on the navigation.

264
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,690
No signal.

265
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,970
If there's no signal,

266
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,390
how can we find our way back?

267
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,450
We can't even if there is a signal.

268
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,690
We're in the mountains,

269
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,670
the GPS can't locate us accurately.

270
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,240
You're the one who took us here,

271
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,090
you idiot!

272
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,970
I'm the one who took us here?

273
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,620
If you hadn't
wanted to fool Zhou Mingming,

274
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
I wouldn't have come

275
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,900
to this dumb place with you!

276
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,300
Are you blaming me?

277
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,910
- You bet I am.
- You led us here.

278
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,020
Okay, stop it.

279
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,720
Save it.

280
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,440
Since neither of us

281
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,600
is convinced,

282
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
we go our separate ways.

283
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,080
Fine by me!

284
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,380
You're not the center of the universe.

285
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,020
Just go.

286
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,390
Why don't you go?

287
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,360
Didn't you say you were leaving?

288
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,300
What if I don't?

289
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:09,840
What are you screaming for?

290
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,730
It's just a bird.

291
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,500
Do you think

292
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,970
there are wolves in the mountains?

293
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,420
Go get the signal.

294
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:27,870
I don't have a signal here.

295
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,660
How about you?

296
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,840
We're not going to
die in the wilderness, are we?

297
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,840
I don't want to die.

298
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,380
Shut your mouth.

299
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,750
Zhou Mingming told us to stay and wait.

300
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,870
Let's just wait here.

301
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,300
Okay.

302
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,080
Yes, yes.

303
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,180
Let's wait here.

304
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,600
We should get in touch…

305
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,660
Find the signal first.

306
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,570
I'm getting weak in the knees.

307
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,620
Dabao.

308
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,540
Still can't get through. No signal.

309
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,570
Your friends are runners.

310
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,330
If we can't find them soon,

311
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,260
we're running out of supplies, too.

312
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,140
Mingming,

313
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,270
these bottled water

314
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,390
are for your friends.

315
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,790
Let's just drink it.

316
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,300
Come on. Just save your breath.

317
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,570
They'll need the water.

318
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,210
Might as well teach them a lesson.

319
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,450
Li Jian.

320
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,420
We're here to rescue them.

321
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,810
- Li Jian.
- Yang Zhao, Dabao.

322
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,380
- Li Jian.
- Li Jian.

323
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:37,930
Yang Zhao.

324
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,970
Footprints.

325
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,200
Snail, Flying Fish,

326
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,090
we found footprints.

327
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,210
Come to the southeast to meet us.

328
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,570
Go.

329
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,610
Keep up with us.

330
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,450
Okay, okay.

331
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,730
How's it going? You okay?

332
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,330
Is there any water left?

333
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,810
It's all gone.

334
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,140
Hey,

335
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,660
are we going to die here?

336
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,300
I don't want to die here!

337
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,030
You made us come here.

338
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,320
What kind of place is it?

339
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,730
Stop it. So annoying.

340
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,540
What's the point of yelling at her?

341
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,510
What's it to do with you?

342
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,870
What? I can't say anything?

343
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,240
You do not get to say, okay?

344
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,750
What do you mean?

345
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,630
What's that for?

346
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,270
What's wrong?

347
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,840
You want to kick me?

348
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,750
If you hadn't made us come,

349
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,620
who would've come to this place?

350
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,690
Did I drag you here?

351
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,930
- Do you think I want to come?
- Stop fighting.

352
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,900
Leave, now.

353
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,030
- I'll never come again.
- Not now.

354
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,180
- Li Jian.
- Dabao.

355
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,140
- Li Jian.
- Dabao.

356
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,120
Li Jian. Yang Zhao.

357
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,730
Yang Zhao. Dabao. Dabao.

358
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,330
We are here!

359
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,750
- We are here!
- Zhou Mingming.

360
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,750
Zhou Mingming!

361
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,630
Zhou Mingming.

362
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,390
We are here!

363
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,510
Mingming.

364
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,270
Here!

365
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,630
Help!

366
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,510
Zhou Mingming, we're here!

367
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,450
We are here!

368
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,420
- Zhou Mingming!
- Mingming!

369
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,810
You're finally here. Do you have water?

370
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,320
I'm so thirsty.

371
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,210
You're one to talk.

372
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,270
Is it fun?

373
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,560
Take it easy. Take it easy.

374
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,810
And you guys,

375
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,450
is it fun to screw
with everyone for chumps?

376
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
It was a joke. Come on.

377
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,300
A joke?

378
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,670
A dozen of people

379
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,930
stopped working for you.

380
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,020
You like jokes, don't you?

381
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,210
Let's get them out safely first.

382
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,450
You can discuss that later.

383
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,090
Have some water.

384
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,210
Here.

385
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,540
Thank you.

386
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,660
That's all the water we got.

387
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,020
Leave some for others.

388
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,910
That's all?

389
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,900
And you call yourself a rescue team?

390
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,790
That's ridiculous.

391
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,690
How dare you say that?

392
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,440
We've come a long way to find you.

393
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,690
We ran out of water long ago.

394
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:01,690
You…

395
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,020
Zhou Mingming.

396
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,730
Zhou Mingming.

397
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,360
Mingming, Mingming.

398
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,840
Zhou Mingming,

399
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,200
you hit me because of a bottle of water?

400
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,030
Are we still brothers?

401
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,050
Brother?

402
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,190
The whole team saved those

403
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,870
two bottles of water to save you.

404
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,010
Are you even human?

405
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,600
How could I be so blind

406
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,820
to have a brother like you?

407
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,120
From today,

408
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,530
we're strangers.

409
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,140
If your pranks

410
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,190
make our team members

411
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,690
get hurt accidentally,

412
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,420
you will be held responsible.

413
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,910
I've never seen

414
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,580
weirdos like you.

415
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,180
I really want to punch you.

416
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,180
Why are you still standing there?

417
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,210
Move it.

418
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,770
We've gone too far this time.

419
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,180
Let's go.

420
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,950
You're complete jerks for doing that.

421
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,010
Can you joke about this?

422
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,690
All right.

423
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,320
We know we're wrong.

424
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,870
But we deserve a chance

425
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,450
to make amends, right?

426
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,470
Then go talk to Mingming.

427
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,120
What's the point

428
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,380
of talking to me here?

429
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,360
He's been ignoring us.

430
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,010
We're all blacklisted.

431
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,100
You deserve it.

432
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,600
Dingding,

433
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,970
we're friends, right?

434
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,910
Please help us out

435
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,380
and speak up for us.

436
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,620
We've been friends for so many years,

437
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,010
and we can't break up because of this.

438
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Whether he breaks up with you or not,

439
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,230
it has nothing to do with me.

440
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,530
It's out of my hands.

441
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,390
You're his girlfriend.

442
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,360
He listens to you.

443
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,340
Come on, have one.

444
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,530
Stop.

445
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,560
Yes, I am his girlfriend.

446
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,730
But it's up to him.

447
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,430
And besides,

448
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,230
if I were him,

449
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,730
I'd be done with you guys, too.

450
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,140
Well,

451
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,100
we've gone too far this time.

452
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,870
Something terrible has happened to him,

453
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,430
but we still caused him so much trouble.

454
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,180
I really want to
slap myself in the face.

455
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,450
Something terrible?

456
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,760
Don't you know?

457
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,180
Ms. Ma is in the hospital.

458
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,210
Come in.

459
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:31,690
What is it?

460
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:40,900
Mingming.

461
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,580
Dingding?

462
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,770
What brings you here?

463
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,930
The company has such a big problem.

464
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,530
Why didn't you tell me?

465
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,190
I used to be a member

466
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,620
of Mingmei Media, right?

467
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,690
What are you talking about?

468
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,930
There's no problem.

469
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,420
Stop pretending.

470
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,770
Li Jian and Yang Zhao

471
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,530
told me everything.

472
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,670
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

473
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,820
I just don't

474
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,450
want you to worry about me.

475
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,290
Here's 800 thousand.

476
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,490
Take it.

477
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,340
Where did you get the money?

478
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,970
A royalty check
for the Light Chaser Rescue,

479
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,660
and I pre-sold the rights to

480
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,140
my next comic to Ma Baoming.

481
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,860
I can't take it.

482
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,100
Why not?

483
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,280
It's a business matter.

484
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,210
I won't drag you into this mess.

485
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,910
Your concerns are my concerns.

486
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,770
Dingding,

487
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,150
I've mortgaged my house.

488
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,530
If the movie won't work out,

489
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,950
not only will my house be lost,

490
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,250
your money will be gone, too.

491
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,450
What's the big deal?

492
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,800
I can just draw
a few more pages every day

493
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,450
and earn it back.

494
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,210
It doesn't matter if the house is gone.

495
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,860
You can stay at my place,
and I'll provide.

496
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:43,900
Dingding,

497
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,210
I will find a way

498
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,010
to solve the problem.

499
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:50,290
Don't worry about it.

500
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,730
You've been

501
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,000
working hard on your comics

502
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,730
and you've been saving little by little.

503
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,690
I can't take your money.

504
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,900
Just keep it

505
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,210
and spend it on yourself.

506
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,970
There he is.

507
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:22,290
Mingming, Mingming.

508
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,630
We know we're wrong.

509
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,120
- Mingming.
- Mingming.

510
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,040
Mingming, please forgive us.

511
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,470
Okay?

512
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,360
I don't know you guys.
Get out of the way.

513
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,210
Mingming!

514
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,800
As long as you can forgive us,

515
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,900
you can hit me or scold me.

516
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,120
Punch me as you want.

517
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,430
I mean it. Come on.

518
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,450
I won't fight back.

519
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,900
Look at you.

520
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,380
You can scold me all you want,

521
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,040
but you can't abandon your brother.

522
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,320
I don't have a brother like you.

523
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,770
Mingming, Mingming,

524
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,000
the three of us decided

525
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,600
to make a donation

526
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,340
to the rescue team

527
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,380
to apologize.

528
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,560
You think money can fix everything,

529
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,290
don't you?

530
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,670
No, no, no.

531
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,760
We thought this way

532
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,430
will convey

533
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,010
how sorry we are.

534
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,670
Then what do you have in mind?

535
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,450
Just say it.

536
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,600
We will do whatever

537
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,580
you want us to do.

538
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,420
Okay.

539
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,140
I'll give you a chance.

540
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:06,870
Go apologize to the team members

541
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:07,420
who went in the mountains

542
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,760
to rescue you that day.

543
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,430
As long as they forgive you,

544
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,420
I will forgive you.

545
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,380
If one of them says no,

546
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,420
I'm sorry,

547
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,250
don't contact me again.

548
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,250
Mingming…

549
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,770
- Dapeng.
- Dapeng. Dapeng.

550
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,250
- Dapeng.
- Dapeng.

551
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,900
Dapeng, it's us.

552
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,490
It's so high.

553
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,490
Dapeng, we're here, Dapeng.

554
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,150
He ignores us.

555
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,900
Let's go up.

556
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,950
Let's go up and talk to him.

557
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:41,690
Go, go, go.

558
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:42,900
Dapeng, we're going up.

559
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,900
Dapeng.

560
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,150
It's…

561
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:49,620
Dapeng.

562
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,730
It's too steep.

563
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,100
Dapeng.

564
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,620
Dabao, hurry up.

565
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,520
Oh, gosh.

566
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,770
Dapeng, we're coming up.

567
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,730
Dapeng.

568
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,820
Dapeng, here we come.

569
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,660
Dapeng.

570
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,450
Dapeng.

571
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,290
This is quite high.

572
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,290
Oh my God.

573
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,690
Dapeng. Dapeng.

574
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,140
Dapeng.

575
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:11,900
Okay.

576
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,380
- Dapeng.
- Dapeng.

577
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,820
We're here to apologize to you.

578
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,380
Dapeng.

579
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,900
- Dapeng.
- Dapeng.

580
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,730
Dapeng.

581
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,140
Wait.

582
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,180
Dapeng.

583
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,250
Dapeng.

584
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,690
Shall we go down?

585
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,610
Let's go down.

586
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,560
Go, go, go.

587
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,180
Go, go, go.

588
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,100
Wait for us!

589
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,620
We're coming down!

590
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,610
Dapeng.

591
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,250
Are you kidding me?

592
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,470
Dapeng.

593
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:46,910
Dapeng.

594
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,010
You're fast, Dapeng.

595
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Dapeng. Dapeng.

596
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,580
We really came to apologize.

597
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,050
Dapeng.

598
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,210
We're here to apologize.

599
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:53,730
Dapeng.

600
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:56,140
Who are you?

601
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,860
Do I know you?

602
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,970
I remember now.

603
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,930
You're that dumb guy.

604
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,470
Dapeng, we...

605
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,770
Hey,

606
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,930
do you come to our place

607
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,180
to have a picnic?

608
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,730
Dapeng, we were really wrong.

609
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,450
Dapeng, we're so sorry. We're sorry.

610
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,420
Unbelievable.

611
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,560
If I hadn't known

612
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,230
you're friends of Zhou Mingming,

613
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,190
I would've just thrown you

614
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,420
from above.

615
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,420
We deserve that. We're so sorry.

616
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,150
Yes, that's right.

617
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,690
Right.

618
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,200
Dapeng,

619
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,690
can you forgive us?

620
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,690
- Dapeng.
- Dapeng. Dapeng.

621
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,420
What are you doing here?

622
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,210
I barely

623
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,340
recognize you in that outfit.

624
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,150
But when you speak,

625
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,820
it feels familiar.

626
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,380
Feeling better?

627
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,860
Why should I be here if I am?

628
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,730
Well,

629
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,840
so don't get upset.
It's not good for your health.

630
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,490
I'm already

631
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,060
uncomfortable when I saw you.

632
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,620
You'd better leave now.

633
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,180
That won't do.

634
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,470
Mingming's been busy lately

635
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,080
and doesn't have time to visit you.

636
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,210
As his girlfriend,

637
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,420
I have to share his duties

638
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,100
and ease his worry, right?

639
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,420
Ding Dingding,

640
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,560
don't think you can take advantage

641
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,530
of the situation when I'm sick.

642
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,860
I won't buy it.

643
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:46,900
All right.

644
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,430
Let me get you some fruit.

645
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,210
Don't.

646
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,660
I don't need you to take care of me.

647
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,180
Come on. Hurry up.

648
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:56,900
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

649
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,660
We were wrong.

650
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,660
We're sorry. Please forgive us.

651
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,250
We're sorry.

652
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:11,380
You…

653
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,340
We're sorry.

654
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,660
- We're sorry.
- Please forgive us.

655
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,620
Sir, your wontons are so good.

656
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,900
Thank you.

657
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,970
Here, take it.

658
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,520
Goodbye.

659
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,290
Take care.

660
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,930
We're sorry.

661
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,340
As long as you can learn your lesson,

662
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,820
let's just pretend this never happened.

663
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,820
Great. Great.

664
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,730
Wait a minute.

665
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,580
My wife has something to say.

666
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,250
My wife says

667
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,530
we must make you pay

668
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,060
for what you've done.

669
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,430
No problem.

670
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,690
How much? You name it.

671
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,730
Ten thousand?

672
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,660
A hundred thousand?

673
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,490
A million is a bit too much.

674
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,340
One thousand

675
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,100
hours.

676
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,140
What's that?

677
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,560
As long as you finish

678
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,180
one thousand hours of volunteer work

679
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,140
or basic training of the rescue team,

680
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,970
I'll pretend that never happened.

681
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,210
Volunteer work?

682
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:51,490
Rescue team?

683
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,530
Food included?

684
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,420
Stop doing it.

685
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,770
I'm not eating.

686
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,690
That won't do.

687
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:25,450
The doctor said you should
have balanced nutrition

688
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,730
and more vitamins.

689
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,250
You can't be picky now.

690
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,150
Besides, the fruit

691
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,210
I bought you was expensive.

692
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,490
If it weren't for you,
I would've never bought it.

693
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,530
I don't have a problem with the fruit.

694
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,930
I'm just upset when I see you.

695
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:36,970
You should leave now.

696
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,690
You're sick and not in a good mood.

697
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,770
I can understand that.

698
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,250
It's the same for me.

699
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:48,950
Can't you understand

700
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,450
what I'm saying?

701
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,430
Whether I'm sick or not,

702
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,900
or how my mood is,

703
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,290
I just don't want to see you.

704
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:03,970
Fine.

705
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,490
I'm leaving now.

706
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,380
Why are you here again?

707
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,250
Let me tell you,

708
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,730
when you're in a bad mood,

709
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,470
have some dessert.

710
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,470
That bakery

711
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,290
is exceptionally good.

712
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,660
But they don't do takeout.

713
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,230
I took a taxi there.

714
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,180
Try it.

715
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,140
It's really good.

716
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:56,620
Come on.

717
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,530
Let me help.

718
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,490
Wait a minute.

719
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,230
Try it.

720
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,340
It's really good.

721
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,950
How is it?

722
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,670
Is it good?

723
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,860
See what I'm talking about?

724
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,100
I've had better.

725
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,530
Have some more.

726
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,450
I haven't eaten for a long time.

727
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,910
Whenever I was there,

728
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,190
it was always packed.

729
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,140
So exhausted.

730
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,140
Let me tell you, their cream

731
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,670
is different from

732
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,430
other bakeries'.

733
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,150
It's quite healthy.

734
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,770
You'll barely
gain weight from eating it.

735
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,730
This is so good.

736
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:47,690
Why does it feel like

737
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,420
there are no fillings anymore?

738
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,420
I like desserts with no jam.

739
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,290
I think nothing is more

740
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,580
important than being happy.

741
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,820
So what if I don't have a nice figure?

742
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,460
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

743
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,250
Want some water?

744
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,690
Just tell me,

745
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,770
and I'll help you with that.

746
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,530
I'm a very light sleeper.

747
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,580
You'd better go home.

748
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,140
No way.

749
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,010
What if something happens

750
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,660
if you're here by yourself?

751
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,380
Things would happen
only when you're here.

752
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,450
Just now,

753
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,860
my leg was dead.

754
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:12,420
I'm sorry.

755
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,730
Let me massage it for you.

756
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,180
Forget it, forget it.

757
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,410
If you really want to stay,

758
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,980
just ask for a folding bed.

759
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,150
Don't sit next to me.

760
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,500
I'm trying to sleep here.

761
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,690
Am I getting on your nerves

762
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,410
or do you care for me?

763
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:54,670
If you don't say anything,

764
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,180
I'll take it as the latter.

765
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:06,730
Nice and cozy.

766
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,460
It is my honor

767
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,730
(Fire Safety Training)
to have you

768
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,330
join today's

769
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,410
fire safety training.

770
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,290
I am Yang Zhao.

771
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:20,150
And now,

772
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,020
I'll demonstrate to you

773
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,770
how to operate

774
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,020
a fire extinguisher.

775
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,400
First, we have to look at

776
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,730
the small pressure gauge

777
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,770
on the fire extinguisher.

778
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:29,940
If the pointer

779
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,330
is in the yellow zone,

780
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,540
it means you can

781
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,630
spray a little bit

782
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,250
and pause a little.

783
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,250
But if it is in the green zone,

784
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,210
you can

785
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,290
spray normally.

786
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,020
But if it is in the red zone,

787
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,400
it means this fire extinguisher

788
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,210
cannot be used.

789
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,730
But, in our…

790
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,620
(Drowning Prevention Education)

791
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,210
Why are you so heavy, Dabao?

792
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,330
So heavy.

793
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,290
Switch shoulder.

794
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,540
Lift it…

795
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,890
Lift it in the back.

796
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,290
Switch shoulder.

797
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:45,890
I'm...

798
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,620
I'm starving.

799
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,210
We've only practiced a little while

800
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,620
and we can barely walk.

801
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,250
Rescue team members are so tough.

802
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,270
In the future, anyone who gets a problem

803
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,020
with the rescue team,

804
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,690
I'll go after him.

805
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,500
- Yes.
- That's right.

806
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:26,580
Blood pressure is fine.

807
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,540
But it's at the critical level.

808
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,560
So remember to take it

809
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,230
every morning and evening.

810
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:34,410
Make it a habit.

811
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,890
It's not going to be that easy.

812
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,460
I'd like you to check it for me

813
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:43,540
every time you come.

814
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,290
I'm going to be away for a while.

815
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,580
Away?

816
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,730
Where are you going?

817
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,580
To support the mountainous areas.

818
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,540
The location has just been decided.

819
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,890
Because of Luo Ben?

820
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,410
Not really.

821
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,980
You know

822
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,730
healing the sick and saving lives

823
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,690
has always been my dream as a doctor.

824
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,980
While I'm young,

825
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,330
I want to travel and experience.

826
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,000
In those remote mountainous areas,

827
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,660
the medical conditions are not good.

828
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,060
I want to do something for them.

829
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,850
For how long?

830
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,500
A year

831
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,540
or longer.

832
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,330
When will you leave?

833
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,690
Tonight.

834
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,500
So sudden?

835
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,350
I didn't tell you in advance

836
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,250
just because…

837
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,620
You were afraid that I'd stop you?

838
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,520
Whatever you decide to do,

839
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,140
you always have my support.

840
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,140
Did you tell Luo Ben?

841
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,710
Going to the mountainous areas

842
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,940
for so long,

843
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,830
you have to be well-prepared.

844
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,680
Especially medicine,

845
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,210
daily necessities and so on.

846
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,620
What do you need?

847
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,660
I will go with you to buy them now.

848
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,460
Already packed.

849
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,290
My only concern

850
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,060
is your health.

851
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,560
I've written here

852
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,210
the instructions

853
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:25,670
and dosage

854
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,250
of the medicine.

855
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,850
Remember to take it on time.

856
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,410
What could go wrong?

857
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:33,540
However,

858
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,370
you're going away alone.

859
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,100
I'll be so worried.

860
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,140
Whenever I have time,

861
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:44,150
I'll check in

862
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,060
and we can video chat,

863
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,080
okay?

864
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,620
Okay.

865
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,210
Make sure I'll see you a lot.

Why didn't you tell me

873

you're leaving?
