16
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,280
We'll have a meeting, right?

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,690
Come on, let us not waste time.

18
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,480
Look,

19
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,970
Miss Ding can be very cooperative.

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,250
Sure.

21
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,810
What working arrangement do you have?

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,690
Let's discuss it quickly.

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,000
I read the data of this week.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
It's unsatisfactory.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,280
And it declined a little.

26
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,970
Isn't that because

27
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,530
you altered the storyline at random?

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,250
I asked you to alter it

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,280
in order to optimize the story.

30
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,720
If I didn't ask you to do it,

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,840
it might be worse.

32
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,080
You let...

33
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,530
Letting your performance decline freely

34
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,410
will never be allowed

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,480
by your boss, which is me.

36
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,200
So,

37
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,250
we need to

38
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:13,810
develop a KPI

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,440
and

40
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,090
strictly enforce it by time points.

41
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,410
What KPI?

42
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,370
By the end of the first month, click rate,

43
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,880
topic popularity and top-search count

44
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
are to come out on top

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,440
in the IP product ranking.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,490
By the end of the third month,

47
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,930
get into the top 10.

48
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,880
By the end of the sixth month,

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,690
the comics are to be serialized,

50
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:28,880
and an offprint is to be punished.

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,280
Within this year,

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,090
the IP comprehensive incubation

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,090
is to be completed.

54
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,970
Knowing the company intends to
popularize my comics,

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,440
as the author,

56
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,320
I feel really gratified.

57
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,130
But why don't you

58
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,810
invite our colleagues

59
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,760
in the Publicity Department,
Marketing Department,

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,130
and the R&D Department

61
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,280
to join us at the meeting?

62
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,160
It's no use telling me alone.

63
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,040
You can't let an author

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,320
work in marketing as well, right?

65
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,440
I'm not

66
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,690
the only one

67
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,210
in the Comics Department, am I?

68
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,410
Do I have to

69
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,970
complete the KPI alone?

70
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,650
So,

71
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,160
Miss Ding,

72
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,880
you have great responsibilities.

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,370
Go for it.

74
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:36,840
Zhou Mingming...

75
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,560
He's such a bully.

76
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,040
Fine.

77
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,440
When Heaven is about to place
a great responsibility on a great man,

78
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,650
it doesn't have to send Zhou Mingming

79
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,840
to push me forward.

80
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,320
(You start to fight with me)

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
(every time you get home!)

82
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,530
(You snooped through my stuff!)

83
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,690
Would you cut it out?

84
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,720
(Throw it!)

85
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,530
(Would you calm down?)

86
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,210
Annoying.

87
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,000
(Go home voluntarily.)

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,640
Are you Mr. Luo?

89
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,810
I'm your neighbor upstairs.

90
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,850
I want to consult you about something.

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
If you have legal problems,

92
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
you can go consult me

93
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,930
at my law firm.

94
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,440
If a man

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,000
promised to marry you before,

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,490
but he went back on his word afterwards,

97
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,730
does it violate the law?

98
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,170
Marrying you is just a verbal promise

99
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,810
without any legal effects.

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
He can break it at any time.

101
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,050
In his case,

102
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,760
he'll only be morally condemned,

103
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,440
instead of being punished by the law.

104
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,850
What...

105
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,880
what if we're cohabiting?

106
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,850
The law protects marriage

107
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,730
rather than cohabitation.

108
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,930
Marriage

109
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,850
isn't necessarily
the result of cohabitation.

110
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,640
You...

111
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,370
you're an attorney.

112
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,760
Do you think I can sue him?

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,130
You want to put him in prison?

114
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,170
No, no.

115
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,290
That's not true.

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
I just want him to marry me.

117
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,640
Marriage is a voluntary act.

118
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,960
The law cannot force a man

119
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,610
to do what he is unwilling to do.

120
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,560
In my opinion,

121
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,000
he probably didn't want to

122
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,080
marry you in the first place.

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,520
You should have a

124
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,440
good talk with him.

125
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,820
(Xiong Fei)

126
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,520
(I tried new stuffing.)

127
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,760
(I want you to try it.)

128
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:47,880
(I'm home.)

129
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,080
(You should come over.)

130
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,880
(My brother isn't home.)

131
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,170
(Rest assured.)

132
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,080
Yuan,

133
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,130
I forgot my keys.

134
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm going to get my keys.

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,960
Where are they? I'll get them.

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,440
In my coat pocket.

137
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,130
Don't bother. I'll get them myself.

138
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,960
Yuan.

139
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,610
Yuan.

140
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,130
You're fast.

141
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,560
Thanks.

142
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,170
What else did you forget?

143
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,370
Nothing.

144
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,170
I'll go grab a coffee.

145
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,170
I'll get it for you.

146
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,250
Why are you so considerate today?

147
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,170
Wait, wait.

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,690
There must be some reason.

149
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,200
Tell me,

150
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,690
are you hiding something

151
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,490
from me?

152
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,370
You interrupted my practice.

153
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,640
Right.

154
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,200
You have new moves

155
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,000
to practice.

156
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,320
OK.

157
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,610
I won't bother you.

158
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,610
Get back to your practice.

159
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,610
Bye.

160
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,760
(I'm almost there.)

161
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,210
How do you like it?

162
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,000
Isn't it to your taste?

163
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,800
I think it tastes good.

164
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,640
Give me your opinions and I'll improve.

165
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
You think it's good?

166
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,760
Your look scared me just now.

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,250
I've decided to

168
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,730
open a steamed wonton restaurant.

169
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,450
But I have to rent a place first.

170
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,760
Why are you more anxious than me?

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,920
Are you a ghost?

172
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,370
What are you doing?

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
How did you come in?

174
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:32,610
Come on, Zhou Mingming,

175
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,730
explain to me.

176
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,680
Why do employees

177
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,880
have the obligation to create

178
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,400
a positive working atmosphere

179
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,970
for the boss?

180
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,140
(Work Regulations)

181
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,400
What are you doing?

182
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,450
Watch your words.

183
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,450
I'm your boss now.

184
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,370
How can you

185
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,000
call your boss by his name?

186
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,640
Will you explain or not?

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,090
It means

188
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,730
you have an obligation
to make me happy.

189
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:01,800
I tell you to walk eastward;

190
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,760
you can't walk westward.

191
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,570
I want you to serve tea;

192
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,850
you can't pour coffee.

193
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:06,850
I

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,210
have to serve you tea?

195
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,130
Or what?

196
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,250
You're the only employee
in the Comic Department.

197
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,330
I'm the director.

198
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,800
Do you want me to do it?

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,250
Can you get this right?

200
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm a comic author.

201
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,450
Also my employee.

202
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,400
Fine.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,040
Let's talk about it.

204
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,570
Why do you do this?

205
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,330
You can slander me in your comics,

206
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,570
but I can't be your boss.

207
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,680
Is that reasonable?

208
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,760
That's it?

209
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,880
You're really narrow-minded.

210
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,970
You'll get your wages docked

211
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,250
for bad-mouthing your boss.

212
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:39,730
You...

213
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,920
If you have more opinions,

214
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,850
go talk to Li Aiqi

215
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:42,640
and ask her to tell me.

216
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,730
Don't you think it's unseemly

217
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,520
to break into my office suddenly?

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,250
Get out!

219
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,330
Don't you think you're...

220
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,040
Are you going to start it again?

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,880
Do you want to hit me?

222
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,680
Security!

223
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,330
Security!

224
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,330
Boss, boss,

225
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,680
how dare me?

226
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Don't you think so?

227
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,800
Tell me,

228
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,330
what drink would you like?

229
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,370
I'll serve you.

230
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,330
I want a cup of latte.

231
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,040
OK.

232
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,520
Hurry up.

233
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,130
OK.

234
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:01,730
Run!

235
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,130
Wait for me.

236
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,760
Hurry up.

237
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,040
Wait for a minute.

(Consulting Room No. 2.)

The wound healed well,

254
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,280
but it may leave scars.

255
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,370
That sounds good.

256
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,970
I'll take it as a souvenir.

257
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,800
What kind of souvenir is that?

258
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,330
It means a lot to me.

259
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,640
Dr. Zhan,

260
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,450
actually, these two days,

261
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,040
I've been having a little chest pain.

262
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,640
I don't know if it's

263
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,090
some kind of sequela.

264
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,800
Let me check.

265
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,920
I'll wait for you to get off work.

266
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,640
What would you like for dinner?

267
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,400
I have to work overtime today.

268
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,040
I'll send you to work tomorrow.

269
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,490
I have a day off tomorrow.

270
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,640
Do I come at a bad time?

271
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,330
Yes.

272
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,210
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,280
You continue.

274
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,160
Continue.

275

(Scan the QR code to place order)

276
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,520
Did you just simply

277
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,730
send Luo Ben away?

278
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,850
He must blame it on me.

279
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,090
Latte?

280
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,040
No, Iced Americano.

281
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,880
Latte can no longer

282
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
urge me to work hard.

283
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,250
Yeah.

284
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,970
You've been overworking recently.

285
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,250
You have five or six
surgeries every day.

286
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,800
At this rate,

287
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,850
you'll soon

288
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,090
become great.

289
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not the one working the hardest.

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,130
Cai Yuxiao is.

291
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,450
He wouldn't exchange a day off recently.

292
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,680
He eats and sleeps in the hospital,

293
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,570
working days and nights.

294
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,330
I know

295
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,000
he's been doing this for you.

296
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,400
He's irritated.

297
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,920
I've made it clear to him.

298
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,880
I don't want him to do this.

299
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,880
But,

300
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:54,920
Cai Yuxiao

301
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,330
is an aspirant man.

302
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,450
Maybe

303
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,850
after he became the
Associate Chief Physician,

304
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,760
he's more demanding of himself.

305
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,520
You

306
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,800
shouldn't take it as a burden.

307
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,040
Thanks.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,920
Please enjoy.

309
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,520
By the way,

310
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,610
do you

311
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,400
have any progress with Luo Ben?

312
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,570
Why do you keep it secret from me?

313
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,040
I can see it myself.

314
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,490
He expressed his feelings to me.

315
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,760
He did?

316
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,970
Then why have you been

317
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,280
avoiding him recently?

318
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,250
I have no idea...

319
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,250
I don't know why.

320
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,920
Actually, I used to hate him.

321
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,040
But now,

322
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,520
I can't tell

323
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,520
whether I'm moved by him,

324
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,160
or really like him.

325
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,210
Well,

326
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,330
you should figure it out.

327
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:00,680
Come on,

328
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,920
let me, the love expert,

329
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,850
diagnose for you.

330
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,970
Will you cooperate?

331
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,160
Sure.

332
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,160
Since when

333
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,850
did you think

334
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,160
he wasn't that annoying?

335
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,920
Dr. Zhan,

336
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,490
have you ever tried Sand-surfing?

337
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,160
Yes, why?

338
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,880
Hold me tight.

339
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,130
♪ Behind each door
are different emotions ♪

340
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,040
Since when did you feel

341
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,210
he was a little lovely?

342
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,330
What are we doing here?

343
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Whenever I feel

344
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,570
troubled,

345
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,490
I'll come here to sing songs.

346
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,960
So you brought me here
to sing songs?

347
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,290

You're diagnosed.

is the lowest price.

386
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,570
You should think about it again.

387
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,130
What's wrong?

388
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,810
Bun-bun,

389
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:33,610

Yeah, come on.

All bark and no bite.

415
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:36,480
Give us a demo.

416

Brat, do you look down upon me?

- No, no.
- Fine.

418
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,610
Put them down.

419

Come.

Let me give you a demo.

Come.

You guys,

423

What's wrong, Falcon?

431
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,050
Nothing.

432
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,480
I just remember

433
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,770
I haven't fed Bun-bun.

434
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,720
Come on, give me a hand.

435
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,290
Come on, guys.

436
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,920
Come.

437
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,130
OK, you've seen it clearly.

438
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,530
Put it down.

439
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,680
Practice more.

440
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,400
OK.

441
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,290
Give Bun-bun some tasty food.

442
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,610
Bun-bun.

443
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,640
It doesn't matter.

00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,050
Bun-bun.

445
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,130
Good buddies

446
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,370
share their food.

447
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,960
I'll eat meat

448
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,090
and you eat the bone.

449
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,610
Come on, Bun-bun.

450
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:15,880
Here.

451
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,640
Falcon,

452
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,240
you just started to restore your health.

453
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,480
Can you eat such food?

454
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
I have no choice.

455
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,010
This is my favorite.

456
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,290
Moreover,

457
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,010
life is short.

458
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,610
If you're not allowed to

459
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,570
eat your favorite food,

460
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,770
it will be boring.

461
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,130
The training ground
is buzzing with activity.

462
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:38,770
Shall I

463
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,130
accompany you to have a look?

464
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm fine here.

465
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
My brother Bun-bun is
keeping me company.

466
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:49,010
Do you feel sorry for me

467
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,370
and come here to accompany me specially?

468
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,370
There's no need.

469
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,920
Bun-bun and I

470
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,050
are enjoying the view here.

471
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,090
We're satisfied.

472
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,920
OK,

473
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,880
let me stay here with you

474
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
and get satisfied.

475
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,290
Is your wound healed?

476
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,010
It's OK.

477
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:16,440
Yan has revised her opinion of you.

478
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,090
You should seize the opportunity,

479
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,920
and strike while the iron is hot.

480
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,680
I'll adapt to the change.

481
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,680
Look at you.

482
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,050
This is not

483
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,010
what you should say.

484
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,570
You shouldn't learn from me

485
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,810
and be disorganized, undisciplined,

486
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,010
free and unrestrained.

487
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Additionally,

488
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,720
you're the father.

489
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,530
She is your daughter.

490
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,850
As her father,

491
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,370
you have the responsibility
and obligation

492
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,440
to open your daughter's heart.

493
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:47,960
OK.

494
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,130
I'll try.

495
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,330
What about you?

496
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:54,960
What about me?

497
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,720
How long has it been

498
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,880
since you last saw Yulian?

499
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,050
You should also

500
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:03,050
open Yulian's heart.

501
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,440
It's also your responsibility.

502
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,400
Say something.

503
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,200
I get it.

504
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,050
Bun-bun.

505
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,960
Don't you eat? Are you full?

506
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,240
Come here.

507
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:24,960
Hello, Falcon.

508
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,370
Brat,

509
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:27,920
are you free?

510
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,640
Let's have a cup of tea.

511
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
I'll send you the address.

512
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,570
OK.

513
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,010
Didn't you

514
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,440
want to quit the rescue team?

515
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,880
Why did you change your mind?

516
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,400
To make money.

517
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,720
Could rescue make money?

518
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,770
It's hard to say.

519
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,610
Just in case.

520
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,680
What's the good of making so much money?

521
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,530
You can't take it with you when you die.

522
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,530
At least when I'm alive,

523
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,960
I don't have to worry about it.

524
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,370
Greedy.

525
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,440
If nothing else,

526
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,720
take the tea for example,

527
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,290
is there any difference between

528
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,720
a pot of tea that's worth 500 yuan

529
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
and that's worth 5 yuan?

530
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,440
You drink it in

531
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,530
and then you piss.

532
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,530
Nothing leaves in the end.

533
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,810
If you spend 500 yuan

534
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,770
on a household first-aid kit,

535
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,920
it may

536
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,770
save several lives.

537
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,160
You're always talking about

538
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,240
your work.

539
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,960
Occupational habit.

540
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,440
Tell me,

541
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,330
what can I do for you?

542
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,810
That's your occupational habit.

543
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,200
Get straight to the point.

544
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,920
Do me a favor.

545
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,400
I want to give my house

546
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,770
to my ex-wife.

547
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,480
May I ask a question?

548
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,090
Of course,

549
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,370
before I formally

550
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,370
handle your case,

551
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,810
you can choose not to answer.

552
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:09,770
Go ahead.

553
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,850
I've never heard you

554
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,330
mention your family before.

555
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,200
Why do you suddenly

556
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,330
want to give your house to your ex-wife?

557
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:23,770
You wanna know?

558
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,720
OK.

559
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,090
I'll tell you all of it.

560
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,440
It was

561
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,770
a long time ago.

562
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,090
Where should I start?

563
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Oh, dear,

564
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,480
something is wrong. Hurry!

565
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,640
Why is she doing that?

566
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,880
I live in the building.

567
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,680
Come down.

568
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,290
Yeah, come down.

569
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,370
Don't do this.

570
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,850
Don't take things to heart.

571
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,370
She seems to be my neighbor upstairs.

572
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,200
Go.

573
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,920
Come down.

574
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,290
Step back. Don't come over.

575
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,370
Calm down, will you?

576
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,810
Let's go back and talk, OK?

577
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,050
Zhu Pengfei,

578
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,810
I've been with you

579
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:08,680
for so many years.

580
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,770
Why?

581
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,200
Why don't you marry me?

582
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,090
I don't mean it.

583
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,200
I...

584
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,480
I think it's enough that

585
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,400
we're happy together.

586
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,130
Why do we need a certificate?

587
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,160
Don't you love me anymore?

588
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,010
Yes, I do.

589
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,850
From the beginning,

590
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:24,920
I've never planned to get married.

591
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,240
A couple may break up
even after they get married.

592
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,610
That's what my parents did.

593
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:28,770
You lied to me!

594
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,720
- You lied to me.
- Jenny.

595
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,770
Jenny, don't be excited.

596
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,090
I beg you. Will you come down?

597
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,530
I'm on my knees, OK?

598
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,370
Come down first.

599
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,090
Zhu Pengfei, get up!

600
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:43,680
Get up!

601
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,680
I won't!

602
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,200
Go back with me, OK?

603
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,720
Stop making a scene.

604
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,480
You never meant what you said.

605
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,160
Let me do it.

606
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,290
I'll never believe you again.

607
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,290
Do as Zhan Yan said.

608
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,160
Let me do it.

609
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
I'll protect you.

610
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,050
OK.

611
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,240
Stay safe.

612
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,240
OK.

613
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,090
You go to persuade her.

614
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
We'll find a chance to save her.

615
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Am I not good enough to you?

616
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,810
Me?

617
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:16,610
Calm down.

618
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,810
They're up there.

619
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,570
Hurry. Go upstairs quickly!

620
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:27,330
Stop watching!

621
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,330
Hurry up, step back.

622
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,160
You'd rather get down on your knees

623
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
than marry me,

624
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,530
wouldn't you, Zhu Pengfei?

625
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,610
I'll marry you.

626
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,330
I'll marry you.

627
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,400
Let's go get
the marriage certificate now,

628
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,130
- OK?
- Neighbor

629
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,480
upstairs,

630
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,090
would you calm down?

631
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,010
Go away!

632
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:40,440
No.

633
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,370
It's none of your business!

634
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,240
Go away!

635
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,640
Miss, listen to me.

636
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,330
I've been cheated by a man too.

637
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,200
Would you like to hear more from me?

638
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,880
At that time,

639
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,240
I tried to
make a big thing out of it too.

640
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,440
But after that,

641
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,770
I regretted it immediately.

642
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,850
Think about it.

643
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,920
There are so many people who love you.

644
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,440
I admit it's my problem.

645
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:00,850
I was wrong.

646
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,720
I'll mend my ways, OK?

647
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,400
You...

648
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,480
Jenny.

649
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,850
Zhu Pengfei,

650
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,610
I'll let you regret it
for the rest of your life!

651
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,090
Jenny!

652
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,130
Jenny!

653
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,720
She really jumped!

654
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:21,200
Jenny!

655
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:24,850
He caught her!

656
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,640
Hold tight!

657
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,920
Let go of me!

658
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,640
Don't move!

659
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:32,200
- Don't save me. Let me die!
- Don't move!

660
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
If you move again, we'll both die.

661
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,720
Let go of me!

662
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,010
Catch hold of it!

663
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,090
Help us!

664
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,810
Pull hard.

665
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,370
Harder!

666
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:20,920
Are you OK?

667
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,400
Jenny, are you all right?

668
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,130
Look. Look at me.

669
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,400
Are you OK?

670
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,570
Jenny.

671
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,880
It was all your fault!

672
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,480
Yes, I was wrong.

673
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,850
Don't do this again.

674
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,240
I saved her.

675
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,200
Why are you so silly?

676
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:39,960
You really jumped down.

677
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,240
How could you jump down?

678
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:45,850
Falcon.

679
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:50,920
Falcon!

680
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,100
(Outpatient)

681
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,850
He's still in surgery.

682
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
I don't know about his situation.

683
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,570
How's it going, Captain?

684
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,680
Still in surgery.

685
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,890
You know he's ill.

686
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:19,970
Why did you let him

687
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,760
take part in the rescue?

688
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,930
Dapeng,

689
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,720
you know Falcon's temper.

690
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,610
Don't blame this on Luo Ben!

691
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,360
No.

692
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,800
It was my fault.

693
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,410
It was all my fault.

694
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:43,490
I didn't fasten the knot.

695
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:46,720
I beg your pardon?

696
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,530
It was you!

697
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,640
Dapeng, calm down.

698
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,160
You're still as opinionated

699
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,840
as you were in training!

700
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,800
Dapeng.

701
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:53,800
Captain!

702
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,760
Let go.

703
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,680
We're in the hospital.

704
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,720
What are you doing?

705
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:02,720
I'll tell you what,

706
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:04,930
if something happens to Falcon,

707
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,010
I won't let you off!

708
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,010
20 units of RBC.

709
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,970
Prepare to stitch.

710
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:57,680
Zhan Yan,

711
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,090
if we don't compulsorily stitch,

712
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,720
he can't even get off the table.

713
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,490
Prepare to stitch.

714
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,450
Quickly.

715
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:35,780
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

716
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,320
How did the surgery go?

717
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,970
During surgery,

718
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,450
the rupture of the hemangioma

719
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,800
caused massive bleeding.

720
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,930
Blood flushed into his abdominal cavity

721
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,490
and resulted in shock.

722
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,050
The tumor wasn't removed.

723
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,320
He doesn't have much time left.

724
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,460
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

725
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,530
Have some food.

726
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,970
Disaster often occurs
beyond expectation.

727
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,490
Beyond expectation,

728
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,160
there may be other accidents.

729
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
We don't want to see them

730
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,090
or want them to happen.

731
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,200
But we still have to face them

732
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,760
and take them on.

733
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,050
But some accidents

734
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,680
make people

735
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,090
pay too heavy a price.

736
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,570
We have to take them on too.

737
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,280
This is the meaning

738
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,970
of life.

739
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,160
Falcon,

740
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,090
the girl we saved

741
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,720
said she wanted to thank you.

742
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,050
You must get better soon.

743
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,050
And don't you

744
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,050
let her down.

745
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,200
I must thank you too.

746
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:39,800
If you hadn't

747
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,840
tried so hard to pull me up,

748
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,360
I might have fallen and died.

749
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,720
Falcon.

750
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,490
Falcon.

751
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,090
Are you awake?

752
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,840
How do you feel?

753
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,680
Slowly. Slowly.

754
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,490
Why

755
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,840
would the first person I saw

756
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,680
always be you

757
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,970
whenever I woke up?

758
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,970
Because we have a bond.

759
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,760
Daddy Fan.

760
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:28,890
Are you awake?

761
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:31,890
Listen to Dr. Zhan.

762
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,050
Don't talk or move.

763
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,200
Save your strength and have a good rest.

764
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,010
How is he?

765
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,570
Rest assured.

766
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,800
I won't die.

767
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,840
I

768
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,360
am waiting to attend your wedding.

769
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm going to change your dressing.

770
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,570
Have a good rest.

771
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,010
Zhan Yan,

772
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,570
Falcon woke up.

773
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,720
Does that mean

774
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,890
he's turning better?

775
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,050
He's in a bad condition.

776
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,490
We must watch over him without leaving.

777
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:22,800
Well...

778
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,200
Well.

779
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,890
Isn't there any other way?

780
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,760
I want to save him
more than anyone else.

781
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,570
I've tried everything I can.

782
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,640
But I'm a doctor,

783
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,360
not a god.

784
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,930
Did Yan

785
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,530
say how much time I had left?

786
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,490
Don't be ridiculous.

787
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,050
She said as long as you woke up,

788
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,360
you would be fine.

789
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,450
Don't lie to me.

790
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm aware of

791
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,970
my own illness.

792
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,240
I got you into trouble.

793
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,010
Don't say that.

794
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,720
We saved

795
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,680
that girl together.

796
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,320
I should thank you.

797
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,680
Enough.

798
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:48,490
You just woke up.

799
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,840
You need more rest.

800
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,930
I don't have

801
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,280
another chance to say

802
00:42:57,130 --> 00:42:59,130
if I don't say it now.

803
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,680
Do you want to

804
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,570
listen to my gab more?

805
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,360
