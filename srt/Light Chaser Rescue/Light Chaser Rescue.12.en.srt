Congratulations,
Associate Chief Physician.

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,930
Yan,

30
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,720
I think

31
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,160
the leadership's decision this time

32
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,810
is somewhat seniority oriented.

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,090
I assume

34
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:21,690
they think I've been

35
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,930
working here longer than you do.

36
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,970
Don't be modest.

37
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,760
Your performance
is approved by everyone.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,810
You deserve it.

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:29,720
OK.

40
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,130
So, I'm one step ahead.

41
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,560
You'll

42
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,840
follow up.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,160
Don't wait for me,

44
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,160
or I'll catch up and surpass you.

45
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,810
I hope you'll do that.

46
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,040
See you.

47
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,720
Dr. Cai.

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,410
Zhan Yan.

49
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,970
Is everything all right?

50
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,130
Could anything be wrong?

51
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,280
If you feel wronged,

52
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
you can tell us.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,690
Am I that kind of person
who can't afford to lose?

54
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,880
You admit defeat
but won't give in to it.

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,690
Why do you ask if you know?

56
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,210
I...

57
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,090
Can you talk properly?

58
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,440
What's wrong with me?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,490
You don't have to rub it in.

60
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
I did it for her own good.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,090
I can't reason with you.

62
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,880
Was I wrong about anything?

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,370
Thanks.

64
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,720
Here, coffee.

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,760
OK. Thanks.

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,000
Congratulations.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Good things come in pairs.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,530
Why did you say so?

69
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,210
First,

70
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,160
you're Associate Chief Physician now.

71
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:38,840
Second,

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,720
you'll lead the team personally to

73
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,970
attend Fengxi reconstruction meeting,

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,320
which Zhan Yan will also attend.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,410
By the time,

76
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,280
the two of you

77
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,250
can have some time alone.

78
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,410
You should be well prepared.

79
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,040
When you come back,

80
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,370
you both can declare
to start a relationship.

81
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,560
Good things indeed come in pairs.

82
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,720
Are you making up stories?

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,130
How could it be so easy?

84
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't you pretend in front of me.

85
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,810
Those of the whole hospital

86
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,440
knowing that you once

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,530
went out with Zhan Yan in college,

88
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,210
is... is...

89
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,560
me alone,

90
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,040
right?

91
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,840
I've thought it through.

92
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,280
When the two of you

93
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,440
declare to be in a relationship,

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,560
I must unveil the secret of the century.

95
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
I've kept it to myself for too long.

96
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,840
I can't hold it anymore.

97
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,000
You'd better not waste time

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and seize the opportunity,

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,840
or Zhan Yan

100
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,040
would be stolen by other men.

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Enough,

102
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,520
don't be impatient.

103
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,490
I know what I should do.

104
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,490
Shouldn't you be impatient?

105
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,000
It concerns the happiness of your life.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,760
Why don't you be impatient?

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,290
You should think it over.

108
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,080
I almost lost my temper.

109
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
All right. Tonight,

110
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,880
we'll celebrate your promotion.

111
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm going to organize the party

112
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,000
and you'll pay the bills.

113
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,810
No problem.

114
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
Well, I've got something to do.

115
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,560
I have to go.

116
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,960
You must invite Zhan Yan.

117
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,810
- Welcome.
- Yan, here.

118
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,440
Yan.

119
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,730
Today, Cong Zhou

120
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,810
and several other colleagues

121
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,810
are here to celebrate with me.

122
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,850
Would you mind?

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,200
You're the major role today.

124
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,320
Don't mind me.

125
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,250
OK.

126
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,960
Come.

127
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,000
Here you come.

128
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,560
Sorry.

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,760
Come, sit here.

130
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,490
I don't think it's appropriate.

131
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
It's just a dinner party.

132
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,400
Don't think too much.

133
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,290
Come on, sit.

134
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,050
Hurry up. Sit down.

135
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,560
Sit down.

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,320
I'm starving.

137
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,760
Sorry, I'm late.

138
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,810
Today,

139
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,520
you can order whatever

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,250
you like.

141
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,520
Don't save money for me.

142
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,170
Decent.

143
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,690
The Associate Chief Physician
is really different.

144
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,400
Generous.

145
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,690
What are you talking about?

146
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,640
Wasn't I generous before I

147
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,560
turned Associate Chief Physician?

148
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,250
I just want you to

149
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,170
get more promotions.

150
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,000
Then we can scrounge

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
more free meals off him,

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,400
right?

153
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't think you want free meals,

154
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,930
instead, you want to ride his coattails.

155
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,640
Whose coattails?

156
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,490
Your coattails.

157
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,170
Enough.

158
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,170
You're late.

159
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,760
Come on.

160
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
You must drink as a forfeit.

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,440
OK.

162
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
Come on.

163
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
Come, Dr. Zhan.

164
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,730
Dr. Zhan can't drink.

165
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,960
I'll drink for her.

166
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,000
You're so biased.

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,810
Absolutely biased.

168
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,320
It's a bit much.

169
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,930
Dr. Zhan,

170
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,250
today is Dr. Cai's big day.

171
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,610
Wouldn't you say something?

172
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,810
I have a surgery tomorrow morning.

173
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,130
Let me substitute juice for wine.

174
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,050
You're not

175
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,370
the only doctor in our hospital.

176
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,200
It's easy for Dr. Cai to transfer

177
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,760
the shift for you, right?

178
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,320
No.

179
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,130
We can have fun at the party.

180
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,690
But the rules and regulations
must be complied with.

181
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,760
Dr. Zhan has a surgery tomorrow.

182
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
She can't drink.

183
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,250
What about this,

184
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,370
I don't have a shift tomorrow.

185
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,130
Let me drink for her.

186
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,130
And I'll drink as much as you ask me to.

187
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,730
What do you say?

188
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,490
Then let's drink to our heart's content.

189
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:54,080
You promised.

190
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,690
Come on.

191
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,490
Let's drink for Dr. Cai.

192
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,520
Come on.

193
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,000
Come on.

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,690
Congratulations.

195
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,610
Congratulations.

196
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,730
Thanks, everyone. Thanks.

197
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,810
Dr. Cai has no problem.

198
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,690
He definitely has no problem.

199
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,050
You just need to ride his coattails.

200
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,250
Can you drop coattails?

201
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,050
Here.

202
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,250
Why hasn't Dr. Cai

203
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,400
returned from the bathroom?

204
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,320
Hurry. We'll drink with him.

205
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,640
Don't mind him.

206
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,760
Let's drink on our own.

207
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,050
Come on. Drink.

208
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,960
Pour. Pour.

209
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,000
To Dr. Cai.

210
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,760
I got to leave now.

211
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,370
It isn't fun at all

212
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,250
drinking on our own.

213
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,050
We must drink to Dr. Cai,

214
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,560
right?

215
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,400
Come back later.

216
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,050
Take it slowly.

217
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,320
Zhan Yan.

218
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,640
Let's not drink up.

219
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,610
Let's not. I can't do it again.

220
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Are you going to leave?

221
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,730
I'll perform the first operation
tomorrow morning.

222
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,200
OK.

223
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,690
Let me walk you out.

224
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,320
They're really boisterous.

225
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,320
I know

226
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,490
you don't like such occasions.

227
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,370
Don't mind.

228
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,640
They're happy for you.

229
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,640
You've always stressed that

230
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,490
we have a fair competition.

231
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,960
This time, the hospital

232
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,290
made me

233
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,730
the Associate Chief Physician.

234
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,930
Would you be unhappy?

235
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,370
No.

236
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,490
If the decision was made

237
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,130
merely on professional skills,

238
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,880
I wouldn't be convinced.

239
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,000
But in general,

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,170
you're more suitable than me.

241
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,560
I'm sincerely convinced.

242
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,370
Congratulations.

243
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm glad you think so.

244
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,370
Two people help each other forward

245
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,000
and make progress together.

246
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,610
I think

247
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
it's the

248
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,760
best state.

249
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,930
What do you say?

250
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,000
The taxi is coming.

251
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,130
OK.

252
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,680
Let me open the door.

253
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,970
Go back.

254
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,970
OK.

255
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,090
Bye.

256
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,250
Bye.

Dr. Zhan.

259
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,000
What a coincidence.

260
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,640
Are you here to attend the meeting too?

261
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,640
We are the counterpart support unit

for the post-disaster reconstruction
of the hospital in Fengxi.

What are you doing here?

Fangqin Group

265
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,970
donated a batch of medical equipment.

266
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,520
I come here on their behalf

267
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,490
for the handover.

Captain Qingshan,

270
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,210
you're here.

271
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,730
Mr. Luo, so are you.

272
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,210
Mr. Fang specifically asked me

273
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,370
to express his appreciation to you.

274
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,800
What for?

275
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,370
You helped us to

276
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,330
train the enterprise rescue team,

277
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,520
which helped a lot

278
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,800
in our financing negotiations.

279
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,970
I didn't expect that.

280
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,160
Thanks.

281
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,250
Let's go.

282
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,760
Go.

283
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,490
According to the unified deployment
of the central government,

284
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,130
the post-disaster reconstruction

285

and hospitals

289
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,400
are the key points.

(Liu Wenbin, Director of Provincial
Emergency Management Office)

291
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,640
The reconstruction of the

292
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,210
government-funded Fengxi Hospital

293
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,130
will be completed
by the end of this year.

294
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,610
By then,

295
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,850
a large number

296
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,040

will be arriving in batches.

Now the most urgent task

301
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,850
is to organically combine

302
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,610
the timing of

303
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,090
talent introduction and cultivation

304
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,330

Yan,

308
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,880
you came too.

309
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,850
I was assigned by the hospital.

310
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,160
Yan,

311
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,570
I saw that Dr. Cai

312
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,920
is very concerned about you.

313
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,280
What are you trying to say?

314
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,400
I know

315
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
you've known each other for years

316
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,570
and you're colleagues.

317
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,520
But a friend can't necessarily

318
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
be your family.

319
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,330
You should know him more.

320
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,640
It's none of your business.

321
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,210
I am telling you this for your good.

322
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,680
Would you cook for us tonight?

323
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:47,920
Of course.

324
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,800
Twice cooked pork?

325
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:49,730
Too greasy.

326
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,250
Ribs?

327
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,730
Why did they...

328
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,680
Didn't we agree to go to

329
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,160
the Xishan Homestay together?

330
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,520
Why did they go first?

331
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:58,130
Yeah.

332
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,570
If I didn't stop you,

333
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,250
you would've been the third wheel.

334
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,450
What do you mean?

335
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,850
Xiaolu,

336
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,610
it doesn't matter
that you have poor eyesight,

337
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,330
but it matters
that you can't take the hint.

338
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,920
What did you say, Cong?

339
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,570
Why can't I take the hint?

340
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,040
Can't you see it?

341
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,640
Dr. Cai has arrangements.

342
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,610
What arrangements?

343
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,800
Enough.

344
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,130
Don't make more trouble.

345
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,610
Let's go to the market

346
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,330
and buy some food.

347
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,450
We'll go to the homestay later.

348
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,450
Let's celebrate

349
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,370
in Xishan.

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:24,800
OK.

351
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,640
Let's go.

352
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,130
Go.

353
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,280
Go.

354
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,280
If we knew earlier,

355
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,880
we shouldn't go back today.

356
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,850
The Xishan Homestay

357
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,370
they booked is said to be nice.

358
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,610
There are single houses

359
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,970
with a view of mountains.

360
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,250
Watch out.

361
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,040
Come in.

362
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,680
Your clothes are wet.

363
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,210
Go upstairs and get changed.

364
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,570
OK.

365
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,610
Come down.

366
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,880
Zhan Yan,

367
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,160
I wanted to tell you something,

368
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,490
but I wasn't ready before.

369
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,520
Today,

370
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
I think it's time.

371
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,730
Go ahead.

372
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,730
When we were in college,

373
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,280
we really

374
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,250
had a good time.

375
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,570
Back then,

376
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,920
people all thought

377
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,850
we were the best matched.

378
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,450
I looked forward to

379
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,280
marrying you soon after

380
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,800
you graduated.

381
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,250
But I didn't expect that

382
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,330
you would break up with me

383
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,640
before we graduated.

384
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,970
That's enough.

385
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,330
Please let me finish.

386
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,040
You told me

387
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,970
we were not suitable for each other.

388
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,450
But I knew

389
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,970
it was because of your parents.

390
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,490
I know what you're afraid of.

391
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
You're afraid of marriage.

392
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,130
You're afraid that

393
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,330
we won't be sincere
with each other in marriage.

394
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,730
So,

395
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,570
I don't want to force you.

396
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,370
You don't want our previous relationship

397
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,520
to be public in the hospital.

398
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,970
I respect your wishes.

399
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,760
But, Zhan Yan,

400
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,880
I want to say,

401
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,160
I have been

402
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,250
and will always

403
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,160
be there for you.

404
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,000
I hope one day,

405
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,850
you'll feel completely

406
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,280
secure with me,

407
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,000
and accept me wholeheartedly.

408
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,210
For that day,

409
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,130
I've been working hard.

410
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,490
Through hard work,

411
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,640
I became an Associate Chief Physician

412
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,760
and bought a condo

413
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,970
nearby the hospital.

414
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,680
I want you to believe

415
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,280
that I'll give you a home,

416
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,610
happiness,

417
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,330
and a sense of security.

418
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,970
I'm ready now.

419
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,040
Zhan Yan,

420
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,250
will you accept me again?

421
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,400
Thanks for

422
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,570
telling me this.

423
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,730
When I told you
we were not suitable for each other,

424
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I meant it.

425
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,640
Now,

426
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,160
I have to tell you the same.

427
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,640
I'm really sorry.

428
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,280
But in my heart,

429
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,400
you'll always be

430
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,210
a respectable senior.

431
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,400
Zhan Yan.

432
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:51,880
Actually,

433
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,450
if you didn't choose me,

434
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:54,880
your sincerity

435
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,250
and efforts

436
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,370
would have been admired.

437
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,850
But you chose the wrong woman.

438
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,640
It doesn't matter.

439
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,610
I've been waiting for seven years.

440
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,370
I'll keep waiting.

441
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,880
Don't rush to any decision.

442
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,090
I just hope after today,

443
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,770
you would seriously consider

444
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,680
what I've said,

445
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,920
OK?

446
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,720
They should be here soon.

447
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,400
I saw there was a wine cellar.

448
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,920
I'm going to choose wine.

449
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,130
(Yuxiao)

450
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,240
(Did it go well?)

451
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,090
(We are now ready to return)

452
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,440
Landslide!

453
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,370
Zhan Yan, a landslide!

454
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,610
Zhan Yan!

455
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,810
Zhan Yan!

456
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,440
Run!

457
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,400
Zhan Yan.

458
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,050
Zhan Yan.

459
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,920
Zhan Yan.

460
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,480
Zhan...

461
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,770
Zhan Yan.

462
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,530
Let me help.

463
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Hang in there, Zhan Yan.

464
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,050
The landslide comes again!

465
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,130
Zhan Yan.

466
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,440
It's not an option.

467
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm going to find help.

468
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,480
Zhan Yan!

469
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,610
(Rebuild Home After the Earthquake)
I asked you to stay

470
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,920
to discuss the secondary disasters

471
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
that may occur

472
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,370
during the reconstruction.

473
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,570
The Armed Police and Fire Force

474
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:27,810
both lack hands,

475
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,570
especially in the critical period
of reconstruction.

476
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,680
Recently, affected by typhoons,

477
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,960
secondary disasters

478
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,010
such as rainstorms, floods, debris flow

479
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,010
and landslides occur frequently

480
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,010
in Fengxi area.

481
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,200
I hope that your team

482
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,090
will assist us in the follow-up work

483
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,720
of disaster relief.

484
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,570
I see.

485
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Please feel free

486
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,850
to assign us any tasks.

487
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,640
The Light Chaser Rescue

488
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,010
will do its best to assist.

489
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,010
Thanks, Captain Qingshan.

490
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,680
I have to take this.

491
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,240
Cai Yuxiao, what's up?

492
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,960
I'm with Zhan Yan,

493
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,480
in Xishan Homestay.

494
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,810
She's buried, Mr. Zhan.

495
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhan.

496
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,770
I didn't protect Zhan Yan.

497
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,240
Send me your location right away.

498
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,920
It seems

499
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
we have to wait
till the rain slows down a bit

500
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,610
before we go.

501
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,640
By the way,

502
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,200
we're not far from the Xishan Homestay.

503
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:30,880
We're

504
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,960
afraid of disturbing Dr. Zhan and the others,

505
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,240
otherwise, we may as well

506
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,960
go grab a cup of coffee.

507
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,530
Here's an emergency

508
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,570
traffic newsflash.

509
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,400
A landslide hit Xishan

510
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:41,960
and a homestay was buried.

511
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,400
Please pay attention when you

512
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,200
pass by Xishan.

513
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,640
Please pay attention when you...

514
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,130
Xishan Homestay.

515
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,010
...pass by Xishan.

516
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:50,940
(Zhan Yan)

517
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,130
(The subscriber you dialed)

518
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,010
(is not answered now.)

519
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,640
It isn't answered.

520
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,290
I'll contact her colleagues.

521
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,850
Hello, Dr. Cai,

522
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,770
I'm Ai Rui'er.

523
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,290
I heard

524
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,530
the news of the landslide in Xishan.

525
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,440
Are you OK?

526
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,370
Zhan Yan...

527
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,010
Zhan Yan is buried.

528
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,480
Zhan Yan!

529
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,610
Zhan Yan!

530
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,640
Zhan Yan!

531
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Zhan Yan!

532
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,370
Zhan Yan!

533
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,440
Yan,

534
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,640
the air content

535
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,010
in a 3 m high,

536
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,960
100 ㎡ house

537
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,920
is 30,000 liters.

538
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,920
The oxygen content

539
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,480
accounts for 21%.

540
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,010
If the oxygen content

541
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,810
reduces to less than 18 percent,

542
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,290
people will suffocate.

543
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,020
(Light Chaser Rescue)
OK.

544
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,850
OK. OK.

545
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,700
The road is slippery.

546
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,580
Please pay attention and

547
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,500
get to the accident location

548
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,100
as soon as possible.

549
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,300
Director.

550
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:04,820
Captain.

551
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,540
This is the architectural structure

552
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,740
of the homestay.

553
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,620
The house has

554
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,620
four floors on the ground

555
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,300
and one basement.

556
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,260
We can see from the structure,

557
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,580
the area of the basement

558
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,740
is 120 ㎡.

559
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,620
Apart from the area occupied by

560
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,380
furniture and other things,

561
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,020
considering the influx of mud,

562
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,020
when she's in a calm state,

563
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,540
we have about six hours

564
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,500
to rescue her.

565
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,020
Theoretically,

566
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,220
an adult needs

567
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,700
10,000 liters of air every day.

568
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,180
If an adult

569
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,940
is trapped in a closed room

570
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,460
of 100 ㎡,

571
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,460
the air inside is enough

572
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,180
for him to survive for three days.

573
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,300
But his demand for oxygen

574
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,300
is completely different

575
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,100
when he is in a nervous

576
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,500
and anxious state

577
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,740
from when he's

578
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,100
in a calm state.

579
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,820
Once people are trapped,

580
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,780
they tend to be afraid, desperate,

581
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,860
and agitated.

582
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,340
Then three days of survival

583
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,860
will shorten to a half.

584
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,500
Yes.

585
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,700
Yes.

586
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,300
So,

587
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,020
no matter what happens,

588
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,380
you shouldn't panic.

589
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,980
Use whatever you can get

590
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,820
to save yourself

591
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,700
until rescue arrives.

592
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,780
Hold on till the last moment.

593
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,580
If the space is smaller,

594
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,340
or there are other

595
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,340
uncertainties,

596
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,380
we may only have two or three hours.

597
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,820
How much longer before we arrive?

598
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,020
At the current speed,

599
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,220
it takes around 20 minutes.

600
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,260
Zhan Yan!

601
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,180
Zhan Yan!

602
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,100
No answer.

603
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,860
We don't know what happened to Dr. Zhan.

604
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,620
Zhan Yan!

605
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,300
Zhan Yan!

606
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,500
Dr. Zhan.

607
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,380
Let me get in and check on her.

608
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Rocks may fall.

609
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,500
It's too dangerous now.

610
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,460
It's more dangerous in there.

611
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,300
Why don't you wait for the rescue team?

612
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,300
I'm with the rescue team.

613
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,180
Don't get in.

614
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,180
What if rocks fall?

615
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,300
What if it collapses inside?

616
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,180
What if another landslide comes?

617
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,620
Aren't you afraid of death?

618
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,940
Ai Rui'er.

619
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,260
If anything happens,

620
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,780
take care of Luo Yuan for me.

621
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,780
No!

622
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,500
Zhan Yan,

623
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,780
Luo Ben went down to save you!

624
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,300
You should get in there.

625
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,740
You coward!

626
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,780
That's easy for you to say.

627
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,700
If Luo Ben is trapped inside,

628
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,100
are you capable of saving him?

629
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,780
Do you know anything about rescue?

630
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,220
Zhan Yan.

631
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,220
Zhan Yan.

632
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,260
Zhan Yan.

633
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,220
Zhan Yan.

634
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,940
Zhan Yan.

635
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,220
Don't talk.

636
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,380
Let me take you out.

637
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,220
Go.

638
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,780
Legs.

639
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,700
Hang in there.

640
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,780
How are you?

641
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,780
Are your legs OK?

642
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,860
Hang in there.

643
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,380
I'll take you out.

644
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,620
Come.

645
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,500
Come.

646
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,820
Slowly.

647
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,540
There's another landslide.

648
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,940
There's another landslide.

649
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,540
Luo Ben.

650
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,780
- Run, Luo Ben!
- Come out!

651
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,220
- Landslide!
- Come out now.

652
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,980
- Come out! Come out!
- Ai Rui'er.

653
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,780
Run!

654
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,620
Watch out!

655
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,020
Zhan Yan!

656
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,300
(Geological Disaster Monitoring
and Warning System)

657
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,740
A second landslide hit Xishan.

658
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,540
Here.

659
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,180
Fill out this form.

660
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,380
Write here.

661
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,580
Why are you here?

662
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,140
(I was passing by.)

663
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,540
I was passing by.

664
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,500
There's a lot of traffic

665
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,100
and it's not safe.

666
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,020
Don't come again

667
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,020
if there isn't anything.

668
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,700
Why are you avoiding me?

669
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Did I do something

670
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,300
that upset you?

671
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,540
Of course not.

672
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,340
There are lots of parcels
during the holiday.

673
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,380
I'm a little busy.

674
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:18,860
Last time when you took the children

675
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,020
to visit the team,

676
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,740
I wanted to be there.

677
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:28,940
It doesn't matter.

678
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,220
I understand.

679
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,580
I gotta go.

680
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,620
Anything else?

681
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,780
(News said Luo Ben and Zhan Yan
were trapped during a landslide.)

682
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,780
Luo Yuan,

683
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,940
your brother is in danger.

684
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,940
Sit tight.

685
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,860
(Here comes the latest
traffic information.)

686
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:35,860
(A second landslide)

687
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,100
(hit Xishan.)

688
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,820
(Please pay attention when you)

689
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,620
(pass by Xishan.)

690
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,180
(Please pay attention when you)

691
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,140
(pass by Xishan.)

692
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,860
Hello, sir.

693
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,620
The road ahead collapsed.

694
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,540
Please turn around.

695
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,940
All roads near Xishan

696
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,180
have been closed.

697
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,340
You can't get in.

698
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,580
We'll work with the fire service

699
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,580
to rescue them.

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,620
Luo Yuan is

701
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,780
very worried about her brother.

702
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,620
Could you

703
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,580
stay connected with us all the time?

704
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,380
OK, I'll tell her.

705
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,020
You must stay safe.

706
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,700
I get it.

707
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,620
You must take Yan back.

708
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,860
Luo Yuan,

709
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,580
the government's rescue team

710
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,380
and Captain Qingshan

711
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,700
will arrive at the site soon.

712
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,180
You must trust them.

713
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:37,860
They will

714
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,780
rescue your brother

715
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,460
and Dr. Zhan.

716
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,780
Don't worry.

717
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
We'll know the situation there

718
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,140
any time.

719
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,410
Luo Ben.

720
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,770
I'm here.

721
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,700
Are you OK?

722
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,340
I'm OK.

723
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,700
How are you?

724
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,940
Come.

725
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:33,820
Be careful.

726
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,900
Hands.

727
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:38,940
Here.

728
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,580
Let me see.

729
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,860
It's OK.

730
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,460
I've taken care of it.

731
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,260
It's OK.

732
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,940
Let me see your back.

733
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,220
I'm fine.

734
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,820
Are you afraid?

735
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,940
I'm afraid it's too dark here

736
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,380
and you'll cry if you're alone.

737
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,620
But do you know

738
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,780
we may not be able to get out?

739
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,260
It won't happen.

740
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,780
I was the nearest,

741
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,620
so I came here first.

742
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,300
Captain Qingshan

743
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,100
and the rescue team should be here soon.

744
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,180
- Luo Ben.
- Zhan Yan.

745
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,580
- Luo Ben.
- Zhan Yan.

746
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,220
- Luo Ben.
- Zhan Yan.

747
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,740
- Luo Ben.
- Zhan Yan.

748
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,260
- We're here.
- Here.

749
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:49,940
Here.

750
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,620
Here.

751
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,740
We're here.

752
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,220
Hurry, we need a hand here.

753
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,780
Coming.

754
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,420
Miss Ruan,

755
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,700
is there any news about Yan?

756
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,420
Captain is there.

757
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,740
They'll be fine.

758
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,300
Hurry.

759
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,620
A landslide hit Xishan Homestay

760
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,260
and two victims are trapped.

761
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,860
Now,

762
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,700
the police, fire service,

763
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,860
and non-government rescue teams...

764
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:40,980
The place looks so dangerous.

765
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,980
Captain Qingshan has dealt with

766
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,260
more dangerous and
complicated situations.

767
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,380
I trust him.

768
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,220
Our task now is to

769
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,580
conserve our strength

770
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,860
and wait for the good news.

771
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,740
Let's grab a bite.

772
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,260
Put the food here.

773
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,460
Luo Yuan,

774
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,460
have some food,

775
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,220
or your brother will feel sorry
when he comes back

776
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,420
and finds you're haggard.

777
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,780
Come on.

778
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,740
Drive forward.

779
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,420
Come.

780
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,180
Come here.

781
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,900
Come here.

782
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,620
Come.

783
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,940
OK.

784
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,100
Captain,

785
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,060
all heavy machinery

786
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,300
is in place.

787
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,260
OK.

788
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,420
The windows are partly buried.

789
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,820
In a special position,

790
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,780
they can relieve the impact of mud.

791
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,100
This is the place

792
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,420
where they dug in.

793
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,060
We should make it our key point

794
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,300
of breakthrough.

795
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,300
OK.

796
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,980
Saving lives are our first priority.

797
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,180
Stick to the plan.

798
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:03,580
OK.

799
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,180
Yes.

800
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,300
Are you hurt?

801
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,260
Let me see.

802
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,780
Let me take care of it.

803
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,860
It's OK. Don't bother.

804
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,380
In this case,

805
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm afraid you can't hold on
till they arrive.

806
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,220
Dr. Zhan,

807
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,220
I'm a man.

808
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,340
If I say I'm OK, I'm OK.

809
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,820
You shouldn't have come.

810
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,220
You shouldn't have come.

811
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,180
Why?

812
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,700
Do you regret it?

813
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,420
Do you regret it?

814
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,900
Are you OK?

815
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,500
Zhou Mingming,

816
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,140
could you get me alcohol?

817
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:53,900
Hey, you,

818
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,860
take it easy.

819
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,140
If you're drunk,

820
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,700
how will you

821
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,780
get down from here?

822
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:04,060
Zhou Mingming, is this beer fake?

823
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,700
Are you kidding me?

824
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,220
How could I

825
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,420
get fake beer?

826
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,340
Then why am I

827
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,460
still scared?

828
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,900
Isn't alcohol supposed to boost courage?

829
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,500
Captain Qingshan

830
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,420
is at the site to rescue them.

831
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,580
Do you have to be so worried?

832
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,500
I'll tell you what.

833
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,780
You know what?

834
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:25,780
I...

835
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,260
I haven't

836
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,380
got good grades since childhood.

837
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,100
Teachers didn't like me.

838
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,100
My classmates hated me.

839
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,060
My parents accused me of

840
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,580
goofing around.

841
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Only Yan,

842
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,620
only my cousin
didn't look down upon me.

843
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,820
She encouraged me to draw comics.

844
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,460
She also praised

845
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,500
my talent.

846
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,580
In this world,

847
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:52,580
my cousin seems to be the only one
who doesn't look down upon me.

848
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,340
Everyone else looks down upon me.

849
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,380
Why?

850
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,140
You

851
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,180
really have a little talent.

852
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,140
If you use it right in the future,

853
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,060
more people will admire you.

854
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,180
What?

855
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,860
My cousin

856
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:14,060
said the same words to me.

857
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,140
I'm so scared now.

858
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,300
My cousin must be

859
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,380
very scared alone.

860
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,620
What if she couldn't

861
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,580
hang in there?

862
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,580
What if she...

863
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,340
she is crying alone?

864
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,940
My cousin...

865
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,300
Enough.

866
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,260
I'll tell you what,

867
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,900
your cousin heals the wounded
and rescues the dying,

868
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,780
and always does good deeds.

869
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,500
So this time,

870
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,700
she'll certainly come back safely.

871
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,580
But you,

872
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,820
if I knew you were not good at drinking,

873
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,260
I wouldn't have

874
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,420
brought you so much beer.
