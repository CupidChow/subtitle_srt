1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,850
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,050
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,470
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,720
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,270
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,450
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:02,250
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:08,850
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,270
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:28,400
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,930

19
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,960

20
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:48,720
No answer.

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,620
He doesn't want to talk to you.

22
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,360
I'll send a message.

23
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,700
Come on.

24
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,139
Zhou Mingming.

25
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,100
 Zhou Mingming, we got lost on the mountain.

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,620
 We don't know where we are.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,119
 We have no water or food.

28
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,580
He is calling. Come here.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,579
Mingming.

30
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:24,179
Hello, Li Jian. Where are you?

31
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:27,260
We got lost on the mountain. We don't know where this is.

32
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,820
Send me the location. Stand still.

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,380
Okay. I'll send you.

34
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,240
The signal is poor.

35
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,039
He's so timid.

36
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,720
- Look. Look. 
 - You...

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,199
Have you heard? His voice changed.

38
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,860
You're dancing on fire.

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,859
Just a joke. It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:47,240
Come on.

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,100
To celebrate our reunion,

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,720
- cheers. 
 - Cheers!

43
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,040
Light Chaser Rescue Team.

44
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,800
Jing, I'm Mingming.

45
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,979
My friends got lost in the mountain.

46
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,659
Where are they?

47
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,120
Come on! Stand up!

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,480
Don't be afraid.

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,140
Come here. Stand up.

50
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,800
You should put it this way.

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,880
What happened?

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,839
Legs forward a little.

53
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:25,640
Yes. Three, two, one.

54
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,100
Your legs...

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,439
I win again!

56
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,800
You're so strong.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,739
It's not interesting.

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,680
You wanted to play here but think it's boring.

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,959
What do you want?

60
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,699
Stop talking nonsense.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,519
The cars can't move forward.

62
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,779
I've found that it's the only way to go up.

63
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,419
We have to walk.

64
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
 Get your package. Take the lead.

65
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
Zhou Mingming.

66
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,379
Where are you?

67
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:26,700
We entered the hiking area.

68
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,120
You're here?

69
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,759
 Are there any special signs near you?

70
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,419
There are trees all around.

71
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,879
 Nothing special.

72
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,159
I'll check with you again.

73
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:42,260
You left the camp at half past ten and got lost at 11. Right?

74
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,280
Maybe.

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,640
 So you're not far away.

76
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,380
 Don't move. I'm coming.

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,579
Terrible. So many people.

78
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,539
You're making things worse.

79
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:53,800
Let's go!

80
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,019
Yes! Go!

81
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:57,759
Don't eat. Turn off your phone. Go.

82
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,859
Why? What's wrong? Doing what?

83
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:01,200
I told him we were lost.

84
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,900
If he sees us eating and drinking, he'll find he was cheated.

85
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,259
No need to turn off the phone.

86
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,990
What if he wants us to post our location?

87
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,010
Have you thought of it?

88
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,120
Let's go, go, go.

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,680
- I just ate a bit. 
 - Go.

90
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:17,099
Slow down.

91
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,079
Slow down.

92
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:26,220
Come on. Darling, lend me a hand.

93
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,360
Come on.

94
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,860
Dabao, hurry up!

95
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,220
You go first. I'll follow you.

96
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,900

97
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:22,159
Yes, it's his.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,219
All new.

99
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,639
Intact.

100
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,230
I don't know why he bought them.

101
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,600
He's rich but stupid.

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,119
Does he want to hike or have a party?

103
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,139
Keep it.

104
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:50,160
 Sorry. The number you dialed is not in the service area. Please redial later.

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,099
I can't contact him.

106
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,259
I have signal.

107
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:03,799
It's strange.

108
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,360
What's wrong?

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
The box is warm.

110
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
They left just now.

111
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,959
What?

112
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,559
But they reported they got lost two hours ago.

113
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:17,180
We were cheated on such a hot day.

114
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,940
What a joke!

115
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,539
- We were cheated! 
 - What a senseless man!

116
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,000
We came here from afar but are cheated.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,919
It's a waste of time.

118
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:28,519
That's really annoying.

119
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,459
Li Jian! Yang Zhao!

120
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,499
Come out!

121
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:38,420
I know you're here. Li Jian! Yang Zhao!

122
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,299
You don't come out?

123
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:44,219
Ojay. Just hide yourselves.

124
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,200
- Let's go. 
 - We must find them.

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,340
They cheated us!

126
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,580
We shouldn't leave until we make sure they are safe.

127
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,399
Safety first.

128
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,159
Any questions?

129
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:03,920
 No.

130
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,700
No.

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,180
Camp as the center, 1 kilometer as the radius. Act separately.

132
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,859
 Yes!

133
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,600
Lei Yun, follow me.

134
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,020
 Yes!

135
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,680
- Li Jian! 
 - Li Jian!

136
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,160
- Li Jian! 
 - Li Jian!

137
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,100
Li Jian! Yang Zhao!

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,639
Li Jian!

139
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,459
Li Jian! Dabao!

140
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,500
Yang Zhao!

141
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,059
Li Jian!

142
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,159
Li Jian! Dabao!

143
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,839
Yang Zhao!

144
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,459
No signal at all.

145
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:01,940
Li Jian!

146
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,880
- Yang Zhao! 
 - Li Jian!

147
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,019
Follow me.

148
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,619
Hurry up!

149
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,410

150
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
Did they enter?

151
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,639
Li Jian probably entered.

152
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,850
Safety first. Keep in contact.

153
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,860
Got it.

154
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,940
Go.

155
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,020
Let's go!

156
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,939
What bad luck!

157
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:45,439
Why did they enter the forested mountain?

158
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:54,739
Slow down.

159
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,759
Slow down.

160
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,320
Are you okay?

161
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,059
My feet...

162
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,639
I can't walk further.

163
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:04,439
Me, too. My hand have been bitten a lot.

164
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,359
Too many insects here.

165
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:09,159
Let me go. Or I'll die.

166
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,039
You've made trouble. Let's go back.

167
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,359
I told Zhou Mingming that we got lost half an hour after we came out.

168
00:10:16,359 --> 00:10:20,839
If we return, he'll know we lied.

169
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,440
You'll know as you become aware. Just apologize to him.

170
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,620
We're friends.

171
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,560
If you don't go, we'll leave.

172
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,059
Let's go.

173
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,860
Backtrack.

174
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,940
Be careful.

175
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,499
Slow down.

176
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:56,130
- Be careful. 
 -  Be careful.

177
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,919
Are you okay? Come on.

178
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,560
- I'm fine. 
 - Watch your step.

179
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,519
Where to go?

180
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,700
Southward.

181
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Take a break.

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
We've spent a lot of time.

183
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,400
If they just hid near the camp, we should have found them.

184
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,500
Yes.

185
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,400
- Peng, I have water. 
 - No, thanks. Keep it.

186
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,300
Snail. Feiyu. Have you found them?

187
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,400
 No.

188
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,600
 We haven't, either.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Wait.

190
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,700
What's wrong?

191
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,800
I just threw the bottle.

192
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,400
- What do you mean? 
 - It means we're lost.

193
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Turn on navigation.

194
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,500
No signal.

195
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,400
Without signals, how to find our way back?

196
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
Signals can't help.

197
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,700
We're on the mountain. The location is not accurate.

198
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,600
But you led us to take this way. What a troublemaker!

199
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
But I didn't want to.

200
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,300
If you didn't want to cheat Zhou Mingming, I wouldn't have come here with you!

201
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,800
- Are you blaming me? 
 - Yes, I am!

202
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Come on, shut up.

203
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,900
Shut up.

204
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,700
Since we can't convince each other, let's go our different ways.

205
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,100
Okay, let's go our different ways.

206
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,300
I can go without you.

207
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Go.

208
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Why do I have to go first?

209
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,900
- You said you'll go. 
 - I won't.

210
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,500
Why were you shouting? Just a bird!

211
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,300
Well...

212
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,000
Are there any wolves here?

213
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,700
Look for signals!

214
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,000
I have no signal. How about you?

215
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,300
Will we die in the wild?

216
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't want to die!

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Shut up!

218
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Zhou Mingming asked us to stay still.

219
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,100
- Let's wait here. 
 - Okay.

220
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Just... wait here.

221
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
As for Zhou Mingming... Let's find signals now.

222
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,400
My legs are weak.

223
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,400
Dabao!

224
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
I can't contact him. No signal.

225
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,100
Your friends are far away.

226
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,500
If we can't find them, our supplies will run out.

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,400
Mingming, here's water for your friends.

228
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
Let's drink.

229
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,600
Come on. Don't be angry.

230
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,140
They also need water.

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Just leave them to be thirsty.

232
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,700
Li Jian!

233
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,900
We're here to rescue you.

234
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,800
Li Jian! Yang Zhao! Dabao!

235
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,700
Li Jian!

236
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Yang Zhao!

237
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,800
Footprint.

238
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,400
Snail! Feiyu! Footprints here.

239
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,900
Meet us in the southeast.

240
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,800
Go.

241
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,300
- Follow me! 
 - Okay.

242
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
Are you okay?

243
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,100
Any water?

244
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,300
It's all gone.

245
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Well...

246
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Will we die here?

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,800
I don't want to die here.

248
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,100
It's your fault that you led us here.

249
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,600
- What a place! 
 - Don't cry. I'm annoyed.

250
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,500
It's no use shouting at her.

251
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,000
- Nothing to do with you. 
 - Why shouldn't I complain?

252
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,400
No, you shouldn't.

253
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,200
- Why not? 
 -  What are you kicking?

254
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,700
- Kicking me?
 - If you didn't come, no one would have come.

255
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
- Did I force you? 
 - I didn't want to come!

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,400
You can go.

257
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,000
If I come again, I'm a dog.

258
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Li Jian! Dabao!

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Li Jian! Dabao!

260
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
Li Jian! Yang Zhao!

261
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,000
- Yang Zhao! Dabao! 
 - Mingming!

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
 We're here!

263
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
 - We're here! 
 - Zhou Mingming!

264
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
 Zhou Mingming!

265
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
 We're here!

266
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,600
 Mingming!

267
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,300
 - Here! 
 - Help!

268
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,600
 Zhou Mingming!

269
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,700
 We're here!

270
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,200
 - Zhou Mingming! 
 - Mingming!

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,200
You came! Any water? I'm thirsty!

272
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,500
Water? Interesting?

273
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,700
Calm down.

274
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,500
And you.

275
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,100
Is it interesting to cheat us?

276
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,300
It was just a joke.

277
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,900
A joke?

278
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,400
Because of you, we postpone our work.

279
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,700
You like to joke?

280
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,900
Send them out first.

281
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,400
Deal with other things later.

282
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,000
Have water.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
Thank you.

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,200
The water is not enough. Leave some for others.

285
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,300
You only carry so little water?

286
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,000
- Irrational. 
 - How dare you!

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,400
We went a long way to find you.

288
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,800
The water is already gone.

289
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,500
You!

290
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Zhou Mingming!

291
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,300
You hit me because of a bottle of water?

292
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
- Aren't we bros? 
 - Bro?

293
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,000
To save you, we only have two bottles left.

294
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,600
You're too cruel.

295
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,100
I'm so blind that I have a bro like you.

296
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,300
From now on, we're not friends anymore.

297
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,600
If our team members were accidentally injured by your mischief,

298
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,500
you would be legally responsible.

299
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,400
Haven't seen such a weirdo for a long time.

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,900
You deserve a hit.

301
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,400
Don't be stunned.

302
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,000
Let's go.

303
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,400
We went too far this time.

304
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Let's go.

305
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,000
You really deserve a hit.

306
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
You shouldn't joke around.

307
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Yes. We're wrong.

308
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
But we must be given a chance to mend our ways.

309
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,500
You should tell him in person.

310
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,100
Why do you bother me?

311
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,400
He won't talk to us.

312
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,600
He blocked us all.

313
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,000
You deserve it.

314
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,800
Dingding, we're friends. Right?

315
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,900
Do us a favor. Help us explain to him.

316
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,200
We've been friends for years.

317
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,700
We shouldn't be done because of that.

318
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,200
It has nothing to do with me.

319
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
I can't deal with it.

320
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,400
You're his girlfriend.

321
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,000
He listens to you. Have a taste.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
No.

323
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,400
Yes, I'm his girlfriend.

324
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,400
But it's up to him to decide.

325
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,700
By the way, if I were him, I would have broken up with you, too.

326
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,500
Yes.

327
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,600
We went too far.

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,500
Even though such a big thing happened, we're still making trouble here.

329
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,200
I just want to beat myself.

330
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
What's wrong with him?

331
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,100
Don't you know? Ms. Ma is in the hospital.

332
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,900
Come in.

333
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
What's the matter?

334
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Mingming.

335
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Dingding.

336
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,600
Why are you here?

337
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,100
The company is in big trouble.

338
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,800
Why didn't you tell me?

339
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,500
At least I was a member of Mingmei.

340
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,100
What are you saying?

341
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,600
Nothing's wrong.

342
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,800
Still pretending?

343
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,200
Li Jian and Yang Zhao have told me everything.

344
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,700
I didn't mean to hide it.

345
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,200
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

346
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,600
Here's 800,000 yuan.

347
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
You can use it.

348
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
Where did you get the money?

349
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,100
I sold the copyright of Light Chaser Rescue and the next comic to Ma Baoming in advance.

350
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
I can't accept it.

351
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,300
Why?

352
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,800
It's my business. I can't involve you.

353
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,900
Your business is my business.

354
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,200
Dingding, I've mortgaged my house.

355
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,500
If the box office has a loss, not only the house but also your money will be lost.

356
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,600
Don't worry.

357
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
I can draw more pages a dayto earn the money back.

358
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
It doesn't matter if you lose the house.

359
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,800
You can live with me. I'll support you.

360
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,800
Dingding.

361
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,200
I'll find a way to solve the problem of the company.

362
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,900
Don't worry.

363
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,500
Your money was saved bit by bit by painstakingly drawing comics.

364
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,600
I can't use your money.

365
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,600
Save it.

366
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Spend it on yourself.

367
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
- He's coming. 
 - Mingming.

368
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,200
We've realized our mistake. Mingming, could you forgive us?

369
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,600
Who are you? Let me go!

370
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,800
Mingming!

371
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,100
As long as you forgive us, you can beat or scold me.

372
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,400
Where do you want to hit me? Just help yourself.

373
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,900
I won't fight back.

374
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,400
Look at yourself.

375
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,800
You can scold me.

376
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,400
- But you shouldn't deny I'm your bro. 
 - You're not my bro!

377
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,900
Mingming.

378
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,200
We three have an idea.

379
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,200
To show our apology, we decided to donate money to the rescue team.

380
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,700
Do you think money can settle everything?

381
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,300
No. We think it can better express our apology.

382
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
So how to show good faith? Tell us.

383
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,300
We'll do whatever you want us to do.

384
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Okay.

385
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,400
I'll give you a chance.

386
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,800
If all the team members who went up the mountain

387
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,500
to save you that day forgive you,

388
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,800
I will forgive you.

389
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,800
If anyone of them says no, sorry.

390
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,700
Don't contact me anymore.

391
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,000
Mingming.

392
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,800
Brother Peng.

393
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Brother Peng! We're here!

394
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,800
So high!

395
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,600
Brother Peng, we're coming!

396
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
- He ignores us. 
 - Let's go up.

397
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,900
- Let's go up. 
 - Go.

398
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,400
Brother Peng, we're coming!

399
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,000
Bro!

400
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,100
Well... Brother Peng.

401
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,200
Too steep.

402
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,600
Brother Peng.

403
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Fatty, hurry up!

404
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,400
- My god. 
 - Brother Peng, we're here.

405
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,100
Brother Peng, we're coming.

406
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,800
Brother Peng.

407
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,100
Too high. My god!

408
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,000
Brother Peng.

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
No.

410
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,600
Brother Peng.

411
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
We're here to apologize.

412
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,100
Brother Peng.

413
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,500
Brother Peng.

414
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
- No. 
 -  Brother Peng.

415
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,000
Brother Peng.

416
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,100
Shall we go down?

417
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,100
- Go down. 
 - Go.

418
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,200
Wait for us!

419
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,500
We're coming! Brother Peng.

420
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,300
I just climbed up!

421
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Brother Peng.

422
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,600
Brother Peng, you're too fast.

423
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,200
Brother Peng, we want to apologize this time. Brother Peng, we want to apologize this time.

424
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Brother Peng.

425
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,400
Who are you?

426
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,800
Do I know you?

427
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,800
I remember.

428
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,400
You're the silly rich man.

429
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,000
- Brother Peng, we... 
 - What?

430
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
Are you having an outing here?

431
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
Brother Peng, we were wrong.

432
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,300
Brother Peng, we're wrong.

433
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,200
You!

434
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,200
If you weren't Zhou Mingming's friends,

435
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,500
I should have thrown you down from above.

436
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,400
We deserve to be killed thousands of times.

437
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,400
- Throw us. 
 - Yes.

438
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
Brother Peng, could you forgive us?

439
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Brother Peng.

440
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,200
What do you want to do?

441
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I almost failed to recognize you.

442
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,500
Your voice makes me feel familiar.

443
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Are you feeling better?

444
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,800
If so, I shouldn't have been in bed.

445
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,800
Yes. So you shouldn't be angry with me.

446
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,900
It really hurts.

447
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,600
I feel sick when I see you.

448
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,700
You'd better leave.

449
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,400
No way.

450
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,100
Mingming is too busy to accompany you.

451
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,500
As his girlfriend, I should help him.

452
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I shouldn't make him worried.

453
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,800
Ding Dingding.

454
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Though I'm ill, you still have no chance.

455
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
I don't buy it.

456
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,400
Okay. Do you want any fruit?

457
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
No.

458
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,500
I don't need your care.

459
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Hurry up! Be quick about it!

460
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,800
 - Sorry! We were wrong. 
 - Sorry! We were wrong.

461
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
 - Sorry! We were wrong. 
 - Sorry! We were wrong.

462
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 - Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

463
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,500
You...

464
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,000
 - Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

465
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,500
 - Sorry! We were wrong. 
 - Sorry! We were wrong.

466
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,800
Boss, your wonton is yummy.

467
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,200
Thank you.

468
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,600
- Take it. 
 - Bye.

469
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,400
See you.

470
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,800
 - Sorry. 
 - Sorry.

471
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,000
As long as you have learned from it,

472
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,600
we will consider it has never happened.

473
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,800
Great!

474
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
Wait.

475
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,400
My wife has something to say.

476
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,600
She said you must pay the corresponding price.

477
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,700
No problem. How much money?

478
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,800
10,000?

479
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,500
100,000?

480
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,200
1,000,000 is too much.

481
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,800
1,000...

482
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,800
hours.

483
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,400
As long as you have done 1,000 hours of volunteer work

484
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,500
or basic training for rescue teams,

485
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,800
I'll consider it never happened.

486
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,600
Volunteer?

487
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,400
Rescue team?

488
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,600
Meals included?

489
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
Don't cut anymore.

490
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
I don't want to eat it.

491
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,800
No. The doctor said you should have balanced nutrition and vitamins.

492
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
You can't be picky now.

493
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
And I bought the most expensive fruit.

494
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,800
I seldom eat it.

495
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,200
I am not dissatisfied with fruit.

496
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm just tired of seeing you.

497
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,800
You can leave.

498
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,000
I can understand that illness affects your mood.

499
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,300
I'm also upset when I'm ill.

500
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,000
Can't you understand me?

501
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,700
I don't want to see you, whether I'm sick or in a bad mood.

502
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Okay.

503
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,300
I'll leave.

504
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,200
Why are you here again?

505
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,200
Listen.

506
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,500
You have to eat dessert when you are in a bad mood.

507
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,700
It's hard to buy it. No takeout.

508
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,200
I went there by taxi.

509
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,100
Have a taste.

510
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,400
It's really delicious.

511
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
Come on. Look.

512
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Wait.

513
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Have a taste. Really delicious.

514
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
How about it? Is it tasty?

515
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
I didn't cheat you.

516
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,600
Just so-so.

517
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,300
Have more.

518
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,800
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

519
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,000
Every time I go, there are so many people.

520
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm tired.

521
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,200
The cream they use is different from that in other stores.

522
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,500
Very healthy. It doesn't make you fat.

523
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,600
Too delicious!

524
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,100
There seems to be no filling inside.

525
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,200
Cakes with no jam are my favorite.

526
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,100
I think happiness is the most important thing.

527
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,700
Getting fat doesn't matter.

528
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,400
Do you want any water?

529
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,700
Just tell me.

530
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,800
I'll help you get it.

531
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,600
Here.

532
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,200
I want a quiet environment when sleeping.

533
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,200
You can leave.

534
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
No.

535
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,400
Since you're alone, what if anything wrong happens?

536
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,000
If you stay, I'll be in trouble.

537
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,600
My leg was almost numb.

538
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,000
Sorry, let me give you a massage.

539
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Forget it.

540
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:36,200
If you want to stay, apply for another bed.

541
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,400
Don't sleep next to me. It affects my sleep.

542
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Do you dislike me or care about me?

543
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,900
If you keep silent, I'll think it's the latter.

544
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,539
Tuck in.

545
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,400
I am very glad to see you come to our fire safety knowledge publicity today. I'm Yang Zhao.

546
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,200
Now let me show you how to use the fire extinguisher.

547
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,779
First of all, each fire extinguisher has a small dashboard.

548
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:31,439
If the pointer is in the yellow area,

549
00:35:31,439 --> 00:35:34,559
it means that the extinguisher can be used and must be used intermittently.

550
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,359
But if it is in the green area, we can always use it.

551
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:42,520
But if it is in the red area, it means that the extinguisher cannot be used.

552
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,039
But under our...

553
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:49,590

554
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,640

555
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,919
Dabao, why are you so heavy?

556
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,639
Too heavy!

557
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,299
Another side!

558
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,840
Back.

559
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,299
Push hard at the back.

560
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,199
Another side!

561
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,599
I...

562
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm hungry.

563
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,120
We're tired after only a short practice.

564
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,059
So the rescue team is really hard-working.

565
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:04,620
If anyone bothers the rescue team,

566
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,399
I'll teach him a lesson.

567
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,500
Yes.

568
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,780
The blood pressure is normal,

569
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,740
but it's already on the threshold.

570
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:35,800
So develop the habit of taking your blood pressure every morning and evening.

571
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,599
It's hard to develop it.

572
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:44,740
It'll be okay when you come and check it for me.

573
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:47,090
I'm leaving for a while.

574
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,700
Leave? To where?

575
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,980
Mountain support.

576
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,140
The location has just been decided.

577
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,499
Because of Luo Ben?

578
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,340
Not exactly.

579
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,880
You know.

580
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,800
Healing the sick has always been my ideal as a doctor.

581
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,439
Walk further while I am young and

582
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:19,060
visit places with poor medical conditions in remote mountainous areas

583
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,060
to contribute and experience life.

584
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,159
How long?

585
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,500
One year.

586
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,340
Or longer.

587
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,039
When will you leave?

588
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,399
Tonight.

589
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,400
All of a sudden.

590
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,459
I didn't tell you in advance because...

591
00:38:46,459 --> 00:38:48,320
You're afraid I would oppose?

592
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,940
I support each of your decisions.

593
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,740
Have you told Luo Ben?

594
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:06,940
Since it will take a long time in a faraway area, take enough belongings.

595
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,719
Especially drugs and daily necessities.

596
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,220
Do you lack anything?

597
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,160
We can go to buy some.

598
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,360
It's already ready.

599
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:21,860
My only concern is your health.

600
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:27,619
I have made it clear how to take the medicine, when to take it, and how much to take.

601
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:29,659
Take medicine on time.

602
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,719
I'm fine.

603
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:36,180
I'm worried about...

604
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,900
you going out alone.

605
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:46,140
As long as I'm free, I'll make a video call and tell you I'm safe. Okay?

606
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,520
Okay.

607
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,019
Let me see you from time to time.

613
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:37,240
Sis.

614
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,820
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

615
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,090
Did you see your uncle?

616
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:44,699
Without him, I wouldn't have known it.

617
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:48,970
After I leave, you're the only young person in our family.

618
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,300
My aunt, my uncle, and my father are old and in poor health.

619
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,379
Come back from time to time.

620
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,800
Got it.

621
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,760
Does Luo Ben know you're leaving?

622
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,519
Maybe he doesn't want to know it.

623
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:07,380
Why?

624
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,619
You used to have a good relationship.

625
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,220
Why did you break up with him?

626
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,700
It's a long story.

627
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,419
Why not talk with each other?

628
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:18,300
There's no misunderstanding that can't be solved.

629
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,119
I'll call him.

630
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,780
It's a matter between adults.

631
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,199
See you. I need to catch up with the car.

632
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,800

00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:49,500
 But I still think I should tell you that my sister is going to the mountains to do support work.

650
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,700
 The plane will take off in an hour.

00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:12,750
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

671
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:20,430
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

672
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,150
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

673
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,880
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

674
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,600
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

675
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,430
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

676
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,050
♫  I can't fly  ♫

677
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,900
♫  But I can look up  ♫

678
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:50,780
♫  I'm chasing the light on the road  ♫
