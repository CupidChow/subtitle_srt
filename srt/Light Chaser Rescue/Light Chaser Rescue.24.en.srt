Sure.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,720
We'll shop here again.

19
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,200
Who are you waiting for, Mr. Luo?

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,920
You didn't drive your assistant
home, huh?

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm not her chauffeur.

22
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,280
I'm the chauffeur of this lady

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
who just came out of the gate.

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
So of course, I had to wait here.

25
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,130
Well,

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,000
you aren't my chauffeur, either.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,810
So I guess I gotta disappear.

Zhan Yan,

29
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,690
you help me

30
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,690
nail my chauffeur, okay?

31
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,250
Who did she refer to?

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,320
Mr. Gao.

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,720
She takes it seriously?

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,250
I'm embarrassed

35
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,250
that you paid for the wine.

36
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,250
Red wine is best served
for a romantic date.

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,320
Mr. Luo,

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,370
you didn't even order
a bottle of wine.

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,490
That's stingy.

40
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,650
I would, previously.

41
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,690
But not now.

42
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,560
Now, I have a girlfriend.

43
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,720
Red wine would

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,490
cause misunderstanding.

45
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,930
I'm not so sensitive.

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,370
I wish you were,

47
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,320
because it means you care.

48
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,810
Let me ask you this.

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,760
You have no

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,090
questions for me

51
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,840
when you see me

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,810
with Ai Rui'er?

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,970
What questions?

54
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,320
You gobbled them up
along with the wine.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,280
Not sensitive, huh?

56
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,560
Mr. Jin,

57
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,650
nice working with you.

58
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,530
You, too.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,530
It's late now.

60
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,880
We'll treat you to dinner

61

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
Mr. Jin,

63
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,840
we'll get drunk tonight.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Sure. Thanks.

Nice, right?

91
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,400
It's too dangerous
that you go there alone.

Nothing. Here we go.

on a trip with you?

Hold in your anger first.

151
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,280
I'm in a bad mood.

152
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,920
Yuan wants to keep me company.

153
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,520
Don't worry.

154
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,920
I'll take good care of her.

155
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,760
If there's any accident,

156
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,850
you'll be in real trouble.

157

No way.

I promise you

Nobody cares about me.

165

Hello, everyone. I'm Ding Dingding.

171
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,330
I created this comic

172

based on my real experience.

173
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,610
During Fengxi Earthquake,

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,160
I was in the stricken area.

175
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,250
I got to know

176
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,730
Light Chaser Rescue,

177
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,730
and a very special person.

178
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,210
He wanted to be helpful,

179
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,490
but regrettably,
he was also chicken-hearted.

180
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,970
He had

181
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,570
all those disaster relief
supplies delivered

182
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,040
to the stricken areas,

183
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,330
but

184
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:47,970
he fainted

185
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,370
at the sight of blood.

186
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,850
When someone fell into the water,

187
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,040
he jumped into the river

188
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,330
without hesitation.

189
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,210
Sometimes,

190
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,610
he would make me so angry.

191
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,330
But sometimes,

192
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,000
I would be moved by
his sense of justice.

193
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,000
Is he Zhou Mengmeng?

194
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,970
Did Zhou Mengmeng
tell you how he felt about you?

195
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,880
You could've got yourself killed.

196
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,130
I know.

197
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,520
But I trust you.

198
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,700
(Zhou Mingming)

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,680
(Dingding,)

200
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:03,970
(I'm sorry.)

201
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,800
(I miss you so much.)

202
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,520
Watch your steps.

203
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,450
It's nice, right?

204
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,450
What are you doing?

205
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,640
Watch, don't touch.

206
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,090
I…

207
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,250
All right.

208
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,570
Come on. Follow up.

209
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,160
Quickly.

210
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,970
Let's take a selfie.

211
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,920
Watch out for the stairs.

212
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,610
Come on.

213
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,920
Watch out for the stairs. Be careful.

214
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,640
Come on. Follow up.

215
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,680
Quickly.

216
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,570
Ladies.

217
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,850
- Coming.
- Follow us up. Quickly.

218
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
Come on. Let's go.

219
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,400
Look here.

220
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,130
It's amazing.

221
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,210
Pretty nice.

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,090
It's so nice.

223
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,330
I bet it's nicer inside.

224
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,640
We'll get inside.

225
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,760
Come on. Let's go.

226
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,980
(Unexplored Area No Entry)

227
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Brothers and sisters.

228
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,450
Now, we have

229
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,250
reached the end of the developed

230
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,920
outer cave.

231
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,400
Further inside

232
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
is the mysterious inner cave.

233
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,210
So far,

234
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,880
only expert explorers
tried to get in there.

235
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,250
So there's no guarantee

236
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:38,880
of safety inside.

237
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,610
Follow us if you'd like to proceed.

238
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,640
If not,

239
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,570
just turn back.

240
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,280
It's an uncharted area

241
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,450
We'd better stay away from it.

242
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm not going in.

243
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,250
It says, "No Entry".

244
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,330
(Unexplored Area No Entry)
Are you going in?

245
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,370
I will.

246
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,330
I will, too.

247
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,880
We have come all the way here.

248
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,090
What about you?

249
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:55,970
I will.

250
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,370
Yuan, don't worry.

251
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,130
This is safer

252
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:02,400
than the places
that the rescue team went.

253
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,160
How about this?

254
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,280
You'll turn back with them,

255
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,160
and wait for me outside.

256
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,280
I'll get in and out very quickly.

257
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,210
Is that okay?

258
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,730
You'll come with me?

259
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,040
We won't go in there.

260
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,520
- You're the best.
- You guys go ahead.

261
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,160
OK.

262
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,490
You'll turn back.

263
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,090
Be safe.

264
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,800
- Alright.
- OK.

265
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,920
We'll meet up at 9:00 PM
at the bus stop.

266
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,090
- OK.
- OK. See you around.

267
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,920
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

268
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,450
See you around.

269
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:24,880
We're going in.

270
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,040
- Let's go.
- Go.

271
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,570
Go, go.

272
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,970
It's wonderful.

273
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,920
We're in the inner cave.

274
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,040
Worth it, right?

275
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,250
Yes.

276
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,450
I'm glad we came in.

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,040
This is

278
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,490
an unexplored area.

279
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,800
We must be safe.

280
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,880
OK.

281
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:09,920
Go.

282
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,400
Watch your steps.

283
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,160
OK.

284
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,640
Easy.

285
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,050
Watch your heads.

286
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,090
Follow me. This way.

287
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,010
Look up. Give me your hand.

288
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
OK. Easy.

289
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,480
It's so nice.

290
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,130
It's getting damp.

291
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,880
Is it raining outside?

292
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,570
It's a sunny day today.

293
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,090
Hey.

294
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,810
You never know in the mountain.

295
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,090
How about we call it a day?

296
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,160
Let's turn back.

297
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,810
Hey, what's the rush?

298
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,440
Listen, it is

299
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,480
7:00 PM already.

300
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,610
If you're afraid, just go.

301
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm going forward.

302
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,680
We'll head back.

303
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,720
Alright, you be safe.

304
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,160
OK. You, too.

305
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,130
I don't remember the water here.

306
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,130
Bobcat, Potherb. Come here.

307
00:19:58,850 --> 00:19:59,720
What?

308
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:00,610
Look.

309
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,920
Where did the water come from?

310
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,050
Oh, no.

311
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,370
Let's get out.

312
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,130
Go.

313
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,920
Be careful.

314
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:14,480
Go.

315
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,370
Yuan.

316
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,530
Watch out.

317
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:37,640
Yeah.

318
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,810
I understand.

319
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,570
Light Chaser Rescue

320
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,610
will be totally cooperative.

321
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
Director Liu,

322
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,960
we'll meet you there.

323
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,400
Dr. Ruan,

324
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,880
missing travelers reported

325
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,810
at Beauty Cave.

326
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,610
Send out the mission.

327
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,810
Move fast, everybody.

328
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,240
It'll be a long way.

329
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,130
Director Liu.

330
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,050
Roger that.

331
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm on my way.

332
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,440
Xiong Fei,

333
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,920
you still can't get in touch
with Luo Yuan?

334
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,570
No, I can't.

335
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm going to the team.

336
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,130
Hello, Xiong Fei.

337
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,090
Is Dingding with Luo Yuan?

338
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,810
What?

339
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,050
The water level isn't high.

340
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,330
We'll swim.

341
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,770
It's dark in here.

342
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,960
Do you know the way?

343
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,640
We can't take the risk.

344
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,880
If we get lost,

345
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,010
we'll never get out of here.

346
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,570
This is on you.

347
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,570
This is on you!

348
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,440
You had to go deep into the cave.

349
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240
If we had turned back,

350
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,010
none of this would have happened.

351
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,290
It has nothing to do with me.

352
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,480
You…

353
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,640
I didn't force you in.

354
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,680
You chose to come in.

355
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,720
You're the leader.

356
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,090
So, of course, it's on you.

357
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,680
You need to take us out.

358
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,880
You think I don't want
to get out of here?

359
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,920
It's full of water. How?

360
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,290
Stop fighting.

361
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,920
What's the point of blaming
one another?

362
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,370
No signals on the phone.

363
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,050
Can't reach anybody.

364
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Are we…

365
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:19,720
Are we going

366
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,880
to sit around and do nothing?

367
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,640
They got out first.

368
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,480
If they don't see us go out,

369
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,640
they'll call the police.

370
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,130
People

371
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:26,370
will come to our rescue.

372
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,440
Rescue?

373
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
When they find us,

374
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,880
we'll already be…

375
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,920
How are you?

376
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,530
Are you okay?

377
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,240
Are you okay?

378
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,610
I'm fine.

379
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,680
Save some energy, will you?

380
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,160
It doesn't look right.

381
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,880
The water level

382
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
is getting higher and higher.

383
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,330
How…

384
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,570
How do we get out of here?

385
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,240
The entrance will be flooded soon.

386
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,530
Let's get out of here.

387
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,680
We'll find a safe spot.

388
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,570
Wait for the water to subside.

389
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,480
The rescue team

390
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,530
will find us.

391
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,680
Well, I guess this is our only option.

392
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,960
Let's go. Come on.

393
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,240
Wait for me.

394
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,530
Be careful. Easy.

395
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,610
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

396
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,720
Easy. Easy.

397
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,850
The tunnel is going to be flooded.

398
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:33,880
Let's go.

399
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,480
You be careful.

400
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,530
Be careful.

401
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,010
It's so low.

402
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,640
Easy.

403
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,610
Up until

404
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,200
5:05 PM.

405
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Beijing Time,

406
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,850
we have yet to find

407
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,880
the trace of the four trapped travelers.

408
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,130
Professional divers

409
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,010
(Emergency Medical Service)
have been sent

410
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,160
to their rescue.

411
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,090
Light Chaser Rescue

412
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,370
is to take the equipment

413
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,400
and arrive at the designated spot

414
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:40,570
to assist in the rescue.

415
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,200
This way.

416
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,160
- Over there.
- Coming.

417
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,640
Can you tell us

418
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,440
about the situation?

419
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,440
We have made

420
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,920
thorough preparations.

421
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,160
Zhan Yan.

422
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,440
You all came.

423
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,920
Yuan and Ding Dingding
were trapped inside Beauty Cave.

424
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,660
(Ding Dingding Luo Yuan
Potherb Bobcat)

425
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,440
OK.

426
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,480
Keep watching out

427
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,640
for the local climate change.

428
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,578
(Liu Wenbin, Director of Provincial Rescue
and Coordination Plan Management Department)

429
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:15,480
Report any emergencies immediately.

430
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,330
Where's the map?

431
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,290
Director Liu.

432
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,920
Please take a look at the map.
Here.

433
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,440
Director Liu.

434
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,010
Director Liu.

435
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,050
You came.

436
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:26,920
How is it looking?

437
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,610
Come here.

438
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,050
Beauty Cave

439
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,610
is more than 10 kilometers in length.

440
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,330
Explorers get lost easily.

441
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
The rain makes things worse.

442
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,880
According to the divers

443
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,050
that we sent out,

444
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,090
the low-lying area

445
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:40,810
is above 1,300 meters long,

446
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,200
and it's completely submerged.

447
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,610
And the entrance, too.

448
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,010
It's filled with water

449
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:45,880
from here to there.

450
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,440
(Water Curtain Cave)
After all the time in water,

451
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,640
(Viewing Area)
they are exhausted.

452
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,160
They need your assistance.

453
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,920
Where's the one
who made the phone call?

454
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:52,920
Can they provide

455
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,960
any useful information?

456
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,640
They are all travelers.

457
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,920
They drew the route

458
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,640
that the trapped ones took.

459
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,090
By our calculation,

460
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,370
they should be

461
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,480
here.

462
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,330
This is the way

463
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,960
to the entrance of the cave.

464
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,370
But it's completely flooded.

465
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,610
They have to swim across it.

466
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,330
The drainage is in process.

467
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
But according

468
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,370
to the meteorology office,

469
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,920
the rain will still be on and off
in the area.

470
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,770
It'd be too late
when the cave is drained.

471
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,090
The water level is rising.

472
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,680
Dive-and-rescue is the only option.

473
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,290
Are there any other entrances

474
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,090
that connect to the inner cave?

475
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,050
A cave like this

476
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,160
should have more than one entrance.

477
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,680
Yes.

478
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,200
Not found yet.

479
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,850
I suggest the two-group strategy.

480
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,130
One group will perform
the dive-and-rescue,

481
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,480
I'll lead another group

482
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
to find the other entrances.

483
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,920
Agreed.

484
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,770
Action!

485
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:42,610
Oh, right.

486
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,160
The divers we sent out previously

487
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,920
found a spot

488
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,240
suitable for cavitation.

489
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,090
The guide line, oxygen tanks,
backup oxygen tanks

490
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,920
are all ready.

491
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,370
You'll do the work.

492
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,850
OK.

493
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,290
Listen to my command.

494
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,330
Group 1.

495
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,290
Zhan Yan and three divers

496
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,850
will take the lead.

497
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,810
You will take supplies
and diving equipment.

498
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,850
The trapped ones must be found.

499
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,440
Luo Ben will lead group 2.

500
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,680
You are to find other entrances

501
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,850
on the surface of the cave.

502
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,290
Other members,

503
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,530
get ready for any emergencies.

504
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

505
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
Let me see.

506
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,010
It's so hot.

507
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,570
Do you have antipyretic pills?

508
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,570
Yuan.

509
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,480
Drink some hot water.

510
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,480
Take it easy.

511
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Don't be afraid.

512
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,440
They will come to our rescue.

513
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,920
It's my fault.

514
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,570
I shouldn't have

515
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:33,810
brought you here.

516
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,400
I promised your brother

517
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,770
that I'd look after you.

518
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:38,960
I'm so useless.

519
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,200
Annoying.

520
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,370
What did you say?

521
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,680
We're in danger.

522
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,160
Cover yourself up.

523
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,260
(Light Chaser Rescue)

524
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,880
Zhan Yan,

525
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,130
I'm coming in with you.

526
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,200
You're in group 2.

527
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,440
Ding Dingding is trapped inside.

528
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:00,960
I know.

529
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,400
It's not the time

530
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,290
to be led by emotions.

531
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,920
You have your task

532
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,880
in group 2.

533
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,480
But…

534
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,570
Zhou Mingming,

535
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,920
I understand how you feel.

536
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,010
But it's your first mission,

537
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,330
and you must obey.

538
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,880
But…

539
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,770
Not but.

540
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,530
Make sure of your own safety.

541
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,610
Trust me.

542
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,290
I will bring

543
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,290
Luo Yuan back.

544
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,160
Come on.

545
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,400
Group 2.

546
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,480
Follow me.

547
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Yes, sir.

548
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,330
Is your flashlight still on?

549
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,680
No.

550
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:54,850
Yours?

551
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,880
The water is rising again.

552
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,920
Look.

553
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,160
What?

554
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
You want water?

555
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,530
No water left.

556
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,720
Yuan, wait a minute.

557
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,960
Do you still have water?

558
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,290
I'm out of water.

559
00:30:58,850 --> 00:30:59,570
And you?

560
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,810
I'll need the water myself.

561
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,570
Hey, she's having a fever.

562
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,610
Just give me a little,

563
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,290
is that okay?

564
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,130
I'll buy some, alright?

565
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,290
Five hundred, is it enough?

566
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,960
One thousand, alright?

567
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,530
We're going to die.

568
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,530
Money means nothing.

569
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,610
That girl

570
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:20,290
is sick!

571
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,480
Just give her some!

572
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Don't collect the water.

573
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,810
Don't drink any water in the cave.

574
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,130
The water source is unknown.

575
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,530
You don't know if it's contaminated.

576
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,640
Get out of the way.

577
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:11,160
Yuan, I want to go home.

578
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,480
If we are able

579
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,920
to get out of here,

580
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:24,160
I will tell Zhou Mingming

581
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,330
how I really feel.

582
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,010
I won't hold back
my feelings anymore.

583
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,570
Are you scared?

584
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,720
I just don't want to die.

585
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,090
I'm sorry.

586
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,480
Thanks.

587
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,330
Yuan, drink the water.

588
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,130
Thank you.

589
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,770
No rush.

590
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,570
Feeling better?

591
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,720
Yuan, don't worry.

592
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,090
I think your brother

593
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,370
will come to our rescue.

594
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,160
Once he hears the whistle,

595
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,920
he'll come to us.

596
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:40,770
Don't be afraid.

597
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,090
We're about to go in.

598
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,240
We have two sets
of diving equipment here.

599
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,680
When we find the trapped ones,

600
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,050
we'll get two out first.

601
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,320
OK.

602
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,800
Let's go.

603
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:29,900
(Unexplored Area No Entry)

604
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,640
Hello.

605
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:34,530
Hello.

606
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:35,760
Where are you?

607
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,160
When will you be back?

608
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,280
I don't know.

609
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,530
Ding Dingding is still trapped
in the cave.

610
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,720
Can you come back?

611
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,050
Mr. Jin asks to see you

612
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,090
and talk about the investment.

613
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,280
You should know

614
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,840
how important it is

615
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,240
to the company, right?

616
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:48,890
I know.

617
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,360
But I can't leave.

618
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,890
Mingming,

619
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,090
the company can't

620
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,360
afford to lose

621
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,010
another

622
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,320
client anymore.

623
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,890
And I can't afford
to lose Ding Dingding.

624
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,640
Zhou Minging, report.

625
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,800
Zhou Mingming reporting.

626
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:15,160
No message from inside the cave.

627
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,890
Copy.

628
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,610
The rain stops at last.

629
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,410
The dark cloud is still up there.

630
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,240
It may rain again.

631
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
It is just the weather

632
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,280
inside the mountain.

633
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,930
Sir,

634
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,410
how far are we from the pit?

635
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,410
It's right ahead of us.

636
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,450
Snake! A snake!

637
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,800
It ran away.

638
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,090
Are you okay?

639
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,930
Snakes are my biggest fear.

640
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,010
Wukong.

641
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,610
Let everybody use the ointment.

642
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,010
OK.

643
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:20,490
Everybody,

644
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,010
apply the ointment

645
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,050
on your skin

646
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,530
in case of poisonous bug bites.

647
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,800
Beat the grass as you walk.

648
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:26,720
Snakes will slither away

649
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,640
when they hear you.

650
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,640
Hold tight.

651
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,050
It looks like we are
heading in the right direction.

652
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,090
Quickly.

653
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:35,970
Come on. Be careful.

654
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,680
Be careful.

655
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,320
This way.

656
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,410
Watch your steps.

657
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,090
It's right over there.

658
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,240
Build the system.

659
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,840
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

660
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,010
You are the security team.

661
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,800
I'll descend.

662
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,800
It's ready.

663
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,450
I'll go down.

664
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:40,570
Xiong Fei.

665
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,800
Be safe.

666
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
Does this pit really have another end?

667
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,360
Underground river erosion

668
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:16,130
may form a pit.

669
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,050
It is very likely to be

670
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,320
the outlet of the underground river.

671
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,930
Xiong Fei.

672
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,610
Get out.

673
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:57,680
Come on.

674
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,530
Come on.

675
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,050
Go.

676
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,840
I'll help you guys.

677
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,680
One, two. One, two. One, two.

678
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:05,410
One, two. One, two.

679
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,160
One, two. One, two.

680
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,890
How is it?

681
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Director, look.

682
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,130
Group 2, report.

683
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,970
Group 2 reporting.

684
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,890
Target No. 1 checked.

685
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,130
No entrance found.

686
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,130
Keep searching.

687
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:42,760
Yes, sir.

688
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,530
Keep searching.

689
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:07,840
It's Yuan.

690
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,450
Look.

691
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,890
