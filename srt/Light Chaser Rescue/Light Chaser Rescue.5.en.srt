Feeling alright?

Thank you.

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,060
Still the same flashbacks?

19
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,540
Yes.

20
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,860
Same flashbacks.

21
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,300
But they are all kind of messy.

22
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,300
It's been many years.

23
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,380
You should try to let it go.

Yan's mom,

28
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,860
and that kid's family.

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,140
I can't put them behind me.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
Maybe…

31
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,020
Maybe only by finding the kid

32
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,460
can you feel relieved.

33
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,180
I have been looking for the kid

34
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,380
for two decades.

35
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,580
But you're right.

36
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,740
Finding the kid is the only solution.

37
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,740
Gotta find him.

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,820

You filed a complaint

No.

79
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,980
Then how come his area was changed?

80
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,460
The change of area is very common

81

Yuan,

84
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,860
I promised you

85
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,140
that I wouldn't submit a complaint
against Xiong Fei,

86
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,780
so I'll keep my promise.

87
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,900
Also,

88
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,980
I'm too busy

89
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,020
to waste my time

90
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,100
on stuff like that.

91
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,300
I know

92
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,020
that you want to thank him

93
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,780
and the rescue team

94
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,460
for saving your life.

95
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,660
I promise you this.

96
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,900
I will go to the rescue team later.

97
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,700
When?

98
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,020
After you finish your congee.

99
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,220
All right. All right.

100
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,700
I'll go now.

101
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,100
Finish it.

102
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,300
I'm off.

103
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,300
I'd like to know

104
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,340
why Xiong Fei's area

105
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,100
was changed?

106
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Xiong Fei?

107
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,300
He's a member of the rescue team,

108
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,900
so he's always on a mission.

109
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,020
His number doesn't look good,

110
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
so the manager

111
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,220
had his area

112
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
shrunken down a little.

113
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,900
OK. Thank you.

Our captain is having a meeting.

116
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,820
But you can

117
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,660
sit here and wait for him.

118
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,820
OK, thank you.

121
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,540
I say

122
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,020
we still need professional equipment.

123
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,780
Let's look at the Cliff Guo incident.

124
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,500
It was for the lawyer boy's

off-road vehicle

and his good skills,

127
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,780
so Yan was taken back in time,

128

or else,

129
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,820
it would be bad.

Hey, you know what?

131
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,180
It'd be nice

What?

136

You actually think

137

you're a flying falcon?

138
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,420
Why not?

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,140
It makes me glad

142
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,940
that we are given

143
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,740
enough catches

144
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,620
and cordages.

145
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,420
You're just short-sighted.

146
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:38,780
I tell you what.

147
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,900
Enough, enough.

It's true that a lot of our equipment

If no helicopter,

166
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,300
an off-road vehicle would be nice,
too, right?

167

you saved my sister.

170

This is a little token of my gratitude.

171
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,180
Please take it.

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,900
If you have

176
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,420
any legal concerns,

177
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,020
we'll just sign

178
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,140
an agreement to prove it's a gift.

179
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:45,900
It'll be very simple.

180
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,020
No, no.

181
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,260
Mr. Luo,

182
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,140
we do non-profit rescue.

183
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,660
I understand.

184
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,020
Before I came,

185
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,620
I learned a little something
about your rescue team.

186
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,660
But

187
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,420
passion alone cannot sustain

188
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,500
your cause, no?

189
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,060
You see,

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,260
you need to pay

191
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,380
for your members' meals,

192
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,420
traffic fees,

193
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,900
and all of your equipment.

194
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,820
Yes.

195
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
Fund has been

196
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,500
one of our long-term issues.

197
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,660
You, too, know

198
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,500
it's an issue,

199
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,180
that's why it needs to be resolved.

200
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,900
With all due respect,

201
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,620
the rescue team

202
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,820
will be disbanded

203
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,020
if it goes on like this.

204
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,380
Luo Ben,

205
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,540
once I take the money,

206
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,420
the team would be different.

207
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,620
What's more,

208
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,300
you are the family

209
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,540
of the one we saved.

210
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,300
So we definitely

211
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,500
shouldn't take the money.

212
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,540
Have you considered

213
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,660
about the future?

214
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,620
The future?

215
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,260
If there isn't a better way out,

216
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,180
we'll just keep doing

217
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,420
what we do right now.

218
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,660
OK.

219
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,260
But if you change your mind,

220
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,300
you can come to me at any time.

221
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,020
Sure.

222
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,380
Mr. Luo.

223
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,500
Come on, Bun-bun.

224
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,260
Mr. Luo. Hello.

225
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,300
- Do you remember me?
- You are…

226
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Falcon?

227
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,900
Good memory,

228
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,780
Mr. Luo.

229
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,180
What is the matter?

230
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,060
I know what you came for.

231
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,260
If you wish to express your gratitude,

232
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,420
money seems degrading.

233
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,140
There's a better

234
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,260
way to express it.

235
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:44,780
Please elaborate.

236
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,420
See,

237
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,140
you're good talent,

238
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,660
a lawyer,

239
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,420
and a good driver.

240
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,780
The team

241
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,300
needs someone like you.

242
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,660
Won't you think about

243
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,740
joining us?

244
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,900
If you have

245
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,260
any legal problems

246
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,300
that require my assistance,

247
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,620
please feel free to call me,

248
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,260
but I have no intention

249
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,660
to join the rescue team at the moment.

250
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,020
No worries.

251
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,420
Just think about it.

252
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,500
We will be waiting for you.

253
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,900
OK.

254
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,380
I'm off.

255
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,300
OK.

256
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,420
Take it easy, alright?

257
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:24,900
Bun-bun.

258
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,380
Did you see?

259
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,780
Look. Look.

260
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,260
He's good talent.

261
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,300
A few days later,

262
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,500
he will be

263
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,540
one of us.

264
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,740
Sorry, I'm late.
Something was up at the station.

265
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,020
(My Beloved Wife Zhu Xiaojie)

266
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,060
Xiaojie, I'm sorry

267
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,620
that I didn't take good care of Yan.

268
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,300
I don't need you to take care of me.

269
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,540
Nor do I need your apology.

270
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,780
Can't you put those things

271
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,660
behind you?

272
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,820
I'm sure your mom

273
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,620
wouldn't want to see us

274
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,780
like this.

275
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,740
She wouldn't want me

276
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,180
to see the old newspaper more.

277
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,020
(Zhan Qingshan, Hero in Qingsen Earthquake)
Why?

278
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,380
What do you mean, why?

279
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,300
(Zhan Qingshan, Hero in Qingsen Earthquake)

280
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,540
Didn't you say

281
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
that my mom was dead

282
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,780
when you saw her?

283
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,140
You liar.

284
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,420
Yan.

285
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,620
Why didn't you save Mum first?

286
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,620
I did.

287
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,260
Then why

288
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,380
didn't she survive?

289
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Why does the newspaper

290
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,660
say that you saved the little boy first?

291
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,020
I have lost my mom

292
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,660
while you are

293
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,060
the applaudable hero?

294
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,740
Why don't you say something?

295
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,820
You can't say anything, right?

296
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,940
Because you killed her.

297
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,140
I'll never forgive you.

298
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,180
I'm sorry for your mother,

299
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,660
and for you.

300
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm a doctor.

301
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,140
But I'm also

302
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,940
a member of the international
medical rescue team.

303
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,780
I understand what you did
as a fellow succor,

304
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,140
but as a daughter,

305
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,660
I'll never forgive you.

306
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,700
Remember

307
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,780
when I showed you

308
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,740
the newspaper

309
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
and asked you

310
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,700
how Mum died in tears?

311
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,700
You were just like this.

312
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,300
Silent.

313
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,260
Not saying a word.

314
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,780
After all these years,

315
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,020
you still haven't changed a bit.

316
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,820
You don't have the courage

317
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,700
to tell me the truth.

318
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,900
(My Beloved Wife Zhu Xiaojie)

319
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:20,820
Xiaojie,

320
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,460
there's something

321
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,380
that I can't tell Yan.

322
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,100
I often question myself

323
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,820
whether I did the wrong thing

324
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,300
or not, too.

325
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,220
But what else can I do?

326
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,780
It is what it is.

327
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,780
I'll take the blame.

328
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,020
He's here already.

329
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,100
Here's our big hero.

330
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,260
Let me see

331
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,500
if you're still intact.

332
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,820
Get your hands off me.

333
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,860
Alright, remove your sunglasses.

334
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,780
Drop your act

335
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,820
in front of us, bro.

336
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm your bro now, huh?

337
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,260
We agreed that we'd go through

338
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,540
weal and woe together in Fengxi,

339
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,020
but you ran away first.

340
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,180
Well, the opportunity

341
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,860
of being a hero

342
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,180
is only for the chosen one.

343
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,700
You got this right.

344
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,300
When I just arrived in Fengxi,

345
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,020
I accomplished

346
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,580
some major feats.

347
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,300
Tell us about them.

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,540
There was this guy

349
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,620
who was mental.

350
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,020
He asked people for money
all the time.

351
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,820
People said he was mental,

352
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,620
but I could instantly

353
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,980
tell that

354
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,780
he had PTSD.

355
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
I got him

356
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,780
a psychiatrist immediately.

357
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,060
And there was this woman.

358
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,020
Same deal.

359
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,780
Something wrong with her head.

360
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,460
While there were still aftershocks,

361
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,020
she crawled into the ruins

362
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,020
to find her laptop.

363
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,940
What's wrong with her?

364
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,300
Right.

365
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,780
She was going to get herself killed.

366
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,220
So I rushed in,

367
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,780
got her out,

368
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,540
and gave her an earful.

369
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,220
"Is your laptop more important
than your life?"

370
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,820
Right?

371
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,060
Since you are her savior,

372
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,540
did she show

373
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,220
some gratitude in any form?

374
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,020
Well, she won't

375
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,940
get off my back ever since.

376
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,780
But that didn't work.

377
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,700
I'm out of her league.

378
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,300
Enough of bragging.

379
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,180
Show her to us someday.

380
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:51,860
Let us have a look

381
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,860
what she looks like.

382
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,020
- Yeah.
- Right.

383
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,980
Just let us see.

384
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,940
She's fine.

385
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,540
Fine?

386
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,740
But you know? This.

387
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,100
Ding Dingding.

388
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,260
What are you doing here?

389
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,180
Zhou Mingming, tell me,

390
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,980
who will not get off your back?

391
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,700
"Won't get off my back".

392
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,780
Am I wrong?

393
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,540
On our way back from Fengxi,

394
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,020
you sat on my lap.

395
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,620
You forgot that?

396
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,260
All the way back, huh?

397
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,980
There's more.

398
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,340
You're right, and I remember it.

399
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,700
On your laps.

400
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,540
Stop!

401
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,180
Not in the face.

402
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,100
What's going on?

403
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,340
- Mr. Zhou, what…
- Shush.

404
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,540
Mr. Zhou, what's the…

405
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,020
Mr. Zhou.

406
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,020
Give me a minute, please.

407
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,060
Zhou Mingming.

408
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,700
Li Aiqi.

409
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,540
You startled me.

410
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,380
Is my mother in her office?

411
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,820
The president asks to see you.

412
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,620
What's with your nose?

413
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,980
I bumped into something.

414
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,740
Clumsy.

415
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,580
She'll scold you

416
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,300
when she sees you like this later.

417
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,100
I'll clean myself up.

418
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
Mom, you want to see me?

419
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,460
Mom, I thought you were having tea
with the actors and actresses.

420
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,100
What are you talking about?

421
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,220
It's so busy at the company.

422
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,180
Look how tired you are.

423
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,300
Where were you?

424
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,300
Nowhere.

425
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,780
I went to get coffee.

426
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,380
You got tired after drinking coffee?

427
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,180
I don't believe you.

428
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,340
Have you finished your plan?

429
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,620
I have.

430
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,860
Yeah, I have.

431
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,300
I was about to send it to you.

432
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,380
Go. Send it over.

433
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:42,860
OK.

434
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,980
G-Give me a sec.

435
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,940
Why so hurry?

436
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,260
What's up with him?

437
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,820
(Mingmei Media's Plans
for the 2nd quarter)

438
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,260
It's great

439
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,340
that you did the plan beforehand,

440
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,220
or else

441
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,460
I would be done for.

442
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,980
I can't always

443
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,020
save your neck.

444
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,340
With you around,

445
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,620
I'll be alright all the time.

446
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
I'm off to do other stuff.

447
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,460
OK.

448
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,100
That woman

449
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,380
was a beast.

450
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,660
(Ding Dingding)

451
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,620
Dad, Mom, I'm home.

452
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,340
Welcome home, Daughter.

453
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:48,820
Dingding.

454
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,700
Come here.

455
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,100
I need to talk to you.

456
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,260
What? You seem serious.

457
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,540
Daughter,

458
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,460
it's fine

459
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,540
that you didn't do well at school.

460
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,980
It's also fine

461
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,460
that you aspire

462
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,500
to be a comic book author.

463
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,220
But a piece of artwork

464
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,540
has to hold

465
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,460
aesthetics and moral value,

466
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:08,940
am I right?

467
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,980
Dad, what is it that you wish to say?

468
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,260
The repairman

469
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,220
came to repair our air conditioner,

470
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,820
and I asked him

471
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,580
to repair yours as well.

472
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,580
You were in my room?

473
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,380
You promised

474
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,940
that you'd respect my privacy.

475
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,020
We always

476
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,980
respect your privacy.

477
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,460
But we didn't expect

478
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,540
that you have been drawing

479
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,620
stuff like that.

480
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,020
Mom, give me a break, alright?

481
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,220
I draw the most

482
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,860
popular stuff.

483
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,020
What do you mean,
the most popular stuff?

484
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,060
This is fundamentally wrong.

485
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,020
Art

486
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,580
is not about catering to the market.

487
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,940
A fine artwork

488
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,780
should convey correct values.

489
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,820
Do you know that?

490
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,060
Can you please not interfere

491
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,100
with my artistic creation process?

492
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,700
We are not

493
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,260
interfering with your
artistic creation process.

494
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,700
We're only trying to get you back
on the right track.

495
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,220
Mom,

496
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,740
I am an adult now.

497
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,300
For the last 20 years,

498
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,860
this is what you have been telling me.

499
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,700
I know what I'm doing.

500
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,020
If you keep doing this,

501
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,540
I can't stay in this house anymore.

502
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,820
Dingding,

503
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,460
what did you say?

504
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,300
I said,

505
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,100
"If you keep doing this,

506
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,540
I can't stay in this house anymore."

507
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,860
If you don't respect my privacy,

508
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,380
I'll move out of this house.

509
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,700
Are you serious?

510
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,300
Yes.

511
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:30,780
Well, then.

512
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,500
Now that you've said it,

513
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
your dad and I

514
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,500
will respect the choice you make.

515
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,860
What?

516
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,300
Pack your things.

517
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,020
Honey,

518
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,300
did we

519
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,740
push her too far?

520
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,300
She's always

521
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,540
casual and careless.

522
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,020
If you don't give her a little push,

523
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,540
how will she cope
with life in the future?

524
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,020
They trampled on my pride.

525
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,300
All I can do is earn it back.

526
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,380
Hello, real estate agent?

527
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,500
I'd like to rent a house.

528
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:38,300
This way, please.

529
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,260
You're pretty fast.

530
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,780
A house tour right after a call.

531
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,060
All our house information is real.

532
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,180
House tours are available
all the time.

533
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,020
The green rate
of the community is high,

534
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,500
fully equipped
with supporting facilities.

535
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,020
There's a metro station
and a supermarket nearby.

536
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,100
The life here is convenient.

537
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,620
The community is quiet,

538
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,540
and the neighbors are civilized.

539
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,540
It's ideal

540
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,740
for an artist like you.

541
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,540
And the rent.

542
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,380
How much is it again?

543
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
How are the patients

544
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,620
from Fengxi?

545
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,300
If things go well,

546
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,300
they can be out
of the hospital this week.

547
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,020
Good.

548
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,980
You made huge contributions

549
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,020
in the disaster-hit areas.

550
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,180
You earned honor for the hospital.

551
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,980
You're an excellent role model.

552
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,260
It's the least I can do.

553
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,740
The leadership thinks highly of you.

554
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,020
Most likely, you'll earn the honor

555
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,340
of outstanding individual this time.

556
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,540
I work under the best.

557
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
I'm glad that I didn't fail your trust.

558
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,340
Brother.

559
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,060
They mentioned the honor

560
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,460
of outstanding individual.

561
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,380
I wonder if Dr. Zhan

562
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,980
will get it.

563
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,820
It's their business.

564
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,740
Don't worry about it.

565
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,380
When will Dr. Cai come?

566
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,380
Dr. Zhan is in charge of you.

567
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,820
Stop asking me about Dr. Cai.

568
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,100
Dr. Cai is now

569
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,460
an Internet celebrity.

570
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,820
I'm going to be out of the hospital.

571
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,180
I just want to take a picture with him.

572
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,700
It's too bad

573
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,220
that he didn't operate on me.

574
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,980
Dr. Zhan is way

575
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,980
better than Dr. Cai.

576
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,020
How come he's the only hero?

577
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,380
That's not fair.

578
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,540
You are all

579
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,700
full of love, aren't you?

580
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,700
Dr. Cai,

581
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,060
can I take a picture with you?

582
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,020
I…

583
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,380
OK. Let's do it.

584
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,700
All right.

585
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,300
Miss Luo,

586
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,020
all your indicators

587
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,620
seem normal now.

588
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,380
You'll be discharged

589
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
from the hospital next week.

590
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,820
Oh, right.

591
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,260
Dr. Zhan is in charge

592
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,300
of my sister, right?

593
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,020
Is she not at work today?

594
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,020
She asked for leave.

595
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,460
This is the president of the hospital.

596
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,340
Sir,

597
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,380
when will

598
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,580
Dr. Zhan be back?

599
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,980
I'd like to talk to her about something.

600
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,540
If you need anything,

601
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,980
you can talk to other doctors.

602
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,540
They will help you solve your problems.

603
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,260
Well, here's the thing.

604
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,780
My sister escaped death

605
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,300
during the earthquake

606
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,060
because Dr. Zhan

607
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,500
risked her life

608
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,260
getting my sister out

609
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,180
of the debris

610
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,580
with the rescue team.

611
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,620
So before we leave,

612
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,020
I'd like to thank her in person.

613
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,500
OK.

614
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,860
We'll see.

615
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,180
Finally, someone

616
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,980
praised

617
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,060
Zhan Yan.

618
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,020
I have got

619
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,820
sick of people

620
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,740
complimenting Dr. Cai.

621
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,700
That's because

622
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,940
he's a show-off.

623
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,260
As if he's some sort

624
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,300
of a superstar.

625
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:19,540
What,

626
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,260
is he going to get into the show biz?

627
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,460
Well, let's not be too harsh on him.

628
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,800
Zhan Yan

629
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,020
always keeps a low profile.

630
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,020
But I believe she has what it takes

631
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,100
to get all the attention, too.

632
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,740
I was just given the information

633
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,380
that Fangqin Group
has been caught up in

634
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,340
a property security case.

635
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,540
Their previous lawyer

636
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,780
didn't provide a sound plan,

637
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,860
so Mr. Fang was displeased,

638
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,180
and wanted

639
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,500
to try another law firm.

640
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,820
OK.

641
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,340
You do your best

642
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,540
to collect as much information
as possible.

643
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,740
I'm working on the files.

644
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,740
You'll have them soon.

645
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,220
OK.

646
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,060
Mr. Luo.

647
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,260
Dr. Zhan.

648
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,980
Can you open the door for me?

649
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,260
I'm on the rooftop.

650
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,820
What are you doing on the rooftop?

651
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,300
Well,

652
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,860
I'll explain to you later.

653
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,060
What is this?

654
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,820
Poison. Will you drink it?

655
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,260
Of course, I will.
Because it's from you, Dr. Zhan.

656
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,100
Cheers.

657
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,340
I'll change my clothes.

658
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,940
You can leave if you like
after drinking it up.

659
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,820
Any clothes for me?

660
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,860
Patient gown.

661
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,020
In all sizes.

662
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,300
I'll pass, thank you.

663
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,180
Um, I'm all wet.

664
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,540
Do you have a dryer?

665
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,540
I'm going to change my clothes.

666
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,940
Put it on the desk
when you're finished.

667
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,300
Thanks.

668
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,260
Dr. Zhan,

669
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,820
I must

670
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,620
thank you

671
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,540
for opening the door

672
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,300
for me.

673
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,380
It looks like

674
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,980
I owe you another favor.

675
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,100
I didn't come to open the door for you.

676
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,340
I was going to work late anyway.

677
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,940
Dr. Zhan.

678
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,780
Do you

679
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,300
have any

680
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,220
off-work

681
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,060
hobbies?

682
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,060
Won't you leave already?

683
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,940
Don't get me wrong.

684
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,780
I just want

685
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,820
to say thank you.

686
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,060
In a way you like.

687
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,860
No, thanks.

688
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,100
Close the door on your way out.

689
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,780
Thank you.

690
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,340
Fine.

691
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,180
I'm off.

692
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,940
Don't work too late.

693
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,460
(Emergency)

694
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,060
Morning.

695
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:15,780
Yan.

696
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,900
Who pulled the plug yesterday?

697
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:19,780
What's wrong?

698
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,940
It was unplugged

699
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,900
this morning,

700
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,260
my fish

701
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,300
nearly died.

702
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,580
Yan, are you busy?

703
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,780
I'm getting ready for an operation.

704
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,620
I'll make it quick.

705
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,300
I have rented a very nice house.

706
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,460
Can you come after work

707
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
to liven the house up a little?

708
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,700
You rented a house?

709
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,140
This is the last bit of my pride.

710
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,620
They despised me.

711
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,260
I'm like worthless in their eyes.

712
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,700
I have decided

713
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,740
that I won't go home easily.

714
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,300
That middle-aged couple

715
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,580
will regret it eventually.

716
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,300
Yan, you will come
to my house after work.

717
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,500
We'll see.

718
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
(Operation Room)

719
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,340
Yuan,

720
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,140
I have got a cold.

721
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,700
I don't want you to have it,

722
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,660
so I won't visit you.

723
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,300
I ordered some food

724
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,220
and desserts for you.

725
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,100
You have your meals properly.

726
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,180
(Why was your area changed?)

727
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,780
(Are you busy?)

728
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,820
(What's up?)

729
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,780
(My package)

730
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,460
(is left in your station.)

731
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:06,420
(It'll be returned
if I don't receive it.)

732
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,780
(That package is important to me.)

733
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,100
(Can you help me get it?)

734
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,780
(Are you still in the hospital?)

735
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,100
(Yes.)

736
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,460
(OK.)

737
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,140
(Send me the tracking number)

738
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,820
(and pickup code.)

739
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,420
(Thanks.)

740
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,700
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

741
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,260
Miss Luo.

742
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,100
You look much better now.

743
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,380
Here's your package.

744
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,900
Thank you

745
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,380
for delivering the package.

746
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,220
Can you open it for me?

747
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:02,740
OK.

748
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,740
Here. Take it.

749
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,860
For you.

750
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,460
It is for you.

751
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,820
I…

752
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,780
I can't take it.

753
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,740
Thank you for saving my life.

754
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,660
That's my duty.

755
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,300
And it's my duty

756
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,380
to thank you.

757
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,180
If you reject

758
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,420
my token of gratitude,

759
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,300
I'll have trouble
falling asleep at night.

760
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,140
You don't like it?

761
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,500
It's... It's nice.

762
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,380
I don't know what you like.

763
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,780
So I bought something

764
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,900
that you might need at work.

765
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,300
You safeguard others

766
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,580
as a member of the rescue team

767
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,700
while Bai safeguards you

768
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
at work.

769
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,660
B-Bai?

770
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,060
This.

771
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,140
I named it Bai.

772
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,100
Operation's over?

773
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,860
So? Did it go well?

774
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,660
It was okay.

775
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,500
Oh, right.

776
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,100
Cong Zhou has asked some
of our collegemates out

777
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,260
for dinner tonight.

778
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,340
He asked me to invite you, too.

779
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,900
You've been working very hard.

780
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,780
You need to relax.

781
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,820
What time?

782
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,460
(Ding Dingding)

783
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,420
Yan, you know what?

784
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,740
My parents have gone out traveling

785
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,860
after kicking me out.

786
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,980
You're the only one

787
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,820
I've got now.

788
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,380
You must come tonight

789
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,660
to comfort

790
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,180
my broken heart.

791
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,420
I understand.

792
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,820
I'll let him know.

793
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,380
(Quick microwave heating)

794
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,940
(You're a pair)

795
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,220
(of unbelievable parents)

796
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,620
(who heartlessly left)

797
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,420
(your one and only daughter behind.)

798
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,140
(Group Chat (3))

799
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,460
(Nice, right?)

800
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,740
Help!

801
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,300
Anyone?

802
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,980
My house is on fire! Run!

803
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,380
The elevator is so slow.

804
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,300
Don't take the elevator.

805
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,780
