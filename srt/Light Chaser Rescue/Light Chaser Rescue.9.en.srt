16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,130
When I just joined

17
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,360
the rescue team,

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,410
I got a phone call

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,410
on duty in the office

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,610
that said an old lady

21
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,890
fell into a pit

22
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,970
in front of her house.

23
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,050
I thought,

24
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,410
"What the heck?

25
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,770
Why is there

26
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,440
a pit in front of her house?"

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,440
I went there,

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,410
and you know what?

30
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:02,920
What?

31
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,080
They are mountain watchmen.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,330
They just lived in the mountain,

33
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,330
and there was a pit near their house.

34
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,640
The old couple had a fight,

35
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,130
and the old lady was so mad

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,890
that she went out

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,000
and jumped into the pit.

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,720
I have a question.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,130
How come some of the team members

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,560
use code names

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,880
while some use their real names?

42
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,930
- Right.
- Why?

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,210
This is a good question.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,970
Well,

45
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,370
it has a backstory.

46
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,650
We'll go back

47
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,040
to the foundation of the team.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,930
When Light Chaser Rescue was founded,

49
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,210
the first batch of team members

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,650
got to know each other online,

51
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,250
so they called each other

52
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,090
by online names.

53
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,840
Over time,

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,370
as they moved from online

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,370
to offline,

56
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,650
they still used

57
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,720
online names.

58
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,490
But those who joined us later

59
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,560
didn't follow the tradition.

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,090
Some use their real names,

61
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,760
some use their online names,

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,250
and some got themselves a code name.

63
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,440
You know,

64
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,690
we're pretty casual.

65
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,720
So, what about Miss Ruan?

66
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,690
She's one of the oldest members,
isn't she?

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,720
An even

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,810
better question.

69
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,880
Miss Ruan

70
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,370
is a straightforward person.

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
She always uses

72
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,810
her real name online.

73
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
I see.

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,880
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,410
The subject is over. You're late.

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,250
Hey.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,930
Oh, right. Xiong Fei.

78
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,320
We are not WeChat friends, right?

79
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll add you.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,530
Alright.

81
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,720
Most of us

82
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,930
are not WeChat friends.

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,970
Let's add each other.

84
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,210
Here. I'll scan your QR code.

85
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,880
Sure, sure.

86
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,930
No one wants to be my WeChat friend?

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,130
We will. We will.

88
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,490
I'll add you.

89
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,970
Drinking alone?

90
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,040
Here.

91
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,880
Black tea?

92
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
How's my jacket?

93
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,410
Looks nice?

94
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,000
Pretty good.

95
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
Yan gave it to me.

96
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,490
It looks good.

97
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,320
Pretty cool.

98
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,250
It suits you.

99
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,490
You're upset.

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,440
You're jealous.

101
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,810
No, I'm not.

102
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,280
You are.

103
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,930
No way.

104
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,690
It really suits you.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,930
Alright, alright.

106
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,250
I have made enough fun of you.

107
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,250
Here's yours.

108
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,250
Same style.

109
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,850
Different size.

110
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,400
It's for you.

111
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:32,880
And

112
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,080
this bunch

113
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,560
of snacks.

114
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,320
I don't like any of these.

115
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
I can tell

116
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,370
that she bought these just for you.

117
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,080
Take them.

118
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,730
Yan bought these for me?

119
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,050
Why would I lie to you?

120
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,880
Happy? Hah, you're happy.

121
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,200
I tell you what,

122
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,810
your daughter

123
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,640
cares about you.

124
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,200
You're the father.

125
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,690
Be the bigger man.

126
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,250
Take some action.

127
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,850
I've had enough of your cold war.

128
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,490
Human life

129
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,050
is very short.

130
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,930
We don't have much time to waste.

131
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,690
Got it.

132
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, right.

133
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll go to a meeting tomorrow

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,130
at the civil affairs bureau.

135
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,490
About the assessment
of the new recruits,

136
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,810
you'll be in charge.

137
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,320
Unbelievable.

138
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,290
What a waste of my breath.

139
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,050
Yan's coming tomorrow,
and you're going away.

140
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,130
I don't have a choice.

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,730
Duty calls.

142
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,560
Also,

143
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,690
she doesn't want to see me anyway.

144
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,760
I'd better stay out of her sight.

145
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,290
Like father, like daughter.

146
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,170
You two are both good at

147
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
hiding true feelings.

148
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,050
I'm done.

149
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,640
Dr. Zhan.

150
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,200
You saw me.

151
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,810
Why didn't you say hello?

152
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,200
It's very late.

153
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,850
Yet you're still training, Mr. Luo.

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,520
Are you going to join
the rescue team?

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,690
But of course,

156
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,200
a lawyer's time is valuable.

157
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,290
Well, never mind.

158
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,730
I've got

159
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,850
used to

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,250
your way of speaking.

161
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,760
What? Am I wrong?

162
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,490
If you don't want to join us,

163
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,440
why are you training this late?

164
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,640
Once I set my mind,

165
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,930
I'll be the best.

166
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,960
Fine.

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
Truth be told,

168
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,730
it's a work need.

169
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,730
I'll have a negotiation

170
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,640
that concerns something

171
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,610
about disaster relief.

172
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,130
Alright, alright.

173
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,320
Mainly because

174
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,170
it's non-profit rescue.

175
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,370
I don't need your explanation.

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,490
You stunned not only the new recruits

177
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,170
but also me.

178
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Good job, son.

179
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,520
You act more and more like a captain.

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,320
You saw that, right?

181
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,370
Captain Qingshan was beside you,

182
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,640
and he didn't say a word.

183
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,850
It means,

184
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,850
you're good.

185
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,960
The training is tough.

186
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,960
Not giving up is already admirable.

187
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,810
Now, Luo Ben

188
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,930
has to swallow his pride.

189
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,250
You shouldn't pick on him.

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,250
Did I pick on him?

191
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,170
You didn't?

192
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,690
I did?

193
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,820
(Rice Cake & Mochi)

194
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,050
(Have you seen my brother?)

195
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,880
(He said he joined)

196
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,440
(your rescue drill as well.)

197
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,290
(It's so hard for me to believe it.)

198
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
(He trains hard.)

199
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,610
(He's an excellent recruit.)

200
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,370
Who is it?

201
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,090
Something's up.

202
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
(Of course.)

203
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,570
(My brother is awesome.)

204
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,570
(But he has a bad temper, though.)

205
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,850
(If he ever says anything offensive,)

206
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:11,920
(just ignore him.)

207
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,370
(No, no.)

208
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,640
(He's doing great.)

209
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,880
The midpoint of chest

210
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,730
is where we press.

211
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,570
The frequency

212
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,250
is 100 to 120 times per minute.

213
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,330
Cross your fingers.

214
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,160
Lay your palm on the midpoint
and press.

215
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,570
Don't bend your elbows.

216
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,610
They are to be perpendicular
to the ground.

217
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,370
The artificial respiration ratio

218
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,210
is 30 to 2.

219
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,330
Lady.

220
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:57,920
On the training ground,

221
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,520
you call me Coach or Dr. Zhan.

222
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,370
What is it?

223
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,210
Dr. Zhan, a training dummy?

224
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,370
That's unprofessional.

225
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,090
What is your problem?

226
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,010
Well,

227
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,800
I volunteer to be the victim,

228
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
and Dr. Zhan

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,330
will give us a demonstration.

230
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,160
What's so funny?

231
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,730
You don't know?

232
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,490
Artificial respiration is one part
of CPR.

233
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,610
So he gets to kiss Yan?

234
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,920
Right. Cheeky.

235
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,760
If it's difficult for you,

236
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,010
you can simply forget about what I said.

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:27,970
Here's common knowledge for you,

238
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,040
which you may not know.

239
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,520
CPR demonstration on living people

240
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,680
is strictly forbidden.

241
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,330
What about artificial respiration?

242
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,640
You should spend more energy
on learning professional skills

243
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,250
instead of making jokes.

244
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,520
Emergency rescue

245
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,610
is a serious matter.

246
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,010
Chen Xing.

247
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,490
Present.

248
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,450
Stand out.

249
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,800
Do a demonstration

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
of what I just taught you.

251
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,450
Wait a minute.

252
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,130
Go. It's an order.

253
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,800
Demonstrate.

254
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,850
He's murdering him,

255
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,520
you know?

256
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,730
Two times of artificial respiration.

257
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,250
F-For real?

258
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,040
Field training.

259
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,560
Instant noodles again.

260
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,450
The provisions are unbelievable.

261
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,450
Want a beef dice?

262
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,280
I think instant noodles are good.

263
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,800
You get good eating every day.

264
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,400
It's a change of diet for you.

265
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,640
I have had instant noodles
for two weeks.

266
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,370
Hey,

267
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,520
are we going to eat this
for every meal?

268
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,800
I think we are.

269
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,560
I have heard that there

270
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,760
aren't even instant noodles
in a real-life rescue.

271
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,210
Only bread, without water.

272
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,010
Without water?

273
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,760
Didn't you watch

274
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,450
the report on Fengxi rescue?

275
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,730
That was tough.

276
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,730
Here,

277
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,920
we got tents.

278
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,520
The armed police, fire fighters,
and the rescue team members

279
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,880
just slept on the ground.

280
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,970
When it rained,

281
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,560
they slept in water.

282
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,680
It's true.

283
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,850
I was in Fengxi.

284
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,730
I saw with my own eyes.

285
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,760
I was there, too.

286
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,130
What were you doing there?

287
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,130
He did what a rich man did.

288
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,400
And she was a drag.

289
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,250
You two make a good match.

290
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,130
Who's that?

291
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,500
(Linjiang Taxi)

292
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,040
Yuan.

293
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,610
What are you doing here?

294
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,520
You're such an angel.

295
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,730
I was just complaining about the food,

296
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,090
and you got me some nice stuff.

297
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:45,090
Let me see.

298
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,130
Chicken wings. Nice.

299
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,730
Hi, beautiful.

300
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm Zhou Mingming.

301
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,330
You can't touch her.

302
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,130
Let me introduce.

303
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,800
She's my good friend, Luo Yuan.

304
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,280
She's here with some good eating.

305
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,280
Let's share them.

306
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:58,800
Thank you, beautiful.

307
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,800
You're so nice.

308
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,560
Give me some.

309
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,330
Thank you so much.

310
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,760
Yuan.

311
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,610
You've grown up.

312
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,010
You can take care of me now.

313
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,880
Of all the disasters and accidents,

314
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,610
fire

315
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,280
is the most common

316
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,730
secondary disaster.

317
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,610
We, as a powerful
supporting organization

318
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,010
of the national emergency rescue forces,

319
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,090
are to stand ready all the time

320
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,330
and to work with the fire fighters…

321
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,090
Why did you give him to me?

322
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,450
He's too difficult for you?

323
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,680
No, with him,
the fire will be too difficult.

324
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,210
Work together more,

325
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,130
and you will get along eventually.

326
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,090
…crowd evacuation.

327
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,250
You'll be divided into four groups.

328
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,280
Complete the task

329
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,040
under your leaders' command.

330
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,970
Be careful.

331
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,800
If there's an accident,

332
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,730
Dr. Zhan and the medical team

333
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,490
will treat you at once.

334
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,280
Is there any other question?

335
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,450
No!

336
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,800
There's a gas explosion

337
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
in the Chinese food canteen on the
second floor of Friendship Hotel.

338
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,970
The fire is serious.

339
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,130
Currently, six people are stuck
in the building.

340
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,210
51 people need to be evacuated.

341
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,610
All the citizens in this drill

342
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,760
are played by professional
rescue team members.

343
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,880
We are to evacuate the residents

344
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
within 15 minutes.

345
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,970
Remember.

346
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,330
We only have 15 minutes.

347
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,090
15 minutes later,

348
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,010
there will be a chance

349
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,330
of a second explosion.

350
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,920
Do you understand?

351
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,880
Understood.

352
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,730
It is now

353
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,850
9:40 AM.

354
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,210
Scale-3 southeaster.

355
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,970
Relative humidity 62%.

356
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,920
You're given the plan. Action!

357
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,640
Yes, sir!

358
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,520
Don't make trouble for me.

359
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,450
You don't get in my way.

360
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,330
Group 1, in position.

361
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,370
Group 2, in position.

362
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,800
Group 3, in position.

363
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,680
Copy.

364
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:22,970
Split up.

365
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,040
Come on. Quickly. Quickly.

366
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:43,850
Quickly.

367
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,760
Come on.

368
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,250
Chen Xing, Wang Yu.

369
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,640
Record the personnel,

370
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,610
time,

371
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,640
and location.

372
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:57,800
Roger that.

373
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,970
Zhou Mingming, Ding Dingding.

374
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:00,970
You're backups.

375
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:02,280
Backup?

376
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,560
My turn at last.

377
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,010
A second explosion in the bakery

378
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,040
on the second floor of the hotel.

379
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,680
The fire has spread
to a residential building.

380
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,330
There's a fire on the third
and fourth floor.

381
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,130
9:46 AM.

382
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,090
A second explosion.

383
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,250
A fire in a residential building.

384
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,560
I thought it would be 15 minutes later.

385
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,400
There's no written script

386
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,450
for a disaster in real life.

387
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,850
So a drill

388
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,330
is to prepare you

389
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,400
for all emergency situations.

390
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,730
Do you hear that?

391
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,730
A real rescuer

392
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,210
has to stay collected. Got it?

393
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Captain,

394
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,090
due to the sudden fire,

395
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,370
one team member in group 1

396
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,330
is stuck on the fourth floor.

397
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,560
Calling for aid.

398
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,880
Copy.

399
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,560
Now, group 4's up.

400
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,490
Action!

401
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,250
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

402
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,800
Quickly.

403
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,040
- Stand back.
- Watch out.

404
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,920
Help me.

405
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,890
Quickly, quickly.

406
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,250
- Go, go, go.
- Come on.

407
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,250
Clear.

408
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:26,410
Group 2

409
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,600
has left the residential building.

410
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,800
A total of 35 citizens were evacuated.

411
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,970
- Quickly. Watch your steps.
- Be careful.

412
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,890
Quickly.

413
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,840
Help!

414
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,970
Help us!

415
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,600
Help us!

416
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,450
I can't move my legs.

417
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,250
Attention, everyone.

418
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,360
Three minutes left.

419
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,320
The fire is still spreading.

420
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,040
All members inside,

421
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,080
pull out immediately.

422
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,010
Quickly.

423
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Zhou Mingming.

424
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,890
Dingding, you go first.

425
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,650
I'll find another way.

426
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,410
Be careful.

427
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,410
I'm stuck on the third floor.

428
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,280
Calling for aid.

429
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,520
Cordage is outside

430
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,080
the window of room 304.

431
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,010
Go down from there.

432
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,890
All teams, pull out now.

433
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,040
Zhou Mingming,

434
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,210
descend now.

435
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,360
This will be your only chance
of survival.

436
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,560
It doesn't have to be so real,

437
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,170
Xiong Fei.

438
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,490
How about we pretend the fire is out,

439
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,690
so I can take the stairs?

440
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,170
Grab the cordage.

441
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,210
Take safety precautions.

442
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,010
Last minute.

443
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,210
Take it easy.

444
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,210
- Watch out. Be careful.
- Steady.

445
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,970
Mingming.

446
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,450
Be careful.

447
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,560
- Be careful.
- Take it easy.

448
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,890
Slow down, Mingming.

449
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,520
Be careful.

450
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,450
30 seconds.

451
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,760
Are you okay, Mingming?

452
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:34,760
How do you feel?

453
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,040
- Are you okay?
- Good job, son.

454
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,450
- Way to go.
- Awesome.

455
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,970
Luo Ben is still in room 506.

456
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,080
Dapeng.

457
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,800
Member of group 1 Luo Ben

458
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,690
is still in room 506.

459
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,320
Go, go, go.

460
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,890
Watch your steps.

461
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,450
Luo Ben, answer me.

462
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,170
Luo Ben, Luo Ben. Answer me.

463
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,320
Luo Ben, I order you

464
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,360
to pull out immediately.

465
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,890
Ten.

466
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,930
Nine.

467
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,080
Help!

468
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,010
Eight.

469
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,760
Seven.

470
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,450
Six.

471
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,490
Five.

472
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
Help!

473
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,840
Four.

474
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,650
Three.

475
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,690
Two.

476
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,800
One.

477
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
Rescue's over.

478
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,490
We lost Luo Ben.

479
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,760
I can't do this.

480
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,730
It'll be me

481
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,800
or him!

482
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,170
Dapeng, calm down.

483
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,840
Calm down.

484
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,010
Calm down.

485
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,600
Let me go.

486
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,080
Why did you disobey the order?

487
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,840
I told you, keep yourself safe

488
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,170
before saving

489
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,040
others' life.

490
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,450
If it was a real fire,

491
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,800
you'd be gone.

492
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,520
Scale-3 southeaster.

493
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,890
Relative humidity 62%.

494
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,170
A second explosion

495
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,120
is very unlikely to happen

496
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,170
when the fire fighters

497
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,730
put out the fire

498
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,760
around the building.

499
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,840
Even if there was a second explosion,

500
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,210
I would still have several minutes

501
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,120
to get them out.

502
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,280
It's only hypothetical.

503
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,280
But there's no hypothesis in real life.

504
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,730
And you know what?

505
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,800
Because you disobeyed the order,

506
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,930
your group got zero points.

507
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,410
What's more important,
scoring points or saving people?

508
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,450
Life matters the most!

509
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,250
Life matters the most.

510
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,930
You said,

511
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,930
"We save lives at the expense
of other lives."

512
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,360
I'm willing to risk my life

513
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,170
to save them.

514
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:07,520
Luo Ben!

515
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,930
Stop fighting! Calm down!

516
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,280
There are all kinds of possibilities

517
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,170
during a rescue.

518
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,120
Luo Ben has his own reasons.

519
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,890
If he refuses to change his attitude,

520
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,010
I don't think he needs to participate

521
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,840
in the following drills.

522
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,940
(Light Chaser Rescue)

523
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,450
I'll leave him to you.

524
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,080
Don't worry.

525
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,520
I know how

526
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,210
to deal with

527
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,250
rebellious recruits like him.

528
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,690
Your personal order?

529
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,520
You do care about him.

530
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,080
It's my job.

531
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

532
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,800
Your flask.

533
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,040
I told you to drink less.

534
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,210
We're on a mission, don't you know?

535
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,320
I won't drink, then.

536
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,410
Kiddo.

537
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,760
Come with me.

538
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,080
What?

539
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
I need your car to move some gear.

540
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,650
I have quit.

541
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,730
Ask someone else.

542
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,730
Who allowed you to quit?

543
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,450
Get in the car and get going.

544
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:40,210
Where did you

545
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,450
get all the gear?

546
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,250
We're funded

547
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,010
by the national
emergency management department,

548
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,600
and some corporations.

549
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,840
Some team members

550
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,760
pay for the gear as well.

551
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,690
Over the years,

552
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,010
all those things

553
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,690
have been our treasures.

554
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:56,650
Kid,

555
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,930
tell me

556
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,250
why you had to save the mother
and the boy?

557
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,170
Can I not answer?

558
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,560
Sure.

559
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,410
Everybody

560
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,560
has their own secret.

561
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,520
Are you drinking alcohol?

562
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,250
It takes away all the trouble.

563
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,930
You're quite humorous.

564
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,930
I had a tough life.

565
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,210
So I choose to enjoy

566
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,690
the rest of my life.

567
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,360
Kid,

568
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:39,600
stop here.

569
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,080
What's wrong?

570
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,120
Can I not answer?

571
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,040
I have my secrets as well.

572
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,260
(Beware of Electro Radiation)

573
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,600
Here.

574
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,760
All right, all right.

575
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,170
We'll talk when I'm home.

576
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,210
Here, here.

577
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,490
I gotta go.

578
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,170
Dr. Zhan.

579
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,410
Director Zhu, how is he?

580
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,690
Is he your friend?

581
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,490
He's like an uncle of mine.

582
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,170
It doesn't look good.

583
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,080
Look for yourself.

584
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,730
We'll see

585
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,040
the doctor very soon.

586
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,080
I asked the doctor.

587
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,490
It's not a big problem.

588
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,040
You're awake.

589
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,560
Where's the gear?

590
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,250
What?

591
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,650
My gear.

592
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,120
Is that all you think about?

593
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,890
It's in my car.

594
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,450
You collapsed,

595
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,560
and you're still thinking about the gear?

596
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,080
I'll call the team

597
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,170
and have it

598
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,120
moved to the headquarters.

599
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,120
Who else knows I'm in the hospital?

600
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,800
I didn't have time to tell anyone.

601
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,040
After you collapsed,

602
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,760
I only told Zhan Yan.

603
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,690
Want me to

604
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,560
call the team members?

605
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,170
OK.

606
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,080
No.

607
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,930
No, thanks.

608
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,080
I'm good.

609
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,600
I didn't sleep well,

610
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,210
so I fainted.

611
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,560
Alright, I'm off.

612
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,760
I've got business to do.

613
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,560
Wait a minute.

614
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,600
Where are you going?

615
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,450
Lie down.

616
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,040
I-I'm going to the bathroom.

617
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,080
Lie down.

618
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:45,970
Lie down.

619
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,080
Listen.

620
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,040
I-I'm okay.

621
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,930
I'm now informing you

622
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,080
as a doctor

623
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,560
that you'll have an operation tomorrow.

624
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,320
It's no big deal. An operation?

625
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,080
No.

626
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,650
I know what

627
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,890
problem I have.

628
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,210
You know?

629
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,080
Then why are you still
on the rescue team?

630
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,450
It's just a tumor. You…

631
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:11,970
You…

632
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,170
I have it checked, a benign one.

633
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,170
Who told you

634
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,320
that a benign tumor was safe?

635
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,280
Can I not have an operation?

636
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,320
I'll be careful.

637
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:22,690
No.

638
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,040
I think

639
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,080
you should listen to Dr. Zhan.

640
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,360
I've got work to do.

641
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,360
If you refuse to listen,

642
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,930
I will

643
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,320
tell your captain immediately.

644
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:30,930
No, no.

645
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,490
Please don't.

646
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:34,410
He mustn't know this.

647
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,320
How about this?

648
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:37,280
Let's make a deal.

649
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,080
You don't tell the captain

650
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,450
and everybody else on the team,

651
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
and I'll have the operation.

652
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,170
Otherwise,

653
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,080
I won't do it.

654
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,450
I'll arrange your
physical examination.

655
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,080
You knew

656
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,080
you were ill long ago.

657
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,930
So it has always been water

658
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,560
in the flask.

659
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,360
I almost lost this baby.

660
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,040
You keep the secret for me, kiddo.

661
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,840
Tell nobody

662
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
that I'll have an operation.

663
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,120
If anybody asks,

664
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,210
just say I'm tired

665
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:36,210
and resting at home.

666
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,210
Go, now.

667
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,040
You just lie down.

668
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,450
Don't worry, I'm a lawyer.
And a lawyer doesn't snitch.

669
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,930
All right. Just go. Go.

670
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,800
I've got a whole bunch of doctors

671
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,250
and nurses to look after me.

672
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,560
I don't need you here.

673
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,080
You'll have your test tomorrow.

674
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,650
What?

675
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,170
You're chickening out?

676
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,210
I'm not even sure

677
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,120
if the test means anything.

678
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,930
It doesn't sound like

679
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,040
something that you'd say,
Mr. Luo, the lawyer.

680
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,120
What?

681
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,600
If you don't show up,

682
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,810
they will think you're a coward.

683
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,330
This won't work for me.

684
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,520
Lie down.

685
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,080
I'll get your admission procedure done.

686
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,900
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

687
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,490
What?

688
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,370
Falcon's in a bad condition?

689
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:48,850
Yes, his hemangioma

690
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,970
is benign,

691
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,720
but it's on a bad spot,

692
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,850
and its size is large,

693
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:56,720
so it cannot be removed.

694
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,600
Ligation is the best option.

695
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,290
Once he's excited,

696
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,160
stimulated, tired

697
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,520
or traumatized,

698
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,520
his tumor may rupture,

699
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,850
and his life will be in danger.

700
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,290
You seem to care about him a lot.

701
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,770
He's like my family.

702
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,290
I can't believe I didn't know

703
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,520
he was so ill.

704
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,040
Don't worry.

705
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,560
If he's willing to receive treatment,

706
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
he will be fine.

707
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,520
Will you go somewhere with me?

708
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,240
Come on.

709
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:10,930
We're here.

710
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,330
This is it.

711
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,720
What are we doing here?

712
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,240
Whenever I feel

713
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:17,970
troubled,

714
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,770
I'll come here to sing songs.

715
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,120
So you brought me here
to sing songs?

716
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,890
A doctor

717
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,410
needs to learn

718
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,890
to adjust their emotions

719
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:28,560
to better

720
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
treat the patients.

721
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,810
My emotions are stable.

722
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,490
Just give it a go.

723
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,720
No.

724
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,010
It works great.

725
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,010
Come on.

726
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,290
In you go.

727
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,240
Sing a song.

728
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:58,290
Pick a song.

729
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,940

Thank you.

749
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,330
I do feel much better

750
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:17,240
after a song.

751
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,520
Dr. Zhan,

752
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,850
if you ever feel down again,

753
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,770
you can ask me out
to sing songs at any time.

754
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,680
Sure.

755
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,080
But I always think

756
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,040
you can handle your feelings

757
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,450
and emotions well,

758
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,240
I never expected

759
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,450
that you'd feel down, too.

760
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,720
The pressure can be heavy for lawyers.

761
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,640
Sometimes, a case

762
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,640
could determine

763
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,930
the future of a firm

764
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,520
or a person,

765
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,080
so

766
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:45,850
we lawyers need to learn

767
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,770
how to cope with stress.

768
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,850
I always thought

769
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,810
doctors were the most stressful ones.

770
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,970
Well, I guess we're the same.

771
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,680
That's why

772
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,720
we need to learn

773
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,330
to conceal

774
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,890
all the stress,

775
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,810
and all those

776
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,640
negative feelings.

777
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:06,970
We travel light.

778
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,680
That's how

779
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,970
we win.

780
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,200
Hello, Xiong Fei.

781
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,770
Why did the gear transportation

782
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,080
take you so long?

783
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,160
You went to have a drink?

784
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,370
You guessed it right.

785
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,640
I did go to have a drink.

786
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,370
Listen, I need to deal with

787
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,330
some personal stuff these days.

788
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,240
I'll get back a few days later.

789
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,970
You'll be in charge.

790
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,330
What's the matter?

791
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,600
Do you need my help?

792
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,520
No, no.

793
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,850
No big deal.

794
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,080
It's a small matter.

795
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,240
You take care of Bun-bun.

796
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,160
I got it.

797
00:40:58,410 --> 00:40:58,850
Oh, right.

798
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,330
No oily food.

799
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,720
He has a weak digestive system.

800
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,040
No problem.

801
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,330
Call me if you need anything.

802
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,850
Alright, bye.

803
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,810
Are you asleep?

804
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,010
Come on.

805
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,560
What?

806
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,970
Kebab?

807
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,240
Now?

808
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,520
You don't like instant noodles,
do you?

809
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,680
I looked it up.

810
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,490
Two kilometers along the path.

811
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,810
After a small forest,

812
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,720
there's a kebab shop.

813
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,770
Let's go.

814
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,640
Wait.

815
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,600
They're on patrol.

816
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,080
If we get caught, we…

817
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,160
No one's on patrol. They're gone.

818
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,680
We'll be back right after we finish.

819
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,850
Come on.

820
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,640
It's been three days.

821
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,410
Forget about it.

822
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,080
I'll pass.

823
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,200
What a wuss.

824
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:33,290
You go to bed.

825
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,600
