1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,748
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,104
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:22,304
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,480
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,912
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,440
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,488
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:48,408
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,540
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:02,260
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:08,860
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,480
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,220
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,380
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,840
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,040

19
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,040

20
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,310
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,990
Have any plans?

22
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,390
Just going home.

23
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,814
My dear Dr. Zhan, you don't have a date today?

24
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,890
Well, why didn't Luo Ben ask you out?

25
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,130
He seems to be a persistent guy.

26
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,731
- What do you want to eat? 
 - Are you gagging me?

27
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,990
Well, since you're so single-hearted, I'll tell you another trick.

28
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,170
When in a relationship, girls can be cared for and looked after, that's a definite.

29
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,750
However, love is a two-way street.

30
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,750
So girls should also care about their boyfriends.

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,918
Otherwise, who would like a piece of ice or wood?

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,870
- Eat or not? 
 - Sure. Go!

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,810
Good job, beginners!

34
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,130
Unexpectedly you've caught up with us.

35
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,010
We're not beginners, bro.

36
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,070
Though lacking in practice, in these programs, we're no worse than you.

37
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,554
Exactly.

38
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,942
Look at these disgruntled guys.

39
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,950
Don't talk big. Let's see what you got.

40
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,570
A game between the new and old?

41
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,150
- Can't wait to see it. 
 - Come on.

42
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,370
Well, I'm not taking advantage of you.

43
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,570
Two in a group, a mixture of old and new.

44
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,090
One ties the knot and the other jumps. Dare you?

45
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,690
Another will tie it for me?

46
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,170
Scared, aren't you?

47
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,410
The one who ties the knots may feel much more scared.

48
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,450
A minor slip-up leads to your partner's fall.

49
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,730
Great duty, isn't it?

50
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,190
We're competing for skills and trust.

51
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,430
- Are you in? 
 - Of course.

52
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,591
- Of course. 
 - One-month breakfast is on the loser.

53
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,770
Deal!

54
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,930
For over half a year, he has had free breakfast.

55
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,358
The good old days will be gone.

56
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:34,430
You're light-handed. Four in a team.

57
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,414
You need another one.

58
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,250
Isn't there a ready-made one over there? Luo Ben.

59
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,998
Why call him?

60
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,330
Regretful? Afraid of losing?

61
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,490
Coward.

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,690
Anyone except him.

63
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,730
No way.

64
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,230
I agree.

65
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,730
Bro, if you admit defeat now, there will be no need for a game.

66
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,430
Giving up? Me?

67
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,990
- Let's go? 
 - Let's go!

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,670
 Come on!

69
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,090
Luo Ben, let's have a game among the old and new.

70
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,051
Jumping alone with a safety rope.

71
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,330
I'm with Snail and you're with Peng.

72
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,030
You in?

73
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,290
If you don't mind, I'm okay with that.

74
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,870
Peng? Is that okay?

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,870
Don't pull a long face before your team members.

76
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,410
I'm afraid of falling to my death.

77
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,350
I'll jump.

78
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,930
The two old members take the initiative to jump.

79
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,970
Peng, if you're afraid, you can tie the knots.

80
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,394
Who's afraid?

81
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,930
Bring it on!

82
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,078
Quicker!

83
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,298
Bro, I'm going first.

84
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,510
Bro, just admit defeat.

85
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,598
Bro, breakfasts for a month.

86
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,342
Quit!

87
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,594
You're not fit for rescue,

88
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:30,002
not saving but harming people.

89
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,850
I'm happy to lose the game today.

90
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,290
At the price of one-month breakfast,

91
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,642
I know you're a good-for-nothing.

92
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:43,250
It's worth it.

93
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,750
I implicated you.

94
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,702
The bet is on me.

95
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,270
Brother Peng!

96
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,530
That was too much.

97
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,290
We were all newbies.

98
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,286
I agree. Who hasn't made mistakes?

99
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,926
Have you forgotten Falcon?

100
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,090
We get to have free breakfast for a month.

101
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,790
So nice.

102
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,730
Luo Ben, don't take it personally.

103
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,150
Actually, Da Peng is a person with a sharp tongue.

104
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,370
but a kind heart.

105
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,570
Yes.

106
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,130
I'm okay. Thanks.

107
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,170
All right. We have to leave now.

108
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,570
Okay.

109
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,290
I've undergone earthquakes twice

110
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,902
and in terms of psychological quality, I thought I was better.

111
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:32,742
But this time the stress seems to be overwhelming.

112
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,378
This is normal.

113
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,930
Many teammates, after joining in rescue operations,

114
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:43,230
will have PTSD.

115
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,486
Our team is armed with professional psychologists

116
00:08:46,486 --> 00:08:50,150
and it seems that just this afternoon there will be a sharing session.

117
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,558
If you're available, you can attend it.

118
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,878
I don't think I will go there.

119
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,006
Luo Ben, time can solve all problems.

120
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,230
Take your time.

121
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,198

122
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,350
Hello?

123
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,134
Knots?

124
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,210
You don't usually cook, what's this for?

125
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,858
You do.

126
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,206
I'm cooking?

127
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,578
Can't you?

128
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,450
Of course, I can.

129
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,006
If you want to eat, I can cook for you anytime.

130
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,338
You have to rescue and cook again.

131
00:10:01,338 --> 00:10:03,274
Really anytime?

132
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,582
Do you think I can still do rescue?

133
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,342
In fact, I didn't dare to be a doctor for a while.

134
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,770
I couldn't even do surgery.

135
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,070
 Buy-one-get-one-free.

136
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,730
Probably not long after I started working,

137
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,334
I wasn't experienced then.

138
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:25,890
I was performing an operation.

139
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,250
I don't know whether I was too confident or too nervous,

140
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,190
I didn't make a precise cut.

141
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,650
There was massive blood loss.

142
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,266
Luckily, my director was there and handled it,

143
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:39,710
or there would have been hell to pay.

144
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,690
I sat in the operating room all afternoon that day.

145
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,310
I didn't know where to go.

146
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,751
- Then? 
 - Then I hid myself from doing surgeries.

147
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:55,070
Or I just did some minor ones and left major ones to others.

148
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,674
At that time, I already felt that my career was over prematurely.

149
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,250
But you still held the line.

150
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,182
That's because I figured out the problem myself.

151
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,518
Do I want to be a doctor who saves lives or not?

152
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,998
The job itself is risky.

153
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:30,058
Instead of being over-cautious, I should be stronger.

154
00:11:30,058 --> 00:11:34,058
So I also need to put in more effort than others.

155
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:37,710
When they're on break, I'll use tweezers to peel grapes.

156
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,270
When they're shopping, sleeping, or having facials,

157
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,814
I was sewing pomelo peels.

158
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,250
Therefore, you ought to ask yourself, not me,

159
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,898
if you want to join operations or not.

160
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,218
Manman! Manman!

161
00:12:08,218 --> 00:12:10,430
- Boy, are you all right? 
 - Manman!

162
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,390
- All right? 
 -  I'm fine.

163
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,090
You scared me! Are you all right?

164
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,910
- Are you okay? 
 - I was too scared.

165
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,450
- His mom, aren't you? 
 - Yes.

166
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:19,930
Children are ignorant and can't be left out of your sight.

167
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,430
Yeah, thanks so much.

168
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,830
- Say "thank you". 
 - No worries.

169
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,130
Thank you so much.

170
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,630
My pleasure.

171
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,510
- Babe. 
 - Bye.

172
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,050
Is everything okay? Stay close to me.

173
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,350
Stay safe!

174
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,954
Many thanks.

175
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,478
It seems you've found the answer.

176
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,510
I don't think Luo Ben will show up.

177
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,734
Well, let's get started.

178
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,190
Hello, everyone. I'm Ruan Jingshu.

179
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,410
I'm very happy to host this sharing session.

180
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,710
At present, we have team members from Linjiang and

181
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,490
the team members from various provinces and cities who came to participate in the training.

182
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,230
Welcome to you all!

183
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,090
The theme today is regrets and growth in rescue.

184
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,090
I sincerely hope that you can share your stories.

185
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,366
Sharing is also a release.

186
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,830
I'll go first.

187
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,230
Welcome.

188
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,554
Before joining our team,

189
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:02,830
I was asked by one of my good friends to go hiking outdoors.

190
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,902
God knows.

191
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:09,210
It was freezing cold.

192
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,290
We developed hypothermia quickly.

193
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:18,202
I became a witness to his death, just in front of me.

194
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:21,641
He died.

195
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,550
I couldn't do anything.

196
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:31,206
If someone had checked the weather report, he would never...

197
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,950
After that, I decided to join the team.

198
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,482
Though I couldn't save my good friend,

199
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:48,782
joining the team would let me save more lives.

200
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,802
We're doing life rescue.

201
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:59,878
At times, we'll risk our lives to save people.

202
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,838
It said that the relationship between us

203
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:06,978
is life and death brothers.

204
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,358
No exaggeration.

205
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,642
Falcon's death really made us sad.

206
00:15:15,642 --> 00:15:18,484
As for Luo Ben, it'll be harder to overcome.

207
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,414
We have all made mistakes

208
00:15:23,414 --> 00:15:25,930
and we were unwilling to face it.

209
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:32,794
Just due to our mutual assistance, care, encouragement, and support,

210
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,998
our team can be what we are today.

211
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:42,950
I hope you can carry forward the tradition.

212
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,390
I really hope that you can share something with us.

213
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,602
I had this idea,

214
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:05,790
but it's too hard for me now.

215
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,322
I'm still looking for the kid.

216
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,378
Time to get up, Yuan.

217
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:16,038
Otherwise, you'll be late for work.

218
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,290
Yuan Yuan!

219
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,890
Yuan.

220
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,350
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

221
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,550
What's wrong?

222
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,610
Nothing. I thought I was the earliest.

223
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,982
Aren't you coming in?

224
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,430
Ding Dingding, well, as for Yuan's frequent visits,

225
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,462
has she said something to you?

226
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,090
Girls can talk about everything.

227
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,274
What do you mean?

228
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,270
Forget about what I asked.

229
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,742
You take your lunch to work?

230
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,076
Hello, I want the ten-yuan wonton.

231
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,434
Miss, you're so beautiful.

232
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,510
Thank you.

233
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,390
He is looking at you, Miss.

234
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,890
Hello?

235
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,906
Okay, got it.

236
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,134
Doubao is sick and needs to see a doctor.

237
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,910
 - I'll do it.  
 - You?

238
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,730
 After seeing the doctor, can I take him home?

239
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,310
Of course you can, but he'll be a bother to you.

240
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,010
 He won't.

241
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:10,942
 If you miss Doubao, I could bring him to you.

242
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,510
 Now, it's No.40, Zhangxing.

243
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,742
 Please go to Room No.5.

244
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:26,790
 Now it's No.41, Luo Ben.

245
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,202
 Please go to Room No.1.

246
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:35,510
 Now it's No.42, Yi Xuan.

247
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,650
 Please go to Room No.3.

248
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,402
What's the matter?

249
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,886
Why are you here?

250
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,490
If you aren't sick, you should leave.

251
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,350
Don't occupy public resources.

252
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,358
Three minutes.

253
00:20:57,358 --> 00:21:00,910
I cooked yam porridge for you, good for your stomach.

254
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,450
Eat it up within three minutes then I'll leave.

255
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,690
I can't. I'm working right now.

256
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,630
I cooked it for so long.

257
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,810
I promise at lunch, I'll eat it up.

258
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,658
Okay? Eat it all.

259
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,550
You promised or I'll be angry.

260
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,370
Good for you.

261
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:21,314
Next.

262
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,634
Don't forget it.

263
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,854
I'm leaving.

264
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:39,178
Mr. Luo, visiting a patient?

265
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:42,038
No, I brought breakfast to Zhan Yan.

266
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,090
 Wait a second.

267
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,690
 - Over there. Go ahead.  
 - Shen Ruoxi.

268
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,130
 Okay.

269
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,651
- What? 
 - Zhan Yan's new romance has come so fast.

270
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,130
Luo Ben sent her breakfast.

271
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,786
Please don't fuss.

272
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,290
It seems that I am still too conservative.

273
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,630
Yuan, I'm back.

274
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,210
Yuan! What're you doing?

275
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,330
Great, you should learn more English.

276
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,102
Your letter of admission is coming.

277
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:44,918
Get prepared for that...

278
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,454
Yuan.

279
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,338
Yuan, open the door.

280
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,386
What has happened over there?

281
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,690
I've said many times,

282
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:24,510
I don't object to your love of dogs, but you can't bring a dog home.

283
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,658
Let me in.

284
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,470
Doubao, here.

285
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:49,870
Eat more and grow stronger.

286
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,930
Don't make Falcon worried.

287
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,334
You miss him, too?

288
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,574
 Brother, please let it stay here.

289
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,250
Okay.

290
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,994
What do you want?

291
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,026
President Ming, any instructions?

292
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,150
Although the click rate of Light Chasers has increased in recent weeks, it is still far from our goal.

293
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,806
What's your opinion?

294
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:51,582
Report to Mr. Ming.  I have none.

295
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,750
You created it, but you don't know where it should go?

296
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,558
President Ming, I'm clocking in here every day and I've drained all my thinking power.

297
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,750
What should we do then?

298
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,510
If the popularity of the work does not increase, then I can only disband the comics department,

299
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,830
dismiss the employees,

300
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,426
and set up some other small goals.

301
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,230
- What? 
 - Could you be reasonable?

302
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,390
You ask me to serve tea and water here every day.

303
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,010
How can I be creative?

304
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,870
Do you think creations will come out themselves?

305
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,910
It's working not dreaming. You know?

306
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,950
What do you want?

307
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,470
From tomorrow on, I'll work at the scene.

308
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,074
As for these trivialities, I quit.

309
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:32,478
Okay.

310
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:37,470
- Do you agree? 
 - Yeah, sure.

311
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,490
See you.

312
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,430
Why is there a pair of shoes in the bag?

313
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,830
Let me see.

314
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,430
They are worn out.

315
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,470
Why don't you change to a new pair?

316
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,270
 They bring me luck.

317
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,390
 Whenever I wear them to a game, I always win.

318
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,358
Do you have a spare?

319
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,630
Leave these to me and I'll have them fixed.

320
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,910
They'll be as good as new.

321
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,130
You don't trust me?

322
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,991
Time for class. Don't be late.

323
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:49,298
 I'll help you close the booth after getting off work.

324
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,550
It's my mom's birthday. It will be a little earlier.

325
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,314
7:00.

326
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,490
Zhou Mingming.

327
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:35,790
You're still haunted and even followed me here.

328
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,990
Say how rare you are.

329
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,230
As a new team member, I came here to get training.

330
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,870
I should be included in your comic.

331
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,110
Could you choose a day when I'm not here?

332
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,350
Why?

333
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,710
We don't have a hidden relationship.

334
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,990
What's a hidden relationship?

335
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,634
Share it with us.

336
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:55,830
You should go to the hospital to check your hearing.  Hurry up.

337
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,010
What terrible hearing you have.

338
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,830
So bad-tempered.

339
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,090
Let's go.

340
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,410
All of you. Attention!

341
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,010
You all have busy schedules,

342
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,250
but you still spare your time for training.

343
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,800
Therefore, each of our training sessions should be high-standard, high-intensity, efficient training.

344
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,350
 Yes, sir.

345
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,670
Captain, we don't know where to start training.

346
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,706
Can you make a plan?

347
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,850
Currently, I also have a busy schedule, so I can't be here always.

348
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,850
Well, there should be a leader who will be informed of tasks.

349
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:37,170
Uncle, me. I can do this.

350
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,230
You belong to the Publicity Department. Don't make a fuss.

351
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,871
Not your business.

352
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,630
You?

353
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,250
Tell me the reason.

354
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,950
Uncle, you see.

355
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:50,366
Each of them needs training.

356
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:55,070
If one of them becomes the leader, the process would be hindered.

357
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,950
I'm available as I do some clerical work. Right?

358
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:01,230
What do you think of her?

359
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,190
Opposed.

360
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,450
- I think we're all males, so a female leader is quite good. 
  - Yeah.

361
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,070
Among us, it's hard to pick one.

362
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:13,330
- Yep. 
 - I agree.

363
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,118
Since you've reached a consensus, welcome.

364
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:20,998
Ding Dinging, you'll be the leader.

365
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,910
Thanks, Uncle. Thanks all.

366
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,610
I'll work hard!

367
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,858
Time isn't up, go on.

368
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,430
Why am I doing something different?

369
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,830
Because of your weak foundation and physical strength,

370
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,650
you need to start with the basics.

371
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,678
Who said that? Captain?

372
00:30:01,678 --> 00:30:03,950
I'm your leader now.

373
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,310
Just follow my orders.

374
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,990
You're getting revenge for your private wrongs.

375
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,350
I'm getting revenge for your private wrongs.

376
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,650
Give me some chips.

377
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,610
Why're you here? I decided to join the team.

378
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,230
You've rested so long.

379
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,250
Do a hundred sit-ups. I'm counting,

380
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,110
One.

381
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,230
Two.

382
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,954
Three.

383
00:30:28,954 --> 00:30:30,498
Four.

384
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:33,194
Can't you speed it up?

385
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,910
You did it on purpose, right?

386
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,274
Why were you so close to me?

387
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,510
I feel I'm deaf now.

388
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,910
Don't blackmail me.

389
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,310
Another one hundred! Or you can't leave.

390
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,930
You're getting revenge for your private wrongs.

391
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,150
I'll report to the captain.

392
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,566
Guess what, I'll tell my uncle.

393
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:52,630
A hundred!

394
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,950
I'm not afraid of you! Go ahead.

395
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,900

396
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,790
What's this?

397
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,154
 It's a birthday gift for your mom.

398
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,270
It's so nice.

399
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,390
My mom would love it. Thanks so much.

400
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,042
 Great.

401
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:30,770
 Today is your mom's birthday.

402
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:35,854
 Now let's clean up quickly so that you can go back home earlier.

403
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:42,490
Luo Yuan, if you are available today,

404
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,514
you can go back with me and celebrate it for her.

405
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,058
 Yeah, sure.

406
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,422
Here is my home.

407
00:32:07,422 --> 00:32:08,810
My dad.

408
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,990
Dad.

409
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,470
This is my friend. Where's mom?

410
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,630
Huahua!

411
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:20,030
I'm coming!

412
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,730
I can't open it. Open it.

413
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,386
Let me try.

414
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:30,362
She's my friend, Luo Yuan.

415
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,646
 Madam, Happy Birthday.

416
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,870
She said happy birthday to you.

417
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,286
This is her gift.

418
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,626
Thank you so much.

419
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,891
- Come and sit. 
 - Have a seat.

420
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,830
Let's have lunch together.

421
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,190
Mom.

422
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,430
- Get a set of tableware. 
 - My mistake.

423
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,110
Here. Take this one.

424
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,034
It's clean.

425
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,070
Try this dish, which is my mom's specialty.

426
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,670
Have a taste.

427
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:33,742
Please.

428
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:36,606
Now let's get a drink.

429
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,834
How is that?

430
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,266
Madam, this is really tasty.

431
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,566
She said it's very delicious.

432
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:56,270
Just eat more of this.

433
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,310
Home-made dishes are healthy.

434
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:01,990
If you wanna eat this, just tell me and I'll do it for you.

435
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,690
Good.

436
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,710
I also cook good dishes.

437
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,350
My dad cooked this.

438
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,550
- Have a try. 
 - And this.

439
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,010
Feel free to eat.

440
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,514
Try this.

441
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,890
Try some.

442
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,586
How is it? nice?

443
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,630
Happy birthday to Mom.

444
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,390
- My mom's birthday. 
 - Yes.

445
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,430
Happy birthday.

446
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,134
Thanks for your gift.

447
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,830
Yuan Yuan, have some fruit.

448
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,190
Let me peel the apple.

449
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,690
Sit down.

450
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,390
Stop doing this. Spend more time with her.

451
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,070
It's okay. Dad's there.

452
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,750
How could it be the same?

453
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,026
Luo Yuan won't mind it.

454
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,038
Tell me the truth. How long you've been dating?

455
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,310
Don't take this wrong, Mom.

456
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,690
We're friends.

457
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,770
Am I stupid?

458
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,510
She likes you.

459
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,678
Do you mind that she can't talk?

460
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:33,270
Though she can't speak, she is a good girl.

461
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,514
If you don't mind, I won't mind.

462
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:41,082
Though she has flaws, she doesn't mind your past experience.

463
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,026
I haven't told her about that.

464
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:57,562
Fei, whatever your future holds,

465
00:35:57,562 --> 00:35:59,842
you can't keep that a secret.

466
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,158
I know.

467
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:42,502
My mom said when you're available you can visit them.

468
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,630
 How about you?

469
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,646
Luo Yuan, there is something...

470
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,322
I have to tell you.

471
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,230
I've been in prison before.

472
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,110
I was a college student then.

473
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,478
I saw my sister being assaulted.

474
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,114
I don't want to hide anything or fool you.

475
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,118
 I already knew about your past,

476
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,922
 but I don't care.

477
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,782
 i only care about how you feel about me.

478
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,140
 I...

479
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,540
 like you.

480
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,318
You really expressed your feelings?

481
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,350
You've won my admiration.

482
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,574
I didn't expect for you to be so brave.

483
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,566
It never occurred to me that you would like that blockhead.

484
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,630
Well, in front of you, I won't never speak ill of him.

485
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,898
Can you tell me his reaction?

486
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,254
 He's uch a blockhead.

487
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,786
 Keep it secret.

488
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,150
No worries. I'll keep it confidential.

489
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,314
I already figured out that your brother is not satisfied with him.

490
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,142
Don't worry, I'll be on your side.

491
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,950
Cheers.

492
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,210
You help with Xiong Fei's diner every morning.

493
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,710
What if it's discovered by your brother?

494
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,771
 He studies late every day and leaves no time for me.

495
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:45,450
He is so excellent and still learns hard.

496
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,206
Just leave no room for others.

497
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,022
He is so competitive.

498
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,958
 He's practicing rescue skills.

499
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:59,302
Well, I think I should work harder.

500
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:01,710
I'll do a hundred sit-ups. Keep counting.

501
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,874
or I can't sleep.

502
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:05,210
Three.

503
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,650
Four.

504
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,190
Steady on it!

505
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,470
Use your feet!

506
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,750
Hold to it.

507
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:13,206
Safety first!

508
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,410
Right!

509
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,050
Good!

510
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,562
Well-done!

511
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,142
Zhou Mingming, what're you doing?

512
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:30,390
Keep training!

513
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,950
I want to do a warm-up first.

514
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,011
Hurry up. You're always slacking off!

515
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:36,058
No, I'm warming up.

516
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,610
Zhou Mingming, why are you so late?

517
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,310
Are you calling your leader by his name?

518
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,150
You're the leader in the company, but we're teammates here.

519
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,150
Take a photo.

520
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,771
- What for? 
 - Publicity.

521
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:56,710
For the photos in the brochure.

522
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,942
People will know we're professional.

523
00:40:59,942 --> 00:41:02,190
That's great. Take photos of me.

524
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,250
- Bro, Bro, excuse me. 
 - Take care.

525
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,910
How is this? this posture?

526
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,290
so cool. Get my sunglasses.

527
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,410
I'll get them.

528
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:10,650
I'm photographing your training, not your poses.

529
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,250
Such a fool.

530
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:14,850
Let's try Speed Drop. That's cooler.

531
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,550
I already did.

532
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,610
What? Whose?

533
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,130
Wukong.

534
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,290
Try the cutting machine. Removing barriers.

535
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,098
Hard-core.

536
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:26,750
I already did.

537
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,538
What else have you not shot?

538
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,670
Ah, tires.

539
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,990
Moving tires and doing sit-ups, push-ups, and pull-ups.

540
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,730
You did this on purpose.

541
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,290
You've shot great scenes for others, and there is nothing left for me. Right?

542
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:45,950
Who made you come so late?

543
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,731
Shoot or not? I'll report it to my uncle.

544
00:41:48,731 --> 00:41:50,890
I'll do it, okay? I'll do that.

545
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,510
 One. Two. Three.

546
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,900
 Four.

547
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,760
Hold on. Keep this posture.

548
00:41:57,762 --> 00:41:59,430
Go on.

549
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:05,850
 Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

550
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,566
 Nine.

551
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,534
 Ten.

552
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,330
 - Eleven. 
 - Come on!

553
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,830

554
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,850
 - Good. 
 - Great. Well-done.

555
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,630
 That's great.

556
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,130
 Come on.

557
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,178
 Come on.

558
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,350
 Go, Zhou Mingming.

559
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,771
Hold on! Stay still.

560
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:39,090
You look so handsome.

561
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,350
Wait. Let me focus.

562
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:53,130
Hurry up. Be quick.

563
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,430
Be quick.

564
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,050
- Out of focus, wait! 
 - Hurry up.

565
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,330
Again.

566
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,170
Wait, wait. Try more angles.

567
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,130
This posture, is really cool.

568
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,638
Quicker!

569
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:12,011
- Finished? 
 - It's so real.

570
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:13,630
Wait a second.

571
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:25,930

572
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,792
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

573
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:43,446
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

574
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:52,084
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

575
00:43:52,084 --> 00:43:57,750
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

576
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:05,954
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

577
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:13,570
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

578
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:20,960
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

579
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:28,350
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

580
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:36,970
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

581
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:43,400
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

582
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:52,100
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

583
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:59,600
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

584
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,324
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

585
00:45:03,324 --> 00:45:07,256
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

586
00:45:07,256 --> 00:45:10,954
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

587
00:45:10,954 --> 00:45:14,640
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

588
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,350
♫  I can't fly  ♫

589
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,104
♫  But I can look up  ♫

590
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:29,730
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
