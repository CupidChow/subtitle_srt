1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,760
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,104
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

3
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:21,816
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,464
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

5
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:35,634
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,250
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,420
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,550
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:02,150
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

12
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,850
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,400
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,130
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

15
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:28,280
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,050
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

17
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,940

18
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,350

19
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:49,430

20
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:55,240

21
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,636
Come in, please.

22
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,419
What's up?

23
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,680
Dean, I have to talk with you about Fengxi.

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,579
Your wound is recovered. And you're recovering from the operation.

25
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,079
Uncle Zhan, after a few days, you can soon be discharged.

26
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,479
Okay.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,928
Dr. Zhan didn't make the rounds today?

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,280
She has work to do.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,400
I think you can get some rest now.

30
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,419
I guess Zhan Yan wants to go to Fengxi.

31
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:41,060
To be honest, nobody wants her to leave.

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,700
Fengxi?

33
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,060
I know that.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,480
Now that you've made your decision.

35
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,799
I respect your choice and I'll explain it to him for you.

36
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,396
I believe he can understand you.

37
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,679
Thank you, Dean.

38
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,639
I was just coming to see you.

39
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,355
Are you still leaving?

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,940
You just ignore what your father said, right?

41
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,900
Do you really feel nothing connected to him?

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,976
Are you so hasty to go there and start your career?

43
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,312
He just had surgery, Zhan Yan.

44
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,039
It's okay if you don't care about me, but he's your father.

45
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,979
You've lost his affection for ten years. How much time can you continue to lose?

46
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:35,947
I won't lose anymore.

47
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:38,804
What do you mean by that?

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,132
I said I won't leave.

49
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:43,979
I've told the dean.

50
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:46,863
He'll explain to Professor Coben.

51
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you serious?

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,072
What's good if I lie to you?

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,859
Then tell me who you made the decision for.

54
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,820
For your father? Or me?

55
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,339
- Is that important? 
 - Very important.

56
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:07,620
I have to know if I'm your concern when you made the decision.

57
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,279
So you aren't satisfied with this answer.

58
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:17,280
Forget it.

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,919
You don't have to.

60
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,056
If not for your father, I guess you'd be in Fengxi already.

61
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,020
Why are you laughing?

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,440
Laughing at a cute you.

63
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,780
So it's your adult love.

64
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,999
You're totally a young boy,

65
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:39,020
a jealous young boy.

66
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,979
Who's jealous? I'm not jealous.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,980
Take it easy, it's a dinner.

68
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,839
Kiss me. Kiss me and I won't be nervous.

69
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,620
Let's go.

70
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,920
Where's your room?

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,611
Upstairs.

72
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,979
Mingming.

73
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,399
Mom. Dingding has come to see you, Mom.

74
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,292
Hello, Aunt.

75
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,519
I don't think we invited her.

76
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,460
Mom, remember? I told you about that.

77
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,619
Dingding knows today's your birthday, so she came to your celebration.

78
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:39,140
She bought a gift for you.

79
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,519
Aunt, I don't know what your favorite is.

80
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,160
I chose this oral liquid for beauty.

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,636
I heard it's good at preventing wrinkles.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,092
Preventing wrinkles?

83
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:51,268
How old do I look?

84
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,204
I don't mean that.

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,560
You know what?  I never bought my mother a precious health product like this.

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919
My mother is afraid that you will spend money indiscriminately. You don't have to be so polite in the future.

87
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,159
I'll make it up for you next time.

88
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,956
Promise?

89
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:09,000
What? You want me to invite you again?

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,303
Coming, coming.

91
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,652
Mom, sit down.

92
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,920
Mom, you and Dingding know little about each other.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,259
If she can often come here, she will know what you like.

94
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,991
I don't think everyone can come and see me.

95
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,299
Dingding, sit. Here.

96
00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:41,232
Chairman. Mingming.

97
00:06:41,232 --> 00:06:42,899
Qiqi's here.

98
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:46,479
I told you to call me Aunt at home.

99
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm so sorry. I'm late. I'm stuck in heavy traffic.

100
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,476
Happy birthday.

101
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,000
You know me most.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,260
Yes. I'm in my 50s.

103
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,159
It's time to take care of my health.

104
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,668
Come here.

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,751
Sit here.

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,143
It's totally different.

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,079
I'd like to propose a toast.

108
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,619
Today, we have Dingding and Ai Qi with us.

109
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:16,279
Let's wish Ma Ruifen a happy birthday.

110
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,279
Cheers.

111
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,639
Aunt, happy birthday.

112
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,484
Thank you.

113
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,340
- Help yourself. 
 - Sure.

114
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,480
- Dingding, this is the signature of our house... 
 - Mingming.

115
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,700
Mom, please eat some.

116
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,560
It's your favorite. A sour-sweet taste.

117
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
Today's your birthday. Enjoy yourself.

118
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,883
It's a happy day for you.

119
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,320
If you find a contented girlfriend, I'll be happier.

120
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:59,044
Aunt, I'm not good at choosing gifts.

121
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,660
No offense at all.

122
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,120
Today, I come here to celebrate your birthday sincerely.

123
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:06,223
Happy birthday.

124
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,627
Thanks.

125
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,820
Dingding, how can you drink it up? You know you can't drink.

126
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,180
Mingming.

127
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,224
She wants it. Let her drink.

128
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,650
Qiqi.

129
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,884
Eat more.

130
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:34,395
Eat some and you'll be fine.

131
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:36,223
You don't need to.

132
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,500
I'll take it myself.

133
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,580
They're all the best dishes of our housemaid. Have a taste.

134
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,199
Mingming, eat your dishes.

135
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,108
All right. I'm eating, Mom.

136
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,400
Dingding, don't drink anymore.

137
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,107
Leave me alone.

138
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,780
Let me go.

139
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,220
- Cheers. 
 - Sure.

140
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,611
Dingding, do not drink.

141
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,710
Dingding.

142
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,940
Dingding!

143
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,320
Mom, what do you want?

144
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,360
Dingding!

145
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,781
- She knows no civility. 
- Are you okay, Dingding?

146
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,539
Dingding.

147
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,779
Dingding.

148
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,359
Why drink so fast? Why overexert yourself?

149
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:51,639
Do you feel better now?

150
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,400
Not anymore.

151
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,851
Your mother was so mean to me.

152
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,479
Why did she treat me and her totally differently with the same gifts?

153
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,372
It's my fault.

154
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,804
I didn't expect her to be like that.

155
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,536
I shouldn't have come and bothered her.

156
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:13,940
I vexed her. And I'm not feeling good.

157
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,300
Dingding, it's not your fault. I asked you to come.

158
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,136
I just feel it's very hard.

159
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,419
Dingding, you've done your best.

160
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:38,720
Leave the rest to me.

161
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,719
Totally a new house.

162
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,719
I even can't say it's my room.

163
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:32,359
Luo Ben, thank you.

164
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,359
A good deed never leaves a name.

165
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,639
I can't take that credit.

166
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:42,139
You had an operation and hurt your scapula.

167
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:43,959
You need to get some rest.

168
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,719
Your bed was too hard for you.

169
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,460
So I bought a new mattress.

170
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,640
You didn't need to do that.

171
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm used to the old one.

172
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,560
It's different.

173
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,983
Have a try.

174
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,740
Here.

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,200
How is it? Is it comfortable?

176
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,759
Yes, very good.

177
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,079
Our Dr. Zhan is meticulously considerate of her patients.

178
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,540
Totally devotes herself to work.

179
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,899
I think I should award a banner to her on behalf of our team.

180
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,479
That's good.

181
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,703
I will hang it in my office.

182
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,284
I guess Dr. Zhan never blushes.

183
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,600
I have a lot to settle with you.

184
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Sure.

185
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,680
All right. Now we have a brand new room.

186
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,160
It's only lacking something to eat.

187
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,959
We don't have any food.

188
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,280
Guess what.

189
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm going to buy some food.

190
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,975
It's a good time for you to catch up with her.

191
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,432
I'm leaving.

192
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,659
Yan, don't be busy yourself.

193
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:08,919
I'll do it by myself.

194
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:11,320
Get some good rest for yourself.

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,680
You've just undergone the surgery.

196
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,520
Mind yourself when you get up and turn over.

197
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,200
Don't pull your wounds.

198
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,728
I'll make porridge for you.

199
00:13:20,728 --> 00:13:24,300
I'll take your word.

200
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,620
Here's the doctor's advice. You can see his advice on medicine and tips.

201
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,839
For a while, get some good rest.

202
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,639
Don't get out of bed, and exercise less.

203
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,680
I see.

204
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,620
I have to go to the hospital.

205
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,460
I'll see you off.

206
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,359
I just said, don't get out of bed.

207
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:04,112
Okay, I'll listen to you.

208
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,648
I'll go, Dad.

209
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:26,199
Thanks.

210
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,560
All I did is for him, not for you.

211
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,040
Are you serious you want to talk like this?

212
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,591
Like what?

213
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,100
Okay.

214
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,719
What?

215
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,239
Settling scores.

216
00:14:39,239 --> 00:14:42,700
You said you have a lot to settle with me.

217
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,340
I'm not sure how to figure it out.

218
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,740
Take me to the hospital.

219
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,999
That's a bummer. I have to go to my office.

220
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,839
It's out of my way.

221
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,575
You're such a meany.

222
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,079
I'm a meany?

223
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,688
Or what?

224
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,807

225
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,619
What are you reading at work?

226
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,859
Director Zhan, please don't blame me.

227
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:22,770
I just helped you.

228
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,400
Your reconciliation with Uncle Zhan is all on Luo Ben and me.

229
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,719
You're lucky you met my father.

230
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,970
But if it was someone else, you would have been scared and had an accident.

231
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,673
No, I wouldn't. Luo Ben said that Uncle Zhan was used to life and death while doing rescue work.

232
00:15:35,673 --> 00:15:37,440
Mental endurance is definitely possible.

233
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,159
You believe everything he says, right?

234
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:42,479
Of course. I know very well what he's done for you.

235
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:46,200
Believe me, love is a mutual feeling.

236
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,220
A man paying forever is not going to work.

237
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,640
You have to be active.

238
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,459
Or you'll regret it when you lose him.

239
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,719
Reciting what you just read?

240
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,800
Confiscated.

241
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,268
I haven't finished it.

242
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,676

243
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:34,219
It's more than words.

244
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:37,988
Brothers forever.

245
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,079
Brothers forever.

246
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,419
What do you want to practice?

247
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:57,239
I'll be with you.

248
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,379
Seriously?

249
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,319
You really talk big.

250
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,279
Do you want to compete with me? You know the rules.

251
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,740
Sure.

252
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,719
Get ready to pay for dinner.

253
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,060
Luo Ben. Peng.

254
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,479
We're waiting for you. Come here.

255
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:13,440
 Now, come on.

256
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,275
 Come on, man.

257
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,071
Does my BP look fine?

258
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,412
Not a big problem for a while.

259
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,011
I can't go anywhere but stay in this house.

260
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,619
Without my permission, you can't rescue anyone.

261
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,139
Okay, I won't. It's all on you.

262
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:52,280
I won't go back to the team.

263
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,319
I was busy and didn't have time.

264
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,719
Now I'm resting,

265
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,599
I have to hurry up.

266
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,924
What do you want to do?

267
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,340
Yan.

268
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:13,563
Do you remember the child I mentioned?

269
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,607
I rescued him from the earthquake.

270
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:20,280
Do you remember him?

271
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:24,507
I've read the report.

272
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,808
Only if I find him,

273
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:34,147
tell him all the truth and get his forgiveness, can I let it go.

274
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,559
So you have been looking for him?

275
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,599
Yes.

276
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:44,223
On the site, I handed the child to the doctors.

277
00:19:44,223 --> 00:19:46,719
Then I heard he was in a welfare house.

278
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:49,319
They said he had been adopted,

279
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,840
and his new family didn't want to be disturbed.

280
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,964
So it was a dead end.

281
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,940
I went to the newspaper office and the publishing house.

282
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,120
But they didn't save all the data.

283
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,435
I haven't found anything useful so far.

284
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,300
It's an age of the internet.

285
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,419
Don't worry. We can find him.

286
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,216
Leave it to me.

287
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,440
I haven't made noodles for a long time.

288
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,999
It seems they won't be very good.

289
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,816
It looks delicious.

290
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:36,019
I'll try them.

291
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,195
It's good.

292
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:53,840
I think I should order takeout for you.

293
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
Why bother?

294
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,120
It's very good. I mean it. Delicious.

295
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,959
How it tastes doesn't matter.

296
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:08,260
It's a bowl of noodles made by my daughter. That matters.

297
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,219
It's irreplaceable.

298
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,820
- Hello, how can I help you?  
 - Is Luo Ben here?

299
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,519
Mr. Luo? Please wait a minute.

300
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,980
Sister-in-law.

301
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,239
Looking for Luo Ben?

302
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,140
Follow me.

303
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,830
- Thanks. 
 - Okay.

304
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:46,999
This way, please.

305
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,020
Luo Ben. Come here.

306
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,159
Luo Ben. Guess who has come?

307
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,799
Why are you here in my office?

308
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:02,759
A day off. May I have dinner with you?

309
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:04,619
I have to work overtime tonight.

310
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:05,799
What case do you have?

311
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,239
What case has to be dealt with tonight?

312
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,959
Yan is a rare visitor to our office.

313
00:22:09,959 --> 00:22:12,230
Shall we eat together?

314
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,840
Don't jeer at me.

315
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,039
If you talk like that, then I won't cover it for you.

316
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,459
Attention, please.

317
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:20,619
Come here now.

318
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,999
I have important news to announce.

319
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:28,283
Our Partner Lou and Dr. Zhan will be getting married soon.

320
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,239
 Really?

321
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,996
All of you look... Proof.

322
00:22:34,996 --> 00:22:36,579
Bravo, Partner Luo.

323
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:38,580
Gao Junchi, you're getting annoying.

324
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,090
Excuse me.

325
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,080
It's important proof.

326
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,720
I have it on my phone and backed up in the Cloud.

327
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,340
I suggest Partner Luo give us a dinner party.

328
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,920
 - Wow. 
 - Party. Party.

329
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,659
What party?

330
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,835
Everyone has to stay here and work late tonight.

331
00:22:57,719 --> 00:22:59,799
I'll pay for the snacks.

332
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,980
You can work overtime with snacks.

333
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,375
 Okay.

334
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,700

335
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,190

336
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,380
You're still here.

337
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,799
I'm doing some research.

338
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,400
No date with Luo Ben?

339
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,080
What do you mean?

340
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,780
I think you're not busy.

341
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,419
Let's hang out.

342
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,039
Do you miss Gao Junchi?

343
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:44,791
I don't miss him at all.

344
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,519
He likes pretty girls.

345
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,280
So shallow.

346
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,300
He's an interesting man at most.

347
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,120
Drinks and talks big.

348
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,539
Nothing else.

349
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,400
So you don't fancy him.

350
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,072
So let's forget about it.

351
00:24:06,099 --> 00:24:08,639
Let's hang out together, I'll accompany you.

352
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,020
Exactly.

353
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,859
You want to date him? Just tell me.

354
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,900
You don't have to be polite with me, right

355
00:24:25,893 --> 00:24:28,181

356
00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:32,180
- Hello. 
  - Are you free this evening?

357
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,400
It's a tight night.

358
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,999
Ruoxi and I can knock off early today.

359
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:42,563
We want to have dinner with you and Gao Junchi.

360
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,919
Shen Ruoxi wants to have dinner with Gao Junchi.

361
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:51,284
I think we should make a good chance for them.

362
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,887
We have a meeting tonight.

363
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,823
I see. Take your time.

364
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,880
I didn't mean to attract her, but I'm so charming.

365
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,699
She just can't forget me.

366
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:13,319
My fault.

367
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,499
Then you can finish your work tonight.

368
00:25:16,499 --> 00:25:20,899
I lied to Zhan Yan for you.

369
00:25:20,899 --> 00:25:22,279
You have to pay me for takeout.

370
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,080
Takeout is not enough.

371
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,239
A small lie for delight, get it?

372
00:25:26,239 --> 00:25:28,120
Love work and love life more.

373
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,879
Tonight, I'll teach you that.

374
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,060
Let's go.

375
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,260
Listen, I know a brilliant restaurant.

376
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,400
Luo Ben is really outrageous.

377
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,819
I have to teach him a lesson.

378
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:42,512
You invited him first.

379
00:25:42,512 --> 00:25:44,620
He hastened down those steps.

380
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,200
That's not good. People are still climbing.

381
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
He is not afraid of climbing higher and falling harder?

382
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,519
Anyway, there's no chance for you to teach him tonight.

383
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,019
He has a meeting. You heard that.

384
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,640
I don't care. You're free tonight.

385
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm not on the night shift. We have to take our time.

386
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:02,859
Where are you going?

387
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:08,731
Then let's go to a romantic place?

388
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,620

389
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,040
 Bravo!

390
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,179
Go and sing a song.

391
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:32,600
Me?

392
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,959
Oh, come on.

393
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,920
You're uptight.

394
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,559
We should work hard during work hours,

395
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:40,059
and enjoy ourselves when we're free.

396
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:42,059
I need to use the lady's room.

397
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,580
Cheers.

398
00:26:57,999 --> 00:26:59,599
You know what?

399
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,059
A woman is a fallow deer, and a man is a hunter.

400
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,519
A hunter chases and a deer runs.

401
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,280
When the hunter is tired and stops chasing, the deer will stop too and look back at you.

402
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,120
So, the more you fancy a woman, the slower you should chase her.

403
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,999
You have to lead her by a rope.

404
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,300
When you need a tight rope, tighten it up.

405
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,239
If you need a loose one, loosen it.

406
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:27,048
When it's time to pull it, you should pull it.

407
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,880
You mean I'm a hunter and Zhan Yan is a deer.

408
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,840
Yes. If you realize it, you will get enlightened.

409
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,899
So it's a good choice to refuse her tonight.

410
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:00,939
You have to play with her. It's called playing hard to get.

411
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,999
Don't worry about a deer running.

412
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:12,471
If the hunter wants, he can...

413
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,655
Zhan Yan?

414
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,199
Zhan Yan.

415
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:27,944
I didn't expect your meeting means a party in this music bar.

416
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,139
I just wanted to hang out with Mr. Gao.

417
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:34,659
Go on.

418
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,792
Zhan Yan.

419
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,420
Zhan Yan!

420
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,919
Zhan Yan.

421
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,800
Zhan Yan.

422
00:28:45,899 --> 00:28:48,599
Don't bother to come any further, Hunter. There's no deer here.

423
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,399
You are chasing the wrong one.

424
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,519
Don't listen to his nonsense.

425
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,059
It's a joke. Don't take it seriously.

426
00:28:58,059 --> 00:28:59,319
Of course, I didn't take it seriously.

427
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,940
But you did it.

428
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,379
You said you had a meeting.

429
00:29:02,379 --> 00:29:04,099
But you're here.

430
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,120
I see.

431
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,560
It's what's called playing hard to get.

432
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:09,579
I was wrong.

433
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,799
How can you be wrong? I am in the wrong.

434
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:13,880
Obviously I was wrong, I am not sincere in admitting my mistakes.

435
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,540
It's all my fault.

436
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,760
Zhan Yan. Zhan Yan.

437
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,900
Zhan Yan!

438
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,639
Zhan Yan.

439
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,319
Listen to me.

440
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:33,640
I'm sorry. I'm wrong this time.

441
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,819
I am too petty.

442
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:37,579
I...

443
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:41,460
I'm bitter about your private decision to go to Fengqi.

444
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,508
That's all because I love you.

445
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,519
I care about my place in your heart.

446
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,719
And I want to prove it.

447
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:53,019
I'm ignoring you, that's because...

448
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,839
In a word, Zhan Yan,

449
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,959
I regret every time I reject you.

450
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:05,811
I can't wait to find you the next moment... I...

451
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,847
♫  Everyone has his own story  ♫

452
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:33,662
♫  We are all chasing a better life  ♫

453
00:30:33,662 --> 00:30:38,920
♫  Time slows down as you pass by  ♫

454
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:43,311
♫  I'm longing to see you again  ♫

455
00:30:47,186 --> 00:30:53,940
♫  We all have our dreams in this world  ♫

456
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,460
♫  I'm only thinking about you  ♫

457
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,860
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

458
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,200
It's good.

459
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,519
But her figure is a pity, not matching the voice of an angel.

460
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,020
What a shame.

461
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,720
Let's go.

462
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,199
You judge her by appearance.

463
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:24,003
♫  I love you as you love me  ♫

464

466
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,172
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

467
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:49,940
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

468
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,920

469
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,426
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

470
00:31:57,426 --> 00:32:04,538

00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:17,126

472
00:32:17,126 --> 00:32:20,279
♫  me like that  ♫

473
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,250
 Bravo. Brilliant.

474
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,760
 Bravo.

475
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,920
May I sit here?

476
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,780
Of course, please.

477
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,400
Do you want something to drink?

478
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Sure.

479
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,280
You sang beautifully.

480
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,499
What you just sang is the best version I've ever heard.

481
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:03,000
- Thank you. 
 - Here's to you.

482
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,060
Are you a regular singer here?

483
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,299
Am I singing so professionally?

484
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:24,216
Shen...

485
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:28,183
Shen... Shen Ruoxi?

486
00:33:35,879 --> 00:33:37,239
- Morning. 
 - Partner Luo.

487
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,296
Morning, Old Gao.

488
00:33:39,296 --> 00:33:41,459
Were you all right last night?

489
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,540
Seeking some pleasure?

490
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,379
Sorry to let you down.

491
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:46,999
I'm worried about you.

492
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:49,120
But you're lit up with joy.

493
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,840
I was overthinking it.

494
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,995
- Last night Shen Ruoxi and you... 
 - Here is the lift, please.

495
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:02,500
 Recently, there has been a continuous heavy downpour in Linjiang City.

496
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,039
 Thousands of people have been affected.

497
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,079
 Military personnel, armed police, firemen,

498
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,939
 and NGO of charitable rescue who have come forward to fight overnight.

499
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:13,108
 As of now, rescue is still in progress.

500
00:34:13,759 --> 00:34:15,504
Here!

501
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,539
We shall move the tree first. Thank you a lot.

502
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,279
- Okay.  
 - Okay.

503
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,839
One, two, go. One, two, go.

504
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,040
One, two, go.

505
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,359
Okay, put it down.

506
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:43,599
Master!

507
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,279
Move your car to the side.

508
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,872
Okay.

509
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,019
Push the car.

510
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:51,319
Okay.

511
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,860
Go.

512
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,239
Go now. One, two, go.

513
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,340
One, two, go. One, two, go.

514
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:03,744
Go over there.

515
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,079
Hello? Hello?

516
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,972
You know...

517
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,200
I was fooled into a ruthless pyramid scheme.

518
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,239
Friends and relatives were cheated by me.

519
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:56,520
I was just discharged from prison.

520
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,680
I don't have money to pay it back, and I can't go back.

521
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,699
I want to find a job in Linjiang.

522
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,847
Why didn't you tell me when you came to Linjiang?

523
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:17,260
I'm in this situation now.

524
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,523
How can you be better than me?

525
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:26,420
Light Chaser Rescue.

526
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,916
What does that mean?

527
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:32,187
A civil rescue team, non-profit.

528
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:39,759
You have a warm heart.

529
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,860
I can't even feed myself.

530
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,667
Don't want to think about it.

531
00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:54,368
Brother Qiang.

532
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,399
What are you going to do?

533
00:36:59,399 --> 00:37:01,919
You can't live on the street forever.

534
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,651
I'll keep looking for a job.

535
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:08,492
I can definitely pay the money back.

536
00:37:11,379 --> 00:37:12,880
Okay. I'm leaving.

537
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,800
Thank you for your noodles.

538
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:17,419
Brother Qiang.

539
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,720
I didn't find any good job either.

540
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:27,255
So I run a small food truck to sell wontons.

541
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,260
It's small but the business is okay.

542
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:36,195
You can come and help me until you find a job.

543
00:37:46,579 --> 00:37:48,060
Why are you crying?

544
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,719
I'm not crying.

545
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,611
The noodles are spicy.

546
00:37:52,399 --> 00:37:54,599
Don't mind the cheap salary.

547
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:55,800
 I called the taxi three times.

548
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,839
 Just can't get one.

549
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,539
 It's peak time.

550
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,640
- Dr. Zhan. 
 - Dr. Zhan. 
 - Calling a taxi?

551
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,719
Failed.

552
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,520
It's peak time. No cars are available.

553
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,440
No one accepts the order.

554
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,488
How are you leaving?

555
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:16,739
Why are you here?

556
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:18,320
Who else can be here?

557
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,020
Get in the car.

558
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,380
- I have to go. 
 - Bye, Dr. Zhan.

559
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,200
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

560
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,339
He's handsome.

561
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:29,183
He's Dr. Zhan's boyfriend. Handsome, right?

562
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,359
Turn up the heat.

563
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:34,559
 The heat is turned up for you.

564
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,799
Well. Am I a competent boyfriend?

565
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,080
Just so-so.

566
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,503
Why isn't the taxi coming?

567
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:10,888
I guess you don't know.

568
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:14,899
Light, sense of living,

569
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,983
tasty food,

570
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,451
and smiles from the family.

571
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:26,000
It's all I want for my life.

572
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,763
It's a simple life, isn't it?

573
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:37,220
Since I lost my mom, I thought I wouldn't have it anymore.

574
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,376
But now I've found it again.

575
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,180
Silly one,

576
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,779
as long as I'm with you, your family will be with you.

577
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,380
Try it.

578
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:04,616
Hot! Fortunately, you didn't eat it.

579
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,540
How are you now? Are you full?

580
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,640
Yes, I ate two bowls and a half.

581
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:17,799
I live there with my parents.

582
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:19,860
It's late. I guess they're sleeping. I won't invite you in.

583
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,659
Please don't. Don't disturb them.

584
00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:27,299
It's the wonton food truck I told you about.

585
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:28,899
This one?

586
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,480
Take it. Find a hotel for tonight.

587
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,880
Tomorrow, I'll find a house with you.

588
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:40,380
Well. This car is good.

589
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,960
It's enough for me to sleep.

590
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,720
It won't be comfortable. And you can't sleep in it.

591
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,500
It's better than the street.

592
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,972
So big, so good.

593
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:51,919
It's a shelter from wind and rain.

594
00:40:51,919 --> 00:40:53,427
I'll live here.

595
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,439
Mom. Dad.

596
00:40:57,439 --> 00:40:59,060
Yuan Yuan.

597
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,279
You are back.

598
00:41:00,279 --> 00:41:02,439
It's windy and rainy outside. You didn't get wet, did you?

599
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:04,200
I'm okay.

600
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,719
 Did you catch a cold?

601
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,319
I'm fine.

602
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,120
I'll make you hot noodles.

603
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,120
Do I have a share?

604
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,040
The soccer match is about to start.

605
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,779
Have a drink with me.

606
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:21,920
If you want to drink, I'll make you more dishes.

607
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,419
- Thank you, Mom. 
 - Never mind.

608
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,399
Don't burn yourself.

609
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,599
Thanks, Yuan Yuan.

610
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,380
Listen. There's no need to say thank you in a family.

611
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,900
You were busy out there.

612
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,960
Eat hot food and take a shower at home, it's a normal life.

613
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,600
Don't stand there. Go to take a shower and change your clothes.

614
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,740
Then the snacks will be fine.

615
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,040
Go.

616
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:24,000

617
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:33,832
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

618
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,986
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

619
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,924
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

620
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:56,190
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

621
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:04,094
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

622
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:12,210
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

623
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:19,474
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

624
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,690
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

625
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:35,390
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

626
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:41,840
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

627
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:50,440
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

628
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:57,940
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

629
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,960
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

630
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,690
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

631
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,340
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

632
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,110
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

633
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,740
♫  I can't fly  ♫

634
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:20,490
♫  But I can look up  ♫

635
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:28,170
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
