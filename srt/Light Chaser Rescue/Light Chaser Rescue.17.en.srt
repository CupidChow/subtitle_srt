(Emergency)

17
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,840
You can go off work.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,610
Okay.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
What are you doing after work?

20
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:50,640
Go home.

21
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,840
Don't you have

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,050
a date after work?

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,560
Well,

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,810
why haven't I heard about
Luo Ben for a while?

25
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,720
He doesn't

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,200
look like he would give up easily.

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,810
What do you want to eat?

28
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,050
You want to silence me by feeding me.

29
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:05,810
Well,

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,610
since

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,560
you're sincere,

32
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,200
I'll teach you one move.

33
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,890
In a relationship,

34
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,440
it's okay for girls

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,370
to be pampered

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,810
and taken care of,

37
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,560
but love

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,370
is a two-way thing.

39
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,720
Girls should also learn to

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,320
care about their boyfriends.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,650
Otherwise,

42
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,370
who would be attracted to someone

43
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,160
icy and wooden?

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,490
Do you want to eat or not?

45
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,720
Let's go.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:36,810
Let's go.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,600
Good for you

48
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,530
to keep up with us, rookies.

49
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,090
Dapeng, don't keep calling us rookies.

50
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,370
Though we have
little practical experience,

51
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,650
we are no worse than you

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,130
at the training programs.

53
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:49,040
- Yeah.
- That's right.

54
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,160
Do you think you're better than us?

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,130
Don't just talk.

56
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,970
Show me what you got.

57
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,530
Let's have a competition
between the rookies and the veterans.

58
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,530
Let's do it.

59
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,490
- Come on.
- Let's have a competition.

60
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,970
Well,

61
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,130
I don't want to take advantage of you.

62
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,650
A rookie and a veteran make a team.

63
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,810
One ties the rope,

64
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,560
the other jumps down.

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,130
Do you dare?

66
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,560
Let someone else tie the rope?

67
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,810
Are you nervous?

68
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,440
The one who ties the rope

69
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
might be more nervous

70
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,320
than the one who jumps down.

71
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,650
If he makes a mistake,

72
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,000
and causes his teammate

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,530
to fall in front of him,

74
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,690
how guilty he must be?

75
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,760
It's about skills and trust.

76
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,930
Well?

77
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's do it.

78
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,160
Come on.

79
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,650
- The loser buys breakfast for a month.
- Come on.

80
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,720
No problem.

81
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,560
Dapeng hasn't paid for

82
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,000
his own breakfast
for more than six months.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,320
Those days

84
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,440
are over.

85
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,410
We need one more person.

86
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,440
We got four here.

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,560
You're one short.

88
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,720
There is one over there.

89
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,600
Luo Ben.

90
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,370
Don't ask him.

91
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,130
Have you changed your mind?

92
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,160
Are you afraid of losing?

93
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,210
Are you scared?

94
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,130
Find someone else.

95
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,760
Anyone else can do.

96
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,810
Then it must be him.

97
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,280
Yeah.

98
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,880
Dapeng.

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
If you give up now,

100
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,810
we don't have to compete.

101
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,160
How would I give up?

102
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,160
Come on.

103
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,760
Let's go.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,210
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

105
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,160
Luo Ben.

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
Let's have a competition.

107
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,930
A rookie and a veteran make a team.

108
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,410
One ties the rope,

109
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,130
the other jumps down.

110
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,130
I'm with Snail.

111
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,170
You're with Dapeng.

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,080
Are you in?

113
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,170
If it's okay with you,

114
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,170
it's okay with me.

115
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:32,930
Dapeng.

116
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,960
Well?

117
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,170
We're teammates. Don't pull a long face.

118
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,850
I don't want to fall to my death.

119
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,520
I'll jump.

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
The veterans should

121
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,000
bear the brunt and jump.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,690
Dapeng.

123
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,960
If you're afraid,

124
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
you can tie the rope.

125
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:55,560
Only a coward would be afraid!

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,170
Let's do it!

127
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,250
Hurry up!

128
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,250
Dapeng.

129
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,730
I'm gonna jump first.

130
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,000
Dapeng!

131
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,930
Give up!

132
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,250
Dapeng.

133
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,930
Buy us breakfast for a month.

134
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,930
You should quit.

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,930
You're not for doing rescues.

136
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,170
You can't save people,
but only hurt them.

137
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,200
I'm glad I lost today.

138
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,560
Although I'll buy them breakfast
for a month,

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,760
I saw who the real loser is.

140
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,440
It's worth it.

141
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,880
You lost because of me.

142
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,880
I'll buy them breakfast.

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,400
Dapeng!

144
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,760
Dapeng!

145
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,440
You were too mean.

146
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,130
We all started as rookies.

147
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah, who hasn't made a mistake?

148
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,200
Have you forgotten about Falcon?

149
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,170
I don't have to worry about
my breakfast for the next month.

150
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,960
Yeah.

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,960
Luo Ben.

152
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,080
Don't take it to heart.

153
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,370
Well,

154
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,850
Dapeng

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,320
is just mean.

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,250
He is not a bad guy.

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,960
Yeah.

158
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,490
I'm okay.

159
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,320
Thank you.

160
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,730
Okay.

161
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,130
We're gonna leave then.

162
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,080
We're gonna leave then.

163
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:55,760
Okay.

164
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,780
(Light Chaser Rescue)

165
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,440
I've been through two earthquakes.

166
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,320
I think my mental ability

167
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,960
is stronger than average people.

168
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,250
But this time,

169
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,960
I don't think

170
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,170
I can make it through.

171
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,850
It's normal.

172
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,320
A lot of our guys

173
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,680
have been left with

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,680
traumatic stress disorder

175
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,400
from rescue operations.

176
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,280
That's why we have

177
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,570
a professional psychologist.

178
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,450
Well,

179
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,370
there's a psych session

180
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,570
this afternoon.

181
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,370
You can come

182
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,970
if you have time.

183
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,680
I guess

184
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
I'll pass.

185
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,610
Luo Ben.

186
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,880
Time will fix

187
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,520
what you can't fix now.

188
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,610
Take your time.

189
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,780
(Zhan Qingshan)

190
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,570
Hello.

191
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,570
Knot?

192
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,850
You don't cook.

193
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:44,970
Why do you buy it?

194
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,330
You can cook.

195
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,570
Me?

196
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,850
Is there any problem?

197
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,090
No, I can cook.

198
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,680
If you like,

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,400
I can cook for you anytime.

200
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,760
You have to rescue people and cook.

201
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,680
Can you really cook for me anytime?

202
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,210
Do you think I should
keep doing rescues?

203
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,520
Actually, there was a time

204
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,850
when I was afraid to be a doctor.

205
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,520
I was even afraid to do surgery.

206
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,610
(Buy one and get one free)

207
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,090
I think that was

208
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,210
when I just started working.

209
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,570
I didn't have much experience.

210
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,850
There was an operation.

211
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:26,640
I don't know

212
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,090
if I was too confident

213
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,280
or too nervous.

214
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,520
I cut the wrong place

215
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,040
and the patient was bleeding profusely.

216
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,520
Luckily, my director was there

217
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,400
and it was handled properly.

218
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,970
Otherwise, the consequence
would be disastrous.

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,490
I just sat in the O.R.

220
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,760
all afternoon that day,

221
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,130
not knowing what to do.

222
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,130
What happened later?

223
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:48,760
Later I just tried everything

224
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,850
to stay away from operations.

225
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,490
If I couldn't,

226
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,920
I just chose some minor operations to do

227
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,450
and let other people do the rest.

228
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,280
At that time, I thought

229
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,970
my career was over.

230
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,330
But you made it through.

231
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,920
That's because

232
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,680
I figured out a question,

233
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
which is if I want to be a doctor,

234
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,730
and save people.

235
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,450
This thing

236
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,490
is risky.

237
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,000
I'd rather

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
be strong

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,130
than timid.

240
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,370
That's why I had to

241
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,970
work harder than other people.

242
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,570
Like I would use tweezers

243
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,250
to peel grapes

244
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,330
while they were resting,

245
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,330
and I would

246
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,250
sew up a pomelo

247
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,130
when they were sleeping, shopping

248
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,370
and doing facials.

249
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,400
Therefore,

250
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,330
you should ask yourself, not me,

251
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,680
whether you want to

252
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,370
do rescues or not.

253
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,330
Manman!

254
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,280
Manman!

255
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
- Kiddo.
- Manman!

256
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,330
Are you okay?

257
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:10,970
Are you okay?

258
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,280
I'm fine.

259
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,970
You really scared me. Are you all right?

260
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,800
Are you okay?

261
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,760
I was scared to death.

262
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,920
Are you his mother?

263
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah.

264
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,610
He is too little to know
what's dangerous.

265
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,730
Never let him

266
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,680
get out of your sight again.

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Okay. Thank you.

268
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
- Thank him.
- It's all right.

269
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,210
Thank you.

270
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,880
You're welcome.

271
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:26,680
Honey.

272
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,330
Go ahead.

273
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,450
Are you all alright?

274
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,160
Stay close to me, okay?

275
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,330
Stay safe.

276
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,250
Thank you!

277
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,680
Looks like you've known your answer.

278
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,970
I don't think

279
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,000
Luo Ben will come.

280
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,000
All right, let's get started.

281
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:11,970
Hello, everyone.

282
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,090
I'm Ruan Jingshu.

283
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,090
It's my great pleasure to host

284
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,330
this sharing session.

285
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,970
We have the members of

286
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,760
the headquarters in Linjiang

287
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,130
and trainees from
different provinces and cities

288
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,570
to join us today.

289
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,400
Welcome, everyone.

290
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,570
The theme of this sharing session is

291
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,640
regret and growth in rescue.

292
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,400
I sincerely hope

293
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,850
you can tell your stories.

294
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,250
It's a form of sharing

295
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,640
and releasing.

296
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,730
I'll go first.

297
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,370
Okay.

298
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,450
Before I joined the rescue team,

299
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,160
a friend of mine once asked me

300
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,090
to go hiking with him.

301
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,040
We never thought

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
we would get caught
in extremely cold weather.

303
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,760
Hypothermia kicked in really fast.

304
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,130
I...

305
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,210
I watched

306
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,330
him die

307
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,920
right in front of me.

308
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,210
There was nothing I could do.

309
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,880
If anyone of us

310
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,250
checked the weather report in advance,

311
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,400
it would never...

312
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,850
After that thing happened,

313
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,680
I decided to join the rescue team.

314
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,450
I couldn't save

315
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,520
my friend's life,

316
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,850
but joining the rescue team

317
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,640
gives me the chance

318
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,880
to save more lives.

319
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,880
We're in the business of saving lives.

320
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,520
Sometimes we have to risk our lives

321
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,330
to save others.

322
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,760
It's not exaggerated at all

323
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,680
to say that we are like

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,450
Damon and Pythias.

325
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,850
Falcon is dead.

326
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,880
We all feel sad.

327
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,490
It's probably more difficult

328
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,730
for Luo Ben to move past it.

329
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,280
We've all made mistakes.

330
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,250
There are times
we don't want to face it.

331
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,160
The reason

332
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,570
that Light Chaser Rescue

333
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,490
can get so far

334
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,040
is because we help, encourage,

335
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,450
support, and care about each other.

336
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,250
I hope we can

337
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,400
carry forward

338
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,330
such a spirit.

339
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,130
I wish you could also

340
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,490
share your story.

341
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,970
It crossed my mind,

342
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,250
but I still can't talk about it.

343
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,850
I have to find that kid.

344
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,370
Yuan, time to get up!

345
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:14,090
Or you're gonna

346
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,400
be late for work!

347
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,570
Yuan!

348
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,130
Yuan.

349
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,570
Morning.

350
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,850
Morning.

351
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,440
What's the matter?

352
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,160
Nothing.

353
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,090
I thought only I would get up so early.

354
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,370
Aren't you coming in?

355
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:21,880
Ding Dingding.

356
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,240
Well,

357
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,400
Luo Yuan always goes to your place.

358
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,640
Has she said

359
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,770
anything to you?

360
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,050
We're girls.

361
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,610
We talk about everything.

362
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,480
What do you mean exactly?

363
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,440
Forget it.

364
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,960
Do you take your meal to work?

365
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,640
Miss.

366
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,160
I'd like wontons of ten yuan.

367

(Big Bear Wonton)

368
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,770
Miss, you're so beautiful.

369
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,090
Thank you.

370
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,880
Miss, he is looking at you.

371
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:33,880
Hello.

372
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,160
Okay, I see.

373
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Bun-bun is sick.

374
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:45,570
We need to take it to a hospital.

375
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll do it.

376
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,200
You?

377
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,370
Can I take Bun-bun home

378
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,810
after we come back from the hospital?

379
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,680
Of course.

380
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,010
I just don't want to bother you.

381
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,290
Not at all.

382
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,290
I can also bring Bun-bun to you

383
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,160
when you miss it.

384

(Consulting Room 3.)

393

What's your problem?

394
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,050
What are you doing here?

395
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,720
Just leave

396
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,570
if you're not sick.

397
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,370
Don't take up public resources.

398
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,160
Just three minutes.

399
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,370
This is the yam porridge I made.

400
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,090
It's good for the stomach.

401
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,370
Eat it in three minutes,

402
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:02,920
and I will go.

403
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,770
No, I'm working.

404
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,920
It took me a long time.

405
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I promise I'll eat it

406
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,880
during lunch.

407
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,920
I'll eat it all, okay?

408
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,480
Remember to eat it,

409
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,400
or I'll get angry.

410
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,370
It's good for your stomach.

411
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,570
Next one.

412
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:23,920
Remember to eat it.

413
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,050
I'm leaving then.

414
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,680
Mr. Luo.

415
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,010
Are you here to visit a patient?

416
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,810
No.

417
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,370
I'm here to bring breakfast to Zhan Yan.

418
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,920
Hold on.

419
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
It's right there. Keep going.

420
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,610
Shen Ruoxi.

421
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,200
Okay.

422
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,530
What's the matter?

423
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,010
Zhan Yan is moving really fast

424
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,440
with her new boyfriend.

425
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,050
Luo Ben is here to bring her breakfast.

426
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,090
You're making such a fuss.

427
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,610
Looks like I'm the old-fashioned one.

428
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,050
Yuan.

429
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,050
I'm back.

430
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:26,850
Yuan.

431
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,530
What are you doing?

432
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:38,200
That's right.

433
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,770
You should read more English books.

434
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,160
Your offer from the university abroad

435
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,290
will arrive soon.

436
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,240
Prepare yourself...

437
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,850
Yuan.

438
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,640
Yuan.

439
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,640
Open the door.

440
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,570
What's that thing by the couch?

441
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,130
I've told you many times

442
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,640
that it's okay for you to like animals,

443
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,680
but you can't take one home.

444
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:29,960
Step aside.

445
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:42,880
Bun-bun.

446
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,720
Here.

447
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,640
Eat more.

448
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,050
Get stronger.

449
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,130
Don't let Falcon worry.

450
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,610
Do you also miss him?

451
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,330
Brother.

452
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,720
Let's keep Bun-bun.

453
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,530
Okay.

454
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,090
Why do you want to see me?

455
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,810
Boss.

456
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
What's your instruction?

457
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,380
(Light Chaser Rescue)

458
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,960
The views of Light Chaser Rescue

459
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,330
have increased
during the last few weeks,

460
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,400
but they're nowhere

461
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,130
near our goal.

462
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,010
What do you think?

463
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,480
I'm not thinking anything, boss.

464
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,530
Don't you want

465
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,480
to create a great comic?

466
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,720
Boss,

467
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,440
it takes all my energy

468
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,160
to clock in

469
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,570
and work here every day.

470
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,370
What to do then?

471
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,290
If your comic can't
attract more readers,

472
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,480
I'll have to shut down
the comic department,

473
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,720
lay off the employees,

474
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,810
and set

475
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,880
new little goals.

476
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,480
What?

477
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,010
Can you be reasonable?

478
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,440
You ask me to serve tea

479
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,370
and water here every day.

480
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,720
How would I have time to create?

481
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:17,570
Well,

482
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,680
do you think

483
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,720
it's that easy

484
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,640
to create something?

485
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,090
It's creating, not dreaming.

486
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:23,720
Thank you.

487
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
What do you want?

488
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,920
From tomorrow,

489
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm gonna go to the rescue team
to collect material for my comic.

490
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,370
Find someone else

491
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,090
to do the errands.

492
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,880
All right.

493
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,440
Do you agree?

494
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
Yes. You have my approval.

495
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,770
I'm leaving.

496
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,580
(Big Bear Wonton)

497
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,850
Why do you have shoes in your bag?

498
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,920
Let me see.

499
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:15,960
They've worn out.

500
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,530
Shouldn't you get a new pair?

501
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,010
These are my lucky shoes.

502
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,810
I won every time

503
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,850
when I wore them to a match.

504
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,850
Do you have spare shoes at school?

505
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,400
Leave them to me.

506
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,370
I'll repair them for you.

507
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,010
I promise they will be
as good as new.

508
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,200
You don't believe me?

509
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,160
Your class will start soon.

510
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,130
Don't be late.

511
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,720
I'll help you close the stand
when you're finished.

512
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,130
It's my mother's birthday today.

513
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,240
I'll close it a little earlier.

514
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,400
About 7:00 PM.

515
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,720
Zhou Mingming.

516
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,720
You keep coming back like a ghost.

517
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,130
You even follow me all the way here.

518
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,770
You make it sound like you're precious.

519
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,640
I'm here for training today

520
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,050
as a newcomer.

521
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,610
I'm also part of the material you need.

522
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,160
Can't you pick a day

523
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,090
when I'm not around?

524
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,130
What's wrong with you being here?

525
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,130
It's not like

526
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,130
we have a secret relationship.

527
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
What kind of secret relationship

528
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,960
do you have?

529
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,090
Tell us about it.

530
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,200
You should go to the hospital
to check your ears.

531
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:55,720
Hurry.

532
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,090
Your hearing is poor.

533
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,810
They have quite a temper.

534
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,240
Let's go.

535
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,330
Everyone,

536
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,570
attention!

537
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,610
It's not easy for you

538
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:06,610
to take the time to train

539
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,440
when you're all busy

540
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,680
with your jobs.

541
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,680
That's why our training every time

542
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,920
must be of

543
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
high-standard,

544
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,880
high-intensity, and high-efficiency!

545
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,960
Yes!

546
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,290
Captain.

547
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,640
We don't know
what programs we should do.

548
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,920
Why don't you make a plan for us?

549
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,160
Well,

550
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,290
I have a lot of work to do lately.

551
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,570
I can't stay with you all the time.

552
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,530
How about this,

553
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,370
you can elect a team leader

554
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,200
to receive tasks from me every day.

555
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,240
Uncle.

556
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,130
Me.

557
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,130
I can do it.

558
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,610
You're from the Publicity Department.

559
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,160
Why would you want
to become the team leader?

560
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,920
None of your business.

561
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,610
You?

562
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,530
Tell me your reason.

563
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,920
Uncle, look,

564
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,610
they all have to train.

565
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,570
If you make

566
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,090
any one of them the representative,

567
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,050
the training will be affected,

568
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,090
but it won't affect me.

569
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,530
I'm doing an administrative job.

570
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,050
Right?

571
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,200
What do you guys think?

572
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,810
I object!

573
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,680
There are all men

574
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,400
in our team.

575
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,570
It would be nice

576
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,290
to have a girl as the team leader.

577
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,530
That's right.

578
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,770
It's hard to pick

579
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,050
the best of a bad bunch.

580
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,810
Yeah.

581
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:12,610
I agree.

582
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,530
Since you all agree...

583
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,400
- All right.
- Good!

584
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,880
Ding Dingding,

585
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,330
you'll be the team leader then.

586
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,880
Thank you, Uncle! Thank you all!

587
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,610
I'll work hard.

588
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,050
It's not time yet. Continue.

589
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,010
Why is my program

590
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,090
different from everyone else's?

591
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,330
Because you have a weak foundation

592
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,810
and a weak body.

593
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,530
You have to start with the basics.

594
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,960
Who said that? Did the captain say that?

595
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,610
I'm the team leader now.

596
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,290
Don't care what he says.

597
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,960
This is personal.

598
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,770
I'm just doing my job.

599
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Let me have some potato chips.

600
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,290
Why are you still standing here?

601
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,640
Get started now.

602
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,850
You've rested for long enough.

603
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,330
Do 100 sit-ups.

604
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,010
I'll count it.

605
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,090
One.

606
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,370
Two.

607
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:28,400
Three.

608
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,960
Four.

609
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,480
Can you be faster? You're too slow...

610
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,880
You did that on purpose, right?

611
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,770
Why are you

612
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,610
so close to me?

613
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,050
I think I lose my hearing.

614
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,440
Don't try to blackmail me.

615
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,240
Do 100 more sit-ups today,

616
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,330
or you can't leave.

617
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,010
This is totally personal.

618
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,130
I'll tell the captain about you.

619
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:49,720
You know what,

620
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,810
I'll go tell my uncle.

621
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,480
100 sit-ups.

622
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,130
Do you think I'm afraid of you?
Go ahead!

623
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:04,180
(Big Bear Wonton)

624
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
This is...

625
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,570
This is a birthday present

626
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,530
for Mrs. Xiong.

627
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,810
It's pretty.

628
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,570
My mom is gonna love it.

629
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,370
Thanks.

630
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,330
That's great.

631
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,480
Today is Mrs. Xiong's birthday.

632
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,160
Let's hurry up,

633
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,850
then you can

634
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,960
go home early.

635
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,680
Luo Yuan.

636
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,640
If you have nothing to do later,

637
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,570
maybe you can go back with me

638
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,810
to celebrate my mom's birthday.

639
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,370
I'm free. Okay.

640
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,810
This is my house.

641
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,290
This is my dad.

642
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,200
Dad.

643
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,090
This is my friend. Where is my mom?

644
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,330
Huahua!

645
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,810
Coming. Stop yelling.

646
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,200
I can't open it.

647
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,810
Let me open it.

648
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,680
I got it.

649
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,720
This is my friend.

650
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,640
Her name is Luo Yuan.

651
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,850
Mrs. Xiong.

652
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,920
Happy birthday.

653
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,850
She said happy birthday.

654
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:43,610
This is her gift

655
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,530
for you.

656
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,810
Thank you.

657
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,370
Have a seat.

658
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:55,610
- Have a seat.
- Sit down.

659
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,050
Sit down and let's eat together.

660
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,400
Mom.

661
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,880
Get a set of cutlery for her.

662
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,440
I forgot about it.

663
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:13,880
Here.

664
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:14,920
Use this.

665
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,290
It's clean.

666
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,160
Let me get you a bowl of this.

667
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,050
- This is my mother's specialty.
- Here.

668
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,850
Try it.

669
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,920
Here, have a try.

670
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,130
Here.

671
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,770
Have a drink.

672
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,130
How's it?

673
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,400
Mrs. Xiong.

674
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,370
Your cooking is delicious.

675
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,770
She said your cooking is delicious.

676
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,370
Eat more

677
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,810
if you like it.

678
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,090
Homemade meals are nutritious.

679
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,400
Just let me know if you want
to have homemade dishes.

680
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,810
I'll cook for you anytime.

681
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,400
Okay.

682
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
I also cook well.

683
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,090
My dad made this. Have a try.

684
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,130
Have a try.

685
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:08,680
And this.

686
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,810
Yeah. Eat more.

687
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,810
Have more.

688
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,130
Have a taste.

689
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,720
Well? Isn't it delicious?

690
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,610
Happy birthday to my mom!

691
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,760
Today is my mom's birthday.

692
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,200
Yeah.

693
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,970
Happy birthday, Mom.

694
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:30,410
Happy birthday.

695
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,320
Thank you. Thank you for the gift.

696
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,050
Yuan.

697
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,490
Have some fruit first.

698
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,010
Let me peel an apple for you.

699
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,800
Sit down.

700
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,760
Stop doing dishes.

701
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,280
Go and stay with her.

702
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,050
It's okay. My dad is there.

703
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,200
Can that be the same?

704
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,200
Luo Yuan won't mind.

705
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,610
Be honest with me,

706
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,280
how long have you two been dating?

707
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,160
Don't get me wrong.

708
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,680
We are just friends.

709
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,200
Do you think I'm a fool?

710
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,840
That girl likes you.

711
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,970
Don't you mind that she can't speak?

712
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,160
Though she can't speak,

713
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,760
she's a good girl.

714
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,320
If you don't mind,

715
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,360
I don't mind.

716
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,090
Although she has a physical defect,

717
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,240
she doesn't mind

718
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,200
your past.

719
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,010
She doesn't

720
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,200
know it yet.

721
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,640
Fei.

722
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,760
Whatever the future holds
for you and her,

723
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:59,010
you can't keep it from her.

724
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,360
I know that.

725
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,240
My mom said

726
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,090
you can come around more often

727
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,570
when you have time.

728
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,720
Well,

729
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:45,970
what do you think?

730
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,050
Luo Yuan.

731
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,680
There's one more thing

732
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,720
I have to tell you.

733
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,200
I was in prison before.

734
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,840
I was still in college when it happened.

735
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,720
I saw someone bullying my sister...

736
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,760
I don't want to hide it from you,

737
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
and I don't want to lie to you.

738
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,800
I knew

739
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,490
your past,

740
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,490
but I don't mind.

741
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,760
I only care about

742
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,800
how you feel about me.

743
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,410
I...

744
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,640
I like you.

745
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,840
Did you really tell Xiong Fei
you like him?

746
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,320
I kind of admire you right now.

747
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,610
I didn't expect

748
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,840
you to be so brave in love.

749
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,610
I didn't even know

750
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,840
you would like that wooden guy.

751
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,450
All right.

752
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,240
I won't speak ill of him

753
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,970
in front of you anymore.

754
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,090
Tell me

755
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,320
how he reacted.

756
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,640
He is a wooden guy indeed.

757
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,200
You must keep it a secret.

758
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,240
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

759
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,450
I could tell

760
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,360
your brother

761
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,640
doesn't like Xiong Fei that much.

762
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,050
Don't worry.

763
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm on your side.

764
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,090
Cheers.

765
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,010
What are you gonna do
if your brother finds out

766
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,050
you go to help Xiong Fei every morning?

767
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,160
He has been studying late
every day lately.

768
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,840
He has no time to worry about me.

769
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,160
He's already so good

770
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,280
and he still learns?

771
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,410
He does leave no way out
for his colleagues.

772
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,360
Well, well.

773
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
My brother is learning

774
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,090
rescue skills.

775
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,090
Okay, I think

776
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,570
I should also try harder.

777
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,490
I'm gonna do 100 sit-ups today.

778
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,490
Count it for me.

779
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,090
I'm not gonna sleep until I finish it.

780
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:04,450
Three.

781
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,090
Four.

782
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,160
That's right. Keep your foot on it

783
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Press into the earth.

784
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,720
Grasp it.

785
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,610
Safety first!

786
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:16,800
That's right.

787
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,320
Good.

788
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:22,840
Not bad.

789
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:27,530
Zhou Mingming.

790
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,160
Are you gonna train or not?

791
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,240
Just get over here if you are.

792
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,890
Dapeng, let me warm up first.

793
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:32,680
You're too slow.

794
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,720
You've been slacking off all day.

795
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,280
No, I'm warming up.

796
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,010
Zhou Mingming.

797
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,450
Why are you here so late?

798
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,570
I'm your boss. How can you
call me by my name?

799
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,010
You are my boss in the company,

800
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,970
but you're my teammate here.

801
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:52,890
Get over here
and I'm gonna take photos.

802
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:53,840
What photos?

803
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,800
Publicity photos.

804
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,280
It's for the brochure

805
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,970
to show people

806
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,050
how professional we are.

807
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:00,760
That's a good idea.

808
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,160
Come on. Take photos of me.

809
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,050
Come on, bro.

810
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:03,930
Move, move.

811
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:04,240
Be careful.

812
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:04,800
How's that?

813
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:05,890
How about this pose?

814
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,570
I look so handsome.

815
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,320
Bring me my sunglasses.

816
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,970
Go ahead and get them.

817
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,490
Don't horse around.

818
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:09,410
I'm taking training photos.

819
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,720
Do you think it's your photo album?

820
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,530
Ridiculous.

821
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,320
Then take photos of me
doing a speed drop.

822
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,050
That will look cool.

823
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:15,640
Done it.

824
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:17,360
You've done it?

825
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,280
With whom?

826
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,320
Wukong.

827
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Then take photos of me
using the cutting machine to clean up.

828
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,200
It will make me look tough.

829
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,130
Done that, too.

830
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,720
What else haven't you done?

831
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,490
I got it. The tire.

832
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,610
Pushing the tire,

833
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,410
sit-ups,

834
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,320
and push-ups.

835
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,970
Pull-ups work, too.

836
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,410
Ding Dingding, you did it
on purpose, right?

837
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,010
You've done all the cool ones

838
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,890
and left those programs to me.

839
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,360
Right?

840
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,890
Blame yourself for coming that late.

841
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,610
Are you gonna do it or not?

842
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,890
Or I'll tell my uncle about it.

843
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,970
I'll do it, all right?

844
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:50,680
I'll do it.

845
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,360
One.

846
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,130
Two.

847
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,130
Three.

848
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:55,610
- Four.
- Don't move

849
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,720
Hold your position.

850
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,320
Continue.

851
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,320
Five.

852
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,720
Six.

853
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,360
Seven.

854
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,360
Eight.

855
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,090
Nine.

856
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,200
Ten.

857
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,610
Eleven.

858
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:14,720
Come on!

859
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,020
(Light Chaser Rescue)

860
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,680
Good!

861
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:24,490
Good!

862
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:25,160
Well done!

863
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Very good!

864
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,010
Come on!

865
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,280
Come on!

866
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,130
Come on, Zhou Mingming!

867
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,840
Stop.

868
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
Don't move.
