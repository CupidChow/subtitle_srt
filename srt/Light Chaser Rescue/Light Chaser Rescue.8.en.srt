16
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,050
Lele.

17
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,050
Eat more eggs.

18
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,840
You know the rules. Eat them all.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,130
Eat properly.

20
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,250
Finish them all.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,080
Captain Ruan.

22
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,440
The stressor of Lele's hypochondriasis

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,080
should be the earthquake in Fengxi.

24
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,360
He saw too many injuries and deaths

25
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,890
in the disaster area,

26
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,050
which made him feel like

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,280
he is a patient with a broken leg.

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,720
That's why he doesn't want to eat.

29
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,840
How did you

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,130
get him to eat?

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
By making him feel like

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,370
he is a normal person.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,490
Eating is a way

34
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,600
of daily communication,

35
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,690
a self-suggestion that will help him

36
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,280
get back to normal gradually.

37
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,970
Well,

38
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,970
in Lele's condition,

39
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,600
is he gonna be able

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,690
to walk soon?

41
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,760
Hard to say.

42
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,930
It depends on whether he can

43
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,280
overcome his psychological problems.

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,560
I think

45
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,490
we need something

46
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,840
to rouse him.

47
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,490
Like the last time, we brought him

48
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,760
the bear box lunch

49
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:39,560
which reminded him of his mom.

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,440
His mom?

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,930
Thank you, Captain Ruan.

52
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,250
We'll have to

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,560
bother you

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,280
to take care of Lele.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Don't worry, just leave him to me.

56
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,690
Well, I'm leaving then.

57
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,440
Bye, Miss Ruan.

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Zhan Yan.

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,370
Your dad's really happy

60
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,650
that you're here,

61
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,210
but he doesn't want to bother you.

62
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,650
He misses you a lot.

63
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,880
I have work to do
in the hospital this afternoon.

64
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,970
I gotta go.

65
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,720
Zhan Yan.

66
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,000
You brought Lele here

67
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,530
to let me cure him.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,880
What about you?

69
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,130
Your relationship with your father

70
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,970
has been difficult for years.

71
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,250
Can't you just make up?

72
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,090
We would have

73
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
if we can.

74
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,250
Thank you for today, Miss Ruan.

(Special Education School)

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,720
Thank you for today.

77

Popularizing knowledge
of emergency rescue

78
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,720
is also part of our job.

79
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:48,930
That's what I should do.

80
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,320
Are you free the day after tomorrow?

81
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:58,720
It's Lele's birthday.

82
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
I want to make a cake for him.

83
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,280
Can you do it with me?

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,090
I know you're busy,

85
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,490
but you saved Lele's life,

86
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,210
and you mean a lot to him.

87
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,600
He must really want you

88
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,130
to come to his birthday party.

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,650
Here is some information on Yigu,

90
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:22,880
and your delivery.

91
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,610
Thank you.

92
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,400
It's from Fengxi.

93
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,080
What is it?

94
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,320
That's my privacy.

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,610
I think I can remain silent.

96
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,850
By the way,

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
keep looking for information on Yigu.

98
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,640
The more detailed, the better.

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,290
Got it.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,810
It's great.

101
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,960
The first step

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
is to spread the cream

103
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
on the cake.

104
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:11,960
Look.

105
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,080
Let's spread it out briefly.

106
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:18,930
And check out

107
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,320
how I do this.

108
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,320
Right? It spreads out.

109
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
Then we wipe it.

110
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,130
Here, have a try.

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,080
Hello.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:36,760

Okay. A moment, please.

115
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,610
Wipe it.

116
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,130
Sir.

117
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,520
Okay.

118
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,130
Here's your cake, Sir.

119
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,130
- All right. Thank you.
- Let's move on.

120
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,690
That's right.

121
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,880
Yeah, like this. It's good.

on the planet.

176
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,400
I hope

177
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,880
you can be like a camel.

178
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,250
Come on.

179
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,040
Make a wish, Lele.

180
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:19,300
(Happy Birthday to Lele)

181
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,680
This is called the bowline.

182
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,800
It has the virtues of

183
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,040
being strong and secure.

184
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,610
When you are in danger

185
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,640
and in need of using a rope,

186
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,680
whether the knot is strong enough

187
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,850
and you can tie it

188
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,130
quickly

189
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,800
are the keys to escaping successfully.

190
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,570
Look, Rui.

191
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,680
I'll teach you. This is the first step.

192
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,250
Rui!

193
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,250
Why don't you stay at home after school?

194
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,280
What are you doing here?

195
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,130
I...

196
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,520
I...

197
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,850
I'm waiting for you to get off work.

198
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,800
Nonsense!

199
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,330
Let's go!

200
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,970
Didn't I tell you

201
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:58,640
to stay away from him?

202
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
What are you doing with him?

203
00:10:59,640 --> 00:10:59,970
Let's go!

204
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,330
Throw away that rope!

205
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,490
There are so many things to play with,

206
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,520
why do you have to play with the rope?

207
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,040
Are you gonna throw it or not?

208
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,730
Listen,

209
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,880
don't make me beat you when we get home.

210
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,280
Why are you

211
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,450
so disobedient all the time?

212
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,040
Are they being

213
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
judgmental again?

214
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,570
It's okay.

215
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,850
They don't mean any harm.

216
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,680
Who are they to judge you?

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
When you got admitted to college,

218
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,090
they all envied you,

219
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,610
but after that happened,

220
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,490
they started to avoid us

221
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,330
like a plague.

222
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,800
Let them talk.

223
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
We just keep living our own lives.

224
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,400
I've been working all day
and I'm hungry.

225
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,640
What did Dad cook today?

226
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,400
Something delicious.

227
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,730
Really? Let's go home now.

228
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
What are you cooking? It smells so good.

229
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,880
Have you washed your hands
before you eat?

230
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
Help!

231
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,160
Help!!

232
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,250
(Required by the story and guided
by professionals. Do not imitate)

233
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,640
Someone helps us!

234
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,450
Help!

235
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,130
Don't be scared, Rui.

236
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't be scared, Mom's here!

237
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,130
Who can get a sheet?

238
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,920
Go get a sheet now!

239
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,280
Tighten the sheet.

240
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,210
Tighten it.

241
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,330
- Tighten it!
- Tighten it!

242
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,970
Rui, grab the rope!

243
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,600
(Required by the story and guided
by professionals. Do not imitate)

244
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,400
Don't move!

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,090
I'm coming to save you.

246
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,880
Rui!

247
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,730
Don't move!

248
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,160
Grab the rope!

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,610
Help!

250
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,800
Don't move!

251
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,720
(Required by the story and guided
by professionals. Do not imitate)

252
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,570
Hang in there!

253
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,570
Slowly!

254
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,800
Careful! Be careful!

255
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,330
Be careful!

256
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,490
Careful!

257
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,570
Be careful!

258
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,850
Rui!

259
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,920
Slowly!

260
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,730
It's too dangerous!

261
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,370
Be careful!

262
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,680
Be careful, kid!

263
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,850
Grab me.

264
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,850
It's dangerous.

265
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,680
Careful!

266
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,730
Careful!

267
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,130
Be careful!

268
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,610
Slowly!

269
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,880
How did he go up there?
It's too dangerous.

270
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,250
Be careful!

271
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,920
Pull up!

272
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,730
It's so dangerous up there.

273
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,880
Be careful!

274
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,250
Be careful!

275
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,490
Careful!

276
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,090
Careful!

277
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,330
Be careful!

278
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,450
Be careful!

279
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,850
They're coming down!

280
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,400
Careful.

281
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,330
Come on.

282
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,880
Are you hurt? It's okay now.

283
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,680
Rui!

284
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,040
You really scared me.

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,760
How dangerous that was.

286
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,250
Is Rui all right?

287
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:33,920
That was close.

288
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,730
Are you okay?

289
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,090
All right.

290
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,490
Everybody goes back.

291
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,090
Stop looking.

292
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,280
There's nothing to see.

293
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,490
Look after your kids when you're back.

294
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,250
Untie the rope.

295
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,680
I'm fine, Mom.

296
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,570
Thanks to Xiong Fei. Yeah.

297
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,130
Or something terrible
could have happened.

298
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,970
Did the rope hurt you?

299
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,210
No, don't worry.

300
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,880
Let's go.

301
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,090
Dad's still cooking at home.

302
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,800
- Let's go back first.
- Xiong Fei.

303
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,250
My blood pressure
goes up because of you.

304
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,760
Let me put the rope away. I'm all right.

305
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,920
Well done.

306
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,880
All is well.

307
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,330
Go back.

308
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,370
It's good that no one is hurt.

309
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
Let's also go back.

310
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,210
That was careless.

311
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,160
Ai Rui'er.

312
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,040
I need you to look into someone.

313
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:24,730
Come in.

314
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,400
Do you want to see me?

315
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,730
Li Aiqi.

316
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,130
Do me one more favor.

317
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,850
I'm not gonna

318
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,490
swindle the chairman

319
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,330
for you.

320
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,160
No.

321
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,680
I'd like to take some courses

322
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,880
on enterprise management.

323
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,730
I need you to find
something suitable for me.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,520
Do you...

325
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,330
Do you want to learn?

326
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,450
Yeah.

327
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,090
I'll practice while taking classes.

328
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,250
I guess this is

329
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,210
how I combine theory with practice.

330
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,730
The chairman must be happy

331
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,800
to know that.

332
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
Okay, leave it to me.

333
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,040
Thank you.

334
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:24,730
Brother.

335
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,280
Yuan.

336
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,370
I want to talk to you

337
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,800
about Xiong Fei.

338
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,450
Xiong Fei?

339
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,490
About what?

340
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,210
You care a lot about him.

341
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,160
I understand that you have

342
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,520
a misunderstanding about him,

343
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,760
but he saved me during the earthquake.

344
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,520
He is a good man.

345
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,730
I want to be friends with him.

346
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,090
I'm not asking you
to stop making friends with him.

347
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,000
It's just humanity

348
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,680
is very complicated.

349
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,570
There are not just good guys
and bad guys.

350
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,440
It's not that simple.

351
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,640
You grew up with

352
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,810
a simple circle of friends.

353
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,160
I'm worried about you getting hurt.

354
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,530
Brother.

355
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,200
You have a prejudice against Xiong Fei.

356
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,290
What proof do you have

357
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,720
to make you say things like that
about him?

358
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,850
Trust me.

359
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,290
I've been working on cases for years.

360
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,050
I have a natural instinct

361
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,880
for people and things.

362
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,330
You trust your instincts,

363
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,010
but I trust more

364
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,400
what I saw myself.

365
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,480
Yuan.

366
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,050
I didn't want to tell you this,

367
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,640
but since you trust
Xiong Fei that much...

368
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,570
What are you trying to say?

369
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,720
He was in prison before.

370
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,440
Read it for yourself.

371
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,220
(Law Positive Law Firm)

372
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:37,260
(Xiong Fei (male) was sentenced to
two years in prison for causing death.)

373
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,050
It's almost done, Hai.

374
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,290
Okay.

375
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,290
That girl came here last time.

376
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,850
She is here for you.

377
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,770
Miss Luo.

378
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,130
Is it for me?

379
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,570
Thank you,

380
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,610
but I've just eaten.

381
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,680
Are you...

382
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,680
Are you here

383
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,010
because of something?

384
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,240
I trust you.

385
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,290
She left?

386
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,770
What does she mean?

387
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,010
I guess she meant you're a good man.

388
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
We're working on

389
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,960
the insurance.

390
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,920
Several insurance companies

391
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,330
have intentions to work with us.

392
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,720
Don't worry.

393
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,160
We won't

394
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,640
let the rescue team

395
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,330
go to save the lives of other people

396
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,010
without getting protected

397
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,010
by insurance.

398
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,770
Director Liu.

399
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,010
You solved

400
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,850
a big problem for us.

401
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,680
As a civil rescue team,

402
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,050
we can't become the way we are today

403
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,330
without the strong support

404
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,370
of the superior departments

405
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,400
and the help from all walks of life.

406
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,960
We also have to thank you, Director Liu.

407
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,290
It's my job, anyway.

408
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,240
By the way,

409
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,920
I also

410
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,090
got you

411
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,160
a gift.

412
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,440
What gift?

413
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:54,920
I've

414
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,880
talked to

415
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,850
the Central Hospital.

416
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,770
Zhan Yan

417
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,530
will be the instructor

418
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,400
to train the new guys

419
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
on behalf of the International Rescue Team

420
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,850
and give you support

421
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,530
on emergency medical service.

422
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,610
Okay.

423
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,010
Why me?

424
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,960
Emergency rescue is about life.

425
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,880
The leadership assigned this task to us,

426
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,920
and we should take it seriously.

427
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
I must send the one
who is perfect for this job.

428
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:21,720
Dr. Zhan.

429
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
You're not just a leading doctor

430
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,570
in our hospital,

431
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,290
but also a member of

432
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,440
the International Medical Rescue Team.

433
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm not asking for your opinion.

434
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,880
I'm informing you.

435
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,370
Prepare to

436
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,130
make a transition

437
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,720
and report for duty
at the rescue team tomorrow.

438
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,240
Hello, everyone.

439
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,480
I'm the captain of Light Chaser Rescue,

440
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,160
Qingshan.

441
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,050
From today,

442
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,770
we will start

443
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,440
the intensive emergency rescue training.

444
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,290
You come from different areas,

445
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,570
and have different jobs.

446
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,810
Whatever you do for a living,

447
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,810
whatever your position is,

448
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,720
when you're here,

449
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,680
you're either an instructor

450
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,570
or a trainee.

451
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:01,720
The trainees must obey

452
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,960
the order of the instructors.

453
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,240
Do you get it?

454
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,530
Yes!

455
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,240
Teammate.

456
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,370
Hello.

457
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,770
Let me add you on WeChat.

458
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,330
We can look out for each other.

459
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,720
Okay, let's do it.

460
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,570
I'll scan your codes.

461
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,570
Okay, you can scan my code.

462
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,160
Here, do it.

463
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,810
Chen Xing. Wang Yu.

464
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:30,530
Right.

465
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,010
Received.

466
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,200
Is your name Ding Dingding?

467
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,640
Isn't it easy to remember?

468
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,810
That's an interesting name.

469
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,130
Why do you guys

470
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,610
want to join the Light Chaser Rescue?

471
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,770
We are the corporate rescue team

472
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,720
of Fangqin Group.

473
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,640
We're here for training.

474
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,850
What about you?

475
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,010
I...

476
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,810
I'm kind of experiencing life here.

477
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,090
Experience life?

478
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,920
A writer?

479
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,850
It's not that serious.

480
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm a comics artist.

481
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,370
A comics artist?

482
00:22:59,370 --> 00:22:59,810
Wait.

483
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,920
Give me your phone number.

484
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,130
We can keep in touch.

485
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,850
Okay.

486
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,440
And me. Let me scan your code.

487
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,050
You guys first.

488
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,610
You guys first.

489
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,810
Why don't you scan my code together?

490
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,880
Tell me

491
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
about your work.

492
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,920
I love reading comics.

493
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,050
I'll tell you later.

494
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,530
Hurry up.

495
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,440
Have you sent me all the information?

496
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,640
There are still some details.

497
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,200
I'll send them to you

498
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,130
after I sort them out.

499
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,330
All right, thank you.

500
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,530
That's why I didn't see you

501
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,400
at the training ground.

502
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,530
Turns out you've

503
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,330
moved your office here.

504
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,160
I have to work.

505
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,290
Everyone here should
take the training seriously.

506
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Not for the team leader, right?

507
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,240
As a team leader,

508
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,720
my job is to lead and manage the team.

509
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,530
There are only instructors and trainees.

510
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,050
If you want to be a leader,

511
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,290
you should have better physical fitness

512
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:51,640
and more comprehensive skills

513
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,290
than your team members.

514
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,370
If you refuse to take the training,

515
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I'll have to advise

516
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,680
Fangqin Group to send someone else

517
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,160
who will take the training.

518
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,290
Ka.

519
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,240

525
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,400
Don't stick up your backsides.

526

528
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,240
You can give up
if this is too much for you.

529
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,770
Do you see
that it's too much for me?

530
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,640
You're pretty stubborn.

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,160
Why would you come here to suffer this?

534
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,480
People like you should just

535
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,240
drink some wine and brag about yourself.

536
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,050
It can promote consumption
and it's environmental friendly.

537
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,640
It's beneficial to everyone.

538
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,050
Don't whisper.

539
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,920
Conserve your strength.

540
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
The training has just started.

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,370

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,530

Come on!

545
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,370

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,400
Come on, Dingding!

550
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,810
You can do it, Dingding!

551
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
Come on!

552
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,090

Higher!

554
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
Why is he uncoordinated? Higher!

555
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,400
Faster!

556
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,480
Faster!

557
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,330
The last ten seconds.

558
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,530
Eight!

559
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,680

564
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,330
I thought it was just
some outward bound.

565
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,370
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

566
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm too tired!

567
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,010
The chairman wants to

568
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:56,680
set up a corporate rescue team.

569
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,810
That's his directive.

570
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,010
Stop talking.

571
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,010
It's even worse for me.

572
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,130
I thought the training for

573
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,880
civil rescuers won't be too intense,

574
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,720
and I could also

575
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,960
meet new people here.

576
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,680
Are you here to network?

577
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,680
That's pathetic.

578
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,200
Who are you calling pathetic?

579
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,050
Who is pathetic?

580
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,920
No.

581
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,130
Don't get me wrong, guys.

582
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm not talking about you.

583
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,960
I'm talking about her.

584
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,370
You must be very noble

585
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:28,880
to join the rescue team.

586
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm just afraid

587
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,130
someone is muddling through.

588
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,400
I don't know who is muddling through.

589
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,330
Let's wait and see.

590
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,010
What do you think of

591
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,960
the trainees this time?

592
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,960
A few of them are okay.

593
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Including him?

594
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,480
Do you have a problem with him?

595
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I just can't stand

596
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,850
his self-righteous manner.

597
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,640
I don't know if he is here for training

598
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,720
or to get gold plated.

599
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,240
He is obviously not our kind.

600
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,440
You brought so much stuff to me.

601
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,440
Are you worried
that I will starve myself?

602
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,810
I don't worry you will starve yourself.

603
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,240
I'm worried that you would be
too stingy with yourself

604
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
and save all that money

605
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,130
to buy a latch, right?

606
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,010
Mean girl.

607
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,050
Did you go to see your dad?

608
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,920
Which part of the training

609
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,050
are you in charge of this time?

610
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
Urban rescue.

611
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,610
Yan.

612
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,440
Listen...

613
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,960
Look.

614
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
I bought these clothes for you last time,

615
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,400
but I kept forgetting
to bring them to you.

616
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,050
Try them on.

617
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,200
Why did you buy me clothes again?

618
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,400
I'm fine in my rescue suit.

619
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,680
Try them on.

620
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,960
It's good.

621
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,680
I've never tried this style before.

622
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,850
Two pieces?

623
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,770
They're both for you.

624
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,400
Try them on.

625
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
They're exactly the same.

626
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,010
Dr. Zhan.

627
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,400
Dr. Zhan.

628
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,440
Get things ready for this afternoon.

629
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,050
Okay.

630
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,220
(Frosted Plum)

631
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,770
Yan.

632
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:45,880
How many shuttles did you do?

633
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,370
Have a rest.

634
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,370
I did five repetitions.

635
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,200
I did two more repetitions than you.

636
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,960
I'm not as good as you.

637
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:51,130
Go ahead.

638
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm not what I used to be.

639
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:54,770
Yeah.

640
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,530
Do it like this. Yes.

641
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,480
Use the strength of your waist.

642
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,240
Do you notice that?

643
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,440
Bro, water.

644
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,480
Take it.

645
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,200
Thanks.

646
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,570
Gather together!

647
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,160
Now we're going to have

648
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,570
the log lift training.

649
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,920
This program is to train

650
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,050
your strength, physical endurance,

651
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,680
and teamwork.

652
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,010
Only with good physical strength

653
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,610
and good teamwork

654
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,440
can you last longer.

655
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,090
Now on my count.

656
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,290
Log on the shoulder!

657
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
Hurry.

658
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,810
This is a real hassle.

659
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,960
One!

660
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,010
Two!

661
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,400
One!

662
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,530
Two!

663
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,880
One!

664
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,680
Two!

665
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,720
One!

666
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,290
Two!

667
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,440
One!

668
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,480
- Two!
- Report!

669
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,920
Ding Dingding, out!

670
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,290
Continue.

671
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,200
Sir.

672
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,680
I ask for a break.

673
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,050
What's your reason?

674
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:52,770
I have no strength left.

675
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,050
It's only been a few minutes.

676
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:55,850
I can't. I really can't.

677
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,010
I can't go on.

678
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,480
Have you decided?

679
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,880
If you quit now,

680
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,610
it will affect your grades.

681
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,130
What will happen
if my grades are affected?

682
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,010
If you fail three times in a row,

683
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,880
you'll have to quit the training early.

684
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll hold on a little longer.

685
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,680
How about...

686
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:21,610
Shut up.

687
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,400
H-How about...

688
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,810
Save your energy

689
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:30,850
and we can hold on a little longer.

690
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,290
One!

691
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,160
Two!

692
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,160
One!

693
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,480
Two!

694
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:53,960
One!

695
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,400
Two!

696
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,920
One!

697
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,090
Two!

698
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,010
One!

699
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,850
Two!

700
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,400
Who allowed you to stop?

701
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,570
Sir!

702
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,610
It's raining!

703
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,680
I know!

704
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,920
Let's take a break.

705
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,720
We can continue when the rain stops.

706
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,010
Maybe you should be the instructor?

707
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,610
I...

708
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,160
Anyone who doesn't
want to get wet in the rain

709
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,090
can quit now!

710
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,440
Everyone!

711
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,920
Log on the shoulder!

712
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,050
One.

713
00:33:58,530 --> 00:33:59,330
Two.

714
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,680
One.

715
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,200
Two.

716
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,480
One.

717
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,240
Sir!

718
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:14,890
The medical team!

719
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,490
Are you okay?

720
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,160
Continue!

721
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,050
One.

722
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,130
Two.

723
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,050
One.

724
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,160
The training is intense in the rain.

725
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,200
Make some brown sugar and ginger water.

726
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,090
Prepare more cold medicine

727
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:49,760
for them.

728
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,280
Two.

729
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,010
Okay.

730
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,050
One.

731
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,280
Drink it. You'll be fine
after some rest.

732
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,160
Thank you, Yan.

733
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,010
Be careful.

734
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,410
Slowly.

735
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,530
Not a big deal.

736
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,680
He just runs out of strength.

737
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,760
Zhou.

738
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,360
Bring me glucose.

739
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:37,930
Okay.

740
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,530
Did Uncle set up

741
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,890
a civil organization

742
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,050
or a hunter school?

743
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,570
If we keep training like this,
all of us will...

744
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,760
Since the beginning of the training,

745
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,050
there have been a number of trainees

746
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,320
who have fatigue,

747
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,760
faint, and fever.

748
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,450
Have you evaluated

749
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,640
whether the training intensity

750
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,200
is suitable for new people?

751
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,930
We've been using

752
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,050
this training system for ten years.

753
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,610
There's nothing wrong with it.

754
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,450
A number of trainees

755
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,760
have medical conditions.

756
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,240
There has never been

757
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,720
such problems

758
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,680
in the training of

759
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,530
the International Rescue Team.

760
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,970
Doesn't it mean anything?

761
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,240
The members of
the International Rescue Team

762
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,530
are all professionals.

763
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,450
They have a good foundation

764
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,570
and they have been trained

765
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,490
before joining the team.

766
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,050
We're a civil team.

767
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,240
Our members are amateurs.

768
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,050
You can't just

769
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,090
compare them with us.

770
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,720
Since our members are amateurs,

771
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,130
we should let them learn to walk
before they run.

772
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,090
Since you asked me
to be the medical instructor

773
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,320
of the new trainees,

774
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,010
now I'm officially telling you

775
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,280
that the training intensity is excessive

776
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,570
and it must be stopped immediately.

777
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,360
The training must be intense and hard

778
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,320
so that they will be confident

779
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,490
when they are out on a mission.

780
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:06,800
Okay.

781
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,490
I respect your opinion,

782
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,970
but it needs to be

783
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,090
comprehensively evaluated by our team

784
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,490
before we decide
whether to change it or not.

785
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,720
So you're not gonna

786
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,930
stop the training?

787
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,530
Fine.

788
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,570
Now that I'm in this position,

789
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,280
I should shoulder

790
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,240
the responsibility,

791
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,360
and I think I have the right to do so.

792
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
I'll stop it.

793
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,610
The rest of you, continue!

794
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:48,610
Two.

795
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,130
Everyone, put the log down!

796
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,640
What are you doing?

797
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,010
Why have you stopped?

798
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,970
I asked them to stop.

799
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,280
It has nothing to do with them.

800
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,640
You just saw

801
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,320
that several trainees

802
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,610
have quit the training

803
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,800
because of physical exhaustion.

804
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,840
I often take part in outdoor sports,

805
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,760
and I think I have a strong healthy body,

806
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:19,200
but even I am

807
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
feeling like

808
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,970
I'm reaching the limit of my body.

809
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,530
You want to push us

810
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,840
beyond the limits of our bodies.

811
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,050
Do you still see us as human beings?

812
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,450
How many of us can get through that?

813
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,970
We are civilian volunteers,

814
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,640
not soldiers of the army.

815
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,490
You're training us

816
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,200
as soldiers in the army!

817
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,890
Such an arrangement

818
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,010
doesn't make sense at all!

819
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,090
What do you know?

820
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,840
I don't know much about rescue.

821
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,640
But let me tell you,

822
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,410
you lack common sense.

823
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,680
Not to mention rescue,

824
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,760
you can't get anything done!

825
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,490
What did you say?

826
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,450
Say it again!

827
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,240
I said you lack common sense!

828
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,720
Before you stop training,

829
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,450
let me ask you a question.

830
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,410
What kind of organization

831
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,320
is Light Chaser Rescue?

832
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,970
A civil non-profit rescue team.

833
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,720
A civil non-profit rescue team.

834
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:15,970
That's right.

835
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,240
We are a civil organization,

836
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,490
that's why we face all kinds of doubts

837
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:21,840
all the time,

838
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,050
being questioned
whether we can save lives

839
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:25,800
like a professional rescue team.

840
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,610
Many people think

841
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:28,720
we are amateurs,

842
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,800
but I want to tell you something,

843
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,680
although we're

844
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,800
a civil team,

845
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,010
we're definitely not amateurs!

846
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:39,240
What do we use

847
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,490
to break down
their prejudices against us?

848
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,320
We show them

849
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,610
our ability to rescue.

850
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:45,450
How do we acquire that?

851
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:49,320
We just take training like this

852
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,680
again and again!

853
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,890
When we're doing rescues,

854
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,050
we are dealing with

855
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,640
human lives.

856
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,450
There's no room for any mistake.

857
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,360
When we're on a mission,

858
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,360
we'll be facing earthquakes,

859
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,640
floods,

860
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,890
and mudslides.

861
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,570
How are you gonna cope with

862
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,410
these disasters and dangers

863
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,640
without strong bodies?

864
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,280
Sometimes, even a simple search

865
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,280
can take

866
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,610
three or four days.

867
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,720
Can you do it

868
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,970
without enough physical strength?

869
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,570
Of course,

870
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,800
such intense training

871
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,320
can be too much for some of you.

872
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,200
I understand.

873
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,640
I'll give you

874
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,840
one last chance.

875
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,010
Think about it carefully.

876
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,720
Are you really ready
to join the rescue team

877
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,570
and do whatever it takes

878
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,360
to save lives in any kind of crisis,

879
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,490
even it means

880
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,760
to sacrifice your own lives?

881
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,410
If you can't do this,

882
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,890
you're also welcome

883
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,930
to stay on the team

884
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,800
to do logistics support work.

885
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,840
It's also a form of dedication.

886
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,280
But if you want to be

887
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,450
a first-line rescuer,

888
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,320
you have to keep training!

889
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:35,970
Luo Ben!

890
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,490
You are the leader

891
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,530
of Fangqin Group's rescue team.

892
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,490
If you think your team

893
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:43,050
needs special treatment,

894
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,570
or if this is just a formality

895
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,800
and you're here for team building,

896
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,050
you can talk to the captain!

897
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,930
No need.

898
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,720
Can you continue?

899
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,050
Yes!

900
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,970
Good!

901
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,050
Let's continue!

902
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,240
Log on the shoulder!

903
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,800
One!

904
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,530
Two!

905
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,530
One!

906
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,160
Two!

907
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,970
One!

908
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,720
Two!

909
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,610
One!

910
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,280
Two!

911
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,050
One!

912
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,720
Two!

913
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,610
One!

914
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,160
Two!

915
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:43,130
Those are my reasons and explanations.

916
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,800
One!

917
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,410
Two!

918
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,410

921
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,610
