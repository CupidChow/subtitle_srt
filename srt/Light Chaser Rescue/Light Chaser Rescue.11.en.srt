16
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,330
You guys go inside.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
If you hadn't called me,

18
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,000
I wouldn't have known

19
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,280
that Fan is this sick.

20
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,360
You two spent every day together.

21
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,640
He has been sick for over a year,

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,050
and you had no idea.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,970
It was my negligence.

24
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,410
Have you really

25
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,410
cared about anyone?

26
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,530
Take good care of him

27
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,560
while he's in the hospital.

28
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:25,650
I don't need you to tell me that.

29
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,970
He attended the parent-teacher meetings

30
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,490
and spent my birthdays with me.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,930
He is my real dad.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,720
Yan.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,370
Because you're the hero.

34
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,810
Take a physical exam when you have time.

35
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,210
What are you doing here?

36
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,210
I'm gonna work overtime
to get these delivered.

37
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,490
You're hard-working,

38
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,210
but if you didn't

39
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,320
take so much time off,

40
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,650
you don't have to work this hard now.

41
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,440
Dude,

42
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,760
I don't want to say this,

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,040
but you can barely
feed yourself right now.

44
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,530
Why are you still doing rescues?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,690
Are you in the place to do that?

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,840
Non-profit rescue

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,210
is only for people

48
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,250
with money and time.

49
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,690
Not exactly.

50
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,600
Don't blame me for not warning you.

51
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,760
The boss is planning

52
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
to cancel the base salary,

53
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,970
which means you're gonna
work on commissions.

54
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,250
Based on your attendance record,

55
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,160
how much money can you make?

56
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,720
Besides, you asked for leave
once for a while.

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,560
The boss

58
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,530
has been unhappy with you.

59
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,130
Just do something about it.

60
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:09,720
Thank you, Hai.

61
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,530
I got it.

62
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,880
Did you listen

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,250
to me at all?

64
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,420

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,520
(Are you gonna marry me or not?)

71
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,050
(Are you gonna marry me or not?)

72
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,690
(How many times have I told you?)

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,520
(Why do you)

74
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,730
(care about that piece of paper
so much?)

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,490
(No!)

76
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,490
(What are you doing?)

77
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,520
(I'm leaving!
What do you think I'm doing?)

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,490
(Get back here!)

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,760
Can't they stop fighting?

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,560
There are people trying to sleep.

81
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,560
(Would you stop it?)

82
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,960
(I can't believe you hit me!)

83
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,080
(Stop crying!)

84
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,640
What a jerk.

85
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,520
What's going on?

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,880
(What do you want?)

87
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,370
Who are you looking for?

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,880
Please fight at other times.

89
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:04,760
Do you know

90
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,880
how late it is now?

91
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,440
Don't you know there are people
trying to sleep?

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,810
I'm not done yet!

93
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,880
How rude!

94
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,440
Open the door!

95
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,400
What do you want?

96
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,730
You're disturbing us, do you know it?

97
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,400
This is my home.

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,370
I'll do whatever I like.

99
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,560
I'll call the police if you don't leave.

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,290
Do you think that will scare me?

101
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,000
Yuan, you're here just in time.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,520
See?

103
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,850
I'm not the only one

104
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:31,560
disturbed by you.

105
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,440
Aren't you gonna call the police?

106
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,050
I'll do it for you now.

107
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,520
I suspect you

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,200
of serious domestic violence.

109
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,170
No, he didn't do it.

110
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,440
Don't call the police.

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,080
Well...

112
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,930
We're not fighting anymore.

113
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,640
It's over.

114
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,080
You just want to mess with me.

115
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,730
Are you happy now?

116
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,490
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,290
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,810
See?

119
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,050
You have to do it the hard way

120
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,250
when you're dealing with
this kind of man.

121
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,440
Let's go.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,370
(I'm not going back tonight.)

123
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,000
(Go to bed early.)

124
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,540
(Oh.)

125
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,810
Here's the information you asked for

126
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,000
on all the negotiators of Yigu.

127
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:41,080
Thank you.

128
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,200
And also,

129
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,130
people from
Anming Pharmaceutical Company

130
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,520
came here for a business discussion
on legal counsel.

131
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,290
The client wanted you

132
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,440
to take this case,

133
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,730
but somehow

134
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,520
he gave this case

135
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,760
to Gao Junchi.

136
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,490
He doesn't want me to outshine others

137
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,200
and destroy the balance of the firm.

138
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,850
So Gao Junchi took advantage.

139
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,320
The negotiation is tomorrow morning.

140
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,730
We're gonna stay up all night again.

141
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,810
You've been working hard these days.

142
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,490
Why don't you go back and get some rest?

143
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,690
How can I leave my teammate

144
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,880
at such a critical time?

145
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,730
Wanna some coffee?

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,640
Thanks.

147
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,450
(The kids love the rescue knowledge)

148
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,730
(you taught them.)

149
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,250
(Can we)

150
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,680
(go and visit)

151
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,850
(the training base?)

152
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,490
(I've been busy with work lately,)

153
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
(and I can't go to the base.)

154
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,640
(You can contact someone else.)

155
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,800
Morning, Mr. Luo.

156
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,370
Go ahead.

157
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,640
The representatives of Yigu

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
will arrive at the hotel
in half an hour.

159
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,800
Mr. Fang is waiting there.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
I'm gonna talk to him first.

161
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,730
You pulled an all-nighter.

162
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,760
Don't drive.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,400
I've hired a premier car for you.

164
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,640
I'll be there in a minute.

165
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,520
Sir, stop the car.

166
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:28,970
Okay.

167
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,280
Hu!

168
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,450
Hu!

169
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,250
Hu!

170
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,730
What happened to him?

171
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,130
He fell from above.

172
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,880
Sir.

173
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,000
Sir.

174
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,640
Can you hear me?

175
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,640
Sir.

176
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,410
Hu.

177
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,240
Sir!

178
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,480
His leg...

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,720
Hu.

180
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,640
Be careful.

181
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,740
He may have brain damage.

182
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,210
(The number you dialed)

183
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,640
(is not answered for now.)

184
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,680
(Please redial later)

185
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,490
Ai Rui'er.

186
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,890
Have you marked

187
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,440
the key points in the contract?

188
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,970
Don't worry, it has been cross-checked.

189
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,320
Good.

190
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Mr. Luo must be present

191
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,160
at this meeting.

192
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,210
What time is it? Where is he?

193
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,850
I'll call him again.

194
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,890
Hello, Mr. Morgan.

195
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,610
Hello.

196
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,250
Nice to meet you.

197
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,980
(Luo Ben)

198
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,820
(Emergency)

199
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,820
(Waiting Area)

200
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,010
How is he, Dr. Zhan?

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,800
He...

202
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,730
Fortunately, he got here in time.

203
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,680
His life is saved.

204
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,250
This is the first time

205
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,010
I've ever saved someone's life.

206
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,560
It feels...

207
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,770
You did a great job.

208
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,770
Thank you.

209
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,610
I still have a client meeting.

210
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,490
I gotta go.

211
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,440
Wait!

212
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,970
Are you meeting a client like this?

213
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:58,640
What's the matter?

214
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,560
Change it.

215
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,850
Is it Cai Yuxiao's tie?

216
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,160
I'll tell him later.

217
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:05,850
No need.

218
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,210
I'll figure it out myself.

219
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,010
Aren't you in a hurry?

220
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,010
I only take it
because you give it to me.

221
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,730
Thanks.

222
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,100
(Fangqin Group)

223
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,130
Good product quality
and excellent service

224
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,800
are our core competitiveness.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,440
The growth rate

226
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
and sales rate

227
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,490
of Fangqin

228
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,520
has been steadily increasing

229
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,090
this year.

230
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,970
Mr. Morgan.

231
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,010
If Yigu can invest in us,

232
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,520
I can guarantee

233
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,520
an average growth rate

234
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,280
of more than 20 percent

235
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,040
in the next three years.

236
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:48,850
Of course,

237
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,730
if we can

238
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,970
establish our partnership,

239
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,160
we can discuss the revenue part

240
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,520
in detail when we draw the contract.

241
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,520
Everybody knows

242
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,560
that Yigu has

243
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,370
strong capital strength,

244
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,210
which also means

245
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,970
we have very strict criteria

246
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,280
for choosing our partners.

247
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,440
As far as we know,

248
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,890
Fangqin Group has been
developing rapidly

249
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,970
since its establishment,

250
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,520
but you have a low base.

251
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,250
I'm kind of

252
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,090
worried about it.

253
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,520
(Luo Ben, why haven't you been here?)

254
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,520
Luo Ben, you are finally here.

255
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,890
Mr. Fang is really worried.

256
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:36,770
I see.

257
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,940
(Fire Alarm)

258
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,850
Susan, I'm not feeling very well
at their optimism.

259
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,250
What took you so long?

260
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,320
I didn't hear or see

262
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,280
anything that moved me today.

263
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,090
Mr. Morgan.

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,770
There are many

265
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,560
well-known companies

266
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,850
that have started from scratch.

267
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,040
Fangqin Group

268
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,730
has maintained
a good momentum of development

269
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,640
in the last few years,

270
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,370
and the Chinese market has

271
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,920
huge development potential.

272
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,130
The specific data

273
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,130
are all

274
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,160
in the report.

275
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,130
I don't need big data.

276
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,090
The data are all partial.

277
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,090
I trust

278
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,800
my own judgment more.

279
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,130
Therefore,

280
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,770
there is no need

281
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,090
to continue the meeting.

282
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,040
Excuse me for a moment.

283
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,160
Mr. Morgan.

284
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,680
This way.

285
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,210
Okay.

286
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,370
Old time, you know.

287
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,850
It's complicated.

288
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,160
What's going on?

289
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,400
Guys.

290
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,040
It's the fire alarm.

291
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,250
There is no need to panic.

292
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:35,800
I need everyone

293
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,970
to evacuate in this way.

294
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,770
This way.

295
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,090
Are you okay?

296
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,040
What's going on?

297
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,770
It's the fire alarm.

298
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,130
We need to get out of here now.

299
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,800
Okay.

300
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,040
Please evacuate in an orderly manner.

301
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,210
Keep up, everyone.

302
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,210
Hurry.

303
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,210
Hurry up, you guys in the back.

304
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,850
This way, please.

305
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,160
Okay.

306
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,770
Come with me.

307
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,640
Mr. Morgan, please.

308
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,010
Mr. Morgan, this way.

309
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,520
Here he comes.

310
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,160
Everything all right?

311
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:34,800
Yeah, I'm fine.

312
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,210
Mr. Morgan.

313
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,560
Are you okay?

314
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm okay.

315
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,850
Your response was swift.

316
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,090
Your staff did not panic

317
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,730
when the alarm went out.

318
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,520
Do you have any training like this?

319
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,400
Do you keep oxygen masks handy?

320
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,800
Fangqin Group is an enterprise

321
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
with a strong sense of crisis.

322
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,010
In the process of development

323
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,850
we don't just

324
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,730
guard against market risks,

325
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,320
we also pay great attention

326
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,650
to disaster prevention and relief.

327
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,690
Our company stipulates

328
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,930
that every employee should be trained

329
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,520
in rescue and self-rescue

330
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,040
so that they can help themselves
when disaster strikes.

331
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:10,930
In this way,

332
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,490
businesses can grow
in a sustainable way.

333
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,170
Mr. Morgan, am I right?

334
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,210
Of course.

335
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,170
Very good.

336
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:17,730
Chairman.

337
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,250
We've found the cause of the accident.

338
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,800
Someone was smoking in the bathroom

339
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,210
which set off the smoke alarm.

340
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,560
The alarm has been lifted.

341
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,170
Gentlemen, we may go upstairs now.

342
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,490
I'm truly sorry.

343
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,730
The alarm was

344
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,280
probably triggered

345
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,450
by my smoking,

346
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,970
but I'm also glad to see

347
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,360
that the senior managers

348
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,120
and the regular employees

349
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,770
were all well-trained

350
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,040
and orderly

351
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,120
when the accident

352
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,690
occurred.

353
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,770
It's very good.

354
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,800
We have reason to believe

355
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,450
that an enterprise

356
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,040
with a sense of crisis

357
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,450
will be particularly steady and solid

358
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,970
in every step it takes.

359
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,770
Therefore,

360
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:57,560
we are sincere

361
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,690
to discuss the cooperation

362
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,410
with Fangqin Group.

363
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,010
I believe

364
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,360
that you will have

365
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,280
a deeper

366
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,170
understanding of us

367
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,770
when you come to Fangqin.

368
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,320
This way, please.

369
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,010
Please.

370
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,800
Please.

371
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,250
It was awesome.

372
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,800
I knew it.

373
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,930
You're so eloquent

374
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,520
that you can talk anyone into anything.

375
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,600
So you had

376
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,080
a plan today.

377
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,170
It only occurred to me

378
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,360
when I came to the company.

379
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,690
How did you get the idea

380
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,080
to use the smoke alarm?

381
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,080
When I was doing research,

382
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,650
I found

383
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,520
that Yigu Venture Capital

384
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,800
has its own emergency rescue team.

385
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,250
(Soros set up a rescue team in 1986.)
Fangqin Group

386
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,210
also set up

387
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,490
our own emergency rescue team.

388
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,690
That's something

389
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,450
we share in common.

390
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,840
How do you know for sure

391
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,040
that Morgan was gonna trigger

392
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,170
the smoke alarm?

393
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,840
There is one important

394
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,040
piece of information you provided.

395
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,410
Mr. Morgan is

396
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,520
a heavy smoker.

397
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,840
He would smoke a cigarette

398
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,970
every 20 minutes.

399
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:09,970
So,

400
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,410
I asked Chen Xing

401
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,010
to turn up the sensitivity of the alarm.

402
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,520
I gathered

403
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
so much information

404
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,770
and you only used one piece?

405
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,800
One piece of useful information
is enough.

406
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,520
We must celebrate it tonight.

407
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,450
I'll choose the place
and order the dishes.

408
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,490
You'll just need to pay the bill.

409
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,520
No problem.

410
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,520
President.

411
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,730
I'll make a report...

412
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,490
Yuxiao.

413
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,730
I have something to tell you.

414
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,840
Something happened

415
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,210
and I needed a tie,

416
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,080
so I took yours in the office.

417
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,410
Okay, feel free to use it.

418
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,170
I knew you wouldn't mind,

419
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,360
but I'll still buy you

420
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,080
a new one.

421
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,280
No need.

422
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,730
It's a spare anyway.

423
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,770
I'm so tired.

424
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,080
I just went to the mall next to us

425
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,800
and bought some facial masks
you recommended.

426
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,040
I walked back and it tired me out.

427
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,600
What were you doing?

428
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,020
Trying to buy a tie.

429
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,740
A tie?

430
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
Why would you want to buy a tie?

431
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,860
Who is it for?

432
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,980
Cai Yuxiao.

433
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,820
Did your story start?

434
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,220
Who made the confession first?

435
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,140
Tell me everything.

436
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,860
You're thinking too much.

437
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,980
I poured my heart out for you.

438
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,260
Every time I fall in love,

439
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,220
I tell you the first time.

440
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,620
Now you're

441
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,420
giving him a tie,

442
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,860
and you still keep it from me.

443
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,980
There's nothing going on between us.

444
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,340
It's just that I took his tie

445
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,900
for emergency use,

446
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,180
so I want to buy him

447
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,940
a new one.

448
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,740
That's what this is.

449
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,860
Emergency?

450
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,420
Then the story

451
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,820
is more complicated.

452
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,180
Tell me about it.

453
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,180
Thanks. I gotta work.

454
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,940
Just tell me about it.

455
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,660
What's going on

456
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,220
between Cai Yuxiao and you?

457
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,100
Look how scared you are.

458
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,340
Li Aiqi.

459
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,500
You're starting to sound like

460
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,140
my mom when you walk.

461
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,660
I'll take that as a compliment.

462
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,940
What's the matter?

463
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,460
Have you read

464
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,220
Ding Dingding's new comic online?

465
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,420
Is it online?

466
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,140
I'll read it.

467
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,180
The number of views for this issue

468
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,620
is twice as much as the last one.

469
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,020
(Gotta sneak back now.)
Feedback from readers

470
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,220
said that Ding Dingding's comic
is humorous and pungent

471
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,620
with vivid characters

472
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,940
and funny stories.

473
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,940
(There can't be ghosts here...)
Especially the part when the heroine,

474
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,620
(Mercy, Lord Ghost!)
Ding Xiaoxiao, lectures Zhou Mengmeng.

475
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,500
(What Lord Ghost? Come back to train!)
There are over a thousand comments.

476
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,740
Ding Dingding.

477
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,140
What's wrong?

478
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,620
Can't you see

479
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,940
that she is trying to discredit me?

480
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,180
When I read these two names,

481
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,100
Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng,

482
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,180
I figured

483
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,260
you two must know each other,

484
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,500
and,

485
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,820
you two have something special.

486
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,700
I saved her life in Fengxi,

487
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,380
but she bit the hand that fed her.

488
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,660
I think as long as comics are popular,

489
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,980
it's okay to exaggerate

490
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,420
the story a little bit.

491
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,500
It's not okay.

492
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,380
I paid her to draw comics,

493
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,620
but she disparaged me in it.

494
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
That's what I paid for?

495
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,420
Change it. All of it.

496
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,580
All of it?

497
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,980
That can't be done.

498
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,140
At least what's published

499
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,020
can't be changed.

500
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,100
Then change the rest of the story.

501
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,340
Anyway, make Zhou Mengmeng

502
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,660
a positive character.

503
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,020
What if she doesn't agree?

504
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,700
I have a plan for that.

505
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,820
Therefore,

506
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,340
I specially added a clause

507
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,140
in the contract

508
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,700
that she is obliged

509
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,900
to modify the comics

510
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,660
according to Party A's opinions,

511
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,580
which are my opinions,

512
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,700
until Party A is satisfied.

513
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,700
I'm not gonna do it.

514
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,220
This is not what I wanted

515
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,620
for my comics in the first place.

516
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,460
What's more, the readers

517
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,820
like the character	setting

518
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,940
of Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng.

519
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,180
If I change it now,

520
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,250
it will ruin the whole work.

521
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,820
We've taken that

522
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,940
into consideration.

523
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,500
Our director said

524
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,540
that we can keep

525
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,420
the previous chapters unchanged,

526
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,820
but you need to adjust

527
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,820
the rest of the story

528
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,420
and gradually change

529
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,460
the character setting

530
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,420
of Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng.

531
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,180
Easy for you to say.

532
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,180
Where is your director?

533
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,980
Put him on the phone.

534
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,620
He's not available right now.

535
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,020
You can talk to me.

536
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,340
What kind of stupid director?

537
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,540
Does he understand comics at all?

538
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,300
Hello?

539
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:19,620
Hello?

540
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,900
What's that attitude?

541
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,340
Why don't you talk to her yourself?

542
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,580
She doesn't know I signed her.

543
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,340
It's kind of complicated.

544
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
I'm not just her client.

545
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,380
We're also teammates.

546
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,580
It's better not to make things too ugly.

547
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,300
She drew you that way.

548
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:39,940
I don't think she would care

549
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,420
if things get ugly.

550
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,540
Well, her brain

551
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,020
doesn't work in a normal way.

552
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,340
She is not like us.

553
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,580
Fine.

554
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,740
I have a word of advice for you.

555
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,380
You won't keep it for too long.

556
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,060
I know.

557
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,300
You're talking

558
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,660
like my mom right now.

559
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,180
I'll go to work.

560
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,020
(Mingmei Media)

561
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,580
Hello.

562
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,100
What can I do for you?

563
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,540
I want to see your director.

564
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,380
Which director do you mean?

565
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,340
Well,

566
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,500
let me see Li Aiqi then.

567
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,340
Li...

568
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,540
Secretary Li?

569
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,580
- Yes.
- Wait a second.

570
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,740
I'll get her for you.

571
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,740
Okay, thanks.

572
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,100
Do you have all the sizes?

573
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,940
Try this one on.

574
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,500
Okay.

575
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,180
Shh.

576
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,780
(Love and Destiny)

577
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,260
Ding Dingding.

578
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,100
Yes.

579
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,340
Come with me.

580
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,780
Are you here because of

581
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,140
the change of the story
and the character setting?

582
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,660
Yes.

583
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,340
I want to talk
to your director in person.

584
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
He's not here right now.

585
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,140
By the way,

586
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,100
how should I address your director?

587
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,180
You can call him Director Ming.

588
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,500
Director Ming.

589
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,820
I need to talk to Director Ming.

590
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,340
My comics can't be changed.

591
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,540
I've made it

592
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,340
very clear

593
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,300
what Director Ming wants.

594
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,940
If you don't agree,

595
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,420
we'll have to act
in accordance with the contract.

596
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,420
Article 5 Clause 3
of the Contract stipulates

597
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,340
that Party B has the obligation

598
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,380
to modify the contents of the comics

599
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,580
as required by Party A

600
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,140
until Party A is satisfied.

601
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,140
If you refuse to do this,

602
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,860
we can only terminate the contract.

603
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,060
Okay. Terminate it.

604
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,860
Fine,

605
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,780
I'll call the legal department right now

606
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,100
to draft a termination.

607
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,380
You only need to refund

608
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,300
the money paid by us

609
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,660
in a lump sum within the specified time.

610
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,820
Refund?

611
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,940
Is there any problem?

612
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,540
I've used it to pay my rent...

613
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,060
In this case,

614
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,260
according to the contract...

615
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,860
Secretary Li, it's like this,

616
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,100
in fact,

617
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,340
I have

618
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,740
a lot of creative ideas.

619
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,900
As long as it's for
the sake of the comics,

620
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,860
I can be open

621
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,580
to the opinions of others.

622
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,740
So?

623
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,820
I'll change it

624
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,540
I'll change it as you want.

625
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,940
That's great.

626
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:50,860
Happy to work with you.

627
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,500
Yeah, it gotta be happy.

628
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,100
Take care.

629
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,060
(If I hadn't run out of money recently,)

630
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,060
(I would have left without hesitation.)

631
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,420
Take care. Bye.

632
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,860
Bye-bye.

633
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,180
Have you fixed it?

634
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,060
No wonder my mom

635
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,100
thinks highly of you.

636
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,340
There's nothing you can't get done.

637
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,620
I'll buy you a meal sometime.

638
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,060
How many meals

639
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,180
do you owe me now?

640
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,620
Well...

641
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,580
Where's my bus pass?

642
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,660
Ding Dingding!

643
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,940
I left something here.

644
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,740
Zhou Mingming?

645
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,820
Ding Dingding?

646
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,420
Aiqi.

647
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,740
Here is your coffee.

648
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,660
Thank you.

649
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,620
I knew it was you.

650
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,900
What are you doing here?

651
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,340
I work here.

652
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,020
Do you need to work?

653
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,140
I just find a place to kill time.

654
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,140
What's your position?

655
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,340
I just run some errands.

656
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,340
Does that include serving tea and water?

657
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,820
Looks like you're not doing that well.

658
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,140
By the way,

659
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,420
what do you think of

660
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,180
Director Ming?

661
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,780
Director Ming?

662
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,300
You mean him.

663
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,420
Is he a tricky one?

664
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,900
I think he just pretends to know

665
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,860
what he doesn't know,

666
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,340
right?

667
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,940
Aren't you here to get something?

668
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,860
It's right here.

669
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,260
I'll talk to you later.

670
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,340
Is he gone?

671
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,140
Well, Zhou Mingming.

672
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,260
You owe me another meal.

673
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,860
Bed 15's wound

674
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,060
is not healing well today.

675
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,540
Keep him here for a few more days.

676
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,100
- Okay.
- Okay.

677
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,500
Let's go over there.

678
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,340
Yuxiao.

679
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,060
What's the matter?

680
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,580
Here is the tie for you.

681
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,940
I said you don't need to buy it.

682
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,340
Take it.

683
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,020
Okay.

684
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,260
I'll take it.

685
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,780
The color looks good.

686
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,780
Where is Dr. Zhan?

687
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,020
I can't reach her.

688
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,020
She's in a meeting.

689
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,060
What's the matter?

690
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,860
I...

691
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,300
It's all right.

692
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,820
Mr. Luo.

693
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,580
Dr. Cai.

694
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,940
Are you here for Dr. Zhan?

695
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,660
I'll be fine with you.

696
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,540
What do you mean?

697
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,060
Zhan Yan gave me your tie

698
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,100
for emergency use.

699
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,540
I bought a new one for you.

700
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,260
Thank you.

701
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,820
You don't need to do this.

702
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,580
I don't want to owe others anything.

703
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,420
You don't owe me anything.

704
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,060
Dr. Zhan has bought

705
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,500
a new one for me.

706
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,940
Keep it.

707
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,940
Dr. Cai.

708
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,940
I'm not feeling

709
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,060
very well recently.

710
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,940
My chest is always tight.

711
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,580
Can you take a look at it for me?

712
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,020
Did you get an ECG?

713
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,300
No.

714
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,340
I suggest you take an ECG first.

715
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,860
Come in.

716
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,300
Mr. Luo.

717
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,620
What brings you here today?

718
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,860
You don't have to

719
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,580
bring me a gift, you know.

720
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,180
A tie?

721
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,500
Keep it if you like.

722
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:51,940
It sounds like

723
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
it's not for me.

724
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,100
Besides,

725
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,300
I've never worn a tie

726
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,420
in my whole life.

727
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,140
Tell me what you like.

728
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,260
I'll buy it for you right now.

729
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,020
Do you mean it?

730
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,340
Also buy me some wine.

731
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:11,580
Well...

732
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,380
You're putting me
in a difficult position.

733
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,860
How is that possible?

734
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,340
How is that impossible?

735
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,940
That's my thing.

736
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
Just help me out.

737
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
I...

738
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,020
It's not an easy task.

739
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,100
If it's easy, would I ask you to do it?

740
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,260
Fine.

741
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,300
All right.

742
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,540
Just wait here.

743
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,100
I'll buy it for you.

744
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,660
Thank you.

745
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,380
Go ahead and hurry.

746
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,340
Here's your coffee, Dr. Cai.

747
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:39,860
Thank you.

748
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,180
Congratulations.

749
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,660
On what?

750
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,020
I heard that Zhan Yan

751
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,100
gave you a tie.

752
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,820
Is that true?

753
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,940
It means something

754
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,340
when a girl gives a tie to a boy.

755
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,340
I know

756
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,860
you're still interested in Zhan Yan.

757
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,060
Seize the opportunity.

758
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Do it well.

759
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,500
You're not young anymore.

760
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,860
Don't make me worry about you
all the time.

761
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,020
Okay?

762
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,420
It's working time.

763
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,940
Don't gossip.

764
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,740
Keep playing cool.

765
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,340
My good man.

766
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,740
My good friend.

767
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,020
Look,

768
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,860
if Zhan Yan finds out,

769
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,820
neither of us can get out of this.

770
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,180
It's just between you and me.

771
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,860
She won't know if you don't tell her.

772
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,860
It's better between you and me.

773
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,620
All right.

774
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:48,340
Stop eating.

775
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,780
Let me finish the last one.

776
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,900
How many have you had?

777
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,780
Is there ever the last one?

778
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,860
Since you bought them,

779
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
let's not waste food.

780
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,940
You shouldn't eat too much
in your condition.

781
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,740
Who allowed you to eat that?

782
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,660
Oh, no.

783
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:06,900
Oh, no.

784
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,700
I said I can't eat

785
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,140
greasy food in my condition!

786
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,620
He had to buy these for me.

787
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,380
He also said...

788
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,460
I had to buy these for you?

789
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,340
...it's just between him and me.

790
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,980
Well...

791
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,620
What did I tell you?

792
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,220
- Mr. Luo.
- You're...

793
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,620
Did you buy these?

794
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
No...

795
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,260
Yes.

796
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:31,980
I bought them.

797
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,340
Don't you know

798
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,540
his condition?

799
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,340
Don't you know

800
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,900
he can't eat something so greasy?

801
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:39,860
Exactly.

802
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,940
Why did you buy it?

803
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,860
I won't buy it next time.

804
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,740
Well, Yan.

805
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,860
He is still young.

806
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,460
Allow him to make mistakes.

807
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,660
He'll correct them.

808
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,420
How are you feeling today?

809
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,620
I'm feeling much better.

810
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,340
The doctor said
I can leave the hospital tomorrow.

811
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,820
Even if you leave the hospital,

812
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,500
you have to keep a light diet.

813
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,060
You're right.

814
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,180
I'll see to it.

815
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,260
All right, you're busy.

816
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:06,980
Just go.

817
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,860
Don't worry about me.

818
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,700
Us.

819
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,140
Here, Dr. Zhan.

820
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,340
It's for your own good.

821
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,620
It's for your good.

822
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,700
Don't do it again.

823
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,260
Okay.

824
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,540
Are you still eating?

825
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,020
Stop.

826
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,780
Let me take these away.

827
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,980
Well, Falcon.

828
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:49,940
Look,

829
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,900
I've seen people stab in the back,

830
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,980
but you blamed it on me

831
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,620
when I'm still here.

832
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,740
I've never seen anyone do that.

833
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:56,900
Shh.

834
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,380
It's just

835
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,540
between you and me.

836
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,820
How can you still say that?

837
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,940
Thank you.

838
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,540
Thank you for covering for me.

839
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,860
I owe you one.

840
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
I'm glad you know that.

841
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,180
Come on.

842
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,220
Let's go for a walk.

843
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,340
Well...

844
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,020
Does the doctor allow you
to take a walk?

845
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,900
I can't eat,

846
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,220
and I can't walk now?

847
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,540
Besides,

848
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,500
I just had two chicken legs.

849
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,540
I have to digest them.

850
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,900
Walk a hundred steps after each meal

851
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,260
and you will live a long life.

852
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:24,860
Come on.

853
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,540
Let's go.

854
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,460
Look at yourself.

855
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,500
You tie knots everywhere you go.

856
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,300
Older members like us

857
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,780
have such a habit.

858
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,180
Look, this little rope

859
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,420
can be used to lift things

860
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,820
and pull things.

861
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,140
If anyone messes with me,

862
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,820
I can also

863
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,380
teach him a lesson.

864
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,220
Let me take a look.

865
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,380
Take it.

866
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,140
Let's sit down for a while.

867
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,740
I heard you failed the test?

868
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,500
It was purely accidental

869
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,700
about this test.

870
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,060
Do you blame Dr. Cai?

871
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,780
I don't blame him.

872
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,500
Do you think it's unfair?

873
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:20,540
Yes.

874
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,500
I just don't think it's fair.

875
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,780
There's nothing fair or unfair about it.

876
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,340
The rescue team's

877
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,140
test questions

878
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,340
weren't set

879
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,340
to give you a hard time, right?

880
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,860
Think about it by yourself.

881
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,340
What was that about?

882
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,420
In the rescue business,

883
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,500
you can never

884
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,140
be more cautious.

885
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,460
Why?

886
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,740
Because we're

887
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,420
dealing with lives.

888
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,020
Take me for example,

889
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,700
I've tied knots

890
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,860
for more than 20 years,

891
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,420
and I still do it every day.

892
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,020
Why?

893
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,980
I'm turning it

894
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,540
into muscle memory

895
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,020
and making it etched in my mind.

896
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,820
I have to make sure
nothing would go wrong

897
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,340
when I'm doing rescues.

898
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,420
Do you get it?

899
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:14,980
Yes.

900
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,860
I understand.

901
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,980
You don't have to comfort me.

902
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,740
I know you don't understand

903
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,940
from your look.

904
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,660
Based on your look,

905
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,060
you're still this far away
from understanding it.

906
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,340
It's only this far.

907
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,860
Hand drill!

908
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,340
How many times have I told you?

909
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,780
Mind the structural,
angle, and position!

910
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
Got it!

911
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,220
And you!

912
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,460
Hold it steady and don't shake it.

913
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,620
Yes!

914
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,660
Continue!

915
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,940
Everybody be careful!

916
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,300
Okay!

917
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:07,820
Falcon!

918
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,780
Falcon is back!

919
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:10,020
You're finally back!

920
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,700
Well?

921
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,220
Captain.

922
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,340
Do you want me to come back

923
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,260
or never come back?

924
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,460
See?

925
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,540
It's unfair to say that.

926
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,740
He even took my speaker!

927
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,780
I'm keeping an eye on them for you,

928
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,860
lest they slack off!

929
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:23,540
Here.

930
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,420
Since you're back, you can take it.

931
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Keep it yourself.

932
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,620
Don't try to slack off.

933
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,900
It's your speaker.

934
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,780
Take it when I ask you to.

935
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,820
Why do you have so much to say?

936
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,260
Take it, Falcon.

937
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,340
We feel something's missing

938
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
without you shouting orders

939
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,940
by our ears.

940
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,180
Yeah.

941
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,900
Falcon.

942
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,940
Everybody cares about you.

943
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,340
I'm getting tired of them asking me

944
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,020
about your condition all the time.

945
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,540
Guys!

946
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,340
Rest assured!

947
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,340
My body is indestructible!

948
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,540
Great!

949
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,860
My little Bun-bun!

950
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,060
Bun-bun, come over here.

951
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,420
I miss you so much.

952
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,020
I hope Xiong Fei

953
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:07,260
didn't starve you.

954
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,700
Xiong Fei hasn't been around this week.

955
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,500
The team took turns

956
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,900
to look after Bun-bun for you.

957
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,420
Yeah.

958
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,780
We take care of it every day.

959
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,060
Why are you looking at me?

960
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,180
Go get trained!

961
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,380
Okay, go get trained!

962
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,540
Yes!

963
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,020
I'll take Bun-bun to have some fun.

964
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,540
Okay.

965
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,030
Come on, bun-bun!

966
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,780
