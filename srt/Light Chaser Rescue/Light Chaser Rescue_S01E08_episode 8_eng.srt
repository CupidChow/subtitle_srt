1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,980

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,900
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,180
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,000
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,540
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,560
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,320
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,560
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,420
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,480
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,500
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,220
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,560
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,220
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,360
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,940
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,980

19
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,440

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,920
Lele, try some more eggs.

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:45,419
You know our rule. No leftovers.

22
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,900
Eat more.

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,120
That's good.

24
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,359
Captain Ruan.

25
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,359
The stressor of Lele's hysteria is the Fengxi earthquake.

26
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,160
He saw so many injured and dead people there.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,359
It makes him feel like he is a patient with a broken leg.

28
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,699
So he doesn't want to eat anything.

29
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,020
So how did you manage to encourage him to eat?

30
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,440
Just making him feel he is a normal person.

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,579
Eating is what normal people do every day.

32
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:20,159
So it unconsciously helps him to recover step by step.

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,640
If the recovery goes well, Lele will get out the bed and walk soon. Right?

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,439
I can't say 100%.

35
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,900
Because it's up to him whether he can overcome his psychological trauma.

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,039
I think... we should find a chance to stimulate his mind.

37
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,460
Like last time, the bear dish we made for him reminded him of his mother.

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,319
His mother?

39
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,500
Thank you, Captain Ruan.

40
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,120
Lele, still needs your help.

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,839
Don't worry. I will take care of him.

42
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,660
We have to leave.

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,819
- See you. Ruan. 
 - Zhan Yan.

44
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:58,020
Your father is pleased that you came.

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,680
He doesn't want to disturb you,

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
but he has you on his mind.

47
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,759
I have to go to the hospital this afternoon.

48
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,540
- See you. 
 - Zhan Yan.

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,979
You brought Lele to me, to make his wounds heal faster.

50
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:12,359
But what about you?

51
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,140
After so many years, the heart knot still can't be unraveled. Right?

52
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,639
It's not a knot if it can be unraveled.

53
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,120
Thank you, Ruan.

54
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,480

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,099
 Thank you so much.

56
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,140
It is our job to spread knowledge of emergency rescue.

57
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,800
It's something I should do.

58
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,599
 How's the day after tomorrow?

59
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,199
 It's Lele's birthday. I want to make a cake for him.

60
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,159
 Are you available to help me?

61
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:08,560
 I know you are busy, but you saved Lele,

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,480
 so you are important to him.

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,900
 He must hope you will attend his birthday party.

64
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,920
Here are the documents of Yigu, and this is your delivery.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,050
Thank you.

66
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,479
The delivery is from Fengxi.

67
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:28,959
What is it?

68
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,299
This is my personal privacy.

69
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:35,480
I can keep silent, right?

70
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,620
And keep collecting the documents about Yigu,  I need more details.

71
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,219
I know.

72
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,580
 Wonderful.

73
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,339
Let's first spread this cream on the cake base.

74
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,939
Look at me.

75
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,959
Let's simply spread it.

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,300
Then, I'll use the turn table.

77
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,799
Right? And spread the cream to the edge.

78
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,339
Then repeat the process.

79
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on, try by yourself.

80
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:36,659
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

81
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,299
- I came to get the cake. 
 - No problem.

82
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,900
Please wait a second.

83
00:05:51,739 --> 00:05:53,280
 Use it.

84
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,500
 - Sir. 
 - It's good.

85
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,200
Sir, here's your cake.

86
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,900
Oh, thank you.

87
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,360
Right, this is the way.

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,759
It's great. You did a good job.

89
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,420
 My baby.

90
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,500
 Thank you, for choosing us to be your parents.

91
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,999
 You brought us great happiness.

92
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,680
 In the future...

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,339
Mom! Mom!

94
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:27,300
 ...Dad and Mom will always be with you forever.

95
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,179
 Lele, you are a little bird.

96
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,920
 - You have a long way to go in the upcoming days.  
 - Mom! Mom!

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,179
 You can find the beautiful things in this world.

98
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,499
 - I hope you will...  
 - Where are you?

99
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:46,850
 I hope you can grow up...

100
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,190
 happily.

101
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,060
 I want to see...

102
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,840
 your smile.

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,620
 - Lele.  
 - Mom.

104
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,059
 Dad and mom failed to... stay by your side,

105
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,399
 but we will...

106
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,699
- Mom. 
  - we will... be in your heart forever.

107
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,219
 When the future comes,

108
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,599
 Dad and Mom... will always stay by your side.

109
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,300
 No.

110
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,179
 We will still be in your heart

111
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,820
 ...and be with you.

112
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,679
 Dad and Mom will love you forever.

113
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,560

114
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,279
Mom.

115
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,900
Lele.

116
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,139
Actually, your dad and mom did not leave you,

117
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:23,379
but they just live somewhere else now and will stay with you in another way.

118
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,020
We are your family, too.

119
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,160
We will be with you to spend every birthday from now on.

120
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,720
The camel is one of the toughest animals on this earth.

121
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,679
I hope, you can grow up like it.

122
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:45,220
Come on.

123
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,819
Make a wish, Lele.

124
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,370

125
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,859
This is called the bowline.

126
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,779
It is famous because its a reliable and fixed loop.

127
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:36,880
When you are in danger, you need to use a rope.

128
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,159
So the key to getting out of danger is to make a strong knot

129
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:43,379
and to tie it as fast as you can.

130
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:46,540
Look at me. A'Rui, I'll tell you how to tie one.

131
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,720
A'Rui,

132
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,220
why won't you stay at home after school?

133
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,659
What are you doing here?

134
00:10:50,659 --> 00:10:52,900
I... I...

135
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,820
I'm waiting for you.

136
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,879
I don't believe you. Go.

137
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,740
I've told you before. Stay away from him.

138
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,219
Why did you play with him again? Go home.

139
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:01,800
Throw away the loop.

140
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,099
Why are you interested in such a rope?

141
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:05,319
Do you hear me?

142
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,600
Listen to me, or I will beat you when we get home.

143
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,059
Every day, you never listen to me.

144
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,699
Did they say something rude to you again?

145
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:20,340
I'm good. I know they don't mean it.

146
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,459
How dare they?

147
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,459
When you were recruited into the university, they got close to you.

148
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:31,880
But now they treat you as a virus, escaping from us.

149
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,379
Just don't take them seriously. We live in our way.

150
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:36,679
I'm so starving after work. What is Dad cooking today?

151
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:39,379
- Delicious food. 
 - Really. Let's go. I can't wait.

152
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,979
What is it? The smell is great.

153
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:10,659
You should wash your hands first.

154
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:16,999
 Help!

155
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:20,339
 Please, help.

156
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,919
 Anybody here? Help.

157
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:26,620
 Help!

158
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
 Rui, don't be afraid!

159
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,379
 Don't worry. Mom is here with you!

160
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,100
Can anyone find a bed sheet?

161
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,799
We must find a bed sheet.

162
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,259
Everyone, hold it tightly.

163
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,280
Clench it tightly.

164
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,000
And stretch the sheet.

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,140
 Rui, grab the rope!

166
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,079
 Don't move! I'm coming to save you!

167
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,220

168
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:20,679
Rui. Don't move.

169
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,039
Grab the rope.

170
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,380
Help.

171
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,679
Stay there.

172
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,040
- Hold on! 
  - Slowly.

173
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,879
 Watch out. Watch out.

174
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,100
 Be careful.

175
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,860
 Watch out.

176
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,020
A'Rui!

177
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,140
 Move slowly.

178
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,600
 It's too dangerous.

179
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,040
 Watch out. Be careful with the kid.

180
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
Hold me.

181
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
 It's so dangerous.  Watch out.

182
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,800
 Watch out.

183
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,000
 Be careful.

184
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,280
Slow down. How did he get to the roof?

185
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,820
 Watch out.

186
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,099
 Pull up.

187
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:04,600
 It's so dangerous up there.

188
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,059
 Be careful.

189
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:07,120
 Watch out.

190
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,460
 Watch out.

191
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,960
 Be careful.

192
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,240
 Look out.

193
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,520
 Watch out.

194
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,920
 They are coming down. He's safe.

195
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,179
 Easy. Easy.

196
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,180
 Come on.

197
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,959
How are you? Are you hurt?

198
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,659
A'Rui! I was so scared.

199
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:31,739
It was too dangerous.

200
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:33,120
A'Rui, are you all right?

201
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,399
That was a close call. Are you okay?

202
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,260
Well, enough. It's done. It's over. Just leave.

203
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,260
Don't stay here. There is nothing happening now.

204
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,560
Take care of your kids.

205
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,920
Let's untie the knot.

206
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,959
It's good now, Mom.

207
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,540
- Thanks to Xiong Fei, 
 - Yes.

208
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,000
or it would have been all over.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,459
- Did you get any rope burn? 
 - No. Don't worry.

210
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,060
Let's go. You haven't finished cooking.

211
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,679
- Let's go home. 
 - Xiong Fei, don't you know I have hypertension?

212
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,039
I won't do it again. Calm down.

213
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:58,199
 What a good man. He saved the boy.

214
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,700
 Let's go. It's done.

215
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,340
 Lucky for the boy.

216
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,399
 We should leave now.

217
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,980
 It was so dangerous.

218
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:15,939
Ariel, find me some information on someone.

219
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,700
Come in.

220
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,279
What's happening?

221
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,000
Li Aiqi, please do me a favor.

222
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,300
I won't lie to the chairman of the board to help you.

223
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,839
No.

224
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,059
I want to apply for a company management training program. Any suggestions?

225
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,599
You? Do you want to study?

226
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:42,720
Of course.

227
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,560
I should study while I'm working.

228
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,780
I believe, it is the combination of theory and practice.

229
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,200
If the chairman knows about it, she would be satisfied.

230
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,199
Sure. I'll arrange it for you.

231
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,819
Thank you.

232
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:25,500
Brother.

233
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,059
Yuan Yuan.

234
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,479
I want to ask you something about Xiong Fei.

235
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:45,120
 Xiong Fei? What do you want to ask?

236
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,380
 Are you worried about him?

237
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,339
 You took him wrong before.

238
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,699
 So I can understand you.

239
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:54,539
 But he saved me when the earthquake occurred.

240
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,199
 He is a nice man.

241
00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,100
 I really want to have this friend.

242
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,960
Of course, you can make friends.

243
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,279
But you should know... human nature is complicated.

244
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,219
It's hard to say a man is 100% good or bad.

245
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:15,319
When you were a kid, your friendships were true and pure.

246
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,739
I'm afraid you will get hurt.

247
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:21,400
 Brother, you have a prejudice against Xiong Fei.

248
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,510
 Do you have any evidence to prove that he is a bad person?

249
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,420
Trust me. I've been dealing with different cases for so many years.

250
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,720
I can intuitively feel what kind of man or case it is.

251
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,000
You believe in your intuition.

252
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,179
But I believe more in what I see.

253
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,859
Yuan Yuan, I didn't mean to tell you.

254
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,019
But you believe in him too much.

255
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,240
 What do you want to tell me?

256
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,599
He's been in jail before.

257
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,319
Here's the document.

258
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:23,210

259
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,310

260
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,670

261
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:55,720
It's almost over, Brother Hai.

262
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,060
Good.

263
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,460
The girl also came here before.

264
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,620
She's coming for you.

265
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,540
Ms. Luo.

266
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:18,900
For me?

267
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,140
Thank you.

268
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,380
But I've had lunch.

269
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,959
You...

270
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,759
You came to see me... Is anything going on?

271
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,919
 I believe in you.

272
00:19:57,479 --> 00:19:58,460
She just left?

273
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,540
What does she mean?

274
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,680
She may think you are a good man.

275
00:20:11,999 --> 00:20:15,539
We're still working on the insurance issue.

276
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,700
And a few companies would like to cooperate with us.

277
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,099
Don't worry.

278
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:25,539
We must help the rescue members get insurance and protect them

279
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:28,780
while they are saving others' lives.

280
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,040
Director Liu, you've solved a big problem for us.

281
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,120
As a non-profit rescue team, thanks to the support

282
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,340
from official departments, other organizations,

283
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,079
and so many people, we have been able to help the world till now.

284
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,539
And thank you, Director Liu.

285
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:45,960
This is what I should do.

286
00:20:46,499 --> 00:20:52,419
Well, one more thing, here's one more present for you.

287
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,119
What is it?

288
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,320
I've discussed this with Central Hospital.

289
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,300
As a representative of International Medical Rescue,

290
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,979
Zhan Yan will be the instructor of beginner training.

291
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,400
She'll support you in emergency rescue.

292
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,080
Sure.

293
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,880
Why is it me?

294
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,239
Emergency rescue is important to human life.

295
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,959
If we get any missions, we must try our best to do them.

296
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:20,899
The doctor we recommend should be perfect for it.

297
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:22,799
Dr. Zhan,

298
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,719
as one of the best doctors in our hospital,

299
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:29,019
you are also a member of International Medical Rescue.

300
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm not asking you what you think. This is a notice.

301
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,640
You should prepare for it now.

302
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,300
Your work here should be left to other doctors.

303
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,599
Tomorrow, you'll work with the rescue team.

304
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,019
Good morning.

305
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:45,959
I'm the captain of Light Chaser Rescue, Qingshan.

306
00:21:45,959 --> 00:21:50,720
From today, the training in emergency rescue begins.

307
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,560
I know you're from different regions and from all walks of life.

308
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,880
But no matter what you do, what kind of title you have,

309
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,940
now there're only two kinds of identities here: instructors and team members.

310
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,039
Team members must follow the order of the instructor.

311
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,419
Do you understand?

312
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:07,300
 Understood!

313
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,500
Hey, buddy.

314
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,700
Hi.

315
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,600
May I have your WeChat account?

316
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,400
We can take care of each other later.

317
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,600
- Sure thing. 
 - No problem.

318
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,300
- I'll scan your QR code. 
 - Here, here's my code.

319
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,000
Here, this is my code.

320
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,840
Chen Xing. Wang Yu.

321
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,200
- It's me. I got you. 
 - Your name is Ding Dingding.

322
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
- Yeah, right. 
 - An interesting name.

323
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
Why did you decide to join Light Chaser Rescue?

324
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,900
We're from Fangqin Group Rescue to get trained here.

325
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,200
How about you?

326
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,600
I...

327
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm kind of doing research.

328
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,000
Research?

329
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,800
You're a writer.

330
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,100
Not really.

331
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm a cartoonist.

332
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,400
Cartoonist?

333
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,100
Well. Give me your phone number.

334
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,900
- Let's keep in touch, come on. 
 - Okay, no problem.

335
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,300
- Add me on your WeChat. 
 - I scan your QR.

336
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,600
Okay, you first.

337
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
You all can scan my QR together.

338
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,900
Tell us. What's your work? I do love comics.

339
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
I'll tell you later.

340
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,200
Come on.

341
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,400
All materials are sent?

342
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,100
 No, when I organize the rest of the details, I'll send them to you soon.

343
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,000
Okay, keep up the good work.

344
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,600
I'm wondering why I didn't see you on the training course.

345
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,000
So you're just moving your office here.

346
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,200
I do have work.

347
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,700
You should train seriously if you're here.

348
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,100
There are no requirements for the leader, right?

349
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,600
As the leader, I'm only responsible for leading and managing the team.

350
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,700
Only instructors and trainees here.

351
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,000
If you're a leader of your group,

352
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,900
you must have better physical fitness and skills than your team members.

353
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,800
But if you insist on working here,

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,600
then I only can suggest that Fangqin Group change to another leader for training.

355
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,000
Ka Mei. Name list.

356

♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

357
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,800

358

♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

359

♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

361
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,400
Straighten your backs.

00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,600
Don't pop your butts.

363

♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

366
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,900
Don't force yourself to hang on.

367
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,400
Why do you say force?

368
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
Never admitting defeat.

♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

370
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,200
Why are you here to suffer?

371
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,300
Like you, go and have a drink and chat with friends,

372
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,300
which can also promote consumption.

373
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,800
That benefits all.

374
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,400
Don't talk to each other.

375
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,200
Save your energy.

376
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,000
It's just a start.

377
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,100
 Come on!

378
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,100
 Run!

379
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,500
 Hurry up!

380
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,300
 Come on!

381
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,700
 Run!

382
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,200
 Hang on. Fighting!

383
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,319
 Fighting!

384
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,000
 Dingding, hang on!

385
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,800
 You can do it!

386
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,600
 Dingding go!

387
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,600
 Come on!

388
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,200
Higher, higher!

389
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,000
Higher, why are you so uncoordinated?

390
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Speed up!

391
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,200
Come on! Ten seconds!

392
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,000
Eight!

393
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Keep up, everyone!

394
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,400
 Come on!

395
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,600
♫  The dreams I carry will be burning  ♫

396
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:41,710
♫  Will be flaming hot, will be blooming  ♫

397
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,300
I originally thought it was just extended training.

398
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,100
I had no idea it was so serious.

399
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm so tired.

400
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,800
Our president wants to form a group rescue team. Maybe it's his request.

401
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,700
Stop complaining.

402
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,200
I suffered more.

403
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,900
I thought that non-profit rescue wouldn't have so much serious training.

404
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,000
I thought it was okay to come here and meet new friends.

405
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You came here to expand your friend network?

406
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,700
It's a low idea.

407
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,800
Why do you say we're low-level?

408
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,300
Who is low-level?

409
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,000
No. Bro, don't get me wrong.

410
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,800
I don't mean you, I mean she's low.

411
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,100
Everyone joined this rescue training, so we must have high-level of thought.

412
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,800
I'm afraid that someone is incompetent.

413
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,100
Yeah, indeed someone incompetent here. We'll see.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,700
What do you think this group of members?

415
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,900
Some of them are not bad.

416
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,700
Including him?

417
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,200
You have something against him?

418
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I just can't stand his self-righteous style.

419
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,600
I don't know if he came to get trained or to just get a reputation.

420
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,000
He is not like us.

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,400
Bringing me so much again?

422
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,800
Are you worried that I don't eat?

423
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,800
No, I was just worried that you didn't buy anything good.

424
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,500
It's better to save your money to buy a lock, right?

425
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
Stubborn girl.

426
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,600
Have you seen your father?

427
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,700
In this training, which part do you take?

428
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
City rescue.

429
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,200
- Yan, listen. 
 - See?

430
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,100
The coat I bought for you, I forget to give to you. Try it.

431
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,500
Why do you buy me more coats?

432
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,280
I'm fine wearing a uniform.

433
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,300
Try it.

434
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,000
Great. I haven't tried this style before.

435
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,900
Two coats?

436
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Both are for you. You have a try.

437
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,400
They are the same?

438
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,400
- Doctor Zhan. 
 - Doctor Zhan.

439
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
- Prepare for training. 
 - Okay.

440
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,700

441
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,200
 Yan.

442
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,400
 How many shuttle runs did you do?

443
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,200
 I've ran 5 times.

444
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,500
 - I've run 7 times. 
 - You're the best.

445
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,000
 Come on.

446
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,200
 Worse than before.

447
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
 Yeah.

448
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
 Like this, right?

449
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,400
 Waist power.

450
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,500
 You know that?

451
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,000
 Bro, water.

452
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,200
 - Take it. 
 - Thanks.

453
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Assemble!

454
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,700
Now we're going to get log lift training.

455
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:22,700
The aim of this training is to practice your fitness, endurance, and teamwork ability.

456
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,800
If your strength is good, with good teamwork ability,

457
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,200
you can hang on for a long time.

458
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,800
Now, listen.

459
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,000
Lift the log.

460
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,600
Come on.

461
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,200
So troublesome.

462
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
One.

463
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,600
Two.

464
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,200
One.

465
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,500
Two.

466
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,700
One.

467
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,700
Two.

468
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,700
One.

469
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,200
Two.

470
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,400
One.

471
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,700
- Two. 
 - Sir.

472
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Ding Dingding, come out.

473
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Go on.

474
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,300
Sir, I request a rest.

475
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,700
Why?

476
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,900
I can't practice anymore.

477
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,600
It's only several minutes.

478
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,800
No, I can't.

479
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
I can't carry on.

480
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,800
Have you made up your mind?

481
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,600
If you give up now, your score will be influenced.

482
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,400
What if I get low scores?

483
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,500
Three consecutive failures, you'll be kicked out of the training in advance.

484
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Okay, I'll keep on training then.

485
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Or...

486
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,500
Shut up.

487
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,500
Or... maybe...

488
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Saving energy can help to hang on for a longer time.

489
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,000
One.

490
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,000
Two.

491
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
One.

492
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,400
Two.

493
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,800
One.

494
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,200
Two.

495
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,600
One.

496
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,100
Two.

497
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,800
One.

498
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,600
Two.

499
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,600
Who allows you to stop?

500
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,000
- Sir, it's raining. 
 - I know.

501
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,100
Can we take a break?

502
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
We can continue when the rain stops.

503
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,700
- Do you want to be the coach? 
 - I...

504
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,900
If anyone doesn't want to train in the rain, you can stop and leave.

505
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,800
Everyone, lift the log.

506
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,700
One.

507
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Two.

508
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,600
One.

509
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,000
Two.

510
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,200
One.

511
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,200
Sir!

512
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,700
Medical Rescue.

513
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,500
Are you okay?

514
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,700
Go on.

515
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
One.

516
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
Two.

517
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,900
One.

518
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,800
Training so hard on a rainy day.

519
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Prepare more hot water and medicine for our members.

520
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,400
Two.

521
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,100
Okay.

522
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,100
One.

523
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,100
Drink it and get some rest.

524
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,000
Thanks.

525
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,000
- Be careful. 
 - Watch out.

526
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
Not a big deal. It is physical incompetence.

527
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,700
- Zhou. Glucose. 
 - Okay.

528
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,200
This is a civil society organization or a hunter school?

529
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,500
If we train like this, we...

530
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,300
From the start till now, a lot of members are experiencing physical exhaustion

531
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,500
fainting or getting a fever.

532
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,900
About training intensity, have you evaluated the suitability of training for beginners?

533
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,400
This training system, we've practiced for 10 years.

534
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
There is no problem.

535
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
A lot of members have problems with their physical condition!

536
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,800
It never happens in our international rescue training.

537
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,400
The phenomenon has shown us how serious it is.

538
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,600
All members of International Rescue are professional.

539
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,700
Before training, they had good foundation and training skills.

540
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,300
But we're a civil organization, our members aren't professional.

541
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,400
There is no comparison between us.

542
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,200
Then they should be trained step by step.

543
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,600
Since you've asked me to be the medical instructor for this beginner training class,

544
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,200
now, I officially suggest that it's excessive training.

545
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,600
Stop training now.

546
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,400
Only with intensive and hard training,

547
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,400
when you take a task, then you can handle it.

548
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,800
Okay. I respect your suggestion.

549
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,200
But as for stopping the training, I need to talk and evaluate with my team.

550
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,000
So you won't stop this training.

551
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
Okay.

552
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,000
As I'm in this position,

553
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,400
I should take responsibility,

554
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,200
I also have the right.

555
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,000
I'll stop it.

556
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
Others go on.

557
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Two.

558
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Everyone, put down.

559
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,000
What are you doing?

560
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,400
Why stop?

561
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,000
I asked everyone to stop.

562
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,600
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

563
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,600
You've seen that several members had to stop training

564
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,500
because of a physical overexertion.

565
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,800
I usually love to participate in outdoor sports,

566
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,200
I think my physical fitness is pretty good.

567
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,500
But even I now feel that I am about to reach the limits of my body.

568
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,630
You let us push the limits of our bodies.

569
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Do you regard us as human beings?

570
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,000
How many people can hold on?

571
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,200
We are all volunteers.

572
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,800
Not soldiers in the army.

573
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,100
You trained us as soldiers in the army; this arrangement is unreasonable.

574
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,400
What do you know?

575
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,800
Yeah, I don't know much about rescue.

576
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,200
Listen to me. You guys have no common sense.

577
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,700
If you keep it like this, not to mention rescue, you won't be able to do anything.

578
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,400
What did you say? Dare you say it again?

579
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,000
I said you have no common sense.

580
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Before we stop the training,

581
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,300
I'd like to ask you.

582
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
What kind of team is Light Chaser?

583
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,500
- A non-profit civil rescue team. 
 - A non-profit civil rescue team.

584
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,900
That's right.

585
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,300
We're not official.

586
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,800
Therefore, we often face various doubts.

587
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,400
They doubt whether we can save people like a professional rescue team.

588
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Many people think that we're not professional.

589
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,300
But I want to tell you! Maybe our team is not official

590
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,700
but we're professional.

591
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,400
How can we break others' prejudice?

592
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,700
We depend on our rescue abilities.

593
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,300
How can we improve our ability?

594
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,400
It depends on lots of training, just like this.

595
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,500
In rescue sites, what we face are people's lives.

596
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,400
We can't have any mistakes.

597
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:07,800
In our tasks, we have to confront earthquakes, floods, and mudslides.

598
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,400
If you don't have good fitness,

599
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
how can you fight against these disasters and dangers?

600
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,400
Even for an easy search task, sometimes it takes three or four days.

601
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,800
Without good fitness, can you keep on doing it?

602
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,400
Of course.

603
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,100
With this intensity of training, some people can't do it. I understand.

604
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,600
So I will give you one last chance.

605
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,800
You can think about it.

606
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,600
Are you ready for joining the rescue team?

607
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,300
Are you ready to try your best to save others from different types of dangers?

608
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,600
Are you ready for saving others with your life?

609
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,200
If you can't continue, we also welcome you to stay here,

610
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,100
to participate in logistical support work.

611
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,700
That's also a kind of contribution.

612
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,200
But if you want to become a professional rescue member, you must go on your training.

613
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,600
Luo Ben!

614
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,800
Are you the leader of Fangqin Group Rescue?

615
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,400
If you think your team should be treated specially,

616
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,500
this training is just a game or is a team-building activity,

617
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,000
you can tell the captain to apply for a rest.

618
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,700
No.

619
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Can everyone continue?

620
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,400
 Yes!

621
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,800
Okay.

622
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,900
Go on!

623
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,900
Lift the log.

624
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:27,590
 One. Two.

625
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:34,590
 One. Two.

626
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:41,500
 One. Two.

627
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:44,000
That's my reason and explanation.

628
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:07,900
 One. Two.

629
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:25,000

630
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,500
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

631
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,700
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

632
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:50,700
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

633
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,800
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

634
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,400
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

635
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:13,700
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

636
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:20,700
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

637
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:28,200
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

638
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:37,000
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

639
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,300
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

640
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:52,000
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

641
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,600
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

642
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,400
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

643
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,100
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

644
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,900
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

645
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,600
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

646
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,300
♫  I can't fly  ♫

647
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,100
♫  But I can look up  ♫

648
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:29,300
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
