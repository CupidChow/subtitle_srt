00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,970

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,150
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,450
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,720
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,270
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,370
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,520
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,470
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:02,070
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,770
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,270
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,980

20
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,430
What have you been up to these days?

21
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,580
I signed up for the training program of a non-profit rescue team.

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,140
Doing public welfare is a good thing.

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,780
I'm in favor of it and I feel happy for you.

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,940
But there are so many public welfare projects.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,120
Why did you have to choose such a dangerous thing to do?

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,610
Have you ever thought about it?

27
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,200
Should there be any danger, what would you do?

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,530
Mom, the rescue team places special stress on safety, and only by keeping ourselves safe...

29
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,400
I know what kind of programs your rescue team has been working on.

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,200
When you're in those dangerous places, you don't get to choose life or death.

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,840
No matter what others do, I don't agree with this.

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Mom!

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,050
You can't make such an arbitrary judgment.

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,050
I'm your mother. Everything I do is for your own good.

35
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,100
Ever since I was little, you've arranged everything for me and justified all of your actions.

36
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,230
Whether it was the school I attended, the major I chose, or the kind of people I made friends with,

37
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,680
I always listened to you.

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,610
But this time, I want to make my own decision.

39
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,260
- You want to make your own decision? 
 - Yeah.

40
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,610
Then try to manage the company well.

41
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,010
Mom, do you have to do this to me?

42
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,260
You just got spoiled by me.

43
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,360
It's time for you to learn something.

44
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,170
Up a little bit. Right here.

45
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,730
The rain is on and off all the time.

46
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,450
What if our son gets caught in the rain while delivering packages?

47
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,820
It's fine. Don't worry too much.

48
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,640
He's grown up. He knows what to do.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,300
He'll be fine.

50
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,600
Our son is home.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm home, Dad.

52
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,890
Look! I'm making pot stickers. They'll soon be ready.

53
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,960
Mom, I just had lunch outside.

54
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,130
- Well, I'll save them for tomorrow. 
 - Okay.

55
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,780
Eat some fruit.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,610
 You want to work overtime?

57
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,100
You're watching such a popular drama.

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,450
Your sister called yesterday and recommended it.

59
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,300
She's been watching it, too.

60
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,020
You know what? It's kind of fun.

61
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,480
Fei, you don't get to have regular meals making all the deliveries.

62
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,700
It's bad for your stomach.

63
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm fine, Mom. You know how strong I am.

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,490
What's more, the more I work, the more I earn.

65
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,480
I have to make money to honor you.

66
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,420
That's good.

67
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,440
We'll be honored as long as you get a girlfriend.

68
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,720
He's always busy with work.

69
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,140
There's no time for him to go out with anyone.

70
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,070
You said it isn't easy to get a job now.

71
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,650
Without a job, it'll be harder for him to find a girlfriend.

72
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,770
I didn't mean he doesn't have a job. I said he was busy.

73
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,480
Don't I know my son?

74
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,350
With his looks and condition, a lot of girls want to date him.

75
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,350
Your son, your son. Isn't he my son?

76
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,710

77
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,620
The jobs we offer are not very demanding,

78
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,940
but about your history...

79
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,920
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,900
It's fine. Thank you for your time.

81
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,310
- Am I next? 
 - Yes.

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,770
 Look more carefully next time.

83
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,120
 Why did you allow him to come?

84
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,500
 It's just a waste of time.

85
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,260
 Who'd hire an ex-con?

86
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,770
 Next one.

87
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,480
Did you see Dr. Cai?

88
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,210
- No. 
 - No.

89
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,450
Did any of you see Dr. Cai?

90
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,700
- No. 
 - I saw him check in this morning. What is it?

91
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,410
He has an operation at 10:00 a.m.

92
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,040
Why does he still have an operation?

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,530
Both of his hands are hurt.

94
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,260
The appointment was made last week.

95
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,700
He's not answering his phone.

96
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,740
The patient is already preparing for surgery.

97
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,840
I'm afraid it'll be delayed.

98
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,820
I'll do it.

99
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,290
Zhan Yan, you're still recovering.

100
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,530
It's fine.

101
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,500
- How many surgeries do we have? 
 - Three.

102
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,850
Leave them to me. Let him take a break.

103
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,350
- Go get prepared. 
 - Okay.

104
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,650
Sir.

105
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,660
 Yuxiao, come to my office when you have time.

106
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,400
Okay.

107
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,180

108
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,170
You're backing off just because of such a minor setback?

109
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,280
All the time, I've been proud of what I do.

110
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,290
Because saving lives is a doctor's duty.

111
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
But...

112
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,450
I just realized this time...

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,360
that I'm such a selfish person.

114
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,430
I...

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,040
I don't deserve to be a doctor.

116
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,450
For the choice someone makes at the moment of life and death,

117
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,480
you can respect his nobility,

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,020
but you can't accuse him of selfishness.

119
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,360
We all have the urge to survive.

120
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,870
It isn't wrong to subconsciously protect your own life.

121
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:11,430
Our country pays a great price to train a doctor.

122
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,510
You're a doctor.

123
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,950
Only in the hospital can you do your best and save more lives.

124
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,240
But now you're just going to walk away like this?

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,040
Sir.

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,290
I don't have the courage to stay.

127
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,330
When you were admitted to college,

128
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,840
your family couldn't afford that,

129
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,850
so you came to my office and told me you wanted to finish your studies.

130
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,530
Think about it.

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,820
What happened to your persistence and courage at the beginning?

132
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,620

133
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,260

134
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,770
It's my surgery.

135
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,120
I can handle it from here.

136
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,790
Let's continue.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,280

138
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,870
What a crappy company.

139
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,990
It's going to be shut down.

140
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,460
Hello.

141
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,890
May I ask has Zhou Mingming come to work?

142
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,120
Not yet.

143
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,810
Loafing around. He'll be fired one day.

144
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,560
What's it that you have to call me this early?

145
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,120
What?

146
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,230
Are you new here?

147
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,240
I haven't seen you before.

148
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,400
I've been here a few times.

149
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,960
It's also the first time I've seen you.

150
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,700
You've got a good temperament. Do you also work here?

151
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,200
Which department are you in?

152
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,620
I... Comic Department, I guess.

153
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,360
Comic Department?

154
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,340
Why didn't I know about this department?

155
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,450
Who's the one in charge?

156
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,730
Don't get me started.

157
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,120
I don't even know his full name,

158
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,990
only that he's called Director Ming.

159
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,600
He's extremely unreliable.

160
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,430
I've been here a few times but I never ran into him.

161
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,460
You may not know.

162
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,660
Director Ming is the president's son.

163
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,380
I'm aware of this.

164
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,020
With what he's got, there's no way he could be a director.

165
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,040
I shouldn't go to Director Ming.

166
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,540
I should go straight to the president.

167
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,550
Why do you want to see the president?

168
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,070
To lodge some complaints, of course.

169
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,950
You see, even if he is the son of the president,

170
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,040
he's clearly not up to the job.

171
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,620
He just doesn't have that ability.

172
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,320
How could he become a director and ruin my comic career?

173
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,220
Auntie, have you seen the president?

174
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,820
I have.

175
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,190
Could you spill the beans?

176
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,670
What kind of person is the president?

177
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,810
Is it a stuffy old lady,

178
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,480
or... or a sloppy old man?

179
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,920
Am I right?

180
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,930
Your coffee is ready.

181
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,100
I'll make you a cup.

182
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,760
No need.

183
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,210
Auntie.

184
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:52,460
- What did you do? 
 - I'll help... Calm down! Calm down!

185
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,820
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

186
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,140
You come to see me in my office.

187
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,790
You...

188
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,120
You're so screwed.

189
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,900
Could she be the president?

190
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:32,410
Mingming, we've got a variety of business sectors, yet you had to choose to do comics.

191
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,240
Good then. Let's take it as a new business you just developed,

192
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,330
tell me what do you plan to do next?

193
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,930
Mom, actually, this comic is going viral online.

194
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,940
How? Have you done any market research?

195
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,960
Have you made a project and a development plan?

196
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,050
How will it make a profit? How will the business grow? What's its potential?

197
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,550
President, Mingming just bought the copyright

198
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,740
and the other work is underway.

199
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,840
Don't try to defend him.

200
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,670
Okay.

201
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,370
Since Mingming is interested in comics, I'll give you a chance.

202
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,740
The company will set up a comic department and you'll be in charge.

203
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,560
But I have to set a goal for the performance of this department.

204
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,750
Aren't you going to take some notes?

205
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,210
Do I need to do that? Mom, just tell me. I'll remember it.

206
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,710
Okay.

207
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,040
Within a month, the hits, popularity,

208
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,280
and trending searches will come out on top among other IPs of the same period.

209
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:41,330
Within three months, become the top ten in the ranking.

210
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,700
Within six months, the serialization will be finished and offprints will be published.

211
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,870
Besides, by the end of the year, incubate the IP comprehensively.

212
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:52,800
So? Do you get it?

213
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,980
Mom, are you really turning the comics into an IP?

214
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,110
If you don't achieve this goal, and no results are produced,

215
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,050
all the money invested in the Comic Department will be deducted from your annual salary.

216
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,490
That's all.

217
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,220
Well... Well...

218
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,280
We've never done this, and have no experience with it.

219
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,830
You know what your mom is like.

220
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,280
Every department must follow through on her request.

221
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,910
But look at those goals.

222
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,040
It's impossible to achieve them.

223
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,370
You're looking down on me?

224
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,800
No.

225
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,070
What your mom wants is for you to admit your mistake,

226
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,380
and this whole thing will stop.

227
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,360
Just quit this.

228
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,420
I just like to take on challenges.

229
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,830
It's a new business sector, and it gets me motivated even more.

230
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,870
Set up the Comic Department officially. It's a deal.

231
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,150

232
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,320

233
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,500
Yuan, keep packing.

234
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,140
I need to go out.

235
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,940
You'll soon be discharged.

236
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,750
Where are you going?

237
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,310
I... I just feel a pain in my back.

238
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,920
I'll get the doctor to check it.

239
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,830
I'm fine. I'm fine.

240
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,360
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

241
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,100
I read your medical records.

242
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,050
You should be feeling fine by now.

243
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,330
So Dr. Zhan has been secretly paying attention to my injuries.

244
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,510
Yeah.

245
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,320
It hurts.

246
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,330
Does it always hurt like this?

247
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,550
No, just now.

248
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,720
Let me disinfect the wound for you again.

249
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,180
It's not healed anyway.

250
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,060
It's going to hurt a little bit, so just bear with it.

251
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,570
It doesn't hurt anymore.

252
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:00,510
After you leave the hospital, have a light diet.

253
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,860
Don't soak the wound in the water. And come to change your dressing regularly.

254
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,220
Okay.

255
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,610
Dr. Zhan, are you coming to my place this weekend?

256
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,260
Why?

257
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,420
We made a deal.

258
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,620
If we can come out alive, you'd come to my place

259
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,970
and taste my cooking.

260
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,730
All right.

261
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,460
6:00 p.m.

262
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,030
- Are you going out? 
 - I'm looking for you.

263
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,000
I think I should have listened to you.

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,660
They only know how to ruin my work.

265
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,380
It's like their humanity has been ripped.

266
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,580
Help me think. Is there any way to cancel the contract?

267
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,200
The terms of termination are clearly written in the contract.

268
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,500
Just pay the penalty.

269
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,870
I don't have that much money right now.

270
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,120
Or I wouldn't have turned to you.

271
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,050
If Sister Yan knows about it,

272
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,960
she'll definitely nag me and blame me for being impulsive.

273
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,730
You haven't told Yan about this?

274
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,410
I don't dare to.

275
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,380
Classmate Ding Dingding,

276
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,760
normally, you need to pay if you seek my consultation.

277
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,740
But considering our relationship,

278
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,090
you can pay me in another way.

279
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,090
You can't be serious, Mr. Luo.

280
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,460
You just showed your affection to Sister Yan,

281
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,160
and now you're coming after me. This isn't appropriate.

282
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,380
You surely are a comic artist,

283
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,600
seeing how rich your imagination is.

284
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,840
Fill out this form.

285
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,050
Questionnaire on Zhan Yan's hobbies?

286
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,060
History of allergies. Favorite...

287
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,820
How about this?

288
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,430
One answer in exchange for one contract.

289
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,040
Do you even have so many contracts?

290
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,270
I may have many in the future.

291
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,180
Okay.

292
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,540
Deal.

293
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,380
Favorite fruit.

294
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,060
Durian.

295
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,920
Favorite flower: Daisy.

296
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,800
Are you done? Let me see.

297
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Not yet.

298
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,020
You're trying so hard to pursue Sister Yan.

299
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,980
Maybe we will become a family.

300
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,560
Do you need to be so calculative? Aren't you ashamed?

301
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,460
Take back the word "maybe" and I'll go easy on you.

302
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,620
Forget it, I'd better be on my own.

303
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,150
Have you finished?

304
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,560
Hang on.

305
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,770
Finished?

306
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,650
Yeah, yeah.

307
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,130
I still need to rely on myself.

308
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,790
Favorite fruit: Durian.

309
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,400
 Starting tomorrow, check in at the company at 10:00 a.m. every day.

310
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,260
What are all these quirky hobbies?

311
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,370
What's wrong with these people?

312
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,770
Does a creator need to check in?

313
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,700
Time for you to fulfill your promise. Think of an idea for me.

314
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,100
I warned you before and told you to recheck the way you work,

315
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,290
but you didn't listen.

316
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,220
Now the contract has been signed,

317
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,130
and you also took the money. What else can we do?

318
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:36,130
So I suggest you go to the company every day and check in.

319
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,670
That's your conclusion?

320
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,550
You asked me to read your contract, and I did it in a very serious way.

321
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,730
Is there a problem?

322
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,300
I don't think this deal is worth it. Give it back to me.

323
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,950
I allow no refund on things sold.

324
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,360
- I'm going to tell Sister Yan. 
 -  I dare you.

325
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,490
- I'll definitely tell her. 
 - Just try it.

326
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,260
Yuan Yuan, you're practicing?

327
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:16,800
Go on.

328
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:24,920
Practice hard.

329
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,420
Yuan Yuan,

330
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,300
do you want to go shopping and buy some new clothes?

331
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,120
Yuan Yuan,

332
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,280
we ran out of tissues. Could you go buy some?

333
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,670
Yuan Yuan.

334
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,580
This is the weekend.

335
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,880
Don't stay at home all the time.

336
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,810
Why don't you hang out with your friends?

337
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,670
You like that lobster pasta, right?

338
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:47,420
I'll transfer you the money and you can treat everyone to it.

339
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,990
See?

340
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,480

341
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,180
 Ben, are you expecting someone?

342
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,240
How do you know?

343
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,510
 Just tell me if you want to send me out.

344
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,640
Leave quickly since you took the money. Go.

345
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,510
 Show your sincerity earlier next time.

346
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:31,060
 Good luck.

347
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,900
Just go.

348
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,410
Naughty.

349
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,000
 Are you busy?

350
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,990
 Do you have time for dinner tonight?

351
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,830

352
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,550
Miss, you're here to see Xiong Fei again?

353
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,150
He left. He doesn't work here anymore.

354
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,270
Didn't he tell you?

355
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,230
Ms. Luo.

356
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,920
Waiting for Xiong Fei?

357
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,950
Have you made an appointment?

358
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,890
Then, what if he doesn't show up?

359
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,800
This brat.

360
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,690
Xiong Fei, I want you on the team right now.

361
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,410
I've got something urgent.

362
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:15,610
All right, see you.

363
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,130
These need to be polished constantly,  or they will age.

364
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,700
Thank you.

365
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,610
Brother! Brother.

366
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,360
Here you are.

367
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,950
This is...

368
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,960
I made this...

369
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,430
You made this for Ms. Luo?

370
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,210
Ms. Luo, look.

371
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,700
The wontons Xiong Fei made are the best.

372
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,740
You don't get to eat them elsewhere.

373
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,820
Well. C-Can I have one box?

374
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,460
Okay, okay.

375
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,140
 Why didn't you text me back?

376
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:54,530
I was busy with work.

377
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,920
 A new job?

378
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,880
 I know about everything.

379
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:19,270
Ms. Luo, I know you're busy, too.

380
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,920
Don't come here again.

381
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,740
 You don't like me here?

382
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,060
No.

383
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,830
I didn't mean it. How would I not like you?

384
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,230
 Then, why are you avoiding me?

385
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,290
Why do you want to be friends with someone like me?

386
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,720
 You don't want to be friends with me.

387
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,150
 So when my brother had the accident, why were you keeping me company?

388
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,960
 And now you're ignoring me.

389
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,130
 How could you do this to me?

390
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,480
 Is that something a friend would do?

391
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,480
 Do you think it's cool?

392
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,140
 I care for you.

393
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,360
 Don't you value me as a friend at all?

394
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,670
I...

395
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,580
No, you...

396
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,600
Don't get mad.

397
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,750
I was wrong, all right?

398
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,290
I...

399
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,230
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

400
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,160
I'll be the one who texts you.

401
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,640
Try the wontons I made.

402
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,880
Tastes good?

403
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,020
 Don't you want to open a restaurant?

404
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,640
Open a restaurant?

405
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,120
 Yeah.

406
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,830
You and your sister have kept your place clean and tidy.

407
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,340
I don't usually let Luo Yuan do housework.

408
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,890
She's a girl, you know.

409
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,990
Of course, I need to spoil her.

410
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,630
An able man does more work.

411
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,820
You do achieve an ideal balance between your work and private life.

412
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:20,750
There are not many men like me who have a successful career and are good at housework.

413
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,350
Attorney Luo, are you promoting yourself?

414
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,620
If I have intentions to persuade a client, of course I should promote myself.

415
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,220
What about you?

416
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,090
Do you have the intentions?

417
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,670
Let's look at the dishes.

418
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,770
Sit, please.

419
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,180
How are they?

420
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,770
Looks great.

421
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,950
They are just appetizers.

422
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,090
Here's the main course.

423
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,260
I reckon this must be your specialty.

424
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,830
Open it.

425
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,130
Zhan Yan,

426
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,540
when I knew you were trapped,

427
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,170
I was really afraid of losing you.

428
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:45,130
I regret that I didn't take my feelings seriously earlier.

429
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,400
But I'm grateful that fate has given me another chance,

430
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,690
and left me with an incredible memory.

431
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,500
Zhan Yan.

432
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,940
I like you.

433
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,170
And you?

434
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,200
I haven't really thought about this.

435
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,730
Let's eat first.

436
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,060
There's no rush.

437
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,760
You can take your time.

438
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,670
How is it?

439
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,000
Is it tasty?

440
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,180
Quite tasty.

441
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,340
What do you mean "quite tasty"?

442
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,810
Don't try to fence with me.

443
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,500
Let me try it.

444
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,380
How tasty it is?

445
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,190
You should have commented like this.

446
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:11,210
It's rich in flavor,

447
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,460
tastes salty and fresh,

448
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,130
and has an aftertaste that lingers.

449
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,300
I need to use the bathroom.

450
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,450
- Hello. 
 - Seven?

451
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,470
This is mine.

452
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,250
- Thank you. 
 - Be careful, it's hot.

453
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,750
Thanks.

454
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,610
You want me to learn first?

455
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,940
Come on, have a taste.

456
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,660
That's thoughtful of you. Thank you.

457
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:33,930
All right, all served.

458
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,370
Here. Be careful.

459
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,670
And this is yours. Enjoy.

460
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,090
Thanks.

461
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,090
Morning.

462
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,410
Mr. Ming, you're so early.

463
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,780
Morning.

464
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,350
 Ling Yiqin, good morning.

465
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,790
Ding... Ding...

466
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,270
Mr. Ming.

467
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,320

468
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,090
Ding Dingding.

469
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,190
You scared me. I thought you were the boss.

470
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,610
What time is it? Why are you so late?

471
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,080
I overslept. That's obvious.

472
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
Did the boss come?

473
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,760
He did, and he has waited two hours for you.

474
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,020
You should be ashamed of yourself.

475
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,150
Why would he wait for me?

476
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,160
You're late on your first day. Your wages will be docked.

477
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,190
I'm only a little late.

478
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:23,370
How many wages will be ducked?

479
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,060
I don't remember seeing this before.

480
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,020
The company had it installed just for you.

481
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,430
 Ding Dingding, you've been working hard.

482
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,120
Your boss thinks too highly of me.

483
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,350
It's already11.06 a.m. Ding Dinggding.

484
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:42,090
According to your wages, ten yuan will be ducked for arriving one minute late,

485
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,080
so it'll be 660 yuan, because you're 66 minutes late.

486
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,780
Come on. I'm only a little late. That's too much.

487
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,460
Late employees will affect the company's luck.

488
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,420
So I'll make it 666. That's really outrageous.

489
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,050
You're as sick as him.

490
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,750
Wait.

491
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,450
How do you know my wages?

492
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:03,860
Because I'm in charge here.

493
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,250
Will you stop it?

494
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,360
I actually thought my wages would be ducked. I was worried there for a second.

495
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,070
It's true.

496
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,480
You didn't get enough sleep, did you?

497
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,540
It's all because of you.

498
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,600
All right, just go. I'm busy here. Don't annoy me.

499
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,750
Work hard and be quick.

500
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,340
I know.

501
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,960
Sorry, Secretary Li.

502
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,200
I worked late last night, so I got up late.

503
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,380
Get prepared. We're going to have a meeting soon.

504
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,520
A meeting?

505
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,870
Who said that?

506
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,510
Director Ming.

507
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,930
Good.

508
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,470
I can finally meet him.

509
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,120
Secretary Li, don't we have a meeting?

510
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,250
Why are just the two of us here?

511
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,730
Secretary Li?

512
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,020
Come on. This is not where you can sit.

513
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,480
This is the boss's seat.

514
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,060
Mr. Ming, everyone's here. Shall we start the meeting?

515
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,650
Yes.

516
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,990
Mr. Ming?

517
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,000
So you're the boss?

518
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,110
And your mom's the president?

519
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,850
Let's begin the meeting. Don't waste any time.

520
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,880
That explains, Zhou Mingming.

521
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,340
So you're the one behind all this.

522
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,960
Ms. Ding, we're having a working partnership.

523
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,560
It doesn't matter who's behind this.

524
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,790
Don't put on airs in front of me.

525
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,420
True. I've offended you before.

526
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,710
It's fine that you want to prank me.

527
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,180
But do you have to go through all the trouble?

528
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,880
The fact is I see the talent in you.

529
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,900
Very funny. If you have to do this, then you're going to have to do it without me.

530
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,870
Ms. Ding, when you get back, remember to pay the penalty.

531
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,060
What penalty?

532
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,400
Read it to her.

533
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,330
If Party B unilaterally terminates the contract due to personal reasons,

534
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,270
Party B shall return the deposit paid by the company

535
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,020
and pay three times the amount.

536
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,770
Aren't we having a meeting? Go ahead. Don't waste any time.

537
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:16,050

538
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,430
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

539
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:32,380
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

540
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:40,350
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

541
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,730
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

542
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:55,700
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

543
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:03,530
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

544
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:10,400
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

545
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:18,200
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

546
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:27,030
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

547
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:33,280
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

548
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:41,980
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

549
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:49,580
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

550
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,400
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

551
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,230
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

552
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:00,780
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

553
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,450
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

554
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,280
♫  I can't fly  ♫

555
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,130
♫  But I can look up  ♫

556
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:19,480
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
