00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,950

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,200
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,800
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,500
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:35,400
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,200
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,700
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,900

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,700
Say whatever you want to say.

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,100
 Ding Dingding.

22
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
How much did Mingmei give you?

23
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,900
I'll pay double.

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,200
How much?

25
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
Ding Dingding.

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Good to see you again.

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
I never dreamed of that even in a nightmare.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,300
You're still so straightforward.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,500
All right!

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Since you are so straightforward, I'll just cut to the chase.

31
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,900
I know you came out of Mingmei.

32
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm going to double the price

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,700
and buy out the copyright of Light Chaser Rescue Comics.

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
A good horse never turns round to graze on an old pasture.

35
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
You forced me to jump.

36
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
I haven't forgotten that.

37
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,700
In fact, you planned and played the incident yourself.

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,100
It's none of my business.

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,900
Besides, later I gave you 100,000 yuan.

40
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,400
You forgot that?

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,400
Okay.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,300
It's over. Let's not mention it.

43
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's cast aside past grievances,

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,900
and start a new journey together.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Mr. Ma, you'd better let me go.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your journey, I can't afford to accompany you.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,200
I know you still hold a grudge about what happened before.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,600
Well, this time, if you have any requirement, just say it.

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,800
I can ask Mr. Luo to write it in black and white in the contract.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,500
Mr. Luo is your friend.

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,600
You should believe him.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,000
Right. I, Ma Baoming, solemnly promise.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,800
As long as you sign a contract with our company,

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,300
the company will not disturb your creation.

55
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,500
And we'll spend a lot of money making you a great comic book artist as good as KK.

56
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,200
How about that?

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600
Mr. Ma, here's the thing.

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,900
Now, I've gotten offers from many companies.

59
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,100
Well, let me go back and think it over.

60
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,900
I'll talk to you when I make up my mind. Okay?

61
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,700
KK is your idol.

62
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
You should cherish this opportunity.

63
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
No, former idol.

64
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,200
Now I, Ding Dingding, don't like anyone.

65
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,500
Bye.

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,600
Ding Dingding!

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
Nice!

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
You...

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,300
Zhan Yan.

70
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
Zhan Yan, come out.

71
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,700
How did my mother die?

72
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,000
Tell me clearly.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Zhan Yan! Come out, Zhan Yan.

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,700
Hello, Zhan Yan.

75
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,900
 - That Zhao Donglei is making trouble here again.  
 - Don't disturb the order.

76
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,000
The hospital? So what?

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,200
- Don't touch me. 
 - Get out. Get out.

78
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,100
- Let me go. 
 - Get out.

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,500
Do you hear me? Touch me again?

80
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,300
- Get out. 
 - Touch me again? Let me go.

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,000
- What are you doing? 
 - Go away.

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
You come just in time.

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,000
Come on. Everybody come and have a look.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,600
While my mother was unconscious, you made a false will for her.

85
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,100
How will you pay for that?

86
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,600
What makes you think the will is false?

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,400
When making the will, Ms. Qin was conscious.

88
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,000
There is a video to prove it.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,700
And you, when your mother was in the hospital, you never visited her once.

90
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,700
When she got into the ICU, in the name of visiting, you sneaked in

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,200
and took her hand forcibly to press her fingerprint on the will.

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400
I'm not wrong about it, am I?

93
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,100
 - What a son! 
 - Too bad.

94
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
 He has to be punished.

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,800
If you don't leave now, I'll call the police right away.

96
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,000
 What kind of manners?

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,600
 Why are you leaving?

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
 Don't go.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,300
 Why are you leaving? Come back.

100
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,300
 Light Chaser Rescue Team.

101
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,400
 Zhan Qingshan. Zhan Yan.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,100
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,600

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Where are you?

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
 I'll be right there.

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,200
Zhan Yan.

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,500
- What are you doing? 
 - You colluded with that lawyer to change the will

108
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,100
just to take my mom's money for your dad's rescue team.

109
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,600
I'm not going to make it easy for you.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Zhao Donglei.

111
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
What are you up to?

112
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,400
Luo Ben, it's you again.

113
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,600
You are everywhere.

114
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Don't mess around, Zhao Donglei.

115
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,200
I'll kill you both today.

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,900
I warn you. Don't mess around.

117
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,600
- Don't move. 
 - What are you doing?

118
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,800
- Catch him. 
 - Don't catch me.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
- Let me go. 
 - Go.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
 You two. I won't let you go.

121
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,200
 Remember!

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,200
Are you all right?

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,100
It's all right.

124
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,000

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Everyone knows it.

126
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,000
At the gate of the hospital last night,

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,100
the patient's relative tried to hurt a doctor with a knife.

128
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,500
Fortunately, Dr. Zhan Yan was fine.

129
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,800
However, it sounded the alarm for us.

130
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
Our hospital's security will be strengthened in the future.

131
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,700
Everyone needs to pay attention to your own safety.

132
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,100
Director, I want to say something.

133
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,000
As far as I know,

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,800
it's because Dr. Zhan helped the patient in the ICU to make a will.

135
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,000
It caused the patient's relative to become extremely agitated.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,800
And then he sought revenge on Dr. Zhan.

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,100
About that, I still hope the hospital can set a rule.

138
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:45,500
So that the other doctors know if similar things happen in the future,

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,200
how to deal with it.

140
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
Right.

141
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,900
I think the duty of doctors is to cure diseases.

142
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,000
How could we get involved in the patient's private affairs?

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,900
As you say, the patient's last will before dying,

144
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,300
we should be indifferent to that?

145
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,000
Then you shouldn't deal with it without authorization.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,200
Your lawyer friend is your boyfriend, right?

147
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,500
You can't use this special relationship to make a will for the patient.

148
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,400
Definitely, the patient's relative will doubt you.

149
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,200
I did everything righteously.

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,300
There's a video recording.

151
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,900
- Xu Zirui was also present. 
 - Right.

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,600
Well, Zhan Yan,

153
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,700
we all believe you have no selfishness.

154
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,600
I also admire your spirit of selfless help.

155
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
But you have to know the position of the hospital.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,800
I already reminded you.

157
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,900
As doctors, except for curing diseases and saving lives,

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,000
we shouldn't get too close to the patient.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,100
If all the doctors follow your example, how will you manage the hospital in the future?

160
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,400
You have to consider the safety of all the doctors.

161
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Anyone else want to say something?

162
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,300
Let me say something.

163
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,400
The patient left the hospital without permission.

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Attending Doctor Zhan Yan took primary responsibility.

165
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,000
When the patient came back,

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Zhan Yan got involved in the patient's family affairs.

167
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,600
It aroused strong dissatisfaction from the family and he continued to make trouble in the hospital.

168
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,400
There was even a vicious incident of stabbing someone with a knife.

169
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
It seriously disturbed the normal work of the hospital.

170
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:38,300
Zhan Yan, starting tomorrow, you're on suspension pending the results of the hospital's investigation.

171
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Adjourned.

172
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,300
Don't take it too personally.

173
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,700
Just give yourself a vacation.

174
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,000
Take a break.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,300
I'm fine. Don't comfort me.

176
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,400
Zhan Yan!

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm just suspended. I'm not being fired.

178
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,400
Don't be like that.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Dr. Cai is going too far.

180
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
In front of so many people, he embarrassed you.

181
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,700
He's just doing business. Don't blame him.

182
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,400
He is turning from love to hate.

183
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
- He took the opportunity to get revenge. 
 - Ruoxi.

184
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,340
Let me go.

185
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:26,379
I hope this incident can be over as soon as possible.

186
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,259
Come back early.

187
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,380
 When do you get off work today?

188
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,700
 I have to finish the operation.

189
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,980
 - What about you? 
 - I have to work overtime.

190
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,839
 Okay, then I'll call you after the operation.

191
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,500
 All right.

192
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,759
What would you like to eat tonight?

193
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,559
I'm not eating.

194
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,219
What's up?

195
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,580
I'm suspended.

196
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,979
You're right.

197
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,860
Now the whole hospital knows I interfered with the patient's family affairs.

198
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,379
But it's also my fault.

199
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:11,200
I took an improper method.

200
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,539
Actually, I think it's not bad.

201
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:19,800
If you were not suspended, how would you be willing to have a good meal?

202
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,899
Let's go. Let's have a big meal!

203
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,999
Pleasant cooperation.

204
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,139
What?

205
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,060
Just look at it.

206
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,220
It's so beautiful.

207
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,200
Good for you.

208
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,040
What about it, Mr. Ma? I think I'm sincere.

209
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,880
Great.

210
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,259
This cave theme, we can make a limited edition and promote it at the Reader Meeting.

211
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,619
- Reader Meeting? 
 - Right.

212
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:09,559
We're going to arrange a Reader Meeting to make an offline promotion of Light Chaser Rescue Comics.

213
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,099
This is your first public appearance.

214
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:15,239
It will definitely promote the sale of new books.

215
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,359
Then I will be popular.

216
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,160
Of course.

217
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:24,619
After this meeting, you will become an eye-catching star in the comic book industry.

218
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,519
Everyone who likes your work will be there to see your style.

219
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:30,880
How about that?

220
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Isn't it exciting?

221
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:38,179
Mr. Ma, pleasant cooperation.

222
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:39,980
That's right!

223
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,999
 Look at the forum.

224
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,920

225
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,399
Ding Dingding, you're going to meet the readers.

226
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,819
Come or not?

227
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:09,810
 Sure, I'm coming.

228
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,950
I cultivated you myself. I wouldn't miss it.

229
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:15,280
You're funny. What do you mean by cultivating me yourself?

230
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,440
If I hadn't forced you to change Zhou Mengmeng's image, could you be so popular now?

231
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,099
Mingming.

232
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:24,460
Okay, that's it. I have something to do.

233
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,840
Then see you at 9:00 a.m. next Tuesday morning.

234
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,259
 Bye.

235
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,440
By the way, that Customer Appreciation Meeting, how is the arrangement?

236
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,200
All arranged. It's on next Tuesday.

237
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,699
Okay.

238
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,559
Next Tuesday?

239
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,740

240
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,599
Have a seat.

241
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:00,820
I heard that there have been some rumors in the office recently.

242
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:03,520
It is also affecting everyone's enthusiasm.

243
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,720
It's great that you know it.

244
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,120
Come back quickly to help me stabilize the group.

245
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,060
If it goes on like this, I can't maintain this law firm anymore.

246
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,880
I can only find a place to enjoy retirement.

247
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,719
It's not that serious.

248
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,200
Okay. Everyone has been working hard recently.

249
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,599
Let's have dinner in the evening. I'll treat you.

250
00:15:26,599 --> 00:15:29,299
That's right. We'll be merciless to your wallet.

251
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,020
Okay.

252
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,660
I forgot to tell you one thing.

253
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,880
What?

254
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,940
Tonight, there are others having dinner with us.

255
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,700
Who?

256
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:00,060
My collea... gues.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Colleagues?

258
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,519
All colleagues of the law firm.

259
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,660
Are you going to sell me? Why didn't you tell me earlier?

260
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,939
What?

261
00:16:12,939 --> 00:16:16,440
I'm bringing my girlfriend to meet my colleagues. Do I need to report?

262
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,199
All right. I'll tell you the truth.

263
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,380
I'm bringing you to assist me.

264
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,499
I've been busy lately training and rescuing.

265
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:33,339
I'm alienated from my colleagues.

266
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,220
I just want to find a reason to make amends.

267
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,719
I think if I take you, the atmosphere will be very active.

268
00:16:40,719 --> 00:16:43,639
- You have such confidence in me?  
 - Of course.

269
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,800
Beautiful enough.

270
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,779
Watch the way.

271
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,119
You're back.

272
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,939
- Auntie, pour me a glass of wine. 
 - Okay.

273
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:02,020
Mom, I'm back.

274
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,719
Got it.

275
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,299
Li Aiqi.

276
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,020
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

277
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,179
I asked her to come here.

278
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,299
I went to find you when I got off work. You were not there.

279
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,559
I thought you left first.

280
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,260
These days, you're both too busy with your work.

281
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,320
Especially Qi, you've been busy.

282
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,459
You must be tired.

283
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,200
Chairman, don't say that. It's all my job.

284
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,039
Don't call me Chairman at home. Call me aunt.

285
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,180
I already consider you as family.

286
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,540
Don't take it personally.

287
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,399
That's what my mother tells everyone.

288
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:42,620
By the way, Mom, Customer Appreciation Meeting, can we reschedule it? I have something to do that day.

289
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,939
What is more important than the Customer Appreciation Meeting?

290
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:48,459
A good friend of mine has a Readers' Meeting.

291
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:51,040
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were busy on Tuesday.

292
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,880
But all the customers have been informed.

293
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,759
If the time is changed temporarily, I'm afraid the customers will have problems.

294
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:02,099
The Readers' Meeting starts at 10:00 in the morning.

295
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:05,099
I staggered the time. The Customer Appreciation Meeting is in the afternoon.

296
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:09,500
Once the former is over, I'll go there right away. Okay?

297
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,399
The time cannot be changed.

298
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,219
Mingming, you should focus on the company.

299
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,380
The Customer Appreciation Meeting is very important.

300
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,659
It's about whether the company can keep them in the future.

301
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:27,360
Honesty and punctuality are also the standards by which customers measure you.

302
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,360
Qi is also here.

303
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Let's have dinner later.

304
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,119
I already ate.

305
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,560
We'll eat later.

306
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,100
It's almost 7:00.

307
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,200
Mr. Luo has never been late before.

308
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,139
Something's wrong today.

309
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,999
Is there a traffic jam on the road?

310
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:08,100
Mr. Gao, are we having a farewell dinner?

311
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,440
Don't talk nonsense.

312
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,760
It's still one minute left.

313
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,839
What's the hurry?

314
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,839
Mr. Luo is here.

315
00:19:16,399 --> 00:19:18,380
He has brought someone with him.

316
00:19:21,979 --> 00:19:24,099
I'm glad I'm not late.

317
00:19:25,219 --> 00:19:28,199
Today, let me introduce her to you.

318
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,720
This is my girlfriend.

319
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,399
Zhan Yan.

320
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:34,299
Welcome.

321
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:35,460
Come on, sit down.

322
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,259
- Hello, everyone. 
 - Sit down.

323
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,820
Luo Ben, you're in love.

324
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,359
What?

325
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,180
You want me to be single all my life?

326
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:47,579
All right. Now, everyone is here.

327
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:49,260
Let's get started.

328
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,920
Okay. Come on.

329
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440
Don't drink if you can't. Drink some water.

330
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,220
What do you want to eat? I'll order it for you.

331
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,699
That's all right. It's good. It's okay.

332
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:01,519
How nice, Mr. Luo!

333
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,780
We were worried about you just now.

334
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,580
We thought you didn't want to work and would leave us behind.

335
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,039
Now it looks like you are just indulging in love.

336
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,220
By the way, what do you do?

337
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm a doctor at Central Hospital.

338
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,480
Wonderful, an angel in white.

339
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,479
Then, when we go to the hospital, we need Dr. Zhan's help.

340
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:23,659
Better not.

341
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,359
Who wants to go to the hospital?

342
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,660
Right. Better not.

343
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,620
Come on, let's drink together. Come on.

344
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,760
Welcome, Dr. Zhan.

345
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,480
- Welcome. 
 - Dr. Zhan didn't have wine.

346
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,680
She drinks water only.

347
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,880
You're so protective.

348
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,659
Is this your first day to know me?

349
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:43,520
I'm worried that you'll suffer losses when you get married.

350
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,220
I think I'm the luckiest in the world.

351
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:51,359
Come on. Cheers.

352
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,580
Come on, together.

353
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,399
Cheers.

354
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,599
Come and drink.

355
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,520
Cheers.

356
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:21,339
I'm so glad that you've decided to stay in Fazheng.

357
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,959
I thought you would oppose me doing public welfare.

358
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:32,939
I support public welfare and respect the volunteers.

359
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:36,679
But the public welfare rescue needs you to do it yourself.

360
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:39,079
It takes a lot of time and energy.

361
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:41,840
As lawyers, it's not allowed.

362
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,700
You've come this far. It's not easy.

363
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,100
I'm a little sorry for you.

364
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,779
Every choice in life is accompanied by sacrifices and trade-offs.

365
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,819
I choose to do rescue.

366
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,039
It may affect my working hours.

367
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,439
But I do obtain a lot from rescuing.

368
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:07,560
I learned what the meaning of giving is.

369
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,060
I learned what faith is.

370
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,780
You think more clearly than I do.

371
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,780
And you're more decisive than me.

372
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,079
I am old. I have too many concerns.

373
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:25,060
You have your pursuit and responsibility.

374
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,400
Such as, making a first-class law firm.

375
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,940
Or...

376
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,479
leading everyone forward.

377
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,499
Thank you.

378
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,140
At that time, Old Gao's face was green.

379
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,479
What are you talking about?

380
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:45,980
I'll tell you.

381
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,060
When he first came, he was just a hot-headed young man.

382
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,039
He dared to take the cases that others couldn't handle.

383
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,899
He even dared to rob my cases.

384
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,559
Did he get them?

385
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,480
I gave them to him willingly.

386
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,359
If one can grab it, get it and do it well, that's his ability.

387
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,639
Dr. Zhan, if you chat like this, it's not easy to continue. You know what?

388
00:23:02,639 --> 00:23:07,239
I guess I was right. He did get it and did it well.

389
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:09,939
I wanted to ask... I got something to say.

390
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,360
- I wanted to ask... 
 - Have a drink.

391
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,300
How did you fall in love with our Mr. Luo?

392
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,399
Now I understand.

393
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:18,400
Those who fit together seem to get together.

394
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,059
Such a good match.

395
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,600
- Have a drink. 
 - Have a drink.

396
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,080
- A toast to Dr. Zhan. 
 - Okay.

397
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,720
Welcome.

398
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,220
Old Gao.

399
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,079
Are you speaking ill of me?

400
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,700
Anyone who spoke ill of you was turned down by Dr. Zhan.

401
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,380
All that is left are admiration, envy, and love.

402
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,320
Right.

403
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,000
It's easy if you're envious.

404
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,619
Let me introduce one to you.

405
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:48,900
In Dr. Zhan's hospital, there are a lot of beautiful doctors and nurses.

406
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,120
I'm serious.

407
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,280
Dr. Zhan. No, an angel in white.

408
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,759
My marriage depends on you.

409
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,440
Mr. Gao, with your conditions, do you still need an introduction?

410
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,879
You can ask Luo Ben about this.

411
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,240
We are busy with our work.

412
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,460
All we know are either the customers or the witnesses.

413
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,440
There's no potential lover.

414
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,660
What he said was correct.

415
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,239
So, my social circle is very simple.

416
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,660
What kind do you like, Mr. Gao?

417
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,600
Do you have someone similar to Dr. Zhan?

418
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,760
What are you thinking?

419
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,560
None. Only one in the world.

420
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,400
Do you want a fake one?

421
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,019
Well, introduce me to someone else.

422
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:29,660
I also want to find the only one of mine.

423
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,620
- For that, a toast to Dr. Zhan. 
 - Okay.

424
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,140
- No. No. 
 - Come on, together.

425
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,180
Dr. Zhan needs to do operations.

426
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,440
It's a matter of life and death.

427
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,020
I'll drink it for her.

428
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,340
- No need. 
 - He is really her guardian.

429
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,579
Miss Rao, please.

430
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,660
Mr. Ming, here is the toy designer you asked me to find.

431
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,539
- Hello, Mr. Ming. 
 -  Hello.

432
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,100
Have a seat.

433
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,620
Miss Rao, I want to customize this set of characters.

434
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,920
Okay.

435
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,640
But it will take a month.

436
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,720
I need it next Tuesday.

437
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,040
I'm afraid it's impossible.

438
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,920
Next week, I can only make two.

439
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,740
Yuan, let me tell you. This meeting is especially important to me.

440
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,420
You must help me choose one.

441
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,580
I mean, an outfit that impresses the audience.

442
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,660
 What style do you want?

443
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,680
No matter what style it is, as amazing as possible.

444
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:44,160
This one.

445
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,460
 Like in the proposal scene.

446
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,020
It seems that the color doesn't suit me.

447
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:56,539
Don't make fun of me. Help me choose one.

448
00:25:57,739 --> 00:25:59,399
How about this one?

449
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:08,720
When will your Xiong Fei propose to you?

450
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,279
This one seems pretty good.

451
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,120
Look at the price.

452
00:26:16,739 --> 00:26:18,240
 It doesn't matter if he doesn't propose.

453
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,340
 - I'll propose.  
 - Okay, I'll see.

454
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,380
I'm waiting for you.

455
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,099
I'll try this one on.

456
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,360

457
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,320

458
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,140

459
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,310

460
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,810

461
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,160

462
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,660

463
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:14,860
 Members of the fan group, let's raise the board together.

464
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,179
Look!

465
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:20,720
Ding Dingding, these fanatical fans are the best proof of your popularity.

466
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,900
It's almost time.

467
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,340
Let's review the host's questions again later.

468
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,659
- Let's go on stage. 
 - Wait. Wait a minute.

469
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,900
 Have you arrived?

470
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,960
I hope you can enjoy it.

471
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,679
Excuse me.

472
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:47,419
- Hello, Mr. Jin. 
 - Hello.

473
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:50,419
Come on. Sign in first.

474
00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:54,239
At this time, you can't be distracted.

475
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,039
Come on. Let's review the questions again.

476
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:00,739
Why did you think of creating comics on the theme of Light Chaser Rescue?

477
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:01,920
Zhou Mingming.

478
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,280
This is our big customer.

479
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,260
- Mr. Jin. 
 - Hello, Mr. Jin.

480
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,779
Distinguished guests. Dear readers.

481
00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:50,999
Next, the most exciting moment is coming.

482
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:55,640
Let's welcome the author of the comic book Light Chaser Rescue,

483
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,399
Ms. Ding Dingding.

484
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,959
Ding Dingding.

485
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:09,320
Hello, everyone, I'm Ding Dingding.

486
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:20,220
I think the fans here must be very curious about one thing.

487
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,499
How did Ms. Ding Dingding come up with the theme of Light Chaser Rescue?

488
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:27,300
- Right? 
  - Yes.

489
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,580
Let me ask you a question first.

490
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,659
Do you like my comics?

491
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:33,699
 Sure!

492
00:29:33,699 --> 00:29:34,799
Thank you.

493
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,760
Then I'll tell you.

494
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,040
Actually, this comic book comes from my real experience.

495
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,700
When Fengxi Earthquake happened, I was in the disaster area.

496
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,380
There, I met the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

497
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,039
Before, I never thought about

498
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,120
what contribution I could make to the world.

499
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,640
However, they made me understand that

500
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,899
in fact, my existence also has a small significance.

501
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,600
And there's a special person.

502
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,159
While he was very enthusiastic, he was also very timid.

503
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,880
Originally, he shipped a batch of materials to the disaster area to help.

504
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,980
Unexpectedly, once he saw blood, he fainted with fear.

505
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,180
When someone fell into the water,

506
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,680
he did not hesitate and jumped into the water to save people.

507
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,060
Sometimes I get mad at him.

508
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,120
Sometimes, I'm moved by his justice.

509
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,939
Are you talking about Zhou Mengmeng?

510
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,520
Did Zhou Mengmeng express his love to you?

511
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,959
 Did he express his love to you?

512
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:47,339
 Will you be together?

513
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:48,779
 Are you together?

514
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,239
 Will you?

515
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,590

516
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,539
Thank you.

517
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,020
It's okay.

518
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,920
 Everybody, line up.

519
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,219
 Ms. Ding Dingding, I like you the best.

520
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,820
 Ms. Ding, can you write down "go ahead" for me?

521
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,859
 - Here. 
 - Thank you!

522
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:33,219
 Thank you, Ms. Ding Dingding.

523
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:35,339
 I like you very much.

524
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:45,679
 Thank you.

525
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:46,819
 I like you very much, Ms. Dingding.

526
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:48,980
 I finally get to meet you.

527
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,200
 - Don't crowd, everyone. 
 - Thank you.

528
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,479
 Come one by one.

529
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,659
 Thank you. I like you very much.

530
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,299
 Gathering for love!

531
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:01,890
 Chasing light for love!

532
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,630

533
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:22,300
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

534
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:27,940
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

535
00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:29,899
Let's go.

536
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,620
♫  and fly high up in the sky  ♫

537
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:39,240
♫  Dreams eventually become lighter  ♫

538
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,860
♫  When I see the crowd  ♫

539
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,360
♫  You became a star  ♫

540
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:56,060
♫  Like the shadow of a soaring dove  ♫

541
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:01,480
♫  Your sweet smile is like a dream to me  ♫

542
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,520
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

543
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,480
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

544
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,800
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

545
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:24,000
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

546
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,960
♫  The world is getting brighter  ♫

547
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,380
♫  Within glistening teardrops there is my love for you  ♫

548
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,340
♫  Two free forms  ♫

549
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:47,940
♫  Embrace the world  ♫

550
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,900

551
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,399
Still sleeping?

552
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,039
Look what the time is now.

553
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,300
Not getting up?

554
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:17,140
If you continue to sleep, I will take necessary measures.

555
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,500
What is the penalty for illegally breaking into a private house?

556
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:24,520
Fixed-term imprisonment of no more than three years.

557
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,599
However, I hope you give me a life sentence.

558
00:35:29,739 --> 00:35:31,519
Get up quickly.

559
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,180
Here.

560
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,279
Just right.

561
00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:09,539
Your brunch is ready.

562
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,459
Sometimes I envy you.

563
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:20,360
Although there is only one boyfriend, it feels like there are many.

564
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,339
That means I have good taste and a high requirement.

565
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,819
It's rare for you to have a rest today.

566
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,820
Do you have any plans?

567
00:36:29,739 --> 00:36:31,940
I've always been too busy to stop.

568
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,599
When I have to stop, I don't know what to do.

569
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,060
The Rescue Team has recently been in need of a diving coach.

570
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,660
No.

571
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,460
You can teach Zhou Mingming. You can also teach more people.

572
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:50,480
I told you I won't go.

573
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,500
Dr. Zhan,

574
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,859
you are good at diving.

575
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:56,260
You know the members.

576
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,640
You're willing to help others.

577
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,740
And you participated in several rescues and cooperated very well.

578
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,319
No one is more suitable than you.

579
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,579
You think it's Qingshan who asked me to persuade you?

580
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,920
Then who?

581
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,439
Qingshan went out to deal with some matters.

582
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,999
He's not at the team.

583
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:21,079
This time,

584
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:27,019
I'm asking you as a regular player and your boyfriend.

585
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,659
Our Dr. Zhan has great love.

586
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,620
How can you be willing to miss this opportunity?

587
00:37:41,379 --> 00:37:44,679
Since when did Mr. Luo speak so nicely?

588
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,380
I knew you'd go.

589
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,020
The type of diving usually involved in rescue is called scuba diving.

590
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,679
Theoretically, scuba diving doesn't require swimming skills.

591
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,479
Because the foundation of scuba diving is equipment.

592
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:10,919
But in today's first class, I still want to define it as swimming.

593
00:38:10,919 --> 00:38:13,079
Because once you get in the water,

594
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:19,039
the first thing you need to do is to overcome a fear of water.

595
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,059
Therefore, I hope you can take the water as a good friend.

596
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:28,600
Don't always think about how to conquer it and overcome it,

597
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,460
but how to use it.

598
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,339
Good speech.

599
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,820
- Chen Xing. 
 - Yes.

600
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,299
- Can you swim? 
 - Coach, I can.

601
00:38:38,299 --> 00:38:39,959
Then you can give us a demonstration.

602
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:41,800
No problem.

603
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,919
- Wukong. 
 -  Yes.

604
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:45,399
- Protect him. 
 -  Okay.

605
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:47,219
Go down.

606
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,520
Escort him!

607
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,879
I'm here, too.

608
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,080
I'm protecting you.

609
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
 I want the courage to enter the water.

610
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,700
 Come on!

611
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,099
 Protect him!

612
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:11,400
You are here but you don't take training.

613
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,980
Why?

614
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,400
I dare not enter the water.

615
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,559
You want to find Zhou Mingming?

616
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,380
No.

617
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,640
I don't know what he's doing lately. He seems very busy.

618
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,139
He hasn't come to practice several times already.

619
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,639
He is just an idle young man born in a rich family.

620
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,059
What can he do?

621
00:39:35,059 --> 00:39:38,140
It sounds that this guy is really not worth your love.

622
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,419
I don't love him.

623
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,539
What are you doing here then?

624
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,240
Besides, at the meeting, what you said was different.

625
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,420
All right.

626
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,919
Even if I used to like him, I don't like him now.

627
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,300
 Assemble.

628
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:15,020
He doesn't look like a good man.

629
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,240
Does he always defend bad guys?

630
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,600
This is a senior partner of their law firm.

631
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,860
Forget it if you don't like him.

632
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,460
Wait.

633
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,640
Taking a closer look,

634
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,279
he's kind of like an elitist.

635
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,180
Well, arrange a date for us.

636
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:45,119
Look. I will have a rest next week just in time.

637
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,859
Right?

638
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:53,080
Look. Is that Luo Ben?

639
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,020
How can he have dinner with another woman?

640
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,839
Keep it down. That's his assistant. I know her.

641
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:03,000
I've seen this case.

642
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,120
You have no chance.

643
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,780
But the task Gao Junchi gave me is that we have to win.

644
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,779
He attaches great importance to this client.

645
00:41:09,779 --> 00:41:11,999
This case is very controversial.

646
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:14,899
If you win, it's not necessarily good for the client.

647
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:16,980
Losing will win the hearts of others.

648
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,739
But I'm not sure I can persuade Gao Junchi to accept defeat.

649
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,159
You don't have to convince Gao Junchi.

650
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,499
Talk to your client.

651
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,659
I see.

652
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:33,899
You always have a clear mind.

653
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:36,719
You always look at the problem more thoroughly than others.

654
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,960
I admire you.

655
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,880
You left my group.

656
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,559
You don't need to flatter me.

657
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:49,319
Are you having difficulties communicating with Gao Junchi now?

658
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:51,039
It's such a simple thing.

659
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:52,640
Do you have to come to me for advice?

660
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,939
Don't mention it.

661
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:56,540
I thought following him would get me closer to my goal.

662
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,099
Unexpectedly, he just wants me to be a publicity agent.

663
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,139
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

664
00:42:02,139 --> 00:42:03,700
There are no right or wrong choices.

665
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,900
All roads lead to Rome.

666
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,759
It depends on how you get there.

667
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:09,399
I believe you can do it.

668
00:42:09,399 --> 00:42:11,240
You trust me so much.

669
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,200
Hello, sir. Here is your red wine.

670
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,740
We didn't order any red wine.

671
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,379
The lady over there ordered it for you.

672
00:42:30,799 --> 00:42:32,700
Please tell that lady on my behalf.

673
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,120
Thank her for her wine.

674
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,799
Okay.

675
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,160
Just give him a bottle of wine?

676
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,179
What else?

677
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:42,619
Declaring ownership.

678
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:44,880
You need to let her know that you're Luo Ben's girlfriend.

679
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,160
Let her face reality and withdraw.

680
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,280
Don't play tricks.

681
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,960
Right?

682
00:42:51,259 --> 00:42:54,539
Just eat. It's almost cold.

683
00:42:59,899 --> 00:43:02,580
They all say, "Be careful of fire, theft, and assistants."

684
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,500
How can you be so careless?

685
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,560
Beware of her.

686
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:26,920

687
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:36,920
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

688
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,940
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

689
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:51,520
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

690
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:58,500
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

691
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:06,560
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

692
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:14,420
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

693
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:21,760
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

694
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:29,060
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

695
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:37,800
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

696
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,040
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

697
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:52,720
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

698
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:00,200
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

699
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,220
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

700
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,960
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

701
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,640
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

702
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,400
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

703
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,020
♫  I can't fly  ♫

704
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,740
♫  But I can look up  ♫

705
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:30,960
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
