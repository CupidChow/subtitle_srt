00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,950

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,880
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,124
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:22,020
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:28,484
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:35,270
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,506
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:48,340
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,400
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,270
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,972

20
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,010
Yuan, I have to work overtime tonight.

21
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,720
Go home on time after work.

22
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,290
I'll order food delivery for your dinner.

23
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,618
It will arrive at 6:00 sharp.

24
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,100
President Ma.

25
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,608
 Mr. Luo, can you talk right now?

26
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,370
You know me.

27
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,220
Lawyers like me are always in court or on their way to the next courtroom.

28
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,368
However, I'm always at your service.

29
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,330
You're just being polite.

30
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,702
Still, I'm glad upon hearing that.

31
00:03:35,702 --> 00:03:38,320
 I'm calling to talk about my new merger.

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,544
We need to talk, face-to-face.

33
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,570
No problem. See you in an hour at my law firm.

34
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,650

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,370

36
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,480
 That's a long traffic jam.

37
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,980
 Looks like it's a traffic jam.

38
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,980

39
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,020
Excuse me, please open the door.

40
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,520
You can't get off on the highway.

41
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,770
There's a car accident. I'm a doctor. Duty calls.

42
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,030
 - Car accident?  
 - A doctor!

43
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,450
 It's a car accident!

44
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,850
Thanks.

45
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,400
 Keep your distance, please.

46
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,780
 Hurry up. Keep order.

47
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,730
 Excuse me.

48
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,500

49
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,360
 Please keep your distance.

50
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,880
 Step back.

51
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,640

52
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,250

53
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,880
Are you crazy?

54
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
- Why did you get up? 
 - I'm a doctor.

55
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,170
There's a car accident ahead. Drive.

56
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,700
This should be the latest and most unreasonable way to strike up a conversation this century.

57
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Occupying the emergency lane in a non-emergency situation,

58
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,960
you'll be fined 200 yuan and two driving record points.

59
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,820
I will take responsibility for my mistake.

60
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,920
Ambulances are on their way here.

61
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,640
You couldn't afford it if the rescue is delayed.

62
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,010
If it wasn't for you, I'd have been off the highway by now.

63
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,110
- I wouldn't delay the rescue. 
 - That's sophistry.

64
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,080
It is also illegal to get off on the highway.

65
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,164
That's up to the police.

66
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,470
I'm a doctor. I'm here to help.

67
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,550
He's taking up the emergency lane. He should be fined.

68
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,950
Okay.

69
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,320
 Move back. Step back, please.

70
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,600
 Keep your distance. The rescue is on the way.

71
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,910
 - Mama!  
 - I'm a doctor.

72
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,910
Mama! Mama!

73
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,400
Mama! Mama!

74
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,060
Mama!

75
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,520
Mama!

76
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,420
Madam, are you okay?

77
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,936
Can you hear me?

78
00:07:43,936 --> 00:07:45,860
I'm okay. Save my child.

79
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,010
Please, get her out first.

80
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,080
- Mama! 
 - Hang in there.

81
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,740
- My child. 
 - I'll check on her.

82
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,890
Look! He is occupying the emergency lane!

83
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,830
 There is a car accident on the highway three kilometers away from Light Chaser Rescue Headquarters.

84
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,080
 The police and the paramedics are on the way to the accident scene.

85
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,110
 It's closer to your headquarters.

86
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,300
 Please head to the scene immediately and help out with the rescue.

87
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,040
 Yes, Director Liu.

88
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,180
 We will set off immediately to therescue.

89
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,040
Be careful!

90
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,630
- Dad! Mama. 
 - There, Honey.

91
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,230
- Come. 
 - Steady.

92
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,190
- Dad. Mama. 
 - Your head!

93
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,280
Careful.

94
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,460
Dad. Mama.

95
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,590
All right.

96
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,210
- I want my mama. 
 - There, there.

97
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,210
 Xiong Fei, how far away are you from the scene?

98
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,918
One kilometer.

99
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:54,350
 Okay. Keep me posted.

100
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
There you go.

101
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,760

102
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,880
Here.

103
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,790

104
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,250
Doctor Zhan, how is it?

105
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,000
The woman is doing okay.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,210
The man is in a bad condition. The door on his side is deformed.

107
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,531
- Understand. 
 - Dr. Zhan, your medkit.

108
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,220
It's opened.

109
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,008
Hang in there.

110
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,720
Hydraulic cutter.

111
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,920
Hang in there.

112
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,490
- Are you okay? 
 - It doesn't work.

113
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,044
Move, let me try.

114
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,240
- It's working. 
 - Hurry up.

115
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,810
Tie the wood up!

116
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,426
Spinal board!

117
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,410
Careful.

118
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,782
Steady.

119
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,650
Pneumothorax.

120
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,306
Can you move?

121
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,500
Here.

122
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,860
Are you okay?

123
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,010
Hold it.

124
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,100
I need a tape bandage.

125
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,190
Hang in there.

126
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Come on.

127
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,680
Hang in there. Talk to me.

128
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,400
Come on.

129
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Careful, move your right foot.

130
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
Careful.

131
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,700
There you go. Come on.

132
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,784
To the stretcher.

133
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:37,620
Careful. Take care.

134
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,950
Steady. Come on.

135
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,186
Steady.

136
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,110
- Steady. 
 - Here.

137
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,550
I got this. Let's go.

138
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,500
 - Nice work! 
 - Nice!

139
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,388
 Thank you!

140
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:43,512

141
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,500
Grandma Qin.

142
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,360
Morning, Mr. Luo.

143
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,860
Good morning.

144
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,652
Same as usual.

145
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:03,830
Thank you.

146
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,290
 At 11:18 today, there was a car accident on Airport Highway.

147
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,030
 It caused a severe jam.

148
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,100
 Mr. Luo.

149
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,620
- Thank you, Mr. Luo. 
 - No problem.

150
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,828
- The receipt for the new rescue kit. 
 - Okay.

151
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:26,140
The rescue kits you prepare never come to use.

152
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,500
But we're paying a fortune to update the materials.

153
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,690
I hope they'll never come to use.

154
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,100
What took you so long?

155
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,170
President Ma has been waiting for 20 minutes.

156
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,162
There was a traffic jam.

157
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:36,028
What is that?

158
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
I picked it up.

159
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,380
There's an ID card in it.

160
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,600
- Deal with it later. 
 - Okay.

161
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,310
Let's go.

162
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,680
 He's being fined for taking up the emergency lane.

163
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,380
 See the difference?

164
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,980
 What could be more important than this emergency?

165
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,830
 Check on these ordinances.

166
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,786
President Ma, sorry for the wait.

167
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,160
You're a hit now.

168
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,376
I see you are on the news.

169
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,590
I didn't mean to urge you.

170
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,200
Sorry about that.

171
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,480
I'll compensate you for the fine.

172
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,080
Thanks.

173
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,740
The time is short.

174
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,420
Let's get to the point.

175
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,870
It's about our merger with Ruyi Pictures.

176
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,370
Now is the time for due diligence.

177
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,634
It went on smoothly.

178
00:15:30,634 --> 00:15:33,190
However, there is an illustrator coming out of nowhere.

179
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,950
She started an activism with other illustrators to claim rights.

180
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,340
She threatened me with making a big scene.

181
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,924
President Ma, what is your attitude?

182
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,420
I could add up the payment. That's not a big deal.

183
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,590
But their names must not appear in the books.

184
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,930
As you know, what makes this contract profitable

185
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,340
is the comic with KK's name on it.

186
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,790
It's impossible for us to add a little-known illustrator's name as a co-author.

187
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,730
The contract I drew up for you circumvents the authorship of the illustrators.

188
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,460
The authorship shall depend on the illustrator's contribution.

189
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,340
We could interpret this clause in our interest.

190
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,280
But it's different this time.

191
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,686
Ding Dingding, the illustrator, came up with the storyline.

192
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,714
She launched this campaign.

193
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:19,610
What's her relationship with KK?

194
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,730
At first, she agreed to work under KK's guidance.

195
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,366
She would imitate KK's style.

196
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:30,052
I did agree to sign her at the time.

197
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,620
But who knew that after the work was finished,

198
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,348
KK insisted on sole authorship.

199
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:38,280
What could I do?

200
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,040
So, you thought she was a pushover.

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,592
Turns out that she's hard to deal with.

202
00:16:45,592 --> 00:16:49,380
Don't say that.  Take a look at the situation.

203
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,232
Which contract did Ding Dingding sign?

204
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,754
The illustrator contract you drafted.

205
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:59,590
The tricky part is she keeps a huge amount of sketches.

206
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,040
It's enough to prove her contribution.

207
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,620
She deserves authorship.

208
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,270
Why did she agree to work with KK in the first place?

209
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,734
Why did she give out her idea?

210
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:12,070
She's a fan of KK.

211
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,620
She said that as long as she could work with KK, she was willing

212
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,696
to work free of charge without claiming authorship.

213
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:23,234
President Ma, do you have any proof of that?

214
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,808

215
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,586
Doctor Zhan.

216
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,070
Zhan Yan.

217
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,168
Bring me the CT results of Director Zha's patient.

218
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:41,364
Not again!

219
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,476
Is that clear?

220
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,340
All right.

221
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,704
Stick to this surgical plan and get prepared.

222
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:50,750
What's going on?

223
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,920
Doctor Zhan.

224
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,980
Zirui, the medical record.

225
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,770
Dr. Zhan, you're supposed to be on vacation.

226
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,036
Did you just get off the plane?

227
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,610
The patient is Fang Xiaoya, a 16-year-old girl.

228
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,030
She came here because of abdominal pain.

229
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,466
After the examination, it's an occupied lesion of the pancreatic head.

230
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,540
What's your opinion?

231
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,850
Director Zha held the preoperative conference.

232
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,960
The plan is to carry out the Whipple procedure.

233
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,400
- Meeting minutes. 
 - Here.

234
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,070
You lads! Listen up!

235
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:36,310
The task is to get down as fast as possible while keeping safe.

236
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,440
Do you get it?

237
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,880
 Yes, sir!

238
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,030
Are you ready?

239
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,590
 Yes, sir.

240
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,020
Ready, set, go!

241
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,450
Hurry up!

242
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,230
Too slow! What are you, turtles?

243
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,758
The wounded are dying.

244
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,970
Not bad.

245
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,606
0.8 seconds slower than the last run.

246
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,540
Don't underestimate it!

247
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,740
At the rescue scene, the wounded might be dead within 0.8 seconds,

248
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:13,160
and you could get injured!

249
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:18,066
So, the task now is,

250
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:21,192
is to practice, practice, practice!

251
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:24,650
I want it faster, faster, faster, and more precise.

252
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,840
- Do you understand? 
 - Yes, sir!

253
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,432
Look at you.

254
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:34,450
Look at your pretty face.

255
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,438
You need more practice!

256
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,054
100 push-ups with weights!

257
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,990
Did I see you grin?

258
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,826
Do it with him!

259
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,640

260
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,440
- Falcon. 
 - Falcon.

261
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,620
Torturing the newbies again?

262
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,800
Did you get wounded?

263
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,820
Just a scratch. Not a big deal.

264
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,930
That's not a military medal.

265
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,838
Keep yourself safe before helping others.

266
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:26,930
You should learn from Xiong Fei.

267
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,500
Not even a scratch.

268
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,840
Why is that?

269
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,020
Because he's skilled.

270
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Think about it.

271
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,790
He was helping out Zhan Yan when he got scratched.

272
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,430
Was Yan there, too?

273
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,730
- Is she all right? 
 - Yeah.

274
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,120
She was really helpful.

275
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,540
- Captain. 
 - Captain.

276
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,230
That's good.

277
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,130
Like father, like daughter.

278
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,790

279
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,682
You've worked hard today.  We'll have a feast.

280
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:51,240
Stay here if you're free tonight.

281
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,140
 - Bravo! 
 -  I'm free!

282
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,820
 - Me, too! 
 - So am I!

283
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,590
Show me what you've got.

284
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,170
Help prepare dinner!

285
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,340
 Give it to me.

286
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,540
- What about it? 
 - I heard that Doctor Zhan stole Chief Cha's surgery again.

287
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,440
Doctor Zhan's plan is too risky.

288
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,384
Stealing isn't necessarily a good thing.

289
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:19,340
What's in it for her?

290
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,320
Isn't there a vacancy for the associate chief physician of general surgery.

291
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,610
Both Dr. Cai and Dr. Zhan are candidates. That's why she's doing it.

292
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,396
Gossiping?

293
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,340
If you can come up with a surgery plan, you should be doctors.

294
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,060
Shouldn't you focus on your job?

295
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,332
Stop talking about others.

296
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,060
Bed No. 3 can be discharged early.

297
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,900
He's progressing nicely.

298
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,134
Yuxiao, I'm more optimistic about you.

299
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:54,820
Thanks, Chief Cha.

300
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,800

301
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,010
Prepare for sutures. Zirui, it's your turn.

302
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,570
Yes.

303
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:38,210
Zhan Yan shows her exquisite skill and her sense of responsibility.

304
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,790
This surgery was a great success.

305
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,690
It's finished not by luck.

306
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,410
She has what it takes.

307
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,430
I wish that all of you can learn from her by thinking for your patients.

308
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,780
That's the sense of responsibility.

309
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:54,052
Meanwhile, never stop improving your abilities.

310
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,140
Dr. Zhan.

311
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,030
You performed an operation just after your vacation.

312
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,630
What else could I do? Let Chief Cha cut out her organs?

313
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,440
I was there at the conference.

314
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,130
To be honest, Chief Cha's plan was feasible.

315
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,230
Besides, you shouldn't have offended him for one surgery.

316
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,206
If it works, it works.

317
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,018
But it's not the best.

318
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,890
Since I have to think about my patients, I can't keep being the good guy.

319
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,250
Yuxiao, that's why I'm different from you.

320
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,736
Fine, I won't argue with you.

321
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:50,540
May I remind you that in the hospital, the winner is king.

322
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,310
The job title evaluation exam is approaching.

323
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,790
How is your thesis going?

324
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,050
Working on it. Still need some time.

325
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,928
Name it if there's anything I can do.

326
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,110
Thanks but no.

327
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,896
There's only one vacancy.

328
00:25:03,896 --> 00:25:07,344
Everyone competes fairly according to their abilities.

329
00:25:07,344 --> 00:25:10,762
Sooner or later, we'll both be associate chief physicians.

330
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:11,850
How about this?

331
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,300
I'll let you have it this time. Take the chance.

332
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,910
I'll wait for the next time. Okay?

333
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:19,860
This isn't the time to show your chivalry.

334
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,694
Don't be stubborn.

335
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,920
What about your case study on a diving medicine accident case?

336
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,608
How is it going?

337
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,898
I left my bag in his car!

338
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,000
 Look!

339
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,960
 - What's going on? 
 - What happened?

340
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,500
Stop messing around!

341
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,150
- Ding Dingding. 
 - Dingding!

342
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,940
Get down!

343
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,460
We don't have to sign.

344
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,750
Exactly, Dingding.

345
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,410
We'll be more careful with the contract next time.

346
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:10,600
I get it. I dare not fight back.

347
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,310
But I am tired of the bullying.

348
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,400
 - Calm down. 
 - Don't do this.

349
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,710
 We can talk to them.

350
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,270
Ma Baoming.

351
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,600
By agreeing to sign an unconscionable contract,

352
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,700
would occupy the fruits of the artist's labor and make the artist sell himself in disguise.

353
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,600
And finally, won't give us authorship.

354
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,310
Drawing is our career and our dream work.

355
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,030
We eat to live.

356
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,850
Yes, we are small yet transparent.

357
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,590
It's important to earn a living and to live.

358
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,680
But also with dignity and a bottom line.

359
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,800
Pregnancy in October to give birth now then to take my baby away,

360
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,300
only to have it named after someone else.

361
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,548
How can you do that to us?

362
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:47,910
 You're still young!

363
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,210
 Don't do this.

364
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,930
 Don't jump!

365
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,306
 Go back!

366
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:54,346
 Calm down.

367
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,340
 Step back.

368
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,240
 Don't be silly. We can talk about it.

369
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,270
 Keep your distance. Move back.

370
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,660
 Please keep your distance. Step back.

371
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,498
 Move back.

372
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:06,818
 Calm down, Ding Dingding.

373
00:27:06,818 --> 00:27:08,630
 What happened?

374
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,750
Don't do anything stupid!

375
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,106
Get the air mattress.

376
00:27:14,106 --> 00:27:15,640
 Walk downstairs. Let's talk.

377
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,144
 Finally, there you are.

378
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,390
I knew it. Ding Dingding is hard to deal with.

379
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,920
I didn't know how she would come up with this idea.

380
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,790
I wanted to give her a bluff and make her stop.

381
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,774
But it didn't work.

382
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,880
It's a disaster now! It's only been minutes.

383
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,580
She has 100,000 viewers already!

384
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,532
Oh, my goodness.

385
00:27:34,532 --> 00:27:36,500
Mr. Luo, my company is counting on you.

386
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,200
Mr. Luo.

387
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,440
How much can you pay?

388
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,640
100,000 yuan.

389
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,764
At most, 100,000 yuan.

390
00:27:42,764 --> 00:27:44,580
Mr. Luo, go upstairs on your own.

391
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,790
I'd better not show up.

392
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,360
But this is between you and her.

393
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,960
I'm afraid she'll lose her mind upon seeing me.

394
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,370
You're my lawyer. You are my universal agent.

395
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,740
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

396
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,060
Please.

397
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm begging you.

398
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,930
Zhan Yan, it's your cousin.

399
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,340
Your cousin is going to jump off the building.

400
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,680
What are you talking about? What cousin?

401
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,340
It's... I get it! Ding Dingding.

402
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,000
That's a catchy name.

403
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,706
 - Anyway, Ma Baoming must compen... 
 - Why is he there?

404
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,370
Why is it blocked?

405
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,750
No!

406
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,270
Did she take the leap?

407
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,630
What are you thinking? It's life and death.

408
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,640
You don't seem nervous at all!

409
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,340
Call the emergency department. I'll go with them.

410
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,824
- To those who are in the same situation— 
 - You must be brave Ms. Ding.

411
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,180
Who are you?

412
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,400
Stay there! Or I'll jump.

413
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,048
Okay, I'll stay.

414
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,110
I'm the legal counsel from the company. You can call me Mr. Luo.

415
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,740
Where is Ma Baoming? Get him here.

416
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,900
What do you want? You can talk to me.

417
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,144
I am here on his behalf.

418
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,360
My demand is simple.

419
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,510
I want the authorship for all illustrators and an addition contribution fee.

420
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,500
What's more, the company has been exploiting us for years.

421
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,320
They must pay us back.

422
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,290
How about this?

423
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,270
Get down and let's talk somewhere else.

424
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:45,170
No way. We can talk right here.

425
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,710
I don't know if you can see it.

426
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,160
But it must be loud enough.

427
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,110
 KK, I love your work so much!

428
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,440
 You're my idol!

429
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,990
 You know what, as long as I can learn from you, work with you,

430
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,158
 I can even work for free without claiming authorship!

431
00:30:04,158 --> 00:30:06,690
 As long as you can learn from KK,

432
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,820
 you'd work for free without claiming authorship.

433
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,890
But I was being polite.

434
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,370
That's not evidence.

435
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,930
Even if what you said in this clip is not an oral stipulation,

436
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,950
you came up with a common plot for this book.

437
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,060
But the details and character designs

438
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,440
are all from the community discussion with KK and other illustrators.

439
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,980
What about the sketches?

440
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,640
I drew most of the sketches.

441
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,868
Even if I'm not the first author, there should be a place for me!

442
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:53,780
The sketches were imitating KK's style.

443
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,160
You'd agreed to this condition before working on this book.

444
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,690
The comics in your book, the lines, colors, and compositions

445
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:06,230
are all in KK's style.

446
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,322
These properties are protected by law.

447
00:31:09,322 --> 00:31:13,210
But... Ma Baoming promised me.

448
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,690
Okay, I get it.

449
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:19,930
So Ma Baoming dug a hole from the beginning.

450
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,950
He didn't want to give us the authorship at all. Right?

451
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,000
-  That's enough. 
 - If you were to jump,

452
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,600
you'd have jumped before your live broadcast had more than 100,000 viewers.

453
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,450
What do you mean? Are you forcing me to jump?

454
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:35,500
To be honest, even if you jumped off,

455
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,410
the company would not be affected.

456
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,910
You'd bring more exposure to the book.

457
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,750
In our time, news about a woman jumping off a building

458
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,260
will be forgotten overnight.

459
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:52,672
Your death would be utterly meaningless.

460
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,820
You are so cold-blooded.

461
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,552
I'm just analyzing it in a sensible way.

462
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,670
Ms. Ding, I've read your work.

463
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,340
You are a creative and talented illustrator.

464
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,110
Even if you don't get the authorship now,

465
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:17,350
I'm sure that if you go on and work hard enough,

466
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:23,018
one day, you will get your own work published.

467
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,320
President Ma agreed to you pay you 100,000 yuan as remuneration.

468
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,220
- For real? 
 - For real.

469
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,470
What about the others?

470
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,010
They'll get theirs.

471
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:49,244
The exact amounts depend on their workload.

472
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,840
Get down, will you?

473
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,470
Get down. We can sign the contract now.

474
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,982
Do you really believe that I can have my work published?

475
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,748
Here, give me your hand.

476
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:21,070
 Ding Dingding!

477
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,680
 Ding Dingding!

478
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,856
 Oh my goodness!

479
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:25,960
 That's close!

480
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,240
 - Thankfully, there was a mattress. 
 - So close.

481
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,510
 - It's working. 
  - Yeah.

482
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,490
 That was dangerous.

483
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,110

484
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,970
 - Ding Dingding! 
 - Ding Dingding.

485
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,380
- Are you okay? 
  - All right?

486
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,272
You scared me!

487
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,318
Take it easy.

488
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,890
 Steady.

489
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,642
 You're safe.

490
00:34:00,642 --> 00:34:02,100
Why are you everywhere?

491
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Why can't I be here?

492
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,920
I left my bag in your car.

493
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,154
I was trying to find you.

494
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,350
Send it to Central Hospital, pay on delivery.

495
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,930
Thank you.

496
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,330
That's the start of our connection.

497
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,890
Is it a good sign to build a connection with the hospital?

498
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
 Thankfully, they arrived in time.

499
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,730
 Are you okay?

500
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,970
 Should you give her an inspection?

501
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,452
 Doctor.

502
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,250
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

503
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:15,850
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

504
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:21,500
♫  and fly high up in the sky  ♫

505
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,120
♫  I want to know how dreams float in the clouds  ♫

506
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,320
Ariel, mail the dive bag to this address.

507
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,350
Pay on delivery.

508
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,998
Found the owner?

509
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,850
It must be fate, between you and this beauty.

510
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,550
That's the second time you met her.

511
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,890
Beauty?

512
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,714
I've seen her ID.

513
00:35:40,714 --> 00:35:43,602
You used to have better taste.

514
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,550
♫  Your sweet smile is like a dream to me  ♫

515
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,250
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

516
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,700
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

517
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,800
♫  As we hug each other  ♫

518
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:14,780
♫  we create a world of two  ♫

519
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,386
Delivery?

520
00:36:33,386 --> 00:36:34,330
May I come in?

521
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,086
- Sure. 
 - Thanks.

522
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,874
Let's learn a new dance, shall we?

523
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,892
Let's feel the beat with our hearts.

524
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
Careful.

525
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,518
Yangyang, what's wrong?

526
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:27,940
Yangyang!

527
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,608
What happened?

528
00:37:30,608 --> 00:37:32,350
- Are you okay? 
 - He's choking.

529
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,420
Are you choking? Here, allow me.

530
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,840
All right.

531
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,680
It's out!

532
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,230
How do you feel now?

533
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,700
It's out. Yangyang.

534
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,120
Are you okay, Yangyang?

535
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,210
Thank you.

536
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,860
I didn't even know what to do.

537
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,420
Thank you so much.

538
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,820
It's okay.

539
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,358
As a teacher, you should learn some basic first-aid techniques.

540
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,414
 Do you know first-aid?

541
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,270
This is... This is Ms. Luo.

542
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,594
She was asking if you know first-aid.

543
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,530
That was the Heimlich maneuver.

544
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,040
I'm from Light Chaser Rescue Team.

545
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,812
I know a thing or two.

546
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,650
 Good!

547
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,330
Congrats to Mr. Gao on his new case.

548
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,430
Thanks.

549
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,034
 Congratulations!

550
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:28,680
Thank you!

551
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,610
Old Gao, you're one step closer to becoming a partner.

552
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,196
Keep it up.

553
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,290
Luo Ben, you should work harder.

554
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,630
I'll follow Mr. Gao's example.

555
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,484
Save me the etiquette.

556
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,888
Everyone knows that Mr. Luo always surpasses his predecessors.

557
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,900
Mr. Luo works hard.

558
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,210
It's also for the profit and the reputation of our firm.

559
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,510
- We all benefit from it. Don't you think? 
 - Exactly.

560
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,380
See? I told you.

561
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,700
Never judge Luo Ben in front of Ariel.

562
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,380
Otherwise, she'd act as defense counsel.

563
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,370
See what I mean?

564
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,580
She puts you in silence.

565
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,130
Mr. He, I want a partner like this one, too.

566
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,640
Ariel, how about working for me?

567
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,810
Take all the credit.

568
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,062
I'm willing to be the one who supports you.

569
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,580
Sorry, already taken.

570
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,460
It's filled to capacity.

571
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,960
Filled to...

572
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,420
Come on, give me a chance.

573
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,920
Hold on.

574
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,870
Don't raid my helpers.

575
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,210
This isn't the first time.

576
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,910
Likewise.

577
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,980
That's right.

578
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,230
We march forward in competitions.

579
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,870
This way, our firm is dynamic.

580
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,870
Don't you think so?

581
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,270
 Sure!

582
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,500
Here.

583
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:55,900
Here's the deal. Be sure to get Old Gao drunk.

584
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,600
- Drink a toast to him! 
  - All right.

585
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,082
Thank you.

586
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,906
Can I have a word with you?

587
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,140
What's up?

588
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:21,330
Do you remember the annual blanket order of Fangqin Group?

589
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,660
The underlying asset is worth a fortune.

590
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,332
Can you handle it?

591
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,800
Why aren't you giving it to Old Gao?

592
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,328
If he gets this, he'll be the partner.

593
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,906
If you don't take this, I'll give him the offer.

594
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,960
 Don't forget about our deal.

595
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,460
 Sure.

596
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,868
You wily fox.

597
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,170
Their president is taking a vacation in Fengxi.

598
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,862
Pay him a visit as soon as possible.

599
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,080
I got it.

600
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,400
 - Watch your step. 
 - Steady.

601
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,030
Be sure to send him home.

602
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,540
 - You got this.  
 - Be careful.

603
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,590
Don't forget my partner!

604
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,190
I hear you.

605
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,330
Well, I'll get going.

606
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:13,760
Don't forget our deal.

607
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,860
Sure.

608
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,030
I must go.

609
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,810
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

610
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,322
Drive me home?

611
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,770
Luo Yuan is off from work.

612
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,818
I must get home.

613
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,760
You are too strict with her.

614
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,504
Girls at her age all have dates at night.

615
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,840
Luo Yuan is unlike other ordinary girls.

616
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,610
You're spoiling her.

617
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,540
You can't look after her forever.

618
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,840
She'll get married one day.

619
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,000
Being in a relationship, living her own life.

620
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,636
So will you.

621
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,840
Okay, you're right.

622
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,070
I'll be going on a business trip for a few days.

623
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,230
I must prepare some food for Luo Yuan.

624
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,650
See you tomorrow?

625
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,081
 - How can I help you? 
 - This one and the bum, please.

626
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:58,608
 Okay.

627
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,460
What are you doing?

628
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,500
Delete it.

629
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,810
What do you mean?

630
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,430
Delete the video.

631
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,770
Done.

632
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,526
Clear the recycle bin.

633
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,338
I've deleted them all. See?

634
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,800
What are you doing?

635
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,740
He was filming you.

636
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:16,950

637
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:25,792
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

638
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:32,846
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

639
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:40,884
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

640
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:47,850
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

641
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:55,754
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

642
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:03,770
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

643
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:11,134
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

644
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,350
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

645
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:27,170
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

646
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:33,400

647
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:42,100
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

648
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:49,700
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫
