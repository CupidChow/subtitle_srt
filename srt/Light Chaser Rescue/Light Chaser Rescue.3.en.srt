Dongzi!

17
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,200
You can't go in there.

18
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,000
It's too dangerous.

19
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:44,000
Let go.

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:44,920
Let go.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Let me in.

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Calm down.

23
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
- Dongzi!
- Calm down.

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,000
Dongzi.

Captain.

26
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,410
Captain.

Falcon.

28
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,920
What's the situation on the scene?

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,530
In the earthquake,

30
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,810
owing to everyone's rapid response,

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,890
most of the teachers and students

32
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,770
escaped,

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,810
except for an old headmaster,

34
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,690
and a teacher surnamed Luo

35
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,560
from Linjiang,

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,920
who was buried

37
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,000
while rescuing junior students.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,440
OK.

39
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,640
Look.

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
Is their location confirmed?

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,440
Not yet.

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,000
But

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,360
we're narrowing the search scope.

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,610
Captain Qingshan,

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,840
my little sister is still in there.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,920
I beg you to save her.

47
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,720
Luo Yuan?

48
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
We're in search and rescue.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,210
Captain.

50
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,880
My sister can't speak,

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,280
but she can hear.

52
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,250
She can't speak?

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:22,650
No,

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,090
she can't.

55
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,250
It's very important information.

56
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,000
The victim can't speak.

57
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,130
She may communicate

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,840
with us in other ways.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
Wall, tube,

60
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
stone, whistle,

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,560
anything is possible.

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Pay special attention to that.

63
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,040
Take actions separately.

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,810
Yes.

65
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,650
Captain.

66
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,250
The location is confirmed.

67
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,690
OK.

68
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,880
Anyone there?

69
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,690
Anyone there?

70
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,410
Miss Luo.

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,440
Miss Luo, is that you?

72
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
Good.

73
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,250
Don't be afraid.

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,370
We'll definitely get out alive.

75
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,090
People will

76
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,210
come to rescue us.

77
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,970
Don't be afraid.

78
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,280
I'm fine here.

79
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,840
It's just a bit too narrow.

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,440
I must keep up my strength.

81
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,610
Now,

82
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,610
I can't speak to you anymore.

83
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,290
By the way,

84
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,370
I'm right under you.

85
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,440
I'm keeping you company.

86
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,810
Don't panic.

87
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,170
Why haven't they come out yet?

88
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,290
Yuan!

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,400
Yuan, can you hear me?

90
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,050
Yuan,

91
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,370
don't panic.

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,610
I'll rescue you soon.

93
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,810
Are you injured?

94
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,080
Hang in there for a while.

95
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,080
I'll rescue you soon.

96
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,290
Captain,

97
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,080
my sister is injured.

98
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,170
Please go to save her.

99
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,560
We'll try our best

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,730
to rescue your sister.

101
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,880
Thanks, Captain.

102
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,290
Can you hear me?

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,930
We're with Light Chaser Rescue.

104
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,000
We're here to rescue you.

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,200
We're with Light Chaser Rescue.

106
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,170
We're here to rescue you.

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,050
Can you hear me?

108
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:28,730
Nurse.

109
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,250
When can I walk?

110
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,050
Be patient.

111
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,050
Wait for a second.

112
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,080
OK.

113
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,440
Thanks, nurse.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,170
You're welcome.

115
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,490
Why don't you eat the egg noodles?

116
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,960
Aren't you hungry?

117
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,810
Lele.

118
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
Yan, I tell you what,

119
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,130
it's been a while.

120
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,290
The kid didn't eat or drink anything.

121
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,810
He wouldn't read comic books.

122
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,370
The milk

123
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,000
was warmed for you.

124
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,400
While it's still warm,

125
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,080
drink a little, OK?

126
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,250
I'll drink if you don't.

127
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm drinking now.

128
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,520
What about this?

129
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,760
Do you believe

130
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,050
I'm a magician?

131
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,850
I'll do a magic trick for you.

132
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,850
Look.

133
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,080
A butterfly.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,130
Legend goes, long long ago,

135
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,490
butterflies' favorite food

136
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,130
was milk and butter.

137
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,000
That's why butterfly

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,130
was called butter-fly.

139
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,080
Butterflies

140
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,760
grew beautiful

141
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,050
colored wings

142
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,170
after they ate butter and milk,

143
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,490
which helped them

144
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,730
to survive in nature.

145
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,810
So,

146
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:23,810
Lele, do you want to

147
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,170
be like butterflies

148
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
to protect yourself

149
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,930
as well as others,

150
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,200
and be strong?

151
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,400
Yan,

152
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,450
you are much gentler

153
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,090
to children than to me.

154
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,490
Zhan Yan, there's a patient

155
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,330
that needs you to check on.

156
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,160
OK.

157
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,280
Take care of him.

158
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,570
Rest assured.

159
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,680
Do you want to eat noodles?

160
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,680
Look, they're so yummy.

161
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,570
Come on.

162
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,730
The connection is resumed.

163
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,880
I'd better...

164
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,780
(Driving Mode)

165
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,250
Mom.

166
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm with my cousin.

167
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,880
Don't worry.

168
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,920
She's fine.

169
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,090
Why don't you care more about me?

170
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,760
Aren't I your daughter?

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,210
Tell my dad to make more wontons.

172
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,520
They make my mouth water.

173
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,970
OK. No more talk. I'll hang up.

174
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,090
OK.

175
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:28,400
I won't say hang up.

176
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:30,330
Dear mom, goodbye.

177
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:30,920
Bye.

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,520
Hello, Wenbo.

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,760
I'm in the earthquake-stricken area.

181
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
There was no cell service.

182
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,330
The connection just resumed a little.

183
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,130
I saw your message,

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,330
asking me to paint.

185
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,450
No.

186
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,760
I was out to enjoy a diversion,

187
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,000
and the quake just came up.

188
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,000
Wait for me. I'll...

189
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,370
Tomorrow,

190
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,880
or I'll return the day after tomorrow
at the latest.

191
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,160
OK. Yes.

192
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,280
Goodbye, then.

193
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,100
(Emergency Medical Service)

194
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,730
Yan, when will the vehicle

195
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,570
of the hospital come?

196
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,450
Will it come today?

197
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,520
I don't know.

198
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,330
I have surgeries.

199
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,250
Well, Mingming,

200
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,490
didn't you say

201
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,920
you had contacted people here?

202
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,000
Now we're here.

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
Why no one comes to our aid?

204
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,800
The connection is bad here.

205
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,680
I talked to them.

206
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,610
They said it was too late
to send anyone to help us,

207
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,330
and asked us to unload the goods
in the tents first.

208
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,130
Captain,

209
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,520
according to the initial judgment,

210
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,000
the victim is
buried underneath heavy objects,

211
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,520
and the space is narrow.

212
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
I need to get up and check

213
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,680
if we can clear a passage.

214
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,570
According to the image,

215
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,090
he should get up from the south.

216
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,760
There are more props

217
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,090
and it's relatively safe.

218
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,040
Xiong Fei,

219
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,680
get up from the south.

220
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,330
There are more props

221
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,610
and fewer obstacles.

222
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,680
Roger that.

223
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:45,880
Fatty.

224
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,330
Li Jian.

225
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:50,920
Where are they?

226
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,380
(When Trouble Occurs at One Spot,
Help Comes from All Quarters)

227
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,250
Excuse me?

228
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,250
Are you from Linjiang?

229
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,130
So am I.

230
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Are you also from Linjiang?

231
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,280
Are you here to make a contribution?

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,160
I'm here to supply relief.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,920
With enough supplies,

234
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,970
people on the front line
will be more dynamic.

235
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
Are you going back to town?

236
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,370
Sure.

237
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,730
But I have a truckload of goods...

238
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,970
The goods still need to be unloaded.

239
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't worry, I'll help you.

240
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,800
Can you do that?

241
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,090
Don't underestimate me.

242
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,400
Good.

243
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,570
You seem quite capable.

244
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,610
I'm Zhou Mingming, and you?

245
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,610
I'm Ding Dingding.

246
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,490
Here, take it.

247
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,640
I have to make a call.

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,570
Well, what do you mean?

249
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,730
You not only didn't unload the goods,

250
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,610
but also drove my car away.

251
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,610
How could you do that to me?

252
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,280
You guys wait for me.

253
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,850
I'll teach you a lesson when I return.

254
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:09,970
Miss Luo.

255
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,640
Can you hear me?

256
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,730
Except for your legs,

257
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,280
what is ailing you?

258
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,920
Yuan.

259
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,400
How's the kid?

260
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,760
Hang in there.

261
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,250
I'll get you out of here right now.

262
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,610
What does she mean?

263
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,400
My sister said,

264
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,610
she said there was another victim.

265
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
Is that the headmaster?

266
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,090
Headmaster.

267
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,250
We're with Light Chaser Rescue.

268
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,330
Hang in there.

269
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,490
I'm coming to save you now.

270
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,800
Can you hear me, sir?

271
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,490
Captain,

272
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,970
my sister's legs are pinned.

273
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,450
And she's injured in the abdomen.

274
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,570
How bad the injuries are

275
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:37,760
isn't quite so obvious.

276
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,920
Would you hurry up

277
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,250
and save her?

278
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
I can tell

279
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,730
you know something

280
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,520
about emergency relief.

281
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,920
If so, you should stay calmer.

282
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,760
We should make

283
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,400
a safe and effective rescue plan

284
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,210
according to the specific condition

285
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,210
of the trapped.

286
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,280
But the one buried there

287
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,090
is my sister.

288
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,280
She's at death's door.

289
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,800
How could I be calm?

290
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
How long will it take you

291
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,280
to make this plan?

292
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,330
Could you hurry up?

293
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,760
I know,

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,730
you perform a public service by
rescuing the victims without charge.

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,250
But if you can get my sister

296
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:07,880
out of there,

297
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,490
I'll donate

298
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,240
to your team.

299
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,050
I'll donate as much as you need.

300
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,050
Sir,

301
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,440
whether it's your sister or anyone else,

302
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,530
we'll try our best

303
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,200
to rescue them.

304
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,130
Moreover,

305
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,920
we don't risk our lives

306
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,720
to rescue the victims

307
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,130
in order to collect donations.

308
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:23,920
Wukong.

309
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,640
Yes.

310
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,850
Invite a doctor over

311
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:26,480
to have a look.

312
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,010
Got it.

313
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,480
Hurry.

314
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,130
I've taken some

315
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:41,880
disaster-relief materials for you.

316
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,480
They are all here.

317
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,240
Did you unload all of these?

318
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,570
Miss,

319
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,960
you're really tough.

320
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,720
I admire you.

321
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,480
Thank you for helping the victims.

322
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:58,640
Take a break.

323
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,200
Please check the goods.

324
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,880
OK.

325
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,370
Thanks for your contribution

326
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,130
to Fengxi.

327
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,640
Don't mention it. It's no big deal.

328
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,610
It doesn't matter.

329
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,570
I don't need a break.

330
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,440
I've made up my mind.

331
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
I'll sleep in the truck on our way home.

332
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,090
Do you have any problems driving?

333
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,440
You want to go back now?

334
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,370
Aren't you going back to Linjiang?

335
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,810
Yes, of course,

336
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,850
but not now.

337
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,530
Didn't you say you would go back

338
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,400
after the goods were unloaded?

339
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,130
I didn't say that.

340
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,330
Seriously,

341
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,810
I asked if you would go back.

342
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,440
You said you would definitely.

343
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,570
But I didn't say when.

344
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,880
Wow, you tricked me.

345
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,720
You volunteered to help.

346
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,680
I didn't force you.

347
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,290
Fine.

348
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,130
I volunteered to help.

349
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,770
So, when will you go back?

350
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,810
Can I take a ride?

351
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,440
Of course you can.

352
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,330
But as for when I'll go back,

353
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,920
three days at the least,

354
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,530
at the most, I can't tell.

355
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,090
Now that I'm here,

356
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,090
I'd better do something

357
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,810
before I leave.

358
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,810
Three days?

359
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,770
I don't think so.

360
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,200
I'll be delayed.

361
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,610
If you're in such a hurry,

362
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,640
share a ride with someone else.

363
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,090
I can't promise you anything.

364
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,640
No.

365
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,850
How could I

366
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,850
happen to find a vehicle
heading back to Linjiang?

367
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,570
Your goods have been unloaded.

368
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,200
Why don't you go back with me?

369
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,610
You can do nothing helpful

370
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,640
if you stay here.

371
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
Why... why can't I?

372
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,400
The goods are in place.

373
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,880
Now it's time to fight a hard battle.

374
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:19,920
No,

375
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,880
bro, think about it.

376
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,050
They need hands to save lives.

377
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,720
And,

378
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,010
I can guarantee you,

379
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,960
if you stay here,

380
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,440
not only can you do nothing to help,

381
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,440
you'll also do a disservice.

382
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,090
Do you believe it or not?

383
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,530
I don't believe it.

384
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,960
Then you should try.

385
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,010
I'm sure

386
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,370
you would die to go back

387
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,610
before you could spend a day here.

388
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,810
I will certainly give it a try.

389
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,680
Come on, be careful.

390
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,440
Dongzi, don't be afraid.

391
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,440
Dad is here.

392
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,370
Thanks. Thank you very much.

393
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,400
Thanks. Thank you very much.

394
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,640
Don't be afraid.

395
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
OK, it's all right.

396
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,920
Paper and pen.

397
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,770
Got it.

398
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:11,610
Hurry up.

399
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,770
The location is peculiar.

400
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,880
What's wrong?

401
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,680
(Luo Yuan Headmaster)
Any movement now

402
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,920
may endanger the lives

403
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,290
of the trapped people.

404
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,130
It takes at least three hours

405
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,050
to prop up

406
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,010
the structure over them.

407
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,530
They're both injured.

408
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm afraid...

409
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,720
No.

410
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:42,770
Captain,

411
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,610
my sister is only 26.

412
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,570
She likes kids and dancing.

413
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,530
Her wonderful life

414
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,640
has just begun.

415
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,810
I promised my parents

416
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,330
I would protect her.

417
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,400
I won't let anything happen to her.

418
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:56,640
You...

419
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,290
OK,

420
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,050
if you won't go,

421
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,200
I'll go.

422
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,530
Mr. Luo,

423
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,050
it's dangerous.

424
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:04,480
You can't get in.

425
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,160
Let go of me.

426
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,240
Mr. Luo, calm down.

427
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,610
I can't let Yuan

428
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,330
stay alone in there.

429
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,010
Mr. Luo, calm down!

430
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,130
We need the

431
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,330
professional instruction of a doctor.

432
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,400
Let's wait for the doctor

433
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,240
to tell us what to do.

434
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,050
Maybe it's not

435
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,640
as bad as we think.

436
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,480
Yan,

437
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,290
two victims are trapped there.

438
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,330
Both are injured.

439
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:25,720
We need you to get in and check.

440
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,770
I'm going too.

441
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,720
It's dangerous inside.

442
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,050
You'll add to the disarray for us.

443
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,050
My sister can't talk.

444
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,400
Even if you get in,

445
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,770
you can't communicate with her.

446
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,330
So I must go in there too.

447
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,530
Let him in.

448
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,920
OK.

449
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,640
Xiong Fei, Yan,

450
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,680
Mr. Luo,

451
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,090
you'll get down there.

452
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,160
The building structure below

453
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,090
is very unstable.

454
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,370
Don't act recklessly.

455
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,130
You must follow Xiong Fei's command.

456
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,440
I understand.

457
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,610
For the safety of my sister,

458
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,290
I won't act recklessly.

459
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,400
Yan,

460
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,810
stay safe.

461
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,570
I know.

462
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,610
Stay close to me.

463
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,200
Get ready.

464
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,400
Yes.

465
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,530
Be careful.

466
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,720
Xiong Fei, wait.

467
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,290
OK.

468
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,290
Mr. Luo.

469
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,770
Mr. Luo, are you OK?

470
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:52,400
Mr. Luo.

471
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,240
I'm fine.

472
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,880
Go.

473
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,010
Headmaster.

474
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,610
Headmaster.

475
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,640
How's she?

476
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,160
I'm not worried about
the injuries on her feet.

477
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,610
I'm worried about her spleen.

478
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,720
She needs a surgery as soon as possible.

479
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,330
What should we do?

480
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,640
Is there time?

481
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,640
As long as we get her out quickly.

482
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,090
Headmaster.

483
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,440
Headmaster.

484
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,010
Try not to move from now on.

485
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,200
Maintain your posture.

486
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,200
Save your strength

487
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,330
until you're rescued.

488
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:58,960
Believe me, you'll be fine.

489
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,050
Dr. Zhan,

490
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,610
come and check the headmaster.

491
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,290
OK.

492
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,770
What about my sister?

493
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,770
Stay with her. Don't move.

494
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,370
Dr. Zhan.

495
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,370
It's OK.

496
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,370
Dr. Zhan said

497
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:18,850
you would be all right.

498
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,010
Everything will be fine.

499
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,880
Stay with me, sir.

500
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,090
Sir.

501
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,640
Sir.

502
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,960
Sir, how are you?

503
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:40,880
Miss...

504
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,370
Miss Luo...

505
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,570
She's fine. Don't worry.

506
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,640
I'm relieved, then.

507
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,480
Yuan,

508
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,960
I'll find

509
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,720
the best doctor

510
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,810
to treat you.

511
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,960
Your legs will be fine.

512
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,680
You can still dance.

513
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,480
You can go to

514
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,240
a special school abroad

515
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,160
for further study.

516
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,680
Didn't you always complain that

517
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,920
I meddled too much in your affairs?

518
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,240
As long as you get better,

519
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,640
you can do anything you want.

520
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,090
You can do

521
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,330
anything you like.

522
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,770
I'll support you,

523
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,530
as long as you get better

524
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,440
and are happy.

525
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,400
What do you say?

526
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,160
Yuan.

527
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,880
Yuan.

528
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,770
Dr. Zhan.

529
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,960
Dr. Zhan.

530
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,810
Yuan is coughing blood.

531
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,290
Dr. Zhan.

532
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,370
Yuan.

533
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,960
Yuan.

534
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:05,290
Don't mind me.

535
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,200
Go to check

536
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,920
Miss Luo.

537
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,330
I'll give you a shot
to relieve your pain.

538
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,640
Don't mind me.

539
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,050
Don't waste your time.

540
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,720
I know my condition.

541
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,370
Go to help Miss Luo.

542
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,530
She

543
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,770
was hired by me.

544
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,130
Rest assured.

545
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,370
I will get her out of here.

546
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Keep it steady.

547
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,680
Yuan.

548
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,160
You're fine now.

549
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:08,570
Is she OK?

550
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,640
Come on.

551
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,130
Be careful.

552
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,960
Be careful.

553
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,680
Zhan Yan.

554
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,850
Zhan Yan.

555
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,090
I'll perform the operation.

556
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,640
You assist me.

557
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,010
Yes.

558
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,530
My initial judgment is spleen rupture

559
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,920
and compressive damage of other organs.

560
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,240
The damage degree is uncertain.

561
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,680
We don't have time to prepare.

562
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,010
Her condition doesn't allow it either.

563
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,810
So I hope

564
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,680
you'll do your best.

565
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,330
Yes.

566
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:33,720
Dr. Zhan,

567
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,130
I'll trust you with my sister.

568
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,680
Director Liu,

569
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,920
the Light Chaser Rescue

570
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,370
has finished the search and rescue

571
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,290
at Fengxi Special Education School.

572
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,880
We've safely transferred

573
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
137 teachers and students,

574
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,330
and rescued three trapped
teachers and students.

575
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,960
Unfortunately,

576
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,240
a teacher

577
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,130
died of

578
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,370
severe injuries.

579
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,440
It's still the golden time

580
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,370
for life rescue now.

581
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,200
I know.

582
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,480
Though you're exhausted,

583
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,880
I still have to

584
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,810
assign you a task.

585
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,440
Director Liu,

586
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,090
just tell me what it is.

587
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,200
Now the main force

588
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,290
is in the worst-hit region.

589
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,240
You should give full play

590
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
to your advantage,

591
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,440
and based on
Fengxi Special Education School,

592
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,130
carry out search and rescue around.

593
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,610
800 meters from the school,

594
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,960
there's a farmers' market.

595
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,290
Make it your priority.

596
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,200
OK.

597
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,440
Mission accepted.

598
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,770
You and the team

599
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,850
must stay safe.

600
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,640
Director Liu, rest assured.

601
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,440
We guarantee to fulfill our mission.

602
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,920
Assemble.

603
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,370
Next destination,

604
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,010
Fengxi Farmers' Market.

605
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,090
You go over there.

606
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,330
Keep in touch anytime.

607
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,440
OK. You guys go over there.

608
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,440
(Fengxi Farmers' Market)
You go there.

609
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,240
Follow up.

610
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:55,810
Follow me.

611
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,010
OK.

612
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,240
Be careful.

613
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Watch your step, everyone.

614
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,810
Watch your step.

615
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,370
Go over there. There are victims.

616
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,570
Here's a victim.

617
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,680
Hurry up.

618
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,880
Here's one.

619
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,050
- Be careful.
- Help them out.

620
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,530
Yeah. Help them.

621
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:12,720
Be careful.

622
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,400
I found one too.

623
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,480
Hang in there.

624
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,050
Be careful.

625
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,770
Be careful of the bricks.

626
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,570
Pay attention to his hands.

627
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,960
Be careful.

628
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,770
- Be careful.
- Slow down.

629
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,680
Be careful not to hit him.

630
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,640
Someone help.

631
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,200
Watch out.

632
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,200
Stay with me.

633
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:37,810
Hang in there.

634
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,370
We'll get you out soon, bro.

635
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,290
Stay with me.

636
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,370
Watch out. Watch out.

637
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,570
Watch his arms.

638
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,530
Come on, carry him out.

639
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:53,720
Hurry up.

640
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,290
Carry him out.

641
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,200
Move. Make way.

642
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,610
Fix the fracture.

643
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,850
Move. Move.

644
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,640
Watch out.

645
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Come on, watch his hands.

646
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,200
Dapeng.

647
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:09,610
Dapeng.

648
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,640
Dapeng.

649
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,010
We've got a situation.

650
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,880
Lend us a hand.

651
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,330
Lend us a hand.

652
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:17,880
Come.

653
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,160
Slowly. Be careful.

654
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,770
One, two, three.

655
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,680
Slowly. Slowly.

656
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,050
Where is the puppy from?

657
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,400
Ask who's his owner.

658
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:31,880
OK.

659
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,770
If no one wants it,

660
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,770
I'll take care of it.

661
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,290
OK. I'll give it my box lunch.

662
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:37,530
Come.

663
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,850
Slow down.

664
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:41,400
What's going on?

665
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,960
It shows living signals

666
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,770
of a human.

667
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:44,960
That's not right.

668
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,330
There must be a human.

669
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,130
Probe downwards.

670
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,050
Probe downwards.

671
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,640
Dig.

672
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,200
Anyone there?

673
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,200
Who is it?

674
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,370
What are you doing?

675
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,050
It's you.

676
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,770
What do you think I'm doing?

677
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,720
I'm saving you.

678
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,370
If aftershocks occur,

679
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,010
you'll be buried alive,

680
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:21,720
you know?

681
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,010
You'll be buried alive.

682
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,050
I was looking for my laptop, bro.

683
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,400
I almost managed to reach it.

684
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,010
Thanks to you, I have to
start over again.

685
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,850
Why do I always have bad luck

686
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,200
every time I meet you?

687
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,440
Are you still going inside?

688
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,330
You want to die?

689
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,680
I want my laptop.

690
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Is the laptop more important
than your life?

691
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,050
My laptop is my life,

692
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,720
you know?

693
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,770
All my manuscripts are in there.

694
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,050
They're my brainchild.

695
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,200
Fine, if you...

696
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,240
If you want to die, go ahead.

697
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,960
In case an aftershock occurs,

698
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,680
I won't help you.

699
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,200
How could an earthquake

700
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,240
occur straight after I get inside?

701
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,850
Let's go!

702
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,770
Watch out.

703
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,400
Are you afraid?

704
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:26,880
No.

705
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,160
It seems over.

706
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,090
Continue.

707
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,160
I was so scared.

708
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,330
Are you injured?

709
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:56,920
Roll it up.

710
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,050
Oh, my.

711
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,720
Blood.

712
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,440
You faint at the sight of blood?

713
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,420
(In Operation)

714
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:34,760
Dad.

715
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,240
Mom.

716
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,490
Dad.

717
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:42,930
I want Dad and Mom.

718
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,570
Where are you?

719
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,930
Mr. Luo,

720
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,050
don't worry.

721
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,890
Dr. Zhan will try her best.

722
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,760
Your sister will be fine.

723
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:02,130
By the way,

724
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,570
has the old headmaster

725
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,090
been properly arranged?

726
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,930
Yes. We've taken care of that.

727
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,840
He was

728
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,610
well aware of the situation

729
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,680
and passed away peacefully.

730
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,760
If I could,

731
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,530
I would have done something for him.

732
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,970
But at that time...

733
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,130
I know how you feel.

734
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,160
But we shouldn't

735
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,240
let him down.

736
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,090
Let's accept his kindness.

737
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,720
Have you ever engaged
in earthquake relief before?

738
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,970
I'm just interested in

739
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,160
the relevant knowledge.

740
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,050
How much further is it?

741
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,410
I can hardly walk. I feel dizzy.

742
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,490
You make me feel dizzy.

743
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,930
I'm exhausted helping you all the way.

744
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,800
I just don't understand.

745
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,090
If you faint at the sight of blood,

746
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,800
why do you have to be a volunteer?

747
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,760
You can donate more money.

748
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,450
Why did you come here?

749
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Didn't I get injured

750
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,570
because of you?

751
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:17,680
If you didn't meddle in my affairs,

752
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,890
I would have got back my laptop.

753
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,450
If I got my laptop,

754
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,240
you wouldn't have to get in there,

755
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,410
then you wouldn't have got injured.

756
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,240
If you were not injured,

757
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,410
you wouldn't have been a drag on me.

758
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,530
In the end,

759
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,450
you brought it all on yourself.

760
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,160
Whatever you say,

761
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,130
I was hurt because of you.

762
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
I'll hold you responsible.

763
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,410
You can't leave me alone.

764
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,610
Are you serious?

765
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,130
I'll get you to a doctor

766
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,800
and that's it.

767
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,760
You can't drive like this.

768
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
I'd better find a way out myself

769
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,680
to return to Linjiang.

770
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,890
Hurry.

771
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:51,930
There's a doctor.

772
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,320
Doctor.

773
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,200
Doctor.

774
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,930
Hurry up.

775
00:36:59,200 --> 00:36:59,840
Wait for a minute.

776
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,890
I'll deal with it right away.

777
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,130
Ding Dingding?

778
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,010
Doctor.

779
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,130
Doctor, he's injured.

780
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,760
Would you please dress his wounds?

781
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,530
Dingding,

782
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,890
why are you here?

783
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,160
Uncle, luckily you're here.

784
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,760
Could you please check his leg?

785
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,610
He's seriously injured.

786
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,530
Sit down. Let me check.

787
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,640
Why are you here?

788
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Do you know each other?

789
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,640
Uncle, you know what,

790
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,570
this attorney

791
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
helped an unscrupulous publisher

792
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,130
to cheat me.

793
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,360
I didn't even get

794
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,800
the right of authorship
for my paintings.

795
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,200
We did it according to the contract.

796
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,050
Don't mention your contract.

797
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,240
Excuse me,

798
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,840
could you settle accounts

799
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,490
with each other later?

800
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,640
My blood is almost drained,

801
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,160
guys.

802
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,930
OK.

803
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,490
Uncle, you'd better be careful

804
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:46,280
He fainted at the sight of blood.

805
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:47,720
Put up with it.

806
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,360
I have to
disinfect the wounds with iodine.

807
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:53,090
It hurts. It hurts.

808
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,280
Are you a doctor?

809
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,530
I'm not a doctor.

810
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,720
But the wounds are superficial.

811
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,890
I can handle them.

812
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,890
All right.

813
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,090
Turn round.

814
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,760
No blood again?

815
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,840
No, it's dressed.

816
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,320
You did a good job,

817
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,490
even better than a doctor.

818
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,240
Sir,

819
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,280
what's your team?

820
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,530
I've never seen your uniform.

821
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,090
We're with Light Chaser Rescue.

822
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,130
This is our team uniform.

823
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,680
Cool.

824
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,890
I've admired those people

825
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,970
in uniform since I was young.

826
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,450
Can I join you?

827
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,360
Of course.

828
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:35,640
But you must pass some tests

829
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,490
to join us.

830
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,720
Uncle, forget about it.

831
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,320
Look at him.

832
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,360
He's physically weak,

833
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,450
timid and fearful of blood.

834
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,970
He needs people to save him,
not the other way around.

835
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,280
If you say this again,

836
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,640
I'll sue you for insulting me.

837
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,640
Mr. Attorney,

838
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,720
is there such a crime in the laws?

839
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,490
Article 246 of the Criminal Law,

840
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,360
crime of insult.

841
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,200
Did you hear that?

842
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,610
Uncle, look at him.

843
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,680
This man lacks sincerity.

844
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,570
Even if he passes the tests,

845
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,530
you can't admit him to the team.

846
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,010
That's not your uncle's call.

847
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:59,930
He's the captain, how about that?

848
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,720
Doctor.

849
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,530
How's my sister?

850
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,090
The operation is ongoing.

851
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,610
But the patient needs
a lot of blood transfusions.

852
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,130
We don't have enough in reserve.

853
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,570
Who is blood type A?

854
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,450
I'm type O.
Use mine in case of emergency.

855
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,720
I'm type AB.

856
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,760
Is there type A?

857
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,800
It's better type A.

858
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,490
What's your type?

859
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,160
I...

860
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,130
Are you type A?

861
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,240
Doc, you can use his.

862
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,450
But... but I'm injured.

863
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,800
You won't die of donating blood.

864
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,890
We must save a life.

865
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:29,570
But I have

866
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,610
lost so much blood, I...

867
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,570
Please,

868
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,320
help my sister.

869
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,320
Let me make it clear,

870
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,840
your sister is innocent.

871
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,760
We must save her life first,

872
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,930
but that doesn't mean you're forgiven.

873
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,010
Dingding, enough.

874
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,720
I'll ask the team to donate blood.

875
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,970
OK.

876
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,010
You come with me first.

877
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,720
Hurry up.

878
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,680
Be careful.

879
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,090
Are you awake?

880
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,160
Where am I?

881
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,610
In the field hospital.

882
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,800
You fainted after giving blood.

883
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:08,890
But don't worry.

884
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,970
You were given glucose.

885
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,360
The doctor said you would be fine
when you wake up.

886
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:13,760
Well,

887
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,240
get a good rest for a couple of days.

888
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,010
I have to hurry back to Linjiang.

889

You can't go.

890

891

894
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,570
Nonsense. You asked me to give blood.

895
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,200
You can't go.

896
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,360
Let go.

897
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,970
No.

898
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:31,200
No, you...

899
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:32,490
You can't go.

900
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,050
Fine, I won't go.

Dr. Zhan,

903
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,090
how's my sister?

904
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,130
She's out of danger.

905
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,450
Thanks.

906
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,010
Thank you.

907
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,130
If you really want to thank someone,

908
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,530
do something for the

909
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,360
disaster area.

910
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:21,160
Before he died,

911
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,530
the old headmaster was
still worrying about

912
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,570
Miss Luo and the children.

913
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,160
OK.

914
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:25,720
OK

915
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:28,840
Thanks.

916
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,010
Back then,

917
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,680
the old headmaster

918
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
had put so much effort

919
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,010
to build

920
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,840
the hope primary school.

921
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:05,890
But now,

922
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:07,930
it's collapsed.

923
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,490
Our children will have to

924
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:13,490
walk a long way to go to school again.

925
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,450
Chief,

926
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,010
here.

927
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:26,570
This...

928
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,530
This is a token of my regard.

929
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,720
I hope

930
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,970
the old headmaster can rest in peace.

931
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,200
I believe

932
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,610
he must have wished

933
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,970
the school would be rebuilt soon.
