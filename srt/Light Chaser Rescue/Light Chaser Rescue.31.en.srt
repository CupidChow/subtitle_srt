17
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,250
Come in.

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,050
What's up?

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:10,970
Sir,

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,330
I want to talk to you

21
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,160
about going to Fengqi.

22
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,690
The trauma has healed

23
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,440
and postoperative recovery
is going well.

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Mr. Zhan,

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,130
after a few more days of observation,

26
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,410
you can leave the hospital

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,650
OK.

28
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,370
Why didn't Dr. Zhan go the rounds?

29
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,040
She has other work.

30
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,760
Why don't you have a rest?

31
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,650
Zhan Yan will

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
probably go to Fengqi.

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,210
Honestly, we don't want her to leave.

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,810
Go to Fengqi?

35
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,250
I see.

36
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,130
Now that you've decided,

37
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,090
I respect your choice.

38
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,600
I'll explain to him for you.

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,810
I'm sure he'll understand.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Thank you, sir.

41
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,930
I was looking for you.

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
Are you still leaving?

43
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,320
Your father said everything in vain.

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,370
Do you really

45
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,440
not love him at all?

46
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,760
Are you so anxious

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,410
to start your career in Fengqi?

48
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,720
He has just undergone

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,650
a surgery, Zhan Yan.

50
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,600
You don't have to care about me.

51
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,880
But he's your father,

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,810
and you've lost the

53
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,930
father-daughter affection for 10 years.

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,040
How much more time

55
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,650
can you afford to lose?

56
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,440
I won't lose it again.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,130
What did you say?

58
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,370
I said I wouldn't go.

59
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,530
I told the president,

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,530
and he'll explain to

61
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,320
Professor Coben for me.

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,810
Do you mean it?

63
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,490
What's the benefit to lie to you?

64
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,440
Then tell me,

65
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,760
did you make this decision

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,410
because of Captain or me?

67
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,490
Does it matter?

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,250
Yes.

69
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,210
Because I have to know

70
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,160
if you ever thought about me

71
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,370
when you made this decision.

72
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,130
So, you're not satisfied

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,440
with the answer, are you?

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,490
Forget it.

75
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,600
You don't have to tell me.

76
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,410
If Captain wasn't ill,

77
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,530
you would probably

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,130
be in Fengqi now.

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,610
Why do you laugh?

80
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:28,760
I laugh because

81
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,290
you're cute.

82
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,560
You advertised
the love between grown-ups,

83
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,930
but what's the difference

84
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,200
between you and a little boy?

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,640
You're being jealous for no reason.

86
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,880
Why do you say so?

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
I'm not jealous.

88
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,130
Don't be nervous. It's just a dinner.

89
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,530
Kiss me.

90
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,930
I won't be nervous if you kiss me.

91
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:08,640
Come.

92
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,730
Where is your room?

93
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,000
Upstairs.

94
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
Mingming.

95
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:24,490
Mom.

96
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,080
Dingding comes to visit you, Mom.

97
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,490
Hello, Aunt.

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,370
I don't remember

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,960
having invited her.

100
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,200
Mom, you forgot.

101
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,370
I told you.

102
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,810
Dingding knows it's your birthday.

103
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
She comes here specially
to celebrate with you.

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
She bought you a gift.

105
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,610
Aunt,

106
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,400
I don't know what you like.

107
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,170
So I chose this

108
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,260
Beauty Oral Liquids.

109
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,170
I hear it has
excellent anti-wrinkle effects.

110
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,290
Anti-wrinkle?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,250
Am I that old?

112
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,250
No.

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:57,880
You know what,

114
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,640
this health care product is expensive.

115
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,290
I'm not even willing to
buy it for my mom.

116
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,560
My mom doesn't want you
to spend money recklessly.

117
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,810
You don't have to do this next time.

118
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,960
I'll make it up to you.

119
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,170
You promise.

120
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,810
What are you doing?

121
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,880
Do I have to invite you?

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,520
Coming. Coming.

123
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,850
Mom, sit.

124
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,960
Mom,

125
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,170
you and Dinding

126
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,760
don't know each other well.

127
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,760
She'll come often in the future.

128
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,250
Then she'll know what you like.

129
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,440
Not everyone

130
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,320
is welcome to get in our house.

131
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,440
Dingding, sit.

132
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,250
Sit down.

133
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,170
Ma'am, Mingming.

134
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,700
Aiqi, you're here.

135
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,990
I told you to call me Aunt

136
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,370
away from work.

137
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,130
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm late due to the heavy traffic.

139
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,690
Happy birthday.

140
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,760
You know me well.

141
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,640
Yes.

142
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,050
A woman in her fifties

143
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,960
needs to preserve herself well.

144
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,930
Come.

145
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,080
Sit down.

146
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,520
The same things have different fates.

147
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,930
Let me make a toast.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,200
Today,

149
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,370
Dingding and Aiqi both are here.

150
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,560
Together, let's wish

151
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,170
Ma Ruifen

152
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,130
a happy birthday!

153
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,080
Cheers!

154
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,490
Aunt, happy birthday!

155
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,690
Thanks.

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,050
Have some food.

157
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,400
OK.

158
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:29,520
Dingding.

159
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,610
This is our cook's...

160
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,610
Mingming.

161
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,760
Mom.

162
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,520
Here you are.

163
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,560
This is your favorite

164
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,290
sour and sweet flavor.

165
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,370
It's your birthday. Have some more.

166
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,000
You must be happy.

167
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,170
If you can find

168
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,200
a satisfactory girlfriend,

169
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,610
Mom will be happier.

170
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,490
Aunt,

171
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,810
I'm not very good at choosing gifts.

172
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,370
No offence.

173
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,370
I come here today

174
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,490
to sincerely congratulate you.

175
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,560
Happy birthday!

176
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,880
Thanks.

177
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,000
Dingding,

178
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:21,960
why did you drink it all?

179
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,730
You know you're not good at drinking.

180
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,290
Mingming,

181
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,170
let her drink if she wants.

182
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,810
Aiqi.

183
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,250
Have some more food.

184
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,320
Have some food.

185
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,520
Don't drink too much.

186
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,610
It's OK. I can help myself.

187
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,250
This is our cook's

188
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,680
specialty. Try it.

189
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,400
Mingming, eat your food.

190
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,370
I... I'm eating, Mom.

191
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,160
Dingding, don't drink so much.

192
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,160
Don't mind me.

193
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,640
Get off.

194
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,330
Cheers.

195
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,250
OK.

196
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,920
Dingding, stop.

197
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,570
Dingding.

198
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,330
Dingding.

199
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,760
Mom, why are you doing this?

200
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,160
Dingding.

201
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,210
She doesn't have any manners.

202
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,210
Are you OK, Dingding?

203
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,730
Dingding.

204
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,090
Dingding.

205
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,210
Why did you drink so quickly?

206
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,800
Why would you play tough?

207
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,850
Do you feel better?

208
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,850
I won't.

209
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,280
Your mom is such a bully.

210
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,730
Tell me why

211
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,090
the same gifts

212
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,250
brought different treatment?

213
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,570
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,090
I never thought my mom would do that.

215
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,730
I don't think

216
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,250
I should have come today.

217
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,280
I made her upset.

218
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,800
Now I feel bad too.

219
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,570
Dingding,

220
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,730
it isn't your fault. I invited you over.

221
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,450
Why do I feel it's so difficult?

222
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,210
Dingding,

223
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,970
you've done very well.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Just leave

225
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,210
the rest to me.

226
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,250
It's completely new.

227
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,570
I can't even recognize my room.

228
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,520
Luo Ben,

229
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,970
thanks.

230
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,040
Someone did the good job.

231
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
I dare not steal the credit.

232
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,760
You just had a surgery

233
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,090
and your scapula is injured.

234
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,680
You need a good rest.

235
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,490
The original bed board is too hard.

236
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,680
I bought you a mattress.

237
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,490
You shouldn't have bothered.

238
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,850
I was used to that bed.

239
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,090
It's different.

240
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,000
Come on. Try it.

241
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,570
Here.

242
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,450
How do you feel?

243
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,040
Is it comfy?

244
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,920
Good.

245
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,250
Dr. Zhan is really

246
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,920
meticulous to her patients.

247
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,450
Her thoughts are all on her work.

248
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,280
I think I should

249
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,520
give Dr. Zhan a silk banner

250
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,490
on behalf of our team.

251
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
OK.

252
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,920
I must hang it in my office.

253
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:21,760
Dr. Zhan,

254
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,450
you really don't blush.

255
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,570
I'll have a reckoning

256
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,040
with you later.

257
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,250
Alright.

258
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:36,680
OK.

259
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,730
Now the room is completely new,

260
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,880
but it lacks

261
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:43,000
a little cooking oil smells.

262
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,450
There's no food at all.

263
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,640
You know what,

264
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,570
I'll go out and get some food.

265
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,760
Have a good talk with her.

266
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,570
I'm going out.

267
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,160
Yan, take a break.

268
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,970
I can tidy up on my own.

269
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,570
Just have a rest.

270
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:11,880
You just had a surgery.

271
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,250
These days,

272
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,130
be careful when you

273
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,330
get up or turn over.

274
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,610
Don't stretch the wound.

275
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,570
I'm gonna cook porridge for you.

276
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,570
OK, I'll listen to you.

277
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,090
This is the medical advice.

278
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:46,970
There are medication instructions

279
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,280
and other dos and don'ts.

280
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,730
Recently,

281
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,490
you should take more rest.

282
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
Get out of bed less and exercise less.

283
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,520
OK.

284
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,210
I have to leave for work.

285
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,880
Let me walk you out.

286
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,800
I told you not to get out of bed.

287
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,250
OK. I'll listen to you.

288
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,850
I gotta go, Dad.

289
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,130
Thanks.

290
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,820
I did it for Captain,

291
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,800
not for you.

292
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,850
Do you have to talk like that?

293
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,920
Like what?

294
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,920
Alright.

295
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
What?

296
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,040
Reckoning!

297
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,640
Didn't you say

298
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,400
you would have a reckoning

299
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,970
with me?

300
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,570
I haven't decided yet.

301
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,450
Then take me to the hospital.

302
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,800
Too bad. I'm going to the law firm.

303
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,850
It's out of my way.

304
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,000
Narrow-minded.

305
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,880
Am I narrow-minded?

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,850
Or what?

309
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,760
(Mind Reading in Relationship)
Dr. Zhan, cut me some slack.

310
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,640
I helped you not long ago.

311
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,760
Luo Ben and I should take the credit

312
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,210
for your reconciliation with Mr. Zhan.

313
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,450
Luckily, it was my dad.

314
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,330
If he were someone else,

315
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,680
he would have been scared to death.

316
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,280
He wouldn't.

317
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,610
Luo Ben said,

318
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,370
in rescue work,

319
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,490
Mr. Zhan used to see
death and separation.

320
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,250
He must have great resilience.

321
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,970
Why do you believe whatever he says?

322
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,800
Of course.

323
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,920
I've seen everything

324
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,250
he has done for you.

325
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
I tell you what,

326
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,330
relationship is a

327
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,730
two-way thing.

328
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:46,800
No one will always

329
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,130
sacrifice unilaterally.

330
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,490
You should be active.

331
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,280
Don't wait till you lose him
to regret it.

332
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,570
Did you recite the lines in the book?

333
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,400
It's confiscated.

334
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,370

350
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:13,960
Come up!

351
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,640
Come!

352
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,240
Is my blood pressure normal?

353
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,850
It's OK at the moment.

354
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:33,850
I'm not allowed

355
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,810
to go anywhere,

356
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
and kept in the room all day long.

357
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,640
Without my permission,

358
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,920
you can't participate in rescue.

359
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,680
OK. OK.

360
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,010
I'll listen to you.

361
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,370
I won't participate in rescue.

362
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,680
When I was busy working,

363
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,050
I couldn't spare time.

364
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Now I'm having a rest,

365
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,640
I may as well do something.

366
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,090
What do you want to do?

367
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,570
Yan,

368
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,130
the child I mentioned

369
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,720
to you before,

370
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,010
the child I saved

371
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,640
in the earthquake,

372
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,370
do you still remember him?

373
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
I read that report.

374
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,010
Only by finding him,

375
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,050
telling him the truth,

376
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,400
and being forgiven by him,

377
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,090
could I be completely

378
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,720
over this thing.

379
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,880
So have you been looking for him?

380
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,240
Yes.

381
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,160
At the earthquake site,

382
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,720
I gave the child

383
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,440
to the medical workers.

384
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,050
Later I learned that
he was sent to the orphanage.

385
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,480
People in the orphanage said

386
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,850
he was adopted.

387
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,800
But the foster family

388
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,960
didn't want to be disturbed.

389
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,290
Then I lost his trail.

390
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,810
I've been to the newspapers,
presses,

391
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,920
but the information

392
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,720
wasn't well preserved.

393
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,960
So I haven't found

394
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,720
anything useful.

395
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,920
The network is developed now.

396
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:09,130
Don't worry. We'll find him.

397
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,330
Leave it to me.

398
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,160
I haven't cooked noodles
for a long time.

399
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,160
I don't think it tastes good.

400
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,050
It looks tasty.

401
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,960
Let me try.

402
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,160
It's good.

403
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,240
Shall I order

404
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,640
a takeout for you?

405
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,920
I don't need a takeout.

406
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,920
It's good.

407
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,010
It's really tasty.

408
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,610
It doesn't matter
whether it tastes good or not.

409
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,130
The point is,

410
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,010
it's cooked

411
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,130
by my daughter personally.

412
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240

OK, wait for a minute.

419
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,770
do you want to see Luo Ben?

420

But I have to work overtime tonight.

432
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,370
Come on.

433
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,050
What case do you have

434
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,010
that must be handled tonight?

435
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,720
It's rare that Zhan Yan comes here.

Why don't we have dinner together?

437

Don't kick up a fuss.

Since you're so rude to me,

439
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,850
I won't hide it for you.

Mr. Luo and Dr. Zhan

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,240
are getting married soon.

445
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,680
Really?

446
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Prove...

447
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,610
I have proof.

448
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,090
Mr. Luo is handsome.

449
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,090
Gao Junchi,

450
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,480
you're getting more and more annoying.

451
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,290
Sorry for that.

452
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,720
Such important evidence

453
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,640
is not only in my phone,

454
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,920
but also reserved in my net disk.

455
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:45,720
I suggest

456
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,960
Mr. Luo treats us!

457
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,680
Yes!

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,920

to work overtime, you hear me?

462
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,610
It's OK.
I'll treat you to midnight snacks.

463
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,130
Tonight, you can work overtime

464
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,640
as well as have midnight snacks.

465

What are you suggesting?

512
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,090
You should buy me a takeout
as punishment.

Let's not eat takeout.

do you understand?

Love your work,
but love your life more.

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,330
lecture him when I get a chance.

523
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,610
You were active enough,

524
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,290
he should give himself an out.

525
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,720
But no.

526
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,010
He went further and further.

527
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,920
Isn't he afraid that

528
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,130
he can't wind it up?

529
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,610
Anyhow, you don't have a chance

530
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,330
to lecture him today.

531
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,530
They have a meeting.

532
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,880
You heard it too.

533
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,090
I don't care.

534
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,530
You're free today.

535
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,440
And I'm not on duty.

536
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,050
We must go out and relax.

537
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,290
Where are we going?

538
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,810
Let's go

539
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:07,680
somewhere romantic.

540
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,860
(Mountain Spot)

541
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,010
Great!

542
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,290
Go on the stage and sing a song.

543
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,920
Me?

544
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,720
Forget it.

545
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,680
You're too gauche.

546
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,370
We work hard when we're at work,

547
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,330
and we enjoy ourselves
when we're off work.

548
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,010
I'm going to the bathroom.

549
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,640
Cheers.

550
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,480
I tell you what,

551
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,880
a woman is like a deer,

552
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,680
and a man is like a hunter.

553
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,010
The harder the hunter chases,
the faster the deer runs.

554
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,090
When the hunter gets tired

555
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:06,960
and stops,

556
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,640
the deer will also stop

557
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,090
and look back at him.

558
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,810
So, the more

559
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,090
you like a woman,

560
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,920
the more space you should give her.

561
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,160
You should pull on the rope on her.

562
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,640
Sometimes,

563
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,160
you hold the rope tight;

564
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:21,720
sometimes you loose it a little.

565
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,400
When you have to yank,

566
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,010
yank it a bit.

567
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,530
You mean

568
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,240
I'm the hunter

569
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,680
and Zhan Yan is the deer?

570
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,440
Yeah.

571
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,960
You're finally enlightened.

572
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,810
So when she asked you out tonight,

573
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,570
you were right to turn her down.

574
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,770
Just hang her out to dry.

575
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,200
It's called playing cat and mouse.

576
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,200
Don't worry that the deer will run.

577
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,160
As long as the hunter wants...

578
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,480
Anytime...

579
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,720
Zhan... Zhan Yan.

580
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,770
Zhan Yan?

581
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,370
I didn't expect you

582
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,680
to have the meeting at

583
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,050
such a romantic place.

584
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,640
I just come out with Mr. Gao

585
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,680
to relax a little.

586
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,810
Proceed.

587
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,850
Zhan Yan. Zhan...

588
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:38,570
Zhan Yan.

589
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,920
Zhan Yan.

590
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:43,770
Zhan Yan.

591
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,810
Stop, Hunter.

592
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,240
There's no deer here.

593
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,240
You're chasing the wrong target.

594
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,610
Gao Junchi was driveling.

595
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,530
We were just joking.

596
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,570
Don't take it seriously.

597
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,130
I didn't take it seriously.

598
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
But you did lie to me.

599
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,050
You said you would have a meeting.

600
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,640
But you're here to relax.

601
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
So,

602
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,720
that's how you play cat and mouse.

603
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,330
I made a mistake.

604
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,290
How could you?

605
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,610
It was obviously my mistake,

606
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,640
because I didn't apologize sincerely.

607
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,200
It was my fault.

608
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,240
Zhan Yan.

609
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:17,920
Zhan Yan.

610
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,960
Zhan Yan.

611
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,680
Zhan Yan.

612
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Listen to me.

613
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
I'm really wrong this time.

614
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm too petty.

615
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,200
I...

616
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,850
It rankles me that you decided to

617
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,090
go to Fengqi without telling me.

618
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,330
But that's because

619
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,290
I love you.

620
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,030
I care about

621
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,770
my place in your heart

622
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,240
and I want to prove that.

623
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,200
I ignored you also because...

624
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,640
Anyway, Zhan Yan,

625
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,710
every time

626
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,140
I turn you down,

627
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,570
I regret it so much.

628
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,840
I can't wait to see you

629
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,640
at the next moment. I...

It's a shame.

May I take this seat?

656
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,010
Sure. Please.

657
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,880
Would you like a drink?

658
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:47,810
OK.

659
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,370
Your song is beautiful.

660
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,810
The song you just sang

661
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,330
was the best of all the versions

662
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,330
I've ever heard.

663
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,160
Thanks.

664
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:01,810
To you.

665
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,720
Are you a bar singer here?

666
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,440
Am I really that professional?

667
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,570
Shen...

668
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,400
Shen Ruoxi.

669
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,290
Morning.

670
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,920
Luo Ben.

671
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,050
Morning, Gao.

672
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,440
Was it all right last night？

673
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
You wanna laugh at me?

674
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,240
I'm sorry to let you down.

675
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
I'm worried about you.

676
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,610
But since you're radiant with happiness,

677
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:50,130
my concern is misplaced.

678
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,530
Last night, you and Shen Ruoxi...

679
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,880
Here's the elevator.

680
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,530
(Recently,)

681
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,370
(continuous and severe downpours
in Linjiang)

682
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,680
(have affected thousands of civilians.)

683
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,200
(Officers and soldiers
of the People's Armed Police,)

684
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,130
(firefighters,)

685
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:08,160
(and non-governmental
rescue organizations)

686
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,850
(have stepped forward
to fight the rainstorm.)

687
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,290
(The rescue is still in progress.)

688
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,010
Here.

689
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,940
(Light Chaser Rescue)

690
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,640
Move the tree first.

691
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,800
Thank you.

692
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,610
OK.

693
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,720
One, two, go.

694
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,570
One, two, go.

695
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,450
One, two, go.

696
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,720
Put it down.

697
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,010
Sir,

698
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,610
would you please move the van?

699
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,970
OK.

700
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,450
Let's push the van.

701
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,240
OK.

702
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,570
Go.

703
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,720
One, two, push.

704
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
One, two, push.

705
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,570
One, two, push.

706
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,010
Sir, move aside.

707
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,240
Bro. Bro.

708
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,010
You know,

709
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,890
I was

710
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,570
tricked into a pyramid scheme.

711
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,680
I cheated all my relatives

712
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,320
and friends out of money.

713
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,720
I just got away from it.

714
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:58,640
I'm too ashamed to go back
before I pay back the money.

715
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,240
I intended to

716
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,280
find a job

717
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,640
in Linjiang.

718
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Why didn't you

719
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,410
come to see me?

720
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,450
I ended up sleeping on the street.

721
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,800
How much better could you do?

722
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,760
Light Chaser Rescue.

723
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,530
What's that?

724
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:31,320
A civilian rescue team. Non-profit.

725
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,840
You have such a big heart.

726
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,930
I can't even feed myself.

727
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,720
Forget it.

728
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,530
Qiangzi,

729
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,450
what's your plan for the future?

730
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,010
You can't sleep on the street.

731
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,680
I'll keep looking for a job.

732
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,450
I'll definitely pay back

733
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,490
all the money.

734
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,720
OK.

735
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,200
Gotta go.

736
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:13,800
Thanks for your noodles.

737
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,610
Qiangzi,

738
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,890
I didn't find any good job.

739
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,050
I own a food truck

740
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,200
and sell wontons.

741
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,240
It's small,

742
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,930
but the business is OK.

743
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,570
Before you find a job,

744
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,200
you can lend me a hand.

745
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,840
Why are you crying?

746
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,450
I'm not crying.

747
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,800
The noodles were spicy.

748
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,010
Don't complain about the small salary.

749
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,760
I've placed the third order.

750
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,130
But no one took my orders.

751
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
We can never get a taxi at rush hour.

752
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,410
- Dr. Zhan.
- Dr. Zhan.

753
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,490
Are you calling a taxi?

754
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,490
I can't get one.

755
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,280
The taxis are busy at rush hour.

756
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,800
No one took my orders.

757
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:10,610
By the way, what will you take?

758
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,610
Why do you come?

759
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,930
Who else would come except me?

760
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,090
Hop in.

761
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,160
Gotta go.

762
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,160
Bye, Dr. Zhan.

763
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:22,930
Bye.

764
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:23,970
Bye.

765
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:24,890
He's so cute.

766
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,010
He's Dr. Zhan's

767
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,280
boyfriend. Isn't he cute?

768
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,160
Turn the temperature up.

769
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,560
(Temperature turned up.)

770
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,240
Say,

771
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,800
as your boyfriend,

772
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,320
did I do well?

773
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,130
Not bad.

774
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,840
Why hasn't the taxi arrived yet?

775
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,890
You know what,

776
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,010
light,

777
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,970
cooking oil smells,

778
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,160
tasty meals,

779
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,160
and cheerful voices of the family

780
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,840
are all I've been longing for in life.

781
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,280
Is the life you've been longing for

782
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,640
so simple?

783
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,280
After my mom died,

784
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,610
I thought I could no longer
own that life.

785
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,570
But now I've found it again.

786
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,530
Silly,

787
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:45,570
as long as you have me,

788
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,890
you own a home.

789
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,410
Here.

790
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,570
Hot! Luckily you didn't eat it.

791
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,160
How do you feel?

792
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,360
Are you full?

793
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,570
Sure. I had two and a half bowls.

794
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,450
I live in the front,

795
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,890
with my parents.

796
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,130
I assume they've fallen asleep now.

797
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:19,760
I'd better not invite you in.

798
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:20,680
No, no.

799
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,450
I don't want to
disturb your parents' sleep.

800
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,090
This is the food truck

801
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,050
I told you.

802
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,010
This one?

803
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,010
Take the money.

804
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,090
Make do in a hotel

805
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,200
tonight.

806
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,890
We'll find you a place tomorrow.

807
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,240
No.

808
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,200
The truck is good enough.

809
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,720
I can sleep here, can't I?

810
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,240
It's uncomfortable to sleep here.

811
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:44,610
The space is narrow inside.

812
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,200
It's much better than on the street.

813
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,090
It's nice. It's so big.

814
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,410
It'll keep out wind and rain.

815
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,680
I'll sleep here.

816
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,200
Mom, Dad.

817
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:57,930
Yuan.

818
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,760
You're back.

819
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,200
It's raining outside.

820
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,320
Did you get wet?

821
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,090
It's OK.

822
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,930
Have you caught a cold?

823
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,160
Don't worry.

824
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,760
I'll cook you some hot noodles.

825
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,890
Do I have any share
in the midnight snack?

826
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:15,530
The football match

827
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,800
is about to start.

828
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,450
We can have a drink.

829
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,640
You want to drink?

830
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,010
I'll cook you some dishes.

831
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:22,490
Thanks, Mom.

832
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,490
Welcome.

833
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,640
Be careful.

834
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Thanks, Yuan.

835
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,160
Son,

836
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,240
you don't have to thank your family.

837
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,760
You were busy working outside.

838
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,200
Isn't that normal to have a hot meal

839
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,130
and take a hot shower

840
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,720
after you get home?

841
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,800
Don't stand there.

842
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,530
Go take a shower and get changed.

843
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,280
The midnight snack is ready soon.

844
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:47,160
