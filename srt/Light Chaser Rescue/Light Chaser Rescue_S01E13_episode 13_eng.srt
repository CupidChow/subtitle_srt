1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,050

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,710
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,080
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,910
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,330
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:35,380
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,130
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,480
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,230
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,580
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,530
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,230
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:08,730
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:15,480
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:22,110
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,360
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,530
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,080

19
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,940

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,880
As we breathe,

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,330
the oxygen...

22
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,650
the oxygen density will decrease.

23
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,770
The carbon dioxide density will increase.

24
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,170
When the density of carbon dioxide in the air is higher than 4%,

25
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,260
and the oxygen density is below 17%,

26
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,090
the human body will suffer from hypoxia poisoning,

27
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,680
causing pulmonary edema, brain swelling,

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,920
electrolyte disturbance, shock,

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,610
or even brain death.

30
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,560
Dr. Zhan,

31
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,150
your passive attitude has a bad influence on me,

32
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,360
and makes me terrified.

33
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,660
I'm trying to make myself

34
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,980
breathe smoothly.

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,100
Then, what should I say?

36
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,370
You should believe people outside

37
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,720
are trying to rescue us out of here.

38
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,400
Don't you think there is no sound of rescuing at all?

39
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,310
It means the mud layer is too thick.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,450
We may not survive to the time when they rescue us.

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,060
Then should we talk about something else?

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,040
If we die here,

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,090
then before we die,

44
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,890
can we know more about each other?

45
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,490
If we are rescued,

46
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,890
maybe we'll be close friends.

47
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,260
So you want to exchange some secrets with me?

48
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,290
Actually,

49
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,450
this is not the first time for me to be trapped in such circumstances.

50
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,570
I survived an earthquake.

51
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:13,880
My parents died in the earthquake in Qingsen County 25 years ago.

52
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,420
Do you remember that training?

53
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,240
It's not I didn't want to listen to the order.

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,630
But that circumstance reminded me of my parents.

55
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,460
No wonder you treat Luo Yuan so well.

56
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,050
It's not because of the earthquake.

57
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,540
Luo Yuan and I are not biological sister and brother.

58
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,460
I was adopted by Luo Yuan's parents.

59
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:55,490
Before they adopted me, I stayed at Heart-to-heart Welfare Center.

60
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,340
That's where Lele is staying.

61
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,080
Then, my foster parents died.

62
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,000
Taking care of Luo Yuan

63
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,630
has become the biggest driving force in my life.

64
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,780
So you work so hard for her.

65
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,850
I won't allow myself to rest.

66
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,340
Because I'm the one who made Luo Yuan like she is.

67
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,610
 Yuan Yuan.

68
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,540
 Yuan, what's wrong?

69
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,000
 Sorry, it's all my fault.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,340
 Just hit me.

71
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,990
Then,

72
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,930
I worked hard and earned a lot of money.

73
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,440
I promised to let Yuan Yuan to live the happiest life.

74
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,880
I remember one time,

75
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,660
Yuan Yuan was sick and needed to have an operation.

76
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,660
I couldn't even pay the medical fee of 50,000 yuan.

77
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,370
Do you know?

78
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,710
The feeling I had at that time,

79
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,730
was more asphyxial than being buried here like this.

80
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,800
So after that, I never handled legal aid cases again.

81
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,680
I specialized in business and divorce cases.

82
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,020
I really envy Luo Yuan,

83
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,540
for having such a good brother.

84
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,290
We have no parents. Why do you envy her?

85
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,170
Because I have nothing.

86
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,630
Sorry.

87
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,930
You don't need to apologize.

88
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,310
I'm used to it.

89
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,410
When I was five years old, my mom died.

90
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,820
You may not believe it.

91
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,080
She also died in the earthquake in Qingsen County.

92
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,340
So I'm also a victim of that earthquake.

93
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,230
We're close to the target.

94
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,820
- Stop the heavy machinery! 
  -  Come on.

95
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,880
- Use a rescue shovel! 
 - Yes, sir.

96
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,180
Stop the heavy machinery. Use a rescue shovel.

97
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,620
- Follow me. 
 - Hurry up!

98
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,120
Come on.

99
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,450
Once, a patient complained about me...

100
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,765
and said I had a bad attitude,

101
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:39,890
so I must have grown up in an environment without love.

102
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,380
I was so angry and argued with him.

103
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,740
Then I thought, he was right.

104
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,930
 Smile.

105
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,370
 Smile. Good.

106
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:02,430
 One, two, three.

107
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,550
 Mommy.

108
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,490
 Yan, good girl. I'm checking out.

109
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,280
 Hello, please wait. Our staff is checking the room.

110
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,700
What happened next?

111
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,980
There was an earthquake.

112
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,130
And my mom died.

113
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,810
 Mom!

114
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:44,350
In fact, childhood memories are fragmentary.

115
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,380
I just remembered, at that time,

116
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,480
my dad took the little camel my mom bought for me to the settlements.

117
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:00,490
But my mom didn't return with him.

118
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,270
So I thought,

119
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,130
she died in that earthquake.

120
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,890
Then my father set up a non-governmental welfare rescue organization,

121
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,280
and is determined to do public welfare rescue.

122
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,530
So...

123
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,980
your dad...

124
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,140
your dad is...

125
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,860
His full name is Zhan Qingshan.

126
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,730
Then,

127
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,760
what happened between you two?

128
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,440
When I was in middle school...

129
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,200

130
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,430
 You said, when you saw my mom, she had already died. Right?

131
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,720
 - Liar. 
 - Yan...

132
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,170
 - Why didn't you rescue mom first? 
 - I did.

133
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,720
 Then, why didn't she survive?

134
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,700
 Why did the report say you rescued the boy first?

135
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,480
 Why did I lose my mom,

136
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,380
 and you became a hero with no guilt at all?

137
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,170
At that time, I knew,

138
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,710
my dad had time to rescue my mom first.

139
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,930
But he chose to rescue others.

140
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,690
My mom had no opportunity

141
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,220
to give me that camel in person.

142
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,650
I think...

143
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:52,900
Captain Qingshan must have some reasons that he can't say.

144
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,120
Maybe.

145
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:06,230
After all, I'm also a member of International Medical Rescue now.

146
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,030
I know, in such large catastrophes,

147
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,550
we need to make many decisions that we don't want to.

148
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,780
So what?

149
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,070
For me, that's my mom.

150
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,660
My mom is gone.

151
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,520
Stop! Stop!

152
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,990
Captain Qingshan.

153
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,740
Director Liu, he has something urgent to tell you.

154
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,100
Come on.

155
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,550
Stop for a while. Stop for a while!

156
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,800

157
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,760
 We just got a new assessment.

158
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,788
 The soil layer is sinking.

159
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,890
 There is a danger of collapse, so I had to ask you to stop.

160
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,300
 And according to time, there isn't much oxygen left.

161
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,280
 We just received a forecast from the meteorological department.

162
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,440
 There will be heavy rain soon.

163
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,120
Qingshan, there isn't much time left for us.

164
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,090
According to your experience, what's your judgment?

165
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,370
According to the rain, landslides, and debris flows may occur at any time.

166
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,880
It's dangerous.

167
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,110
Director Liu, evacuate with them.

168
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,560
I'll stay.

169
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,310
 - No, Captain. 
 - We won't leave.

170
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,740
I can't leave!

171
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,630
 Director Liu.

172
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,940
I'm not a captain now, nor a rescue team member.

173
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,420
I'm just a father.

174
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,640
The one buried down there is my daughter.

175
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,100
Dr. Zhan is Captain Qingshan's daughter?

176
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,380
I can't breathe.

177
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,850
Me, too.

178
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,400
Trust me.

179
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,820
When we were little,

180
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,000
we survived the earthquake.

181
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,230
We can surely make it this time.

182
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,850
Trust me.

183
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,530
Okay.

184
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,160
Make a wish.

185
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,350
After we are rescued,

186
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,380
I'll fulfill it for you.

187
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,880
I want to eat...

188
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,690
a bowl of hot rice with vegetables.

189
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:44,160
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

190
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,420
Hot rice with vegetables?

191
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,390
Okay.

192
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,130
Maybe you don't know it.

193
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,370
My cooking skill is top-notch.

194
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,950
When we are rescued,

195
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,740
I'll make it for you.

196
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,320
And you?

197
00:18:21,662 --> 00:18:30,400
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

198
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,600
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

199
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:45,380
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

200
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:52,940
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

201
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,600
Open! It's open!

202
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,200
 - Qingshan!  
 - They'll be fine.

203
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,440
 Be careful. Everyone, observe the scene.

204
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,790
 Be careful.

205
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,590
 Prepare to coordinate with Qingshan.

206
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,600
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

207
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,390
It's open?

208
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:30,490
♫  I hope the wind can blow through the lane  ♫

209
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,580
♫  And rest in your arms  ♫

210
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:45,440
♫  The one who loves you and you love 
 will always be with you  ♫

211
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,960
♫  It's a stable place for you when turning back  ♫

212
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,660
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

213
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,520
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

214
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,200
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

215
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,900
 With a fiery gaze  ♫

216
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,560
♫  I can't fly  ♫

217
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,020
Nice!

218
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,200
They did it!

219
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,390
Dingding doesn't know this. I'll tell her now.

220
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,260
Great!

221
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:28,300

222
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,430
Luo Ben.

223
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,390
You haven't recovered yet. Why did you come out?

224
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:11,810
Is Zhan Yan in this room?

225
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,220
You're here to see Zhan Yan?

226
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,290
Not bad, man.

227
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,280
I heard you went to the basement to save Zhan Yan.

228
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,750
What were you thinking? Weren't you afraid of being buried there?

229
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
Zhan Yan! You-You woke up?

230
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,890
I-I'll find someone to fix it.

231
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,190
The curtain dropped.

232
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,130
Are-Are you okay?

233
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,410
Are you okay?

234
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,680
I'm fine.

235
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,320
Are you okay?

236
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,920
My sister is fine. You don't need to come back.

237
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,100
I'm here.

238
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,420
Such a serious thing happened, I need to come back.

239
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,730
I can't rely on you to take care of your sister.

240
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,910
- Where is Yan? 
 - Room 720.

241
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,910
Room 720.

242
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,260
Is your wound okay?

243
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,710
The doctor said your anti-inflammatory dressing is good.

244
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,760
I said that bottle of liquor is good.

245
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,820
I suggest the hospital introduce some.

246
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,810
It can both anesthetize and diminish inflammation.

247
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,410
You have the mood to tell jokes?

248
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,810
I remember we talked a lot in the basement.

249
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,730
We agreed to keep it a secret.

250
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,510
I know that.

251
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,270
I mean... that last moment.

252
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,600
I don't remember.

253
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,820
But I do.

254
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,290
My memory is better than yours.

255
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:01,820
I can remember 30 seconds more than you do.

256
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,490
It's okay.

257
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,400
I'll wait for you until you remember it.

258
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,880
- Where is she? 
 - Room 719.

259
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,920
There?

260
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,390
- The second one. This one. 
 - Yan.

261
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,440
- Yan. 
 - Yan.

262
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,720
Yan, where is your wound?

263
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,010
Let me have a look.

264
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,410
Be careful.

265
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,960
Where is your injury?

266
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,620
I'm fine, Aunt.

267
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,910
What about your leg?

268
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,440
You scared me.

269
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,150
When I heard about the disaster, I felt terrified.

270
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,340
Okay, Mom.

271
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,230
Enough, Mom. She is fine.

272
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,650
I didn't introduce him to you.

273
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:59,040
Mr. Luo, Luo Ben.

274
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,290
Hello, Aunt. Uncle.

275
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,220
You're Luo Ben?

276
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,680
Dingding has told us about you.

277
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,220
You're injured?

278
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,520
Dingding told us about it.

279
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,200
Thank you for saving Yan. Thank you.

280
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,560
You're welcome, Uncle. That's what I should do.

281
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:19,490
Mr. Luo, it's rare to see a young man with courage and love like you.

282
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,650
Thank you so much for saving Yan.

283
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:23,670
You're welcome, Aunt.

284
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,640
Well, when Yan recovers,

285
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,250
you are welcome to our home

286
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,970
to taste the wontons we make.

287
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,060
Okay.

288
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,490
Aunt, Mr. Luo is busy.

289
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,580
But he needs to eat.

290
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,960
I need to eat.

291
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,670
That's right.

292
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,780
Aunt, I can help you with it.

293
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,490
You can also cook?

294
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,790
Yes.

295
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,900
Besides working, I like cooking and doing housework.

296
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,060
What a nice young man.

297
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,270
See? Dingding, this is the right way of life for young people.

298
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,090
You should love your work

299
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,460
and enjoy your life.

300
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,820
Aunt, what you said is definitely the truth.

301
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,160
I can tell you can cook well.

302
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,870
If I'm fortunate enough to eat food made by you,

303
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,650
I would be so honored.

304
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,150
So you must come to our home and taste our homemade wontons.

305
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,630
Mom and Dad, enough.

306
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,560
You act like he is your son-in-law.

307
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,710
Don't say that.

308
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:30,360
Let me tell you...

309
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,690
Luo Ben and my sister survived this time,

310
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,700
we should thank one person.

311
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,400
We thanked him.

312
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,080
That's my uncle.

313
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,970
At the end of the rescue,

314
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,960
the scene was not suitable to carry out a rescue.

315
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,060
Nearly everyone was giving up.

316
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,040
But my uncle.

317
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,430
He said, "Now, I'm not a captain,

318
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,170
I'm just a father."

319
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,270
How touching this sentence is.

320
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,240
What's your face?

321
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,170
Don't you feel moved?

322
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,820
Fine. Luo Ben risked his life to save my sister first.

323
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,110
But he was also trapped there, right?

324
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,970
If my uncle wasn't there,

325
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,360
Luo Ben and my sister would have died.

326
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,260
Dingding, don't say that.

327
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,180
Uncle. Aunt.

328
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,300
To be honest, this time, we should thank Captain Qingshan.

329
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,500
Where is he?

330
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,770
Yes. Where is he?

331
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,910

332
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,700
Qingshan, the children have grown up.

333
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,930
We can't accompany them forever.

334
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,670
Look at you.

335
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:49,230
You're more than fifty years old now.

336
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,460
Just let the young men do the rescue work.

337
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:57,430
I'm still in a healthy condition.

338
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:59,600
I can continue to do it.

339
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:03,860
If I got injured and even died one day,

340
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,750
I believe you'll take care of Yan.

341
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,580
Uncle, you always think for others, what about you?

342
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,220
You must be so hurting alone.

343
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,980
Dingding, I'm not hurting.

344
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,060
 With an excellent daughter like Yan,

345
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,650
 and you,

346
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,560
 I'm not hurting at all.

347
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,730
 Don't worry.

348
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:27,350
 After Xiaojie passed away,

349
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:32,290
 I promised, I'd take care of her

350
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,710
 and never let her meet any danger.

351
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,680
 I didn't do well.

352
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,910
You've taken 99 steps, why don't you want to take this last step?

353
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:54,240
You were little when you knew the truth.

354
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,310
But I know you're forgiving him as well.

355
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,780
There is such a good opportunity.

356
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,380
Why don't you want to give it a try?

357
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,330
Zhan Yan, you're evading.

358
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,580
You don't understand.

359
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,700
The last step...

360
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,360
is for my mom.

361
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,680
Yan.

362
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,780
Lie down.

363
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,180
Have some rest. I'll go back now.

364
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,160
Mr. Luo.

365
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,400
Thank you for saving Zhan Yan.

366
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,780
Thank you.

367
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,060
You're welcome, Dr. Cai.

368
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:04,090
This sentence, Zhan Yan, and her family have already said that to me.

369
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,290
Yan.

370
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,990
I...

371
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,150
I know you're disappointed in me.

372
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,050
To be honest, I...

373
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,710
I was in a panic.

374
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,090
I wanted to pull you out of there,

375
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,980
but you were blocked inside.

376
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:41,220
I didn't imagine... this all came all of a sudden.

377
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,100
About this, I mean... I was wrong.

378
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,480
I hope you can give me a chance to make up.

379
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,050
Okay?

380
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,970
Self-preservation is a human instinct.

381
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,780
You're not wrong.

382
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,300
And I won't blame you.

383
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,690
No, I did the wrong thing.

384
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,350
I would like to use the rest of my life to make up for my mistakes.

385
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,870
No.

386
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,740
I'll take care of you and protect you.

387
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,590
I'll give you the happiest life.

388
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:13,700
I promise from today, I won't let you be in danger again.

389
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,880
I mean it.

390
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,330
Yuxiao,

391
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,880
I thought I'd told you clearly in the homestay hotel.

392
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,260
We are not the perfect match for each other.

393
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,720
It's not about the accident.

394
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,880
You're still my senior; my colleague.

395
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,610
It's just...

396
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,430
nothing will change between us,

397
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,400
even if there is no such accident.

398
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,800
No, Yan, listen to me, I...

399
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,160
The reason why I agreed to break up with you is that I wanted to prove myself.

400
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,630
You know I love you.

401
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,350
You're the most important person in my life.

402
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,640
I've never loved anyone else.

403
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,640
When I was with you, I wanted to marry you.

404
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,390
You only love yourself.

405
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,850
You never loved me.

406
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,130
I'm tired. I want to have some rest.

407
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,630
Thank you.

408
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,880
Okay.

409
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,290
Let me tell you!  Life is so amazing.

410
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,410
It's always full of surprises and shocks.

411
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:06,260
She met a landslide during her vacation.

412
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:11,890
More strangely, she survived after being buried alive.

413
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,200
Zhan Yan is so fortunate.

414
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,220
She survived a disaster, so her fortune is coming.

415
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,750
This is so terrifying.

416
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,520
If we had all gone there, would we have been buried as well?

417
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,120
We might not have been as lucky as Zhan Yan.

418
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,110
Haven't you noticed one thing?

419
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,100
Dr. Cai's ten fingers are all injured.

420
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,880
It's because he was digging the soil to save Dr. Zhan.

421
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,220
Did it work?

422
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,530
At the crucial point, Mr. Luo came out

423
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,490
and risked his life to save Zhan Yan.

424
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,470
Yes.

425
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,790
That is to say, we can see one person clearly,

426
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,190
when meeting something urgent.

427
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,660
That's right.

428
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,130
Dr. Cai.

429
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,530
- Dr. Cai. 
 - Dr. Cai.

430
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,190
What's wrong?

431
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,260
Don't think about it.

432
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,450
Just go to work. Just go.

433
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,380
See you when something urgent happens.

434
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,850
See you.

435
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,870
Dad, open the door.

436
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,720
Dingding, call a taxi.

437
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,297
We're not heading in the same direction.

438
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,240
Where are you going? Aren't you going back home?

439
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,560
Your dad and I just came back.

440
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,280
Some of our close friends will welcome us at the hotel.

441
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
We'll go to the hotel directly.

442
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,680
I want to eat the spiced chicken with chili sauce Dad made.

443
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,210
I haven't bought the chicken yet.

444
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,810
And it will take time to make it.

445
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,580
Okay, we'll make it for you next time.

446
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,410
We're in a hurry now.

447
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,110
- Goodbye. 
 - Let's go.

448
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,480
Don't worry.

449
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,271
The doctor said your brother was not seriously injured.

450
00:35:19,271 --> 00:35:21,290
He will recover soon.

451
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,510
Take these.

452
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,410
See? About the payment and medicine.

453
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,300
And this one. It might be useful.

454
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,440
Hai.

455
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,990
Yes, I had something to deal with.

456
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:38,940
I forgot about it. Sorry, I'll go there now.

457
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,000
Okay.

458
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,580
I have to leave now. Contact me if you need anything.

459
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,950
Yuan Yuan.

460
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,540
Yuan Yuan has grown up.

461
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,550
You can take care of me now.

462
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,190
 When you were saving Zhan Yan, did you ever think of me?

463
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
Of course.

464
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,890
The first one I thought of was you.

465
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,970
But under that circumstance,

466
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:25,890
I had to save Zhan Yan.

467
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,680
 Brother, have you fallen in love with her?

468
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,930
Nonsense.

469
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
That's because she saved you.

470
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,540
I'm repaying her kindness for you. Enough.

471
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,910
Captain.

472
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,650
Mr. Luo, how's your wound?

473
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,220
Thank you.

474
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,500
I'm much better now.

475
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,120
I'm here to thank you.

476
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:00,010
If you didn't go to save Zhan Yan, she wouldn't survive herself.

477
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,620
We should thank you, Captain.

478
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,830
You rescued Zhan Yan and me.

479
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,840
Why do you thank me?

480
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,660
Zhan Yan is my daughter.

481
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,860
I know that.

482
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,450
She barely mentioned our relationship to others.

483
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,570
I think there is something on her mind.

484
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,360
I think you should be more active in your relationship.

485
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,610
Sorry, Brother Hai. I'm late.

486
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,900
Take this.

487
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,710
This is?

488
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,220
You've asked for leave three times this month, which are eight days.

489
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,660
The number of goods received and delivered is the last of the whole company.

490
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,680
There is a rule, you'll be fired if you rank the last one for three months.

491
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,960
This is the double salary for this month.

492
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,490
This is all I can do for you.

493
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,460
Thanks, Brother Hai. Sorry to cause you trouble.

494
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,100
Xiong.

495
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,850
Listen to me.

496
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,670
We're just normal people who live normal lives.

497
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,080
Why do you try to be a hero?

498
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,860
Well, if people saw you, they would think you returned from Flaming Mountain.

499
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,430
- Why are you feeling so hot? 
 - I'm angry.

500
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,250
Your sister was rescued, and she is safe and sound.

501
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,420
- Why are you angry? 
 - It's all your fault.

502
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,170
You made me get drunk,

503
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,060
so I didn't see my sister being rescued in person.

504
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,250
Is it my fault?

505
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,710
You asked me to give you wine.

506
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,950
That wine was expensive. I didn't charge you for that.

507
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,850
I'm poor and have no money.

508
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,760
Didn't you just get the copyright fee from our company?

509
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,460
Why are you complaining?

510
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,270
Come on, the rich man won't know the sorrow of the poor.

511
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,370
I just moved out of my home.

512
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,620
I need to pay four months' rent at a time, which is about tens of thousands of yuan.

513
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,200
I need to save money.

514
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,090
Money should be earned, not saved.

515
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,510
You're lucky enough to work for our company. Just work hard.

516
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,930
I feel angry when you mention this.

517
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,100
I want to create good work.

518
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:26,460
But that Director Ming in your company, knows nothing about art

519
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,280
and he disrupted my creative ideas. He...

520
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,350
Is it because he knows nothing or the pictures you drew were not good enough?

521
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,101
My pictures are not good enough?

522
00:40:38,101 --> 00:40:42,250
If my pictures are not good enough, why do so many people like me and I'm so popular?

523
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,760
A creator can't always cater to the market and readers.

524
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,440
I didn't cater to the market.

525
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,250
What I draw is what I want to express.

526
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,640
And so many people like it.

527
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,830
What does it mean?

528
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:55,380
It means the readers understand what I'm thinking.

529
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:00,090
But that Director Ming wants me to change my ideas according to his idea.

530
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,070
I didn't mean that, I...

531
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,570
Nothing.

532
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,980
Well, for the birth of great work, I've decided to fight against him till the end.

533
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:15,200
That Director Ming...

534
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,300
What kind of person is he? Man or woman?

535
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,510
Fat or thin?

536
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,290
Are you okay?

537
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,770
I'm fine, I'm just angry.

538
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:28,250
Does he have any violent tendencies?

539
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,880
I don't know.

540
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,270
You've never seen him?

541
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,330
Yes.

542
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:38,510
A normal staff like me, I have no chance to meet a director.

543
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,690
What a pity.

544
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,140
See? Entering the company through relations is like this.

545
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,370
They won't pay attention to you.

546
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,110
Just work hard.

547
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,890
- Mom. 
 - Mingming.

548
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,690
Where did you go?

549
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,020
I went to have a meeting at the company.

550
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,760
What's wrong, Mom?

551
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:14,610
I thought you went to the training class.

552
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,820
The class is over.

553
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,550
We'll find a day to treat the tutor a lunch.

554
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,140
Mingming.

555
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,480
- What's the surname of your tutor? 
 - Zhang.

556
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,960
Zhang Weilin, right?

557
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,710
Yes.

558
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,510
I visited him to thank his guidance to you.

559
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,140
You visited him?

560
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,290
Yes.

561
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:47,980
Professor Zhang said that he really wants to see what Zhou Mingming looks like.

562
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,860
He paid for his lessons,

563
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,100
and only appeared on the name list.

564
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,320
He also said that Zhou Mingming said he had something important to deal with.

565
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,750
There is a schedule conflict, so he couldn't attend his class.

566
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,750
Mom, sorry.

567
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,220
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

568
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,540
Then tell me!  What have you been doing recently?

569
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,080
I signed up for the training of the public welfare rescue team.

570
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:32,000

571
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,350
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

572
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,700
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

573
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,770
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

574
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,650
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

575
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:10,720
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

576
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:18,670
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

577
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:26,020
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

578
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,220
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

579
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:42,050
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

580
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:48,300
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

581
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:57,070
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

582
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:04,450
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

583
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:08,370
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

584
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:12,200
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

585
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,870
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

586
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,650
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

587
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,270
♫  I can't fly  ♫

588
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,070
♫  But I can look up  ♫

589
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:34,500
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
