Help!

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,530
Mingming!

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Dabao!

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,530
Mingming.

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,080
Mingming!

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Li Jian!

Mingming!

25
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,890
Li Jian, are you all right?

26
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,360
Mingming!

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,480
Don't move!

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,690
Don't move!

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,770
Well...

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
- Mingming.
- What to do?

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,690
Give me your towel.

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,600
Be careful.

33
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,440
Mingming.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,560
Grasp it.

35
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
Hold my hand.

36
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,280
Li Jian.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,690
Don't move.

38
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,930
Don't move.

39
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,560
You can let me go.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,090
Okay.

41
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,530
Como on, give me your hand.

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,760
Be careful.

43
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,530
Come on.

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,840
Get up.

45
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:11,840
Be careful.

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,440
Go.

47
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:15,930
Come on.

48
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,760
Li Jian, give me your hand.

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,210
Mingming, gave him a push.

50
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:20,760
Come on.

51
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,000
Mingming.

52
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,930
Grasp me.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,210
Come on.

54
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,280
Sit down here.

55
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,210
Are you okay?

56
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,530
I'm fine.

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,650
Just some scratches.

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,320
Why did you

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,410
have to ride so fast?

60
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,720
If it weren't for Mingming today,

61
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,810
you would have died here!

62
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:49,440
Thank you.

63
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,690
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,290
Mom.

65
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,690
When did you come back?

66
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,690
How many times

67
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,880
have I told you?

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,320
You just won't

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,440
listen to me.

70
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,810
I didn't say anything about you

71
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,490
fooling around all day,

72
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,930
but do you have to go fish up bodies?

73
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,610
Do you know how unlucky this is?

74
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,760
Have you known that?

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,520
I hear it's not safe on the water.

76
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,050
What if something

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,610
happens to you?

78
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,440
Do you wanna

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,440
die earlier than your parents?

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,290
Mom.

81
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,760
I learned how to swim.

82
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,200
I'm also learning dive rescue.

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,610
You're just a jack of all trades.

84
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,960
Do you think you can

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,930
save yourself every time?

86
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:10,930
Mom.

87
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,690
I know.

88
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,730
Don't be mad.

89
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,320
Look,

90
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,730
you like comics,

91
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,490
so I set up

92
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,370
a Comic Department for you.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,760
Have you achieved anything so far?

94
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,850
Your passion for it
only lasted for a short time.

95
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,520
You've failed to hit your KPIs

96
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,080
even for a month.

97
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,080
Mom.

98
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,320
There is only one employee
in the Comic Department.

99
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,130
The KPIs you set

100
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,170
are way too high.

101
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,930
Ding Dingding has tried her best.

102
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,690
Don't even mention Ding Dingding.

103
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,080
I had Aiqi look into her.

104
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,520
It was Ding Dingding

105
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,200
who tricked you into
joining the rescue team, right?

106
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,850
No.

107
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,050
I joined it voluntarily.

108
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,490
Okay, you don't have to defend her.

109
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,640
The Comic Department

110
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,930
will be abolished from today.

111
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,930
You will focus on

112
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,520
the company's projects.

113
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,560
You're not going anywhere

114
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,960
until business picks up.

115
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,440
Mom...

116
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,290
Ding Dingding.

117
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,290
Good morning.

118
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,050
Morning.

119
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,610
Morning.

120
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,490
Miss Ding, please come with me.

121
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,880
Why is she so solemn?

122
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Why?

123
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,520
Because comics are not

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,690
our company's main business,

125
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,640
and the Comic Department

126
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,000
has failed to hit its KPIs for months.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The chairman saw

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,760
no need for

129
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,880
this department.

130
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,810
What about Zhou Mingming?

131
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,370
Chairman has other plans

132
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,200
for Mr. Ming.

133
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,250
What about
the Light Chaser Rescue serial?

134
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,440
Starting tomorrow,

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,730
you'll have the copyright

136
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,760
on the comics.

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,850
You can do whatever you want.

138
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,050
But in that case,

139
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,130
my contract with the company

140
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:01,760
hasn't expired yet.

141
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,930
That's a breach of contract.

142
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,610
You're gonna

143
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,960
pay me a lot of money.

144
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,400
All the compensation

145
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,610
will arrive tomorrow.

146
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,050
Please note to check.

147
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,000
Does Zhou Mingming know about this?

148
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,760
Yes.

149
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,050
Hello?

150
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,400
You signed me

151
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,880
and you should be responsible for me.

152
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
How can you terminate the contract

153
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,370
all of a sudden?

154
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,960
I'm not the one firing you.

155
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,760
It's the chairman who wants to fire you.

156
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,930
The chairman is your mother.

157
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,730
Can't you object to that?

158
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,960
I did.

159
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,250
It was overruled.

160
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,200
Besides,

161
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,320
you said you want to take a break.

162
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Well,

163
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,930
you can take the time
to adjust yourself.

164
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,200
After she calms down,

165
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,730
we'll give the matter further thought.

166
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,050
What about my comics?

167
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,440
You are already

168
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
a professional comics artist.

169
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,080
You can't stop updating

170
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,250
just because no one is urging you.

171
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:03,810
Understand?

172
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,080
Well...

173
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,170
What's next?

174
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,050
What's our plan?

175
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,610
Just stay put.

176
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,050
When I get back on my feet,

177
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,200
I'll buy you back.

178
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,930
However,

179
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,850
you have to make my character

180
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,730
look better.

181
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,810
Okay.

182
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,960
You must keep your word.

183
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,730
Of course.

184
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,200
By the way,

185
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,560
I will stay current

186
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,610
with your posts.

187
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,400
Don't slack off.

188
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,200
I got it.

189
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,810
Bye-bye.

190
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,820
(In-patient)

191
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,920
The patient in Bed No. 36

192
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,610
can be discharged

193
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,610
after another day of observation.

194
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,210
Okay.

195
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,760
The patient

196
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,570
in Bed No. 49 is old

197
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,450
and not recovering well

198
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,400
from surgery.

199
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,570
Where is the patient on this bed?

200
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
What's going on?

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,370
Who allowed her to get out of bed?

202
00:08:58,450 --> 00:08:59,850
I don't know.

203
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,640
She left from the front

204
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
and never came back.

205
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,920
Could she leave on her own?

206
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,130
When?

207
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
About two hours ago.

208
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,160
Find her.

209
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,680
Okay.

210
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,250
The patient left the ward
at 6:00 in the morning,

211
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,730
and took the elevator down at 6:05.

212
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,370
At 6:25,

213
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,490
she left the hospital building

214
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,970
and got into a taxi.

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,330
Can you read the plate?

216
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
No.

217
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,250
There weren't many people at that time.

218
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,640
How did it take her 20 minutes

219
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,520
to get from the elevator

220
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,920
to the entrance of the hospital?

221
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:43,920
Yeah.

222
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,450
Pull the security video
from the elevator.

223
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,450
Yes.

224
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,760
Chu Weisheng!

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,490
Yes.

226
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,210
We got a task.

227
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:02,800
Okay.

228
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,250
The Central Hospital

229
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,210
has an old woman missing.

230
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,610
The specific information
has been released.

231
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,250
Please help in the search.

232
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,210
Look here!

233
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,040
Everybody!

234
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,520
Look here!

235
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,280
Listen to this.

236
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,610
How did you

237
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,490
care for your patients in the hospital?

238
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,730
How can you lose

239
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,800
a living person?

240
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,570
You have to give me

241
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,160
an explanation today.

242
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,250
We can talk in the office

243
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,400
if you have any problem.

244
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,210
Please don't

245
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,450
create a disturbance here!

246
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,490
You don't need to tell me that.

247
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,850
Get your guy in charge here.

248
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,160
- Let your head talk to me.
- Talk nicely.

249
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,800
Talk nicely.

250
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,610
How am I not talking nicely?

251
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm Qin Huizhen's attending doctor.

252
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,330
Are you the one who lost my mom?

253
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:36,970
Mind your words.

254
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,760
What?

255
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:38,970
Listen,

256
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,130
if anything were to happen to my mother,

257
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:41,850
you

258
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:43,160
and the hospital

259
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,880
would take full responsibility for it,

260
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,850
and I would ask for compensation!

261
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,610
Are you her son?

262
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,000
Isn't that obvious?

263
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,970
Your mother has been hospitalized

264
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,970
for more than half a month.

265
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,090
Have you ever shown up once?

266
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:52,850
I...

267
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,680
Where were you

268
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,800
when she was in surgery

269
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,610
and needed someone?

270
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,610
Yeah.

271
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,970
Would you know

272
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,570
she was hospitalized here

273
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,040
if Dr. Zhan didn't tell you?

274
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,970
How dare you come here

275
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,880
and ask for compensation?

276
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,160
You...

277
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,760
That's right.

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,570
My mom and Mrs. Qin

279
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,680
live in the same ward.

280
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,330
Why have I never heard

281
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,130
that she has a son?

282
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,040
None of your business.

283
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,760
Listen,

284
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,920
what you should be doing right now

285
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,610
is thinking about

286
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,610
where your mother would go

287
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,450
and where she might be,

288
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,040
instead of making a scene here,

289
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,880
or I'll call security.

290
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,760
Call security?

291
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:18,570
Go ahead!

292
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,400
What do you want to do?

293
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,920
Call security!

294
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,850
- All right, all right.
- What's wrong with me?

295
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,880
Stop it.

296
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,800
It's all your fault.

297
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,210
I've learned the situation.

298
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,850
I'm a lawyer.

299
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,760
In a situation like this,

300
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,040
there could be
a large sum of compensation

301
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,730
if I'm hired.

302
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,040
A lawyer?

303
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,330
Okay.

304
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,850
I'm about to take them to court.

305
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:37,970
Well,

306
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,130
would you like to talk alone?

307
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,330
Let's go.

308
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,040
All right, everybody goes back.

309
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:44,520
Go back.

310
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,280
Wait for it.

311
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,250
This is not over.

312
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:51,760
Let's go.

313
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,760
Don't watch it.

314
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,280
Let's go.

315
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,880
What an unreasonable man.

316
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,520
Let's talk.

317
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,610
They lost my mom.

318
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,370
Do you have a picture of your mother?

319
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,970
Let's just find her first.

320
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:05,760
Yes.

321
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,680
Is she your mother?

322
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,850
Look,

323
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,000
the expenses on

324
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,370
finding my mom must be paid for
by the hospital,

325
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,250
and they should hire people to find her.

326
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,400
I'm sure there is something wrong

327
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,850
with my mom's attending doctor.

328
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,000
She must have encouraged her

329
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,970
to have an operation

330
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,450
to get her money

331
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,760
because she thinks
an old woman is easy to fool.

332
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,330
My mom

333
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,570
loves money the most.

334
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:38,920
She would never agree
to have an operation,

335
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,210
so they kicked her out.

336
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,520
I know my mom's body.

337
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
It's nothing serious.

338
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,800
That sounds logical.

339
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,130
Are you suggesting

340
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,970
the hospital is suspected
of overtreatment?

341
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,450
That's right.

342
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,490
Overtreatment.

343
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,400
It's overtreatment.

344
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,760
How much is this overtreatment thing

345
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,450
gonna cost the hospital?

346
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,520
It could cost you everything.

347
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Do you know

348
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,970
the law stipulates
that children have the duty

349
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,730
to support the sick elderly?

350
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,880
Abandoning the elderly

351
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,250
is a felony

352
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:10,850
that will get you in jail

353
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,330
for up to five years.

354
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Don't scare me.

355
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm scaring you?

356
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
Just because your mother won't sue you,

357
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,280
it doesn't mean

358
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,250
you can get away with it.

359
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,330
Your mother is missing.

360
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,250
The hospital will call the police,

361
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,730
and the police will deal with it.

362
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,520
Then you're not just

363
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,610
going to get

364
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,490
a moral reprimand.

365
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,520
Stay out of this.

366
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,520
It's none of your business.

367
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,570
I'm a lawyer.

368
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,880
I have an obligation to provide

369
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
legal assistance to victims.

370
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,450
Sir.

371
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,850
I hope you understand

372
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,850
what I said.

373
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,640
If you do,

374
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:48,850
please leave now.

375
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,040
Good for you.

376
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,640
I got a message

377
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,520
from the Light Chaser Rescue
that someone is missing.

378
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,570
Luckily, I got here in time.

379
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,330
I don't think

380
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,000
he's gonna
mess around anymore.

381
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,730
Did you hit him?

382
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,920
How come?

383
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,520
I'm a lawyer.

384
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,880
I have plenty of other ways

385
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,000
to deal with him than by force.

386
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,040
Looks like it's useful

387
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,160
to have a lawyer as a boyfriend.

388
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:22,520
Of course.

389
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,040
Zhan Yan.

390
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:24,760
The hospital knows

391
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,040
that Qin Huizhen is missing.

392
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,330
They called you in for a meeting.

393
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,680
This happened

394
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,370
in the Department of General Surgery.

395
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,040
As the direct supervisor

396
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,970
of Dr. Zhan,

397
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,800
I failed in my management.

398
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,210
I'll censor myself.

399
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,640
As the attending doctor,

400
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,280
Zhan Yan is also culpable

401
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,920
because she failed to notice

402
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,610
the patient's mood swings

403
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,640
which caused

404
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,800
the patient to leave the hospital

405
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,850
during the treatment.

406
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,330
As her attending doctor,

407
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,680
I'm directly responsible for this.

408
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,730
Alright.

409
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,520
We still don't know why

410
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,400
the patient left the hospital,

411
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,450
where she is

412
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,880
and if she is safe.

413
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,680
The priority is

414
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,970
to find the patient back,

415
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,850
then we'll find out

416
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,760
who should be held accountable.

417
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,520
We are from the Ningcheng Division.

418
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,730
We were searching along the river

419
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:23,920
when we saw the old lady
jump into the river.

420
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,160
She was unconscious

421
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,130
when we brought her up,

422
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:26,680
so we took her

423
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,250
to the nearest clinic.

424
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,160
The police confirmed

425
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,370
that she is the missing patient

426
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,450
from Linjiang Central Hospital.

427
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,490
Don't worry.

428
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,040
I will work with the police

429
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,570
and bring her back safely.

430
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,970
In that case,

431
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,370
our work here is done.

432
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,210
Goodbye.

433
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,490
Thank you.

434
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,520
You're welcome.

435
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,450
Mrs. Qin.

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,800
Mr. Luo.

437
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,210
Why are you here?

438
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,730
Please sit down.

439
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,210
Mrs. Qin.

440
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,920
We haven't seen flowers

441
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,330
at the firm for days.

442
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,760
You left the hospital

443
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,040
on your own.

444
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,400
Everyone at the firm

445
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
worries about you.

446
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,850
Thank you for your concern.

447
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:19,970
I...

448
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,490
Well,

449
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,640
you just left without telling anyone.

450
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,970
We were all worried.

451
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,250
Your son came to the hospital.

452
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,490
He was also worried

453
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,280
when he couldn't find you there.

454
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,450
Did he go to the hospital?

455
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,680
Yes.

456
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,490
How would he worry about me?

457
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,130
He just wants my money.

458
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,250
Is there anyone else in your family?

459
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,970
I can contact them for you.

460
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,280
Did he cause trouble for the hospital?

461
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,330
He asked the hospital

462
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,330
for an explanation

463
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,330
and compensation.

464
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:11,200
I'll go back with you.

465
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,540
(Ward 1)

466
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,130
How is Mrs. Qin doing?

467
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,330
She's already in poor health.

468
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,240
After what she went through,

469
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,160
she is in no condition

470
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,920
to have surgery.

471
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,370
But I think what hurts her most

472
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,920
should be her son's attitude.

473
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,640
All he cares about is still money

474
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,610
at this point.

475
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,010
I think Zhao Donglei

476
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,290
is the most pathetic person.

477
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,330
He thinks money

478
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,850
is the most important thing to him,

479
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:12,810
but when he loses

480
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,130
his mother,

481
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,130
he will know

482
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,090
what the most important thing is to him.

483
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:19,960
Actually,

484
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,530
family members

485
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,130
should try to clear up

486
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,720
their misunderstandings
as early as possible

487
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,640
before it's too late.

488
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,130
Or it will be regrettable.

489
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,960
(Linjiang Central Hospital)
Keep a close eye on

490
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,330
the patients

491
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,130
in Beds No. 15 and No. 16.

492
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:09,610
Okay.

493
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,440
Good.

494
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:12,850
Dr. Zhan.

495
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,810
I heard the patient has been found.

496
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,640
Yes.

497
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:17,680
It's good.

498
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:18,850
By the way,

499
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,810
don't mind what I said

500
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,530
at the meeting.

501
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,330
It's nothing personal.

502
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,010
Don't take it to heart.

503
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,770
You did the right thing.

504
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,960
Director Cai.

505
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,130
Mom.

506
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,160
Please let me stay
in the Comic Department.

507
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,330
Just give me some more time.

508
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,160
I promise I'll make a difference.

509
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:43,610
I told you

510
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:44,480
you'll go to meetings with me

511
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,610
from today.

512
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,160
Meetings...

513
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,680
She can go with you.

514
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,480
Take his phone.

515
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,130
Yes.

516
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,370
Well...

517
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,530
You don't have to do that, Mom.

518
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,160
Mom.

519
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,480
Mom!

520
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,850
Mom!

521
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,880
Give me my phone.

522
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,530
Li Aiqi!

523
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Mr. Liu, please

524
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,240
read the terms.

525
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,050
I guess you've learned it.

526
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,960
Change it here.

527
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,530
Here.

528
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,960
What's wrong with it?

529
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,050
Please take a look.

530
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,240
Sorry about that.

531
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,610
See, this is...

532
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,010
Thank you for your cooperation.

533
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,680
It's happy to work with you.

534
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,880
Take care.

535
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,370
Goodbye.

536
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,050
Goodbye.

537
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:43,570
Okay.

538
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,880
It went pretty well today.

539
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:47,200
This is the new plan

540
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,010
we made.

541
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,050
It's all here.

542
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,400
Did you take one month

543
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,810
to come up with such a plan?

544
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,090
Okay, we'll change it right away.

545
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,680
Why doesn't he answer the phone?

546
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,090
Is his phone charge overdue?

547
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,920
You'll see.

548
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,720
Here.

549
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,960
Don't let the chairman see it.

550
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,720
Li Aiqi.

551
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,130
You're the smartest person
in the whole company.

552
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:38,960
I'll go get busy.

553
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,260
(You have 12 missed calls
You have one unread message)

554

(Sleepy Ding: Updates on Light Chaser.
Leave comments. Advice won't be taken.)

555
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,580
(Ding Xiaoxiao,)

556
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,980
(be my girlfriend!)

557
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,400
Are you kidding?

558
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,090
How could I possibly like her?

559
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,380
(Congratulations from people
in Linjiang)

560

(Zhou Mengmeng has been in love
with Ding Xiaoxiao for a long time.)

561
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,480
Hello?

562
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:09,400
Hello.

563
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,610
What kind of stuff did you draw?

564
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,770
None of your business.

565
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,330
You're not

566
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,130
my boss anymore.

567
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:14,920
Then why did you make so many calls

568
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,400
to me?

569
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,160
You know what,

570
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,640
a lot of companies want to sign me.

571
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,480
It's up to you.

572
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,400
Bye-bye.

573
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,570
Hey, you...

574
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,570
Hey! Hey...

575
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,400
(I'll see you tomorrow morning)

576
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,680
(to direct your comics.)

577
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,480
Whoever doesn't come is a dog.

578
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,850
Hello.

579
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,370
Where have you been?

580
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,480
Why don't you come to the company?

581
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,770
I have things to do.

582
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,720
Don't tell my mom.

583
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,570
Cover for me.

584
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,850
The chairman fainted at the meeting.

585
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,480
What?

586
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:18,920
Mom!

587
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:21,770
Mom, what happened?

588
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,400
She has high blood pressure.

589
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,050
What's going on?

590
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,240
How did you faint all of a sudden?

591
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,200
Well, she has been keeping from you

592
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,480
that something went wrong with the movie

593
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,370
our company invested in.

594
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,920
We've spent billions of yuan

595
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,290
on that project.

596
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,880
The company has

597
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,640
a cash flow problem now.

598
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,240
Mom.

599
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,680
Mingming.

600
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,530
It's time for you to grow up.

601
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,090
(I'm not coming.)

(Find a reliable company)

603
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,640
(and keep)

604
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,530
(drawing your comics.)

605
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,050
Fine, Zhou Mingming.

606
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,240
You stood me up.

607
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,960
I'll never

608
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,240
come to you again.

609
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,160
Thank you, sir.

610
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,330
Here.

611
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,240
Thank you, Miss.

612
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:49,920
- Sir, we'll have one steamer.
- Thank you.

613
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:50,850
Okay.

614
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,440
Here.

615
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,240
Thank you.

616
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,640
Look at your smile.

617
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,720
You must be

618
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,440
very happy now.

619
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,680
Right,

620
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,850
your boyfriend is by your side
every day.

621
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,920
How can you not be happy?

622
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,400
Yuan, I'm full.

623
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,570
She wants you

624
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,290
to bring this to Zhou Mingming.

625
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:41,770
Then you don't

626
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,050
have to envy the two of us.

627
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,240
No, why should I bring it to him?

628
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,880
I have nothing to do with him.

629
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:49,850
Okay.

630
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,530
We've read your comics.

631
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,850
You like Zhou Mingming a lot,

632
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,440
right?

633
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,090
How could I possibly like him?

634
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,720
That's ridiculous.

635
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,290
Is he good enough for me?

636
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,880
She means

637
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,400
you should ask yourself how you feel.

638
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,440
I...

639
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:15,680
I'm her boss.

640
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,880
I'm the reason why she's lucky.

641
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,160
I tell you what,

642
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,200
not only am I going to promote her

643
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,130
as a major illustrator,

644
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,810
I'm also going to make her famous
across the nation.

645
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:23,720
By then,

646
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,720
even closing the page
of her work won't help,

647
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,880
because everyone will be

648
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,240
talking about her comic

649
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,330
and looking up to her success.

650
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,610
All right. I'm leaving.

651
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,850
Xiong Fei, you're not pure anymore.

652
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,260
(Big Bear Wonton)

653
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,050
Ding Dingding?

654
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,530
What are you doing here?

655
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,010
I have a job interview.

656
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,850
I see.

657
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
I thought

658
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,770
you were here to get back at me

659
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,850
because I stood you up.

660
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,880
That's funny.

661
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,400
Why would I waste my time on you?

662
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,440
Do you bring food to a job interview?

663
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,130
What a foodie you are.

664
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Let me remind you.

665
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,400
Not every boss

666
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,640
is as tolerant as I am.

667
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,610
Don't go too far.

668
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,010
Just leave.

669
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,330
When have you been tolerant?

670
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,880
What a pig.

671
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,480
Mr. Luo!

672
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,960
Are you here to pick up
your girlfriend from work?

673
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:51,880
I haven't seen him before.

674
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,480
Where is Zhan Yan?

675
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,530
It's expensive
to get information from me.

676
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,680
I'll give you a red envelope later.

677
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,130
She's in the locker room.

678
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,400
Thanks.

679
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,960
You have keen sight.

680
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:03,850
Does Dr. Zhan really have a boyfriend?

681
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,480
It has nothing to do with my sight.

682
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm speaking from experience.

683
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,610
How did you fail to make Dr. Cai
your boyfriend

684
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,330
with all your experience?

685
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,290
I...

686
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,370
I do like him,

687
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,050
but that doesn't mean

688
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,370
I have to be his girlfriend, right?

689
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,330
Does Dr. Cai know

690
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,200
that you're so good at

691
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,370
giving yourself an out?

692
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,710
Shh.

693
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,700
(Locker Room)

694
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,160
Dr. Cai.

695
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,440
Dr. Cai.

696
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,680
Mr. Luo.

697
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,640
Are you here to see Dr. Zhan again?

698
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:45,680
Dr. Cai.

699
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
Your key chain is quite special.

700
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,010
This one?

701
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,570
I got it from my ex-girlfriend.

702
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,370
By the way, Mr. Luo,

703
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,370
I should remind you

704
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,920
that Dr. Zhan doesn't like roses.

705
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,200
Luo Ben!

706
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,370
Have you seen Zhan Yan?

707
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,680
He was all right just now.

708
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
What's going on?

709
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,570
Men are fickle.

710
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,050
You can only have them for a short time,

711
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,640
but you can't have them forever.

712
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,920
You see what I mean?

713
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,290
Get in touch

714
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,720
with this man later.

715
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,570
Yes.

716
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,850
Check out his problem.

717
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,370
Zhan Yan.

718
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,240
Have you had a fight
with your boyfriend?

719
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,480
No.

720
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,680
No?

721
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,020
(Zhan Yan)

722
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,780
(Zhan Yan)

723
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,300
(Zhan Yan)

724
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,440
Why didn't you

725
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,090
answer my call if you're at home?

726
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,860
(Missed calls Zhan Yan)

727
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
You did it on purpose.

728
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,570
I'll give you a chance to explain.

729
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,010
I have nothing to explain.

730
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,680
Don't you

731
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,370
have anything to tell me?

732
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,680
What do you want to hear?

733
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,960
What's your relationship
with Cai Yuxiao?

734
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,640
He is a colleague.

735
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:22,880
Just a colleague?

736
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,010
A senior.

737
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,050
What else?

738
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,010
Ex-boyfriend.

739
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
Why didn't you

740
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,880
tell me earlier?

741
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,570
It was in college.

742
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,720
What is there to say?

743
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,960
Are you gonna keep it from me

744
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,530
if I don't ask you?

745
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,440
I never meant to keep it from you.

746
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,880
You just didn't ask.

747
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,680
How can you say that
like you did nothing wrong?

748
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,880
What about your ex-girlfriends?

749
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:52,610
I don't have one.

750
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,960
Never mind.

751
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,610
Am I really your first love?

752
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,770
Seriously?

753
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,720
It's just that you were single
for over 30 years.

754
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,960
It's not that bad. Get out.

755
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,810
I'm leaving.

756
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,460
(Out-patient)

757
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,610
Mr. Luo.

758
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:51,570
Morning!

759
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,810
Good morning, Dr. Cai.

760
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,050
Dr. Zhan, morning.

761
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,010
Morning.

762
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,680
Dr. Cai.

763
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,440
Your ex-girlfriend said

764
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,880
you bought that camel key chain

765
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,200
yourself.

766
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,400
And I got this

767
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,890
from my current girlfriend.

768
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,970
Childish.

769
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,800
The family member
of the patient in Bed No. 40.

770
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,450
You can visit her now.

771
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,280
I can visit her now?

772
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,320
ICU visits are limited

773
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,490
to five minutes.

774
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,160
All right, I got it.

775
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,200
Let's go.

776
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,530
Mom.

777
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,930
Mom.

778
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,160
I need you to cooperate with me.

779
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,450
We can't let them

780
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,970
cheat us of our money,

781
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:46,490
right?

782
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,010
(Will)
You can't take the money to the coffin.

783
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,200
Just give it all to me.

784
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,450
Son, what are you doing?

785
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:52,890
Mom.

786
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:53,720
I need your fingerprint.

787
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:54,450
Your fingerprint.

788
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:55,610
Son.

789
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,720
When I die, what I have

790
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,050
will all be yours.

791
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:01,490
Why are you in such a hurry?

792
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,240
Mom.

793
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,090
You don't need money after you die.

794
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:03,530
Right?

795
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,410
Give it to me.

796
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:04,610
No.

797
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,530
Just give it to me, okay?

798
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:05,720
No.

799
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,240
Come on, I need your fingerprint.

800
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,760
Mom!

801
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,640
No!

802
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,570
Do what I say!

803
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,410
Give me your fingerprint!

804
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,010
What are you doing?

805
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,280
Mom.

806
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,840
Get out.

807
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:16,640
This is a family thing.

808
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,360
Back off.

809
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,240
I take care of everything in the ward.

810
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:20,760
Get out.

811
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,840
We're not done
with what happened last time.

812
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,240
Can you back off?

813
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,240
This family member.

814
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,200
Please leave.

815
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,410
She needs emergency treatment.

816
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:28,640
Zhan!

817
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,410
Zhan! Listen!

818
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,680
If anything were to happen to my mother,

819
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,840
I would never let you go!

820
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,570
Zhan, do you hear me?

821
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,530
Ding Dingding!

822
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,130
You did it well.

823
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,280
Aren't you in charge of logistics

824
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,450
and publicity?

825
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,570
Why are you practicing this?

826
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,450
Can't I improve myself?

827
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,160
Don't underestimate me.

828
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,160
When I'm ready,

829
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,490
I'll show you how I carry out a mission.

830
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,450
Don't say that.

831
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,010
Do you wanna see

832
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,760
the rescue mission I did
with the double rope?

833
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,410
My goodness.

834
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,490
This is beautiful.

835
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,200
Where is it?

836
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,410
Shuanglong Cave.

837
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,090
There are many more

838
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,200
beautiful caves than it.

839
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,090
Well?

840
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,930
I wanna go there.

841
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,970
Let me see.

842
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,320
But you can't go

843
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,240
before you're skillful enough.

844
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
The cave is beautiful,

845
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,800
but it's also extremely dangerous.

846
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,490
You know what,

847
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,840
a lot of rescue experts went in there

848
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,680
and never made it out.

849
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,800
Is there anything else?

850
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,490
I'd like to see more.

851
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,320
Let me find more for you.

852
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,530
How about this?

853
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,720
(The cave landscape is beautiful.)

854
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:27,760
Dr. Zhan.

855
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,320
Put it on.

856
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,160
I...

857
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,530
I want to make a will.

858
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,800
Okay?

859
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,640
Okay.

860
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,090
Are you sure

861
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,800
you want to

862
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,280
give away all your money?

863
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,450
Yes.

864
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,610
Actually,

865
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,280
you can donate some of it

866
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,200
and keep some for him.

867
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,760
It will only harm him.

868
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,570
Can we get started now?

869
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,010
Okay.

870
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:09,680
Dr. Xu.

871
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,530
Please record it.

872
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,090
Okay.

873
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,490
You can start.

874
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,050
My name is Qin Huizhen.

875
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:25,840
I'm thinking

876
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,970
clearly

877
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,010
about making my will.

878
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,450
After I die,

879
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,720
I'll donate

880
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,840
all of my assets

881
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,010
to the Light Chaser Rescue,

882
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,160
Attorney Luo Ben will be my executor.

883
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,010
It's done.

884
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,970
Let's leave.

885
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,010
Thank you.

886
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,360
Thank you.

887
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,410
Let's go.

888
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,640
Thank you for today.

889
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,240
All my years as a lawyer,

890
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,640
I've seen the ugliness
and goodness of humanity.

891
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,840
I'm willing to be kind to others.

892
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,890
I also suffered losses

893
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,010
and got fooled

894
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,160
because of that.

895
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,720
Later,

896
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,640
I would still offer my help,

897
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,800
it's just

898
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:49,570
I have my own principles

899
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,720
and bottom lines now.

900
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,970
Is it against your rules

901
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,570
to help Mrs. Qin?

902
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,530
Yes,

903
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,720
but you changed me.

904
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,320
I'm not that good.

905
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:10,200
When I first met you,

906
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,010
I thought you were rigid

907
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,200
and indifferent,

908
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,800
even a little mean.

909
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,130
I thought

910
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,720
you were different

911
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,640
because you got used to deaths

912
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,890
as a doctor.

913
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:25,610
But when

914
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,640
I spent more time with you,

915
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,530
the more I could feel

916
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,490
your soft

917
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,090
and gentle side.

918
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,610
Zhan Yan.

919
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,130
You're the reason

920
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,840
I believe in

921
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,610
the brilliance of humanity

922
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,610
while I'm seeing

923
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,090
all the good and evil things people do.

924
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,490
I'm really not that good.

925
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,050
I know

926
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,490
that helping Mrs. Qin in this matter

927
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,890
is bound to raise eyebrows,

928
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,240
but if she has

929
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,610
someone to trust,

930
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,280
why would she come to me?

931
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,410
Don't worry.

932
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,320
No matter what happens next,

933
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,890
I got it.

934
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,610
This is the will

935
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,530
of Mrs. Qin Huizhen.

936
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,160
She entrusted me to donate

937
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,760
all her property
to the Light Chaser Rescue.

938
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:38,840
This is a copy.

939
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,930
No way.

940
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,490
I have her will.

941
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,090
Do you think I know nothing
about the law?

942
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,800
I'm her son.

943
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,720
I'm the first heir.

944
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,360
Do you still know you're her son?

945
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,760
What do you mean?

946
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,970
Anyway,

947
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:57,800
I have fulfilled

948
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,130
the duty of notice.

949
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,010
Please leave now.

950
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,050
Fine.

951
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,360
Listen.

952
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,320
Give me the money before it's too late.

953
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,240
I'll get a lawyer, too.

954
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,640
Fine.

955
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:10,970
Good for you.

956
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,450
If you're being unreasonable,

957
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,010
I'll go to a place
where people are reasonable.

958
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,130
Who is he?

959
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,090
A bad son who wants her mother's money.

960
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,800
Are they rich?

961
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,570
Just ordinary people.

962
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,800
Legal aid again?

963
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:39,530
Just let

964
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,760
your guys

965
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,530
deal with such things.

966
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,200
Why would you waste your energy on that?

967
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,930
I just lifted a finger.

968
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,490
I have to remind you.

969
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,160
It's not worth it

970
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,530
to get into trouble

971
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:52,570
over a case like this.

972
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,610
You should put your mind

973
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,840
to those big cases.

974
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,680
I see.

975
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,090
