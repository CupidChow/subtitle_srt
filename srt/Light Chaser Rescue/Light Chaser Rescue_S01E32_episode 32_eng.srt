00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:10,150

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,840
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,164
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:21,976
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,424
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:35,490
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:39,310
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:43,546
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:48,220
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,560
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,510
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:02,210
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,910
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:15,460
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,290
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,340
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,910
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,950

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,062

20
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,351
Stop. Come back.

21
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,440
Who're you?

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,770
Do you want to call the police?

23
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,110
Why?

24
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,560
I'm not bad.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Stop.

26
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,020
I'm asking you. Who're you?

27
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,270
Listen, I'm not bad. The truck is my bro Xiong Fei's.

28
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,640
He also lives here.

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,473
I'll let you go. Calm down.

30
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,820
It's his truck. He lives over there.

31
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,190
Do you also live here?

32
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,694
Are you his wife?

33
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm asking you. Are you dumb?

34
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,933
Don't go.

35
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,701
If you won't make it clear, you can't go.

36
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:54,801
- Why opened the door? 
 - Brother Qiang!

37
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,601
Hands off.

38
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,220
Are you okay?

39
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,420
- Brother Xiong... 
 - She's your sister-in-law

40
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,222
Sister-in-law?

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,820
It's fine.

42
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,584
Bro, sorry.

43
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:17,220
I kept asking her. She didn't answer. I was confused.

44
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,710
I...

45
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,260
She can hear you, but can't speak.

46
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,456
No wonder she didn't answer my questions.

47
00:03:27,456 --> 00:03:29,504
She's dumb indeed.

48
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,150
I'm sorry, Sister-in-law.

49
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,220
- I didn't know. 
 - It's okay.

50
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,970
It's my fault. I hadn't told her yet.

51
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,790
Don't be afraid. He's my friend.

52
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,436
Don't be afraid.

53
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,450
Sister-in-law, I'm sorry.

54
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,362
Your smartphone.

55
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:57,650
All right, go back to sleep. Not a big deal.

56
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,730
Well.

57
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,550
Let's go home. It's okay.

58
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,360
Never mind.

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,596
Sorry.

60
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,354
What a farce!

61
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,470
I'm sorry. You must have been frightened.

62
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,978
 He said he's your friend.

63
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:31,014
 Why haven't I heard about him?

64
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:34,326
He's Qiangzi, my fellow inmate.

65
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,470
He was just discharged days ago.

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,782
He seems careless, but not bad in nature.

67
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:49,260
He was trapped in a pyramid scheme and brainwashed to cheat others.

68
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,836
He isn't bad in nature.

69
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:55,750
I used to be bullied in prison. He was the only one to help me.

70
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,440
Yuan Yuan, I...

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,030
I've something to discuss with you.

72
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,550
Qiangzi was just released with no money or job.

73
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,246
I'm thinking of doing him a favor by employing him.

74
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,030
What's wrong?

75
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,450
Is it because he was imprisoned?

76
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,482
 No.

77
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,190
 We're making wonton.

78
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,990
 Though I saw Qiangzi for the first time,

79
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,054
 I can feel he's not fit for the service industry.

80
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,870
Don't worry about his past.

81
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,426
I was imprisoned as well, and I'm pretty good.

82
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:58,238
 You're not the same.

83
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,566
 I understand you want to help him,

84
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:08,060
 but we can take another way rather than sheltering him by our side.

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,676
A'Fei, why don't you sleep this late?

86
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,060
What's wrong?

87
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,912
Are you okay?

88
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,110
We're fine, Mom. We're just discussing something.

89
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,500
We'll go to bed soon.

90
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,008
All right. Go to bed early or you'll be late tomorrow.

91
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:39,070
What about this? Shelter him for now

92
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,556
until he finds a job, okay?

93
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,460
Today's traffic is heavy.

94
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,700
Luo Ben will be here once he parks the car.

95
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,564
Luo Ben also comes.

96
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
You didn't eat anything for the blood test.

97
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,350
Are you hungry?

98
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,570
Yes, indeed.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,990
Have your breakfast.

100
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,490
Okay.

101
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,146
It's all prepared.

102
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Wipe your hands.

103
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,506
I'll get some water.

104
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:33,600
If you feel cold, put the jacket on.

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,300
All right.

106
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,406
It's so lucky of you to have such a considerate daughter.

107
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,270
Brother Xiong.

108
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,422
Did your wife feel unhappy

109
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,840
or quarrel with you last night?

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,991
No. She was just frightened because she didn't know you were there.

111
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,130
She looks pretty and teaches dance as a decent job.

112
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,460
I'm so happy for you to have such a wife.

113
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,700
But if she doesn't allow me to be here,

114
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,940
I'll go right after you tell me.

115
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,980
I can't cause trouble for your peaceful life.

116
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,700
I've made it clear to her. Be assured to work for me. Don't worry.

117
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,230
Go. Okay.

118
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,926
Leave it to me.

119
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:46,300
Though your booth is not big, it is doing good business.

120
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,490
Yes. You're so busy.

121
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,962
But the booth is too hot.

122
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,650
Boss, two sets of wontons.

123
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,126
Two sets of wonton. Okay, two sets of wonton.

124
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,610
Two sets of wonton.

125
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,340
Xiong Wonton makes you on top of the world.

126
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,384
Two sets.

127
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:08,641
Here you are. I don't want this set.

128
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:11,050
Pack another one for me.

129
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,390
What? You forgot to wear a mask.

130
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,396
You spit as you spoke.

131
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:20,391
You old geezer, are you finding trouble?

132
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:23,239
I just said a few words without a mask. How can I spit in it?

133
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:28,448
- You are spitting over our wonton as you're standing here. 
 - Save your words.

134
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:29,840
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,771
Bro, what about remaking a set for you?

136
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,094
- Hold on. 
 - I don't need it.

137
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:37,040
I'll complain your hygiene is unqualified. Wait!

138
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,704
Bullshit!

139
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,980
Bro, calm down.

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,831
Sorry, it's our fault. We didn't wear masks. We'll correct it.

141
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:47,962
In such hot weather, we struggle to run our small business. Please forgive us.

142
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,631
Now it's yours for free. It's inappropriate. It's free.

143
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,320
Welcome to buy it tomorrow if it's good.

144
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,410
All right, I won't mind it for the sake of you.

145
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,660
You'd better fire him as soon as possible.

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,620
I'm so sorry. Take care.

147
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,612
- Get back. 
 - Shut up.

148
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,496
Enough.

149
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:08,390
You don't have to quarrel with guests.

150
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,810
Listen, you should curb your temper.

151
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,199
It's common for us to be wronged in the service industry.

152
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,740
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,110
I'll eat up my own spit.

154
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,180
Hurry to wear your mask.

155
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,840
Right, wear the mask.

156
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,630
Is she your wife?

157
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,930
Why is she here?

158
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,620
I forgot what she said.

159
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,271
Excuse me. Receive the guests for me.

160
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,352
Okay, you go first.

161
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,770
Yuan!

162
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,128
 I saw it all.

163
00:10:53,128 --> 00:10:57,436
 As I imagined, he isn't fit to stay here.

164
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,640
 Give him some time for adaptation.

165
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,840
 Adapt?

166
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,060
 How long?

167
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,220
 One's temper can't be changed in days.

168
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,544
 You can't help him at all in this way.

169
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,680
When I'm able to help him, I can't let him sleep on the street.

170
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,528
 What about me?

171
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,684
 For him, won't you care about my feelings?

172
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,070
Yuan Yuan, listen to me.

173
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,638
Yuan!

174
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,259
Delicious.

175
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:48,951
Spicy broth is boiling. Can I put some meat in?

176
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:50,720
It's ours.

177
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,870
The plain broth is for you.

178
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,170
I just have a taste.

179
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,546
This morning's test result was quite good.

180
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,010
All right, I'll take the plain one as the doctor said.

181
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,710
But Zhan Yan...

182
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,460
Captain, let me make a dipping sauce for you.

183
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,762
Sit down.

184
00:12:12,762 --> 00:12:16,488
Today's hotpot is an exception.

185
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,874
Dad, you just underwent an operation.

186
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:23,150
These days he should have a bland diet,

187
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,610
or I'll replace your broth with water.

188
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,860
Come on.

189
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,891
Dr. Zhan, it's okay not to take the spicy broth,

190
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:31,460
but can't you spare a dipping sauce?

191
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,776
It's the soul of having  hotpot.

192
00:12:33,776 --> 00:12:35,750
I'm a doctor instead of you.

193
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,930
If going on like this...

194
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,370
All right, don't quarrel about this. Okay?

195
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,690
I'll take the plain one.

196
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,980
It's boiling.

197
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,660
Well. Only in the plain broth can the original flavor of ingredients

198
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,790
be utterly revealed on the tongue.

199
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:57,358
Zhan Yan, go fetch some fruits for us.

200
00:12:57,358 --> 00:12:59,150
Can I have some fruit?

201
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,590
- Of course. 
 - Yes.

202
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,562
There she goes.

203
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,896
You're so smart.

204
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:09,478
Taste this.

205
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,200
How do you like it? Spicy ones are better.

206
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,638
Have some more.

207
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,226
Take it secretly.

208
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,740
Just have a taste.

209
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,630
If caught by Yan, I'm cool with it but you'll be in trouble.

210
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,530
I know.

211
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,100
How can we two men be controlled by her?

212
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,210
That's it. What do you mean?

213
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,650
Are you making me your ally to overturn her?

214
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,240
How dare I?

215
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,830
It's no other than asking for trouble.

216
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,980
- Taste good? 
 - She's coming.

217
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,310
Well, try this. The plain broth.

218
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,260
I'm trying the plain one, plain broth.

219
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,960
- Here you are.  
 - Pretty good.

220
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,890
Luo Ben, have some fruits besides meat.

221
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,490
Okay.

222
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,750
What kind of fruit do you want, Dr. Zhan?

223
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,738
Is watermelon okay?

224
00:14:04,738 --> 00:14:07,580

225
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,132
Yan, my belly is full.

226
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,290
Luo Ben, mind your work this afternoon.

227
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,860
- Don't accompany us. 
 - Okay.

228
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,680
Yan, I want to visit your mom.

229
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,180
No problem.

230
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,486
I never expected the disease

231
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:32,300
untied the knot between Yan and me.

232
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,258
That's a blessing in disguise.

233
00:14:35,258 --> 00:14:37,256
Don't worry, Mom.

234
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,294
I'll look after Dad.

235
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,600
I, a so-called heroic dad,

236
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,650
finally exposed my original nature to our daughter.

237
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,322
I'm so relieved,

238
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:58,190
but became a mental burden on her.

239
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,574
It doesn't matter if you're a hero or not.

240
00:15:04,574 --> 00:15:08,630
You've shouldered too much these years.

241
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,002
It's time for me to ease it for you.

242
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,730
Did you hear it?

243
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,022
Yan's so considerate and promising.

244
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:22,790
I don't have to worry about her.

245
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,030
In this life, if I can find that child,

246
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,470
I'll rest assured.

247
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,630
I can go to accompany you without regret.

248
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,474
Don't put it that way.

249
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,940
I'll surely help you find the child.

250
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,620
With Luo Ben by Yan's side,

251
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm so assured.

252
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,080
Luo Ben was that lawyer who I mentioned to you last time.

253
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,264
Now he's part of the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

254
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:01,390
I've tested him. He's great in nature,

255
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,758
and genuinely nice to Yan.

256
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm looking forward to their marriage.

257
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,450
Dad!

258
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,250
You are in such a hurry to marry me off because I have been annoying you for the past few days?

259
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,410
It's getting windy. Let's go back.

260
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
See you.

261
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,914
Yuan Yuan, you're back.

262
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,644
I thought you forgot your brother after marriage.

263
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,442
What happened, Yuan Yuan?

264
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,772
Were you wronged?

265
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:58,412
Did Xiong Fei pick on you?

266
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,070
Tell me everything. I'll help you out.

267
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,142
All right, it's okay.

268
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:18,926
Is Yuan Yuan still angry?

269
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,220
She's not angry, but doesn't know what to do, so she turned to me.

270
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:32,122
It's my fault,

271
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,896
but I can't leave Qiangzi displaced.

272
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,544
I see something of myself in him,

273
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:50,250
just released with no target or job,

274
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,420
and afraid of everyone's discrimination.

275
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,900
The neighboring kids would even avoid me.

276
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,480
Without Captain Qingshan,

277
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,400
I might have stepped onto another wrong path.

278
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:10,110
I understand how you feel and I know you want to help him.

279
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,838
I won't disagree.

280
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,252
But, Xiong Fei, there're many ways to help him.

281
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,830
You don't have to keep him by your side,

282
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,498
especially when your family objected to it.

283
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,062
Do your parents know?

284
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:39,600
I believe if they know, they'd be on Luo Yuan's side to persuade you to send Qiangzi away.

285
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,500
I did think about other ways.

286
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,820
It was quite hard for me to find a job.

287
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,036
I became an expressman, but soon failed.

288
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,166
It'll be much harder to help him find a job.

289
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,996
I'll help find a job for Qiangzi.

290
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,160
Before he finds a new job, Luo Yuan will live with me.

291
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,060
Thanks.

292
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,366
Don't thank me in a hurry.

293
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,200
Xiong Fei, you promised me to take good care of her.

294
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,790
What's the result?

295
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,066
Soon after your marriage,

296
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:25,200
you made her so worried and angry

297
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,410
that she came back to her maiden home.

298
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,950
This time I forgive you for it's reasonable,

299
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,386
but I won't make it easy for you next time.

300
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,070
- Come on. 
 - You brat.

301
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,020
Who's he?

302
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,480
Zhao Zhenkai, a new character and decathlete.

303
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,730
He can fly a helicopter, tall, handsome, and obsessed with Ding Xiaoxiao.

304
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,572
What do you think?

305
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:36,760
How can you let Ding Xiaoxiao betray Zhou Mengmeng?

306
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,060
It's not a betrayal, just a competitive rival in love.

307
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,394
No need.

308
00:20:42,394 --> 00:20:45,634
There's no need for the other man between the two of them,

309
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:47,578
let alone such a formidable man. I object.

310
00:20:47,578 --> 00:20:53,090
Think about it. Once Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng are committed, the plot is no longer intriguing.

311
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,550
Except for adding a new character, I'm at my wit's end.

312
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:59,640
Your creation technique of a love triangle isn't sophisticated at all,

313
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,260
and will be dissed by fans.

314
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,090
Listen to me. You can't add this guy.

315
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,786
Find another way out.

316
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,630
Sounds right.

317
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:12,190
Then should I make the relationship

318
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,830
between Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng more impressive?

319
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,718
That's right.

320
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,444
But I have no love material.

321
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,520
I know. I should find a backup.

322
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,910
No way! Do you hear me? No back-up. Just me.

323
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:35,300
You know? You're strangling me!

324
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,381
Say "I'm wrong."

325
00:21:58,736 --> 00:22:00,700
 Then should I make the relationship

326
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,480
 between Ding Xiaoxiao and Zhou Mengmeng more impressive?

327
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,790
 But I have no love material.

328
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,250
My god.

329
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,926
Has Zhou Mingming been enlightened to gift me with so many skins?

330
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,570
Who's there?

331
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,332
Hi, your packages. Please sign for them.

332
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:28,024
Okay.

333
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,020
What's this?

334
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,930
"Dear Miss Ding Xiaoxiao, you've worked hard.

335
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,806
Though I can't stay up late to write for you,

336
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:42,480
let them safeguard your complexion for me

337
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,584
to keep you shining every day."

338
00:22:45,584 --> 00:22:47,236
Well.

339
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:57,172
 Fool, how can I use all these up?

340
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,210
 Go downstairs. A car is awaiting for you.

341
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,486
 Ending No. 777.

342
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,340
So mysterious.

343
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,616
What's he doing?

344
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,230
Miss Ding, please.

345
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,830
Mingming, it's all ready.

346
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,210
 What's that?

347
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,462
 I also want it.

348
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,030
♫  I want to be a shining star  ♫

349
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,706
♫  I will give out my light  ♫

350
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:27,230
♫  and fly high up in the sky  ♫

351
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,860
♫  Dreams eventually become lighter  ♫

352
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,970
Zhou Mingming!

353
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,240
Zhou Mingming, show up now!

354
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:49,844
♫  Although everything can't go as planned  ♫

355
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:55,215
♫  I'm more stable than the wind and rain  ♫

356
00:25:55,215 --> 00:26:00,190
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

357
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:06,550
♫  Still, I light up the way for others  ♫

358
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,430
♫  I think I'm a star  ♫

359
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:18,582
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

360
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:46,310
♫  When I see the crowd  ♫

361
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,910
♫  You became a star  ♫

362
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:57,570
♫  Like the shadow of a soaring dove  ♫

363
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:02,990
♫  Your sweet smile is like a dream to me  ♫

364
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:07,820
♫  I am alone in this lively world  ♫

365
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,688
I want to be your knight.

366
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:14,488
When you're in need, I'll accompany and guard you forever.

367
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,790
Do you want to be my princess?

368
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:25,527
♫  I only have eyes for you  ♫

369
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:30,510
♫  The world is getting brighter  ♫

370
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:34,650
♫  Within glistening teardrops there is my love for you  ♫

371
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,810
 So happy!

372
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,870
♫  Two free forms  ♫

373
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:43,970
♫  Embrace the world  ♫

374
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,454
Today's a special day.

375
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,220
In the past few days,

376
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,198
we've done many things and talked a lot.

377
00:27:52,198 --> 00:27:55,100
Every time when I meet with setbacks in life or work,

378
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,268
I'll recall these memories.

379
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,948
I can't imagine the rest of my life without you,

380
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,622
so...

381
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,960
So what?

382
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,512
So...

383
00:28:14,064 --> 00:28:15,805
I wish you a happy weekend!

384
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:16,712
What do you think?

385
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:20,166
You must have accumulated many writing materials of love.

386
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,790
Are these all for writing materials?

387
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,030
Of course.

388
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,421
You feel full of ideas to write all kinds of plots, right?

389
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,204
Let me put it on for you.

390
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,250
- Hurry. 
 - Okay.

391
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,380
Do you like it?

392
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,240
Very much.

393
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,550
That's great.

394
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,920
Let me know when you are short of material.

395
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,550
I've so many plans.

396
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,294
Knothead!

397
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,640
Hello?

398
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,190
Okay.

399
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,926
Thank you.

400
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:27,020
Brother Xiong, any emergency?

401
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,680
Do your business. Leave it to me.

402
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,160
Nothing.

403
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,410
Set up that table. Let's have a drink.

404
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,580
Okay.

405
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,090
- Want some beer? 
 - It's a must!

406
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:40,258
Well, I'm on it.

407
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:58,397
You must have been exhausted these days.

408
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,150
Not at all.

409
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,470
Business is so good.

410
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,400
I think it's so hopeful.

411
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,280
I'm not exhausted.

412
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,300
Brother Qiang, I'm telling you...

413
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,400
From tomorrow, you don't have to work for me.

414
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,993
I see, Bro. I'll leave tomorrow.

415
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:20,620
It's not the case. Wait a second.

416
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:27,890
I don't need you here for I asked a friend to find you another job.

417
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,630
What?

418
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,680
To be a warehouse keeper for a plant.

419
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,560
Provided with board and lodging, you'll be paid a salary with social security.

420
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,650
The requirement is to live in the plant with no cares.

421
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,742
You're quite fit for it,

422
00:30:45,742 --> 00:30:48,464
but I wonder if you're willing or not.

423
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,560
- Take care. 
 - I'm fine.

424
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,650
Thanks, Bro.

425
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,590
You know, it became a trendy topic this soon.

426
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,840
That scene is so impressive.

427
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,000
At least hundreds of drones flying over to me.

428
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,800
I was shocked. Wonderful.

429
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
But Zhou Mingming is a knothead.

430
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,550
He took out a box.

431
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:21,220
I thought he'd propose to me with the ring inside, but it was a necklace.

432
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,550
He even wished me a happy weekend.

433
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:26,878
I even wanted to kick him.

434
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,080
Forget it.

435
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,540
He has been so busy with work, and prepared a surprise for me.

436
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,564
I won't make a fuss over it.

437
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,310
Why hasn't Xiong Fei come to pick you up?

438
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,760
Did he text and apologize to you?

439
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,540
What is this knothead thinking?

440
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,210
Give me your phone. Let me call him.

441
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,270
There you go.

442
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,920
Listen!  If he doesn't come, you can't go back.

443
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,040
You must have principles or you'll suffer a lot. Got it?

444
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,450
One more chance.

445
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,970
How many things did you steal?

446
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,490
Give them out honestly.

447
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,400
Chief, I told you many times I didn't steal them at all.

448
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,500
Once you came, goods have been disappearing.

449
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,400
If you didn't, did I steal them?

450
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I'm not the only keeper.

451
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,400
One's nature is hard to be changed.

452
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,100
- What do you mean? 
 - Brother Qiang!

453
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,300
- Make it clear. 
 - Enough.

454
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,600
Who are you?

455
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,300
Who asked you in?

456
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,200
I'm his friend.

457
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,700
You said he stole things.

458
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700
Show the evidence.

459
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,100
I don't have enough cigarettes.

460
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,500
Go get some more for me.

461
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,900
Over there.

462
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
Or apologize to him.

463
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,900
You put a good word for him.

464
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,300
Are you colluding to steal my goods?

465
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,400
- Go. 
 - Hurry.

466
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,900
I'll kick you off for slandering my bro.

467
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,900

468
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,524
Will the Chief suspect us?

469
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't be afraid.

470
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,100
Qiangzi is our scapegoat.

471
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,100
50/50 split. Keep your word.

472
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,400
I know.

473
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
This afternoon we've to paint the wall. Let me take a nap.

474
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,900

475
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,600
President Wang, the scale of Jilu Group's warehouse is so large.

476
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,200
We used to focus on the overseas market.

477
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,000
Now we're working on improving our brand's domestic popularity,

478
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,200
realizing the dual circulation of domestic and foreign trade.

479
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,000
Mr. Luo, our company just set up its domestic business.

480
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,200
We're not familiar with business policies.

481
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,200
I hope you'll help us with legal risk prevention.

482
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,800
Don't worry.

483
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,600
It's on fire!

484
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,800
My materials!

485
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
My Russian orders!

486
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
Call 119.

487
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,000
Ariel, give me your silk scarf.

488
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
 It's on fire. Go!

489
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,800
 Go! Go!

490
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Stand up.

491
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,200
Go!

492
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,300
Anyone inside? Anyone inside?

493
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,300

Take him out.

510
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,600
Do him a favor.

511
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,300
Caution upstairs! Put out the fire.

512
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,500
- Anyone here? 
 - Anyone here?

513
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,600

514
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,300
Hurry!

515
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,100

00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,400
Anyone inside?

520
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
Someone's upstairs.

521
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300

530
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,800
Xiong Fei, the fire is getting close.

531
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
We can't go downstairs.

532
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,700
Send them down the window with the fire hose. Hurry.

533
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,400
Okay.

534
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,400
 What shall we do?

535
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,400
Luo Ben!

536
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,000
Don't let go!

537
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Hold tight!

538
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,000
Don't let go!

539
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,800
 Don't let go!

540

 Never let go!

544
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
Slowly!

545
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,600
Take care!

546
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,200
Don't worry.

547
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,800
Luo Ben! Luo Ben!

548
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
Take care!

549
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,200
 Take care.

550
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,600
 - Slowly. 
 - Hurry! Are you okay?

551
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:46,500
- You first. I'll follow you. 
 - Xiong Fei, cut the crap.

552
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,200
You first.

553
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,200
If anything bad happens to you, how can I explain this to Luo Yuan?

554
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,100
- Follow me. 
 - I know.

555
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,500
Luo Ben, hurry and get down!

556
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Take care!

557
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,200
 Slowly, it's too dangerous!

558
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,300
 Take care. Slowly!

559
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,400
 Slow down.

560
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,850
 Step firmly!

561
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,800
 Take care. Hold tight!

562
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,800
 Step by step!

563
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,300
 - Almost there! 
 - Slowly!

564
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,200
 It's too high. Must step firmly.

565
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,500
 - Slow down. 
 - Take care!

566
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,300
 - Hold tight! 
 - Drag.

567
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,500
 - Slowly! 
 - Injured?

568
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,300
 Fine.

569
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,400
Luo Ben, hurry!

570
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,100
Luo Ben!

571
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,800
Luo Ben!

572
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,800

573
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,900
The patient broke his leg falling from a high place.

574
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,400
After falling to the ground, it was was crushed by falling heavy objects.

575
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,600
From the results of various examinations,

576
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,420
it can be seen that crush syndrome has formed concurrently with compartment syndrome

577
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,300
which is life threatening.

578
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,800
Therefore, our orthopedic diagnosis is amputation.

579
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,200
Isn't there a Plan B?

580
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,800
Even if we try to salvage the limbs and it succeeds,

581
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,200
he'll still be troubled by severe limb dysfunction.

582
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,800

583
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:17,090

584
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,300
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

585
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,944
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

586
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:41,896
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

587
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,900
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

588
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:57,200
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

589
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,800
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

590
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:12,000
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

591
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,300
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

592
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:28,200
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

593
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:34,400
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

594
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:43,200
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

595
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:50,800
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

596
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,600
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

597
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,300
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

598
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,000
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

599
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,800
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

600
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,500
♫  I can't fly  ♫

601
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,200
♫  But I can look up  ♫

602
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,200
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
