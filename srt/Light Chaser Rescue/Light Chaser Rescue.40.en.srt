Hurry. Go.

Are you there?

24
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,940
Xiong Fei, Xiong Fei.

25
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,250
We have found Zhan Yan.

26
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,810
Captain Xiong Fei,

27
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,300
we can't go any further.

28
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,810
The storm is coming.

29
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,770
Are you not afraid to die?

30
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,490
Yes.

31
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,740
We are all afraid.

32
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,700
But our teammates

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,210
are waiting for us.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,930
We're like family.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,300
If it was your family trapped inside,

36
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,050
would you not keep going?

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,140
But you don't have
to advance with us.

38
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,610
Just turn back.

39
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,020
Let's keep moving.

(Linjiang Central Hospital

41
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait for me.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,330
I'm willing

43
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,490
to risk my life.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,830
Without me,

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,330
the advancement would take longer.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,960
Follow me, brother.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,930
Thank you.

48
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,930
Follow me!

49
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,180
Watch out.

50
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,570
Are you okay?

51
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,640
Keep going.

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,100
OK.

53
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,390
Is the rope fixed?

54
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,300
In a minute.

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,870
The storm is crazy.

56
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,050
If it goes on,

57
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,370
you will die.

58
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:56,450
We'd better take shelter for now.

59
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,930
If I don't descend now,

60
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,250
the one down there
will be in greater danger.

61
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,660
Mr. Lordan,

62
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,870
you take Dr. Cai and the others

63
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,420
to find shelter.

64
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,300
OK.

65
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,510
Luo Ben.

66
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,300
Zhan Yan, hang in there.

67
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,980
Be safe, Luo Ben.

68
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,420
Is it ready?

69
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,450
Luo Ben,

70
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,070
the cordage is ready.

71
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,610
OK.

72
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,810
Luo Ben, be safe.

73
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,370
Zhan Yan.

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,050
Zhan Yan.

75
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,740
Zhan Yan, wake up.

76
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,810
It's me, Luo Ben.

77
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,340
I'm here to save you.

78
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,130
Come on.

79
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,420
How do you feel?

80
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,430
Luo Ben…

81
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,010
It's me.

82
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,100
Is it a dream?

83
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,100
No, it's not a dream.

84
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,180
It's me.

85
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,690
I'm here.

86
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,610
Hang in there.

87
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,860
Come on.

88
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,570
Drink some hot water.

89
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,180
Easy.

90
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:48,810
So?

91
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,450
Feeling better?

92
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,430
I thought I'd never see you again.

93
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,250
No.

94
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,690
I'll get you out soon.

95
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,250
Captain,

96
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,800
he's expecting you

97
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,900
at home.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,450
Zhan Yan.

99
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,660
Zhan Yan, stay awake.

100
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,810
Zhan Yan.

101
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,450
Zhan Yan, stay awake.

102
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,370
Zhan Yan!

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,130
Zhan Yan, you know what?

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,540
After you left,

105
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,490
I made many phone calls to you.

106
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,780
Why didn't you pick them up?

107
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,660
I always wanted you to know

108
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,950
that I care

109
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,930
about the past,

110
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,610
but what I care

111
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,900
about more

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,370
is you, Zhan Yan.

113
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,420
I can't afford to lose you.

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,900
Zhan Yan, hang in there.

115
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,690
I'll take you out now.

116
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,010
Stay strong.

117
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,540
Watch out!

118
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,610
How do you feel?

119
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,740
Are you okay?

120
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:18,610
Come on.

121
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,380
Pull!

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,810
Pull!

123
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,210
Very close!

124
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,020
Easy.

125
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,090
Be careful.

126
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,660
How are you, Zhan Yan?

127
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm okay.

128
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:27,900
Good. Let's go.

129
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,730
Luo Ben! Luo Ben! Luo Ben!

130
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,380
Are you alright?

131
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,380
I'm good.

132
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,570
We'll get you out now.

133
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,020
OK.

134
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,260
I'm coming up.

135
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,180
Watch out! Fall back!

136
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,780
How is it?

137
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,990
Don't worry.

138
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,930
Guoguo's operation was a success.

139
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,570
You get some rest.

140
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,020
She'll be out soon.

141
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,090
Thank you, doctor.

142
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,850
Perfect.

143
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,780
Mrs. Zhang,

144
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,560
I just received the message.

145
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,120
Dapeng has been sent

146
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,620
to the hospital.

147
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,360
Don't worry.

148
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,810
He'll be okay.

149
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,810
Thank you.

150
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,050
Let's go.

151
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,260
Zhan Yan.

152
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,780
Don't worry.

153
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,500
They have gone to Luo Ben's rescue.

154
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,850
He'll be fine.

155
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,730
You listen to me.

156
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,450
Conserve your energy.

157
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,990
I will treat

158
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,260
your wound later,

159
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,180
or you'll get frostbite.

160
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,780
Luo Ben!

161
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,210
Luo Ben!

162
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,690
Luo Ben!

163
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:24,970
Luo Ben!

164
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,660
Luo Ben!

165
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,150
Luo Ben, can you hear me?

166
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,020
Luo Ben!

167
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,260
He should be down there.

168
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,540
Xiong Fei,

169
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,510
it isn't working.

170
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,690
We can't break the ice.

171
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,720
I must get him out.

172
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,780
Xiong Fei, calm down.

173
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,810
Xiong Fei.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,380
You have to try, don't you?

175
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,970
Do you have any other ways?

176
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:58,780
Xiong Fei,

177
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,630
Luo Ben's life is in danger.

178
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,600
I, too, want to save him.

179
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,080
But the ice is too thick.

180
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,540
No way you're gonna break the ice.

181
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,260
Xiong Fei.

182
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,620
Get up!

183
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,330
Xiong Fei!

184
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:12,570
Luo Ben's in peril.

185
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,050
You're in charge.

186
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,730
Xiong Fei, have you found him?

187
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,820
Yes.

188
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,450
Dapeng and Zhan Yan are both safe.

189
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,380
Excellent.

190
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,820
Good work.

191
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,180
Xiong Fei,

192
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,560
on your way back,

193
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,690
make sure you're safe.

194
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,060
Captain,

195
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,340
Luo Ben…

196
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,530
What?

197
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,660
He got Zhan Yan out,

198
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,620
but he didn't make it out.

199
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,930
What?

200
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,930
He's fallen into a deeper place.

201
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,010
The entrance is blocked by ice.

202
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,580
It's all on me.

203
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,320
I…

204
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,970
I failed to protect my teammate.

205
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,950
Xiong Fei,

206
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,870
now is not the time

207
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,150
to blame yourself.

208
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,600
Luo Ben is trapped in a crevasse.

209
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,840
You gotta work out a method

210
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,040
to get him out.

211
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,580
Dad.

212
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,290
Yan.

213
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,910
You'll listen to Xiong Fei.

214
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,420
Tears are pointless at the moment.

215
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,930
Just level with me.

216
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,100
What are the chances?

217
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,250
Yan,

218
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,360
the survival rate
of a crevasse rescue

219
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,580
is very low,

220
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,430
but it is not

221
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,490
entirely hopeless.

222
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,380
(Judging from the falling time,)

223
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,420
(I should be under snow layer.)

224
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,690
(I'll most likely reach
an underground river.)

225
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:53,250
(Where there's a way,)

226
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,180
(there's hope.)

227
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,690
He's right there.

228
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,560
There must be a way

229
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,930
to get him out.

230
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,530
The chance seems slim to me.

231
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,840
Because the crevasse

232
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,530
is completely sealed.

233
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,470
I say

234
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,600
he's fallen into hell.

235
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,690
No.

236
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,970
There must be another way.

237
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,620
Even if we can get him out,

238
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,340
it's unlikely that he'll be alive.

239
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,420
He sacrifices his life.

240
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,100
And it's so high.

241
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,630
He trades his life for someone else's.

242
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,060
It's a real honor.

243
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,820
I won't leave him here.

244
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,530
Even if he's dead,

245
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,180
we'll get his dead body out.

246
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,530
Yan.

247
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,770
One English mountain climber

248
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,970
fell into a crevasse

249
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,010
on the Andes Mountain.

250
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,420
But he didn't give up.

251
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,530
168 hours.

252
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,000
He fought 168 hours.

253
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,820
Eventually,

254
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,150
he got out of the crevasse

255
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,490
and returned to the camp.

256
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,140
Sure,

257
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,210
I admit it's a miracle.

258
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,860
Yan, any news?

259
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,490
Dad,

260
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,610
what do the curved lines

261
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,530
stand for on the map?

262
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,660
Let me see.

263
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,340
Rivers, I suppose.

264
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,420
Rivers?

265
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,580
Yes.

266
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,140
The ice and snow melt

267
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,820
into rivers,

268
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,290
becoming the sources
of other rivers or streams.

269
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,450
Yan,

270
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,210
there may be underground rivers
beneath the crevasse.

271
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,100
What has occurred to you, Dad?

272
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,150
We have been looking for openings

273
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,760
above the crevasse,

274
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,660
hoping that Luo Ben will climb out.

275
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:52,950
But would it be possible

276
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,250
that he's going downward?

277
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,450
Going downward?

278
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,120
Once he finds an underground river,

279
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,080
he'll follow its direction

280
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,710
and get out of the snow mountain.

281
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,660
Yes.

282
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,340
There's still hope.

283
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,100
Mrs. Ruan,

284
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,040
do you think it's possible

285
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,520
that Luo Ben can be found
through my cousin's method?

286
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,180
It's theoretically feasible.

287
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,140
If they'll have more helpers tomorrow,

288
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,820
the chance should be higher.

289
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,620
Yuan, what are you doing here?

290
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,770
Neither my brother nor Xiong Fei
replied to my messages,

291
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,290
so I had to come.

292
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,060
What's going on?

293
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,560
Your brother

294
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,450
fell into a crevasse during the rescue.

295
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,690
We can't get hold of him.

296
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,930
What happened?

297
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,490
How did he fall into a crevasse?

298
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,180
My brother…

299
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,620
Yuan, calm down. Listen to me.

300
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,900
Now, everybody's working together
to find him.

301
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,690
We think

302
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,840
that no news

303
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,710
is the best news.

304
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,280
Trust me,

305
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,530
everything will be fine.

306
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,690
There, there.

307
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,210
Yes, Mr. Wang.

308
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,670
Local guides, villagers.

309
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,580
The more, the better.

310
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:26,800
Find every river

311
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,910
within the 3-kilometer radius
around the crevasse,

312
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,860
and go upstream.

313
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,760
If they find any clue,

314
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,730
notify us immediately.

315
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,690
OK.

316
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,150
We'll be on the move.

317
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,600
Bring a drone for the search.

318
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,140
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

319
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,970
Luo Ben.

320
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,060
Keep going.

321
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,770
Don't give up.

322
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,380
You will get out of here.

323
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,010
Zhan Yan is waiting for you.

324
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,180
You must get out of here alive.

325
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,210
Alive.

326
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:15,430
We…

327
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,290
We go this way up.

328
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,430
Everybody,

329
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:20,900
you must be careful.

330
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,060
Don't be reckless, okay?

331
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,530
Thanks.

332
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,210
Is everyone ready?

333
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,970
- Yes.
- Yes.

334
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,770
We must be extra careful

335
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,770
during the night search.

336
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,690
Follow your guides closely.

337
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,320
You mustn't be separated.

338
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,710
Perform an inch-by-inch search.

339
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,450
Keep in touch.

340
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,560
- OK.
- OK. Got it.

341
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,490
Action!

342
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,930
You take a break.

343
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,420
The guide and I will check
the way ahead.

344
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,820
I'll come with you.

345
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,930
Me, too.

346
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,840
You have searched
the whole snow mountain

347
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,380
for the entire night.

348
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,380
Still no luck.

349
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:59,000
I think his chance of survival

350
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,420
