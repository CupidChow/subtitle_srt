2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,850
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,550
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:35,420
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,470
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,070
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,970
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,670
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,980

20
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,480
It has been 100 meters.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,180
This hole is so deep.

22
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,690
Yes.

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,499
Member One reporting.

24
00:01:50,499 --> 00:01:53,000
The depth is 100 meters.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
No survivor has been found.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,860
Please be psychologically prepared for the worst result.

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,939
He... He'll survive.

28
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:02,480
He'll be fine.

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,660
You haven't found him, right?

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,360
Please! Please save my son.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,940
Please save my son.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,046
- Please. 
 - Stand up.

33
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:09,400
He must be alive.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,799
We'll try our best to look for him.

35
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,760
I totally understand you.

36
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,180
But it is 100 meters.

37
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,899
There is no chance that he could survive.

38
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:22,960
At least, let me see him for the last time.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,619
Sir, don't worry.

40
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:29,659
No matter how hard it is, our rescue team will find Wei.

41
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,579
I promise you.

42
00:02:38,059 --> 00:02:40,980
Member One and Two, continue to go down.

43
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,060
 Be careful.

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,780
Let's go.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,359
The hole wall is getting more and more slippery.

46
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,160
Xiong Fei, be careful.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,600
Okay.

48
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,360
Xiong Fei! Xiong Fei!

49
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,179
Director Liu, look.

50
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,700
Member One, what happened?

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,999
Member Two's rope is out of position. He is adjusting.

52
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:35,779
Xiong Fei, be careful. Give me your hand.

53
00:03:35,779 --> 00:03:38,220
 Be sure to be careful. Be careful.

54
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,659
Hold on. I'll tie a knot.

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,360
Member Two has adjusted.

56
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,220
Safe.

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
Copy that.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,380
Be careful, Captain.

59
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,039
Okay.

60
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,320
It's 200 meters now.

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,379
Director Liu, they've already surpassed 200 meters.

62
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:07,400
Their energy must be used up. I suggest we change to another group.

63
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:12,900
Member One and Two, report the situation.

64
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,420
Member One reporting.

65
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,580
We're still going down.

66
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,300
The hole wall is slippery.

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,219
There is no place to step. It's difficult.

68
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:29,839
Director Liu, for safety concerns, ask them to go up.

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,259
Member One and Two, for safety concerns, stop going down.

70
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:41,159
 Come up now!

71
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:46,980
Member One copies that.

72
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,100
Member Two copies that.

73
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,660
Are you okay?

74
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm fine, it's just a few scratches.

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,619
This way.

76
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,519
Director.

77
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,180
Captain.

78
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:22,799
Sir and Madam, about Wei, we feel...

79
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,919
Don't look for him anymore.

80
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,840
The hole is so deep. Wei must have died.

81
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,439
Just regard Wei was laid to rest.

82
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,259
Don't let members of the rescue team get injured again.

83
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,000
Sir and Madam, please don't worry.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,919
We'll figure out another rescue plan.

85
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:51,520
Just go back and get some rest.

86
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,760
Okay?

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,420
Please wait.

88
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,780
Captain.

89
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,240
After the sun rises tomorrow, we'll go down again.

90
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,319
We'll surely bring Wei out.

91
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,059
- Thank you. 
 - Okay.

92
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:07,279
Thank you so much.

93
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,860
Get some rest.

94
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,280
Go back and get some rest.

95
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,440
You've seen it.

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,260
Because the rescue is too difficult, his parents have given up searching.

97
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,819
But we have to go down and find his body.

98
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:34,419
This is the respect for life, as well as the best comfort for his parents.

99
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:38,059
Xiong Fei and I went down about 200 meters.

100
00:06:38,059 --> 00:06:41,620
There are safety stations, as well as fix points.

101
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,540
When we go down the second time, it will be more effective.

102
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:49,819
Captain, let Peng and I go down tomorrow.

103
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:51,699
No.

104
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:53,860
Xiong Fei and I will go down.

105
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,860
We are more familiar with the hole.

106
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,399
I agree.

107
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,059
Get some rest.

108
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,579
After the sun rises, let's go down the second time.

109
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,179
 - Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

110
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,819
 How's the situation there?

111
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:01,040

112
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,110

113
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,959
 - Check this. 
 - Okay.

114
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,379
Xiong Fei.

115
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,219
He's there.

116
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,539
Okay.

117
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,819
 Member One reporting.

118
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,180
We found the body.

119
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,579
What's wrong, Captain?

120
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:50,900
It's frozen soil.

121
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,420
The soil layer here is very unstable.

122
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,279
- We need to hurry up. 
 - Okay.

123
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,259
Come on.

124
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,519
He has no vital signs.

125
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,879
Xiong Fei, pack his body.

126
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,279
Okay.

127
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,720
We've packed the body. Please lift it.

128
00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:38,000
 Lifting.

129
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:54,659
Xiong Fei, let's go up as well.

130
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,019
Okay.

131
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,559
Xiong Fei, be careful!

132
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,000
Member One. Member One.

133
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,380
Member Two. Member Two.

134
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,959
How's the situation, Member Two?

135
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,800
Captain.

136
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,040
Captain.

137
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,700
Captain.

138
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,780
Captain, hold on.

139
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,979
Xiong Fei. Xiong Fei!

140
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,820
Answer me if you hear me.

141
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,180
Captain, answer me if you hear me.

142
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,160
Answer me if you hear me.

143
00:13:29,979 --> 00:13:31,380
There must be something wrong.

144
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,740
We lost connection with them.

145
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,779
Luo Ben. Peng. Rescue them.

146
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,040
 Yes, sir!

147
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,850
Captain.

148
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:04,660
Captain.

149
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,560
- Are you okay, Captain? 
 - Are you okay?

150
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,899
Captain. Check to see what's wrong with Captain.

151
00:14:18,219 --> 00:14:20,020
It's frozen soil.

152
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,700
They have hypothermia now.

153
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,239
- Peng, let them wear dry clothes. 
 - Okay.

154
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:28,000
Warm them up!

155
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,339
Xiong Fei, what happened?

156
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,900
The frozen soil fell.

157
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,500
Captain pushed me away and was buried.

158
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,560
Come on.

159
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,680
Give Xiong Fei one.

160
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,280
Here.

161
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:48,340
Come on. Bring them out of here.

162
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,079
Let's go. Go.

163
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,740
Hold on, Captain.

164
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:59,479
Zhan Yan, don't work too hard when you go to Fengxi.

165
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,620
And don't forget us.

166
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,099
Come back often to see us.

167
00:15:03,099 --> 00:15:06,079
Don't worry. Zhan Yan will come back even if you don't say that.

168
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,879
Not for you, but to date her boyfriend.

169
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,799
That's enough.

170
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,119
Okay, go back.

171
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:14,880
Call me if you have time.

172
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
Zhan Yan, we wish you all the best.

173
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,620
Take care of yourself.

174
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,020
Bye-bye.

175
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,859
Zhan Yan, bye-bye.

176
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,499
Zhan Yan.

177
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,699
Something happened to Captain.

178
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:34,080
He is still in a coma.

179
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,199
 We're on the way to the hospital.

180
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,539
 Zhan Yan, do you hear me?

181
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:47,659
Sorry, doctor. My father is in an emergency.

182
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:48,980
I have to go now.

183
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,339
Okay, we'll wait for you in Fengxi.

184
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:52,759
Thank you.

185
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,220
- Come on, follow her. 
 - What's wrong?

186
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,660

187
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,840
Move away!

188
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,919
- Move! 
 - Move!

189
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,860
Move away! Move away!

190
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,900

191
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,159
This way! Come on!

192
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,219
Ruoxi, arrange the physical examination! Zirui, bring me my gown!

193
00:16:18,219 --> 00:16:19,499
Okay.

194
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,860
Come on.

195
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,259
The patient is awake now. He is fine.

196
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,700
From the x-ray, his trauma is not serious.

197
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
It's a scapular fracture.

198
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,800
This is his old wound. He was injured last time.

199
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,620
But we found the patient's underlying disease.

200
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,899
His stomach has a tumor growing in the upper cardia.

201
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,019
This position is dangerous.

202
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,959
The size and shape are suspected to be malignant.

203
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:06,139
Of course. We still need to see the results of tissue tests.

204
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,100
Why are you staying with me?

205
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,179
There is nothing wrong with me.

206
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:23,060
Don't make it so serious.

207
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,960
Uncle, we only informed some people. Only we know about it.

208
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,899
You all have your jobs.

209
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,600
Just do your work.

210
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
The doctors and nurses here will take care of me.

211
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,479
Just go back.

212
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,339
I'll be here with you.

213
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:45,099
I'll fetch some hot water.

214
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,600
I'll be here with you, too.

215
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,219
Xiong Fei, you should have had a wedding ceremony yesterday.

216
00:18:02,219 --> 00:18:03,899
But you went on a mission.

217
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,360
This wedding ceremony is quite meaningful.

218
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:12,299
There is a tumor in Captain's stomach?

219
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:16,339
I guess he doesn't know it himself.

220
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,479
He lives alone.

221
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,879
He has meals irregularly.

222
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:26,020
Sometimes he eats cold food.

223
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,639
See?

224
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:29,720
There is something wrong with his stomach.

225
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:34,959
I'll check it carefully for him.

226
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,739
Zhan Yan, be nice to him when you are checking it.

227
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,960
Don't treat him like an enemy.

228
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,160
As a doctor, you should know that tumor formation has a lot to do with the patient's emotions.

229
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,879
Although Captain talks less,

230
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:57,799
he hides many things in his mind and is not willing to say them.

231
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,999
Real illnesses are easy to cure, but mental illnesses are hard to heal.

232
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,000
I know you'll be angry if I say too much,

233
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,260
but I want to say it today.

234
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,659
Zhan Yan, make up with Captain.

235
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:20,880
He is the only family member you have.

236
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,619
If anything happens,

237
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,680
you will surely regret it.

238
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,579
You won't forgive yourself for your whole life.

239
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,200

240
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,400

241
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,280
Sorry to let you worry about me.

242
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,339
I'm fine.

243
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,039
Really.

244
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,619
Sorry, Yuan Yuan.

245
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:19,719
I left you alone on our wedding day,

246
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,999
and let you worry about me.

247
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,779
Let's go.

248
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,980
Let's go.

249
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,440
No wonder you ran so fast.

250
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,839
You told Luo Yuan that Xiong Fei was injured?

251
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,319
She must be worried about him.

252
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,840
Yuan is my friend. I can't hide it from her.

253
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,140
But my uncle, he is always almighty in my heart.

254
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,379
I think we cared too less about him.

255
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,759
You're right.

256
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,500
The Captain is just a few years younger than my mom.

257
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
I should care more about my mom.

258
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,160
I won't argue with my parents anymore.

259
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,980
Dingding, my mom's birthday is coming.

260
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
How about going with me?

261
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,279
This is a good chance.

262
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,620
Wait and see how I deal with my future mother-in-law.

263
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:38,120
I'm sorry I haven't given you a full wedding.

264
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,120
But my promise to you is full.

265
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,120
I love you, Yuan Yuan.

266
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,080
I've never been as happy as now.

267
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,519
And I have never imagined...

268
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,740
a nice girl like you...

269
00:22:18,939 --> 00:22:20,640
would fall in love with me...

270
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,800
and marry me.

271
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,780
 Marrying you...

272
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,660
 is the happiest thing for me.

273
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,219
I got to know the conflict between Zhan Yan and Captain.

274
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,700
Now Captain is ill.

275
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,639
Well, is there a way to ease the relationship between them?

276
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:19,720
It has been so many years, we figured out many solutions.

277
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
But about explaining the misunderstanding,

278
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,439
they are the ones to do it, especially Qingshan.

279
00:23:25,439 --> 00:23:28,519
There is something he should say himself.

280
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,920
Captain wants to ease the relationship with Zhan Yan so much.

281
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,560
Why is there something he can't say?

282
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,270

283
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,759
Did you get the result?

284
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,220
Yes.

285
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,180
Thanks.

286
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,519
How is it?

287
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,319
Uncle Zhan, get some rest. I'll leave.

288
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,279
- Thank you. 
 - Bye-bye.

289
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,420
How is it?

290
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,139
Not good. It has spread.

291
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,359
Uncle Zhan's lifestyle is so healthy, why did he...

292
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,540
 This is a chronic ailment.

293
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,220
 And he didn't notice it in his daily life.

294
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,879
 If he didn't have a checkup this time, we wouldn't have known about it.

295
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,500
What did Zhan Yan say?

296
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,039
She said nothing.

297
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:51,960
But I can tell, she is ambivalent.

298
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,319
 How could she be like this?

299
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,939
 Uncle Zhan is so ill now.

300
00:24:54,939 --> 00:24:57,960
 If they don't make up with each other, there'll be no chance in the future.

301
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,519
- Why couldn't she forgive Uncle Zhan? 
 - Be quiet.

302
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,460
Don't let Captain hear it.

303
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,099
At this time, we can't irritate Captain.

304
00:25:07,099 --> 00:25:08,619
 I know.

305
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,199
 Okay, I'll check Captain.

306
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:17,579
Remember, don't mention this to anyone else.

307
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:18,980
Don't worry.

308
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,160
- Just go. 
 - Bye-bye.

309
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,899
Captain, how do you feel now?

310
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:49,099
Luo Ben,

311
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:50,960
have you gotten the checkup report?

312
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,119
What's the result? Let me have a look.

313
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,739
Zhan Yan took that report away.

314
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,999
It's okay, don't worry. I've seen it.

315
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,600
It's a benign one.

316
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,180
You can understand that?

317
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,620
Zhan Yan told me about it.

318
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,860
She said it would be good to have an excision.

319
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,480
She asked me to tell you to just relax and not to worry.

320
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,199
You added the last sentence, right?

321
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:21,660
I can hide nothing from you.

322
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,539
Yes, she didn't say the last sentence.

323
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:27,299
But it's okay.

324
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:31,040
You only need to excise the tumor.

325
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,039
You don't trust me?

326
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,500
Don't be nervous. Relax.

327
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,699
You'll recover soon.

328
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,319
Luo Ben, just go to work.

329
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,839
I...

330
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,400
I'm fine.

331
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,160
I want to get some sleep.

332
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

333
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,980
Captain, call me if you need anything.

334
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:56,320
Get some rest. I shall leave now.

335
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:33,380
Why did you come out? Go back and rest.

336
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,100
I want to tell you something.

337
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,239
Tell me after you recover.

338
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:40,400
I want to tell you now.

339
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,740
Let's go.

340
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,299
Be careful.

341
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,940
I know all about it.

342
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,859
Know what?

343
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,699
The tumor is malignant.

344
00:27:59,699 --> 00:28:01,619
And it has spread.

345
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,559
Who told you this?

346
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,879
It's not important.

347
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:11,919
Yan, if I don't tell you now,

348
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,479
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to tell you.

349
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,320
I don't care who told you this.

350
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,219
I'm here to inform you, your tumor is benign.

351
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:29,099
All you need to do is to wait for the indicators to reach the standard and then have an operation.

352
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:31,680
You don't need to comfort me. I'm mentally prepared.

353
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,940
Just listen to me.

354
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:37,859
Say it.

355
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,980
I know I'm not a good father, nor a good husband.

356
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,619
I couldn't protect my family.

357
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,159
In that earthquake,

358
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:57,220
your mom was buried in the ruins of the hotel.

359
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:01,980
Not far from her, there were three people.

360
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,639
They were trapped closer to me.

361
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:07,319
It was easier to rescue them.

362
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:11,379
I know. I have heard these words many times during the years.

363
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:14,539
Those were not the truth.

364
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:17,159
I went to save your mom first.

365
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,980
What did you say?

366
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,620
You were little.

367
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,559
After the earthquake, I asked other survivors to take care of you,

368
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,559
and went back to save your mom immediately.

369
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,660
 Xiaojie, I see you. Don't move.

370
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,360
 Xiaojie. Xiaojie.

371
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,440
 Xiaojie, don't move.

372
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,580
 Yan is safe. Don't worry.

373
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,820
 Are you okay? I'll save you now, Xiaojie.

374
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,119
 - Anyone out there? 
 - Help.

375
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,620
 Anyone? Help.

376
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,820
 Help.

377
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,499
 Save our child.

378
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,039
 Save our child first.

379
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,639
I couldn't let you lose your mom,

380
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:08,020
so I ignored their begging

381
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,399
and saved your mom first.

382
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,500
This is the truth.

383
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,079
But in the newspaper,

384
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,939
it said you saved the kid first.

385
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:28,840
And there was an aftershock, that couple and my mom died.

386
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,039
 You said, when you saw my mom, she had died.

387
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,140
 You liar.

388
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,820
 Then, why didn't she survive?

389
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,639
 Why did the newspaper say you saved the boy first?

390
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:42,499
What the reporters saw may not be the truth.

391
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm dying now. Why should I cheat you?

392
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,320
At that time, I knew nothing about rescue.

393
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,479
I just wanted to rescue your mom,

394
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:59,780
and then rescue that family.

395
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,219
But I destroyed the building structure,

396
00:31:04,219 --> 00:31:06,460
and caused a second collapse.

397
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,120
 Xiaojie!

398
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:21,319
You mean, you chose to save my mom instead of that couple.

399
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:24,640
Yes.

400
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,280
The report made me into a hero.

401
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:46,960
I was admired by others.

402
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,220
But I'm not qualified.

403
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,199
I don't deserve it.

404
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,519
I always wanted to tell you the truth,

405
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,360
but every time I wanted to say it,

406
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,039
I quit.

407
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:08,899
Why? Why couldn't you tell me about it?

408
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:11,880
You are so much like me!

409
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:16,040
I'd rather you had a hero father.

410
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:22,339
I didn't want to let the truth become your spiritual burden for the rest of your life.

411
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,099
I didn't imagine you saw that report.

412
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:38,699
From that day, you and I were getting more and more estranged.

413
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,119
In others' eyes, I'm a hero, a good father,

414
00:32:46,639 --> 00:32:49,900
the Captain of Light Chase Rescue Team.

415
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,859
But I suffer from regret and pain every day.

416
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,760
If I hadn't acted rashly that year

417
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,600
and waited for the rescue team,

418
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:05,020
the result might have been different.

419
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:19,699
So you set up Light Chaser Rescue Team, just for atonement?

420
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,940
There is no atonement for this.

421
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,060
I don't care whether I'm a hero or a sinner now.

422
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,759
Yan...

423
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,800
I just want you to forgive me.

424
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,399
When I meet your mom, I hope she won't blame me.

425
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,619
- Zhan Yan. 
 - President.

426
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,959
I've asked Dr. Liu to do the operation for your father.

427
00:34:52,959 --> 00:34:54,780
Don't worry.

428
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,580
Thank you, President.

429
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:17,360
Zhan Yan, don't worry.

430
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,000
Yan.

431
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,939
Don't worry.

432
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,039
You'll be fine.

433
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,140
I'll be waiting for you here.

434
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,079
Captain, don't worry.

435
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:37,620
- Captain we'll be with you. 
 - You can do it.

436
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,840
Zhan Yan.

437
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:52,579
- Good luck, Captain. 
 - Good luck, Captain!

438
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:05,960

439
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:55,219
Don't worry. Wait patiently.

440
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:01,680
I used to be the surgeon in the operating room.

441
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,580
I thought time passed so quickly.

442
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:09,200
It is common for a surgery to take four to five hours.

443
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,919
This is the first time that I know that time outside the operating room is so difficult.

444
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:21,100
It's hard to sympathize with people.

445
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:27,859
So, understanding and communication are more important.

446
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,340
The doctor said the operation was successful.

447
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,719
I need to have some good rest.

448
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:52,140
You don't need to visit me often.

449
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,599
Okay?

450
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,160
Doctor Zhan came to check the ward in person again.

451
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,419
These past few days, you've been recovering well.

452
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:07,700
You can reduce your medicine from today.

453
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,939
If there is nothing wrong, you can be discharged next week.

454
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:15,119
Next week?

455
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,579
A critically ill patient like me shouldn't stay in the hospital for longer?

456
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,460
I have no family at home. If I feel sick here,

457
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,899
I can press the button and the doctor can help me.

458
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:30,360
Go and check the other patients.

459
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
Okay.

460
00:38:34,799 --> 00:38:41,539
Mr. Luo, did your captain get some other illness that even the doctors don't know about?

461
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:52,680
Captain,

462
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:56,079
don't be mad at me, after I tell you this.

463
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,579
Say it.

464
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,320
Here's the thing.

465
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,379
Shen Ruoxi and I acted in a play in front of you.

466
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,339

467
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,699
 Cheat Uncle Zhan? This is not suitable.

468
00:39:11,699 --> 00:39:13,880
 This is the only solution.

469
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,840
 Zhan Yan won't forgive me.

470
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,739
 You're Zhan Yan's best friend.

471
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:20,920
 Don't you want them to make up with each other by this chance?

472
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,460
 Of course I do, but...

473
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,139
 There are no buts.

474
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,359
 Shen Ruoxi.

475
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:28,679
 Zhan Yan will go to Fengxi after the operation.

476
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,899
 There will be no chance.

477
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,859
 Tell me! What should I do?

478
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,379
You know what happened next.

479
00:39:53,379 --> 00:39:58,159
Shen Ruoxi and I talked about the tumor on purpose,

480
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,699
and made you think you were seriously ill.

481
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:08,099
I admit I made use of the patient's psychology.

482
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,400
- Luo Ben, you're so mean. 
 - That's right.

483
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,180
I'm apologizing now.

484
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,599
I was cheated by you.

485
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,100
So you came to find me because you thought you would die. Right?

486
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:28,799
Here's the checkup report. See it yourself.

487
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,819
Luckily, I'm a brave man.

488
00:40:40,819 --> 00:40:43,080
Or I would be scared to death by you.

489
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,360
What are you doing?

490
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,519
I should buy her a gift since it's her birthday.

491
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:58,720
She is so rich, what should I give her? She has everything.

492
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,019
It's so annoying.

493
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,850
Cosmetics. How about cosmetics?

494
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,140
No.

495
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,140
Clothes?

496
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,699
I can't give her clothes. I don't know what clothes she likes.

497
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:16,799
Oral liquids?

498
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:19,000
Give her this?

499
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,100
Is this okay?

500
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,360

501
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:31,880
"Time to stay, women's pursuit for a lifetime."

502
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,599
This is good.

503
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:40,940
It costs only 1998 yuan? I can't afford it.

504
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,480
That's too expensive, Yuan Yuan.

505
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,200
Fine, that's it.

506
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,659
For love, let's go.

507
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,980

508
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,280
What are you looking at?

509
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,220
You scared me.

510
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,120
I'm here to apologize.

511
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,319
Besides, Luo Ben forced me to do that.

512
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:15,120
How could you trust him so much?

513
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,640
And you colluded with him and betrayed your friend.

514
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,999
I didn't betray you. I care about you.

515
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,200
Think about it. If he didn't use this method to force Uncle Zhan,

516
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,480
how could you forgive him?

517
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,220
Besides, Luo Ben cares about you so much.

518
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,719
You're leaving him,

519
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,399
he also tried his best to help you bridge the relationship between father and daughter.

520
00:42:36,399 --> 00:42:40,020
You should treasure such a good man.

521
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,259
Seriously, don't go to Fengxi.

522
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:47,919
Now, your relationship is at a crucial stage.

523
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:50,020
Take a step forward, happy ending.

524
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:52,939
Take a step backward, bad ending.

525
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:59,160
I mean, there are many projects.

526
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,139
There is only one Luo Ben.

527
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:03,960
You can't find another Luo Ben in the future.

528
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,599
Guess. If the Dean knew you were lying to the patient, what would he do?

529
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,999
Compared with your happiness, I'm willing to be punished.

530
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,299
Okay, fine.

531
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:22,959
Did you change the dressings for the Bed 4 patient?

532
00:43:22,959 --> 00:43:24,900
I'll go now.

533
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,999
Think about it.

534
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:29,560
Remember. Don't regret it in the future.

535
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,800
I'll go now. Think about it.

536
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:49,050

537
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,850
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

538
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:05,100
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

539
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,070
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

540
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,650
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

541
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:28,320
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

542
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:36,370
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

543
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:43,520
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

544
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:51,120
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

545
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:59,850
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

546
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:06,000
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

547
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:14,870
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

548
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:22,350
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

549
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,120
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

550
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,000
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

551
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,670
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

552
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,350
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

553
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,070
♫  I can't fly  ♫

554
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:44,870
♫  But I can look up  ♫

555
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:52,700
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
