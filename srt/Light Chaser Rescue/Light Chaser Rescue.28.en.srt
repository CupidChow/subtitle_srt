16
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,170
You're good.

17
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,410
Mr. Gao, are you waiting for Shen Ruoxi?

18
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,480
Come on.

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,160
Shen Ruoxi,

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,090
will you hurry up?

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,250
Why do you wear

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,040
height-increasing shoes
in a team-building activity?

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,410
Yeah, you're right.

24
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,160
But I think

25
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,840
you should review

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
yourself too.

27
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,210
You match casual clothes

28
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,530
with a business watch,

29
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,210
and check it eight times a minute.

30
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,090
Are you afraid that people don't know

31
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,810
you're wearing an expensive watch?

32
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,410
Do you have to

33
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,320
get so personal?

34
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,840
If you walk like this,

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,490
we'll definitely be the last.

36
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,250
We're

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,210
the last anyway.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:02:59,970
Why don't I

39
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,930
try to be happy?

40
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,720
I'll take it as a sightseeing tour.

41
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,160
You can do as you like.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,440
Rest. Have a rest here.

43
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,760
In fact, at first,

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,490
I only admired Luo Ben.

45
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,970
But after I left him,

46
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,040
I found that

47
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,440
the tacit understanding,

48
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,840
habits, and even dependence

49
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,600
that have been cultivated between us

50
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,320
over a long time were irreplaceable.

51
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,440
Then you showed up.

52
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,320
I found that I was a little jealous.

53
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,280
An excellent woman like you

54
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,880
falling for my boyfriend

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,250
is enough to prove Luo Ben is great

56
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,250
and I have a good eye for men.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,000
Dr. Zhan, you're bighearted.

58
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,810
No wonder Luo Ben would like you.

59
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,650
Miss Ai, you're straightforward.

60
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,320
After all, we both

61
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,410
are adults.

62
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,090
We should lay

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,490
everything on the table

64
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,930
and fight for what we want.

65
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,320
OK.

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,560
Good luck.

67
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,160
Luo Ben.

68
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:06,720
You guys were

69
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,000
talking happily all the way.

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,090
What were you talking about?

71
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,280
Did Ai Rui'er

72
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,370
say anything bad about me?

73
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,280
I did.

74
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,280
I wonder if Dr. Zhan would mind.

75
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,130
Of course I wouldn't.

76
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,410
Everything Miss Ai said

77
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,760
gave you extra points.

78
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,490
Precisely.

79
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,250
After all,
we were partners for years.

80
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,930
We have that tacit understanding.

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,130
Why are you here alone?

82
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,050
Mr. He walks slowly.

83
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,250
I'm waiting for him.

84
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,440
Then we'll leave first.

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,520
Go ahead.

86
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,250
Wait for me at the Lover Tree.

87
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,290
See you.

88
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,050
What's wrong?

89
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,760
I'm a little out of breath.

90
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,080
I need a break.

91
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,810
I'll wait for you.

92
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,640
Don't mind me.

93
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,130
We barely come out.

94
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,320
I want to walk by myself

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,200
and enjoy some space.

96
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,080
OK, I'll leave first.

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,290
What's wrong with you?

98
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,050
I got hurt by accident.

99
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Hurt by accident?

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:12,930
Let me see.

101
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,880
You're really good.

102
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,490
Come.

103
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,490
Why am I to be blamed?

104
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,490
You're stupid.

105
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,730
Who else can you blame?

106
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,690
Can you deal with it?

107
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,320
Wait for a minute.

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,290
Don't rush me.

109
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You've got everything.

110
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,250
I prepared it for you, idiot.

111
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:43,930
Put up with it.

112
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:44,400
It hurts.

113
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960
I know. Put up with it!

114
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:46,930
Stretch your leg.

115
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,320
Don't move.

116
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,400
Look.

117
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,930
Mosquito, look.

118
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,850
Really.

119
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,490
I saw it.

120
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,320
Get off!

121
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,490
Tell you what,

122
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,850
don't think I'm dressing your wound

123
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,490
because I want to help you.

124
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,290
I just can't bear

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,730
to hear you groaning.

126
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,290
You only got scratched
by the grass leaves.

127
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,930
Does it really hurt that much?

128
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,610
Aren't you doctors sympathetic?

129
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,130
You can't neglect such injuries.

130
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,320
What if the leaves are poisonous?

131
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,640
What if they cause tetanus?

132
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,520
Yes, yes.

133
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,000
You're right. Absolutely right.

134
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,440
Why are you so careless?

135
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,850
You're absolutely right.

136
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't move.

137
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,080
There's no one else behind us.

138
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:31,690
I'm afraid we're

139
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,560
really the last team.

140
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,960
Thanks to you.

141
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,000
You were too slow before, OK?

142
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,290
It's dressed. Will you walk or not?

143
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,960
Help...

144
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,850
Get off!

145
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,730
It hurts a lot.

146
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:47,850
Annoying.

147
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,400
Wait for me!

148
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,050
Stumbling block.

149
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,080
Wait for me!

150
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,400
Annoying man.

151
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,880
Luo Ben, where are you?

152
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm lost.

153
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,560
Where are you?

154
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:28,930
Where is Zhan Yan?

155
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,490
I walked slowly.

156
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,610
Dr. Zhan left first.

157
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:34,640
I don't know

158
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,640
where I am.

159
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,500
(Luo Ben)

160
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,280
Ai Rui'er,

161
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,130
show me

162
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,210
your surroundings.

163
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:53,090
OK.

164
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,570
Stay there. Don't move.

165
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm coming for you.

166
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,490
OK.

167
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,880
Do you think

168
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,090
my injuries will be infected?

169
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,730
No, they're just minor injuries.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,400
I saw someone pass by.

171
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,090
It looked like Luo Ben.

172
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,610
Did I make a mistake?

173
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,330
That's not our route.

174
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,400
I don't think so.

175
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:24,800
You're right.

176
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
Luo Ben walks faster than us.

177
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,090
He must be in front of us.

178
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,520
How much longer will it be?

179
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,130
We've walked

180
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,330
two-thirds at least.

181
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,680
Walking on this road makes me

182
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,280
feel like I've gone through

183
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,520
the first half of my life.

184
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,250
Then your life is really rough.

185
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,970
It's mostly because

186
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,250
I met a bad guy.

187
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,970
Then you must keep your eyes open.

188
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Oh, dear!

189
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,090
What do you want?

190
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,450
Take a break.

191
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,680
Who did this?

192
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,370
It's immoral

193
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,490
to waste water and

194
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,280
cast off rubbish at will.

195
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,680
Ai Rui'er,

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,130
how are you doing?

197
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:11,330
Ai Rui'er!

198
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,330
Ai Rui'er!

199
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,400
I'm here.

200
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,680
Ai Rui'er!

201
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,400
Well,

202
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,130
neither of them answered?

203
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,760
Zhan Yan,

204
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,160
I finally saw you.

205
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,920
Are you waiting for us?

206
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,570
Did you see Luo Ben?

207
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,800
Hasn't he arrived yet?

208
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,130
Shen Ruoxi,

209
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,680
was the man you saw before

210
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,970
really Luo Ben?

211
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,130
I'm not sure.

212
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,970
I just saw a figure pass by

213
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,040
on a branch road over there.

214
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,850
Let's not wait here.

215
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,680
We'd better go to the Lover Tree

216
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,850
to join them.

217
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,850
This route

218
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,850
was planned by Luo Ben.

219
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,130
He should know it better
than anyone else.

220
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Let's wait for him there.

221
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,040
OK.

222
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:03,850
Go.

223
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:05,760
Wait.

224
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,210
Come on.

225
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,400
Here we are.

226
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,610
We finally arrived.

227
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,490
You finally arrived.

228
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Why are you so late?

229
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,970
Go up there and take a photo.

230
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,640
Right.

231
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,730
I won't take photos with you.

232
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,730
Let's take one.

233
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,280
To remember the day

234
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,450
when we shared weal and woe.

235
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,850
Exactly. Go.

236
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,370
Go and take one.

237
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,850
I won't take photos.

238
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,130
Don't mess with me.

239
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,250
Who won the first place?

240
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,250
Director He.

241
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,520
Team Two and Team Four

242
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,610
tied for first place.

243
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,210
Two teams?

244
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,880
OK.

245
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,090
Both teams will be rewarded.

246
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,640
Mr. He is generous.

247
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,490
Where is Luo Ben?

248
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,760
I didn't see him.

249
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,920
Weren't you together?

250
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,640
By the way,

251
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,880
Miss Ai of the law firm

252
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,250
hasn't arrived either.

253
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,680
Zhan Yan,

254
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,330
let me go

255
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,880
find Mr. Luo with you.

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,610
We...

257
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
No worries. I'll go by myself.

258
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,610
Don't go alone.

259
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,640
You young people

260
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,520
go to look for Luo Ben

261
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,520
with Dr. Zhan.

262
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,280
You don't have to go.

263
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:24,210
They're coming.

264
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,130
What's wrong?

265
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,000
Go.

266
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,880
Let's have a look.

267
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,760
Slowly. Slowly.

268
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,040
Be careful.

269
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
Where did you fall?

270
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,780
It's OK now.

271
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,040
Is it serious?

272
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,880
Is she OK?

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,570
She's OK.

274
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,280
That's good.

275
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,680
- Does it hurt?
- It's OK.

276
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
Go.

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,520
Slowly. Be careful.

278
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,850
Scheme.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,370
It was definitely a scheme.

280
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,370
I think

281
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,850
she went the wrong way on purpose

282
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,210
to lure Luo Ben there.

283
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,760
I don't think so.

284
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,680
She really fell.

285
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,090
Luckily she just had a scratch.

286
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,920
What if she had a serious accident?

287
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,000
I've read lots of books.

288
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,610
I've seen various scheming women.

289
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,760
The first day, she wouldn't

290
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,850
stop talking about cases with Luo Ben.

291
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,850
The second day, she was lost,

292
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,090
then she told Luo Ben,

293
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:47,210
"There is a bottle of water
where I got lost."

294
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,160
Pah!

295
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,130
I think

296
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,520
she left the bottle there

297
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,280
so Luo Ben could find her.

298
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,680
Maybe

299
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,920
she even faked the fall.

300
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,730
If so,

301
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,520
Ai Rui'er

302
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,450
is really scheming.

303
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,730
Zhan Yan,

304
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,000
you must keep an eye on her.

305
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,760
Yes, Zhan Yan,

306
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,370
you have to pay more attention.

307
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,520
The woman would do anything.

308
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,880
Don't be aloof.

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,520
Go rip her.

310
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,040
If it's true,

311
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,920
and Luo Ben still takes a fancy to her,

312
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,330
I must be blind.

313
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,880
Take it seriously.

314
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,730
Take good advice.

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,210
This is a battle,

316
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,850
a love battle.

317
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,640
If you don't fight,

318
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,640
you're gonna lose.

319
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,920
I'll ask Gao Junchi to deal with her.

320
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,400
It's no big deal.

321
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,280
We just

322
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,040
took a photo under the Lover Tree.

323
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,130
(Basic tasks of emergency accident rescue)
In this case,

324
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,280
what was the most serious mistake?

325
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,130
The team that arrived first

326
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,090
searched the site

327
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,970
and found no victims

328
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,370
or trapped people,

329
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,850
but they didn't

330
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,040
mark their

331
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,640
search results clearly.

332
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,800
When the following echelons

333
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,570
entered the site,

334
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,730
they had to search again,

335
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,370
which was a waste

336
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,400
of valuable rescue time

337
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,490
and rescue force.

338
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,850
In the second case,

339
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,400
the rescue team didn't detect

340
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,280
noxious gas after entering the site.

341
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,330
(When can I meet your parents?)

342
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,520
(I'll make an appointment.)
So the following members

343
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,280
inhaled a large amount of noxious gas,

344
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,490
which seriously endangered the health

345
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,920
and life of the team members

346
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,730
and spoiled the

347
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,160
rescue mission.

348
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,850
Yuan,

349
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:50,760
are you reading

350
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,130
or being infatuated?

351
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:03,850
My brother will meet

352
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,850
Xiong Fei's parents tomorrow.

353
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,760
Really?

354
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,720
Will they discuss your wedding?

355
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,130
Oh, my!

356
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,400
You're going to be married.

357
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,610
No wonder.

358
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,610
No wonder I saw

359
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,770
your brother and Xiong Fei

360
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,920
passed notes on the class.

361
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,400
They were probably discussing this.

362
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,200
Your family members

363
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,850
are about to meet.

364
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,720
What about me?

365
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,810
Zhou Mingming's mother
doesn't even admit me,

366
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,920
let alone meet my parents.

367
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,290
Why am I so miserable?

368
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,130
Don't worry.

369
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,010
I won't sit back and do nothing.

370
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,290
She doesn't admit me,

371
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,200
but I can find a way
to make her admit me.

372
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,640
I'll not only make her admit me,

373
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,440
but also make her most willing,

374
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,960
completely convinced,

375
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,640
and burst with joy!

376
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,330
I'm so pissed.

377
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,720
Get back to work.

378
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,010
Thanks.

379
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,330
Thanks.

380
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,440
You've lost

381
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,720
your parents since childhood.

382
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,290
It wasn't easy for you to

383
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,640
take care of each other all the time.

384
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,010
You're both good kids.

385
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,240
Ma'am, we're flattered.

386
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Well,

387
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,480
we'd like you

388
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,330
to fix the

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,720
wedding date.

390
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,610
I have it checked out.

391
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,200
The sixth day of next month

392
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,640
is a good day.

393
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,010
The sixth day.

394
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,920
It may be

395
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,920
a little hasty.

396
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,400
But it doesn't matter.

397
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,130
There's nothing

398
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,570
to specially prepare for.

399
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,530
Take this condo

400
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,130
as my

401
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,770
wedding gift to them.

402
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,810
No, we can't accept that.

403
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,880
Exactly.

404
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,960
It's too valuable.

405
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,240
We can't accept it.

406
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,480
How can a man

407
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,530
live in his wife's condo?

408
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,530
Yeah.

409
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:23,680
I'll solve the housing problem myself.

410
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
I want to rent an apartment first,

411
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,240
then save up money for two years
to buy one.

412
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,160
Yuan,

413
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:30,010
I'll work hard

414
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,610
to give you a perfect home.

415
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:35,880
Actually,

416
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,200
after they're married,

417
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,850
we'll become a family.

418
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,130
I hope

419
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,400
they live comfortably

420
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,960
and happily.

421
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:47,770
Brother,

422
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,240
after we get married,

423
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,050
we'll live with the family.

424
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,370
Yuan.

425
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,810
After Mom and Dad died,

426
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,050
my brother has to work every day

427
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
to support our family.

428
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,160
I always stay at home alone.

429
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,960
I feel cold and lonely.

430
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
But now it's different.

431
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,160
I've finally got parents again,

432
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,920
and also a sister.

433
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,400
I want to live with my family.

434
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,130
That's my wish.

435
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,810
Please agree with me.

436
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,160
Yuan said,

437
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,640
she likes the family atmosphere.

438
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,480
She wishes

439
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,480
she can

440
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
live with you.

441
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:55,530
Yuan,

442
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,850
as long as you are happy,

443
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,720
I respect your opinion.

444
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,720
Here, Yuan.

445
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Have a glass of milk.

446
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,960
Were you looking over
the wedding dresses?

447
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,440
Are you so impatient?

448
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,240
Look, it's beautiful,

449
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:42,850
isn't it?

450
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,810
Brother,

451
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,050
I don't want to leave you.

452
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,160
Don't try to cheer me up.

453
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:02,880
Here.

454
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,050
Take it.

455
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,130
Yuan,

456
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,370
listen to me.

457
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,640
You want to live with your family.

458
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,480
Actually, I have no complaints.

459
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,570
But you must

460
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960
accept the condo too.

461
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,570
It'll make you feel secure.

462
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,010
Think about it.

463
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,480
Sometimes when you are in a bad mood,

464
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,720
and you want to be alone;

465
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,610
or,

466
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,480
you're upset about something

467
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,440
and don't want to tell others,

468
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,480
you can stay in your condo.

469
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,290
It's your safe haven.

470
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:42,200
Listen to me. Take it.

471
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,880
My sweet little sister.

472
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,290
Do you have a minute?

473
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:11,810
What's up?

474
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,330
I want to return to your team.

475
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,290
Why?

476
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,370
You know my situation

477
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,640
in that team.

478
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,480
In addition, you just got promoted
to senior partner

479
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,960
and you need hands.

480
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,960
If you recruit a new one,

481
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,240
you may not work together well.

482
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,530
I can help you.

483
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,200
But I will still

484
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,770
take legal aid cases.

485
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,960
It won't be helpful

486
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,610
for your promotion in the firm.

487
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,050
I've thought about it clearly.

488
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,050
You were right.

489
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,960
Legal aid cases have their own values.

490
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,200
The business cases will be delayed

491
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,050
when I engage in rescue.

492
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,720
That's why you need me more.

493
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,130
Does Gao Junchi agree to let you go?

494
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,530
If you're willing to accept me,

495
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,960
I'll talk with him.

496
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Get your things together.

497
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,810
Be ready to take over the work.

498
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:08,640
OK.

499
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,420
(Outpatient)

500
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,370
Honey,

501
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,090
aren't you going to take me

502
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,570
to the school to see Zhuangzhuang?

503
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,850
Why do you bring me to the hospital?

504
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,720
Don't you feel unwell?

505
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,160
Let's get some medicine first,

506
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,850
in case Zhuangzhuang will be worried.

507
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,960
That's right.

508
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,130
Go ahead.

509
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,570
Wait for me here.

510
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,290
Don't run around.

511
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,240
Go ahead.

512
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,850
Honey!

513
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,050
Zhuang...

514
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,160
Honey, come here quickly!

515
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,240
What's up?

516
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,610
Our son...

517
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,720
Our son is...

518
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,160
Didn't I tell you not to run around?

519
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:14,720
Look.

520
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,200
Our son.

521
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,530
Didn't you say he was at school?

522
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,770
(Cai Yuxiao Associate Chief Physician)
Why is he a doctor here?

523
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,050
Zhuang...

524
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,570
Lanzhi,

525
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,610
let's go.

526
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,810
Let's not see a doctor here.

527
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,810
I'm not leaving.

528
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,130
My son is here.

529
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,050
Let's go to another hospital.

530
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,640
I won't go to another hospital.

531
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,960
I want to see my son.

532
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,810
My son is here.

533
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
I won't go to another hospital.

534
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,050
He isn't Zhuangzhuang.

535
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,050
Don't make a mess.

536
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,850
He isn't Zhuangzhuang. Let's go.

537
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,960
- I want to see my son.
- Let's go.

538
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
- Ma'am.
- Let's go.

539
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,160
May I help you?

540
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,240
Miss,

541
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,400
are you Zhuangzhuang's colleagues?

542
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,480
Take me to see him.

543
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,330
Who's Zhuangzhuang, ma'am?

544
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,540
(Cai Yuxiao)

545
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,960
Dr. Cai?

546
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,610
I'm his mom.

547
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,960
I'm his mom.

548
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,720
Did you make a mistake?

549
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,720
Dr. Cai's parents

550
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,010
have long passed away.

551
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,680
Doctor,

552
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:06,720
never mind.

553
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,720
I'm sorry.

554
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,330
Let's go.

555
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:08,960
Let's go.

556
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,010
I'm not leaving.

557
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:10,440
Let's go.

558
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,130
Sir,

559
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,130
are you here to see a doctor?

560
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,610
Let me take you to the clinic.

561
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,090
No, thank you, doctor.

562
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,130
Thank you.

563
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,160
- Let's go.
- I'm not leaving.

564
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,640
- I want to see my son.
- Lanzhi.

565
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,610
Zhuangzhuang is at school.

566
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,810
- Zhuangzhuang is at school.
- My son is in the hospital.

567
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:27,330
- He's at school.
- Why don't you let me see him?

568
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,850
He's at school.

569
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,640
I want to see my son.

570
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,880
I've checked all the wards

571
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,090
and departments.

572
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,130
Very good.

573
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,770
Dr. Zhan.

574
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,050
I'm sorry, sir.

575
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:42,880
I just finished.

576
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,610
No worries.

577
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,050
I asked you to come here

578
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,240
to tell you

579
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,370
some good news.

580
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,850
The International Medical Union

581
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,810
has a

582
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,720
medical laboratory

583
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,010
funded project in Fengxi.

584
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,880
Next week,

585
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,810
Professor Coben will come to China
on behalf of the Union,

586
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,050
and choose an assistant

587
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,810
to participate in the whole project.

588
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
Great.

589
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,810
Is Professor Coben

590
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,610
the international oncologist?

591
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,570
Yes, you're right.

592
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:07,850
This project

593
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,480
has received international support.

594
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,370
It'll be very helpful to you

595
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,050
both in your career

596
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,640
and in academics.

597
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,130
The selection will include

598
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,050
surgery and replying in argument.

599
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:19,960
You go back

600
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,850
and prepare for it well.

601
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:22,850
Sir,

602
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,370
how long will

603
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,770
the project last?

604
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,530
Three years.

605
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,090
It's a rare opportunity.

606
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,160
No matter who of you gets selected,

607
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,440
it'll bring honor to our hospital.

608
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,810
Seize the opportunity.

609
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,440
Yes, definitely.

610
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,050
Definitely.

611
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,480
Zhan Yan,

612
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
you seem to be not interested.

613
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,720
Is it because of Mr. Luo?

614
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,530
How come?

615
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,880
It's a good opportunity to learn.

616
00:27:58,770 --> 00:27:59,680
I'm sure he'll

617
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,160
support me in my work.

618
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:02,370
Good.

619
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,770
It seems that you won't

620
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,330
change your goal

621
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
for anyone.

622
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,240
But that's good.

623
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,850
If you don't participate,

624
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,850
it's meaningless

625
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,290
for me to compete alone.

626
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,610
Don't forget,

627
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
my graduation thesis

628
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,680
was about Coben.

629
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,680
Of course I remember.

630
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,290
Back then,

631
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,010
I used to help you to

632
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,720
search for literature and information.

633
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,130
Speaking of that,

634
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:32,680
you just became an
Associate Chief Physician.

635
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:34,050
Are you really

636
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,720
willing to give everything up

637
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,440
and go to Fengxi?

638
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,850
Don't forget,

639
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,130
although I didn't write a paper,

640
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,480
I know

641
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,290
as much as you do.

642
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,850
The project must involve

643
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:50,960
the front-end technology of

644
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,130
terminal cancer treatment.

645
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,880
Few in the world can

646
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,480
come into contact with that.

647
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,050
I must strive for the opportunity.

648
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,440
Let's wait and see.

649
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,240
OK.

650
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:10,240
Three years? Are you insane?

651
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,330
What's wrong?

652
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,010
Long distance love

653
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,920
is the most unstable

654
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,810
relationship in the world.

655
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,530
Now transportation is developed.

656
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,480
We can meet

657
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:23,920
whenever we want.

658
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,680
You're so naive.

659
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,240
When you're fiery, it's even a long
distance between two districts.

660
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,200
You both are busy.

661
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:30,530
How do you get the time to travel?

662
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,130
We're adults.

663
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,290
We don't have separation anxiety.

664
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,330
Then you're doomed.

665
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,810
Spending little time together

666
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,330
will cause a lack of security
in your relationship.

667
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,880
You'll begin to fight constantly.

668
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,880
In the end,

669
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,610
someone will get in.

670
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,400
You mustn't give other women

671
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,570
such an opportunity,

672
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,290
especially Ai Rui'er.

673
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,480
Even if I don't go,

674
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,920
and I stay here every day,

675
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,400
I can't always stay by his side.

676
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,880
If another woman

677
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,720
really gets in between us,

678
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,570
it only means we're not

679
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,050
suitable for each other.

680
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,200
You're really...

681
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:09,850
Then,

682
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,530
did you tell Luo Ben?

683
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,130
It's not even close.

684
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,530
If it's close,

685
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,090
it'll be too late.

686
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,240
I think,

687
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,770
the sooner you tell him, the better.

688
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,880
Please enjoy.

689
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,680
It's so grand.

690
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,200
Don't you like it?

691
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,850
I like whatever you prepare for me.

692
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,480
But,

693
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,200
why do I

694
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,480
feel so uneasy?

695
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
Luo Ben.

696
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,060
(Ai Rui'er)

697
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,010
Today...

698
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,810
Work.

699
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,770
Don't you need to reply?

700
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,530
Ai Rui'er reported

701
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,610
the work progress to me.

702
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,290
No big deal.

703
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,920
Doesn't she work for Mr. Gao?

704
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,090
Why does she report to you?

705
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,330
She returned to my team.

706
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:29,810
Did you agree?

707
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,160
I did.

708
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,010
She used to be on my team.

709
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,050
We worked well together.

710
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,290
It's good that she came back.

711
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,850
What did you want to say?

712
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,440
I'll start, then.

713
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,610
Zhan Yan and Cai Yuxiao

714
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,130
are the best doctors in our hospital.

715
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,570
They are both eager to

716
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,920
participate in your project.

717
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,880
Yes. It's very difficult to choose

718
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,810
between these two.

719
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,200
They are both excellent.

720
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,090
It's very difficult to choose

721
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,770
between these two.

722
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,010
They are both excellent.

723
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,130
Yuan,

724
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,290
I think each of these

725
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,160
suits you very well.

726
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,440
Take your time to try them.

727
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,240
No hurry.

728
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
I'll accompany you.

729
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,290
Do you want me to try this?

730
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:27,880
OK. I'll try it.

731
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,640
This one is beautiful.

732
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,640
Miss Luo, please follow me.

733
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,200
Hello, who is it?

734
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,570
I'm Zhou Mingming's mom.

735
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,570
Mrs...

736
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,960
Aunt, hello. What can I do for you?

737
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:03,570
I want to see you.

738
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,640
You're so beautiful.

739
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,680
I want to marry you myself.

740
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,360
I envy Xiong Fei.

741
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,360
Let me straighten your dress.

742
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,610
You know what,

743
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,450
Zhou Mingming's mom

744
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,200
called me just now

745
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,530
and asked to see me.

746
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,890
She seemed to be impatient.

747
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,490
Do you think

748
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,840
she wants to pay me

749
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,490
to break up with her son?

750
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,450
If she only pays me half a million,

751
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,800
I won't agree.

752
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,890
As for five million,

753
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,160
I'll buy a condo

754
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,240
that faces yours.

755
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,610
Then I can hang out with you every day,

756
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,160
OK?

757
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:49,930
But spending

758
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,840
a breakup fee of five million

759
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,320
on purchasing a condo seems shallow.

760
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,680
It doesn't match my status.

761
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,090
Yuan,

762
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,930
what if...

763
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
what if she pays me 50 million?

764
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I really,

765
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:08,890
I really can't refuse it.

766
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,530
I can't refuse 50 million.

767
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,610
I'm so afraid.

768
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,610
If by any chance,

769
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,130
I unknowingly accept it,

770
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,160
do you think Mingming will hate me?

771
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,280
Is it pretty?

772
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Try another one?

773
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,640
Welcome.

774
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:12,240
Yuan.

775
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,010
You are not suitable for Mingming,

776
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,610
not to mention marrying him.

777
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,360
I didn't think of it.

778
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,160
Did Mingming say

779
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,570
he wanted to marry me?

780
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,090
You'd better not

781
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,360
have such an idea.

782
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,680
Mingming is busy

783
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,200
with his career.

784
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,240
I don't allow you to affect him.

785
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,680
Aunt, rest assured.

786
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,570
I'm busy.

787
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,280
I don't have time to affect him.

788
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:47,360
On the contrary,

789
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,680
you should tell him

790
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,570
not to lecture me

791
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,050
about my work.

792
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,090
My son needs a woman

793
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,320
who can help him

794
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,970
in his work and career.

795
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,490
Obviously you can't.

796
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,050
Aunt,

797
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,490
why do you talk

798
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,890
exactly like Miss Li?

799
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,490
This is the 21st century.

800
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,970
Young people's relationship

801
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,570
isn't as complicated as you think.

802
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,610
We just want to be happy.

803
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,320
You don't understand such things.

804
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,610
Anyhow,

805
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,160
you and Mingming

806
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,640
don't belong to the same world.

807
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:22,360
From the perspective

808
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,010
of a mother,

809
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,610
and also of a woman,

810
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,570
I must tell you,

811
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,410
you and Mingming will get nowhere.

812
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,930
I think

813
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,160
you'd better go back

814
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,090
and ask Mingming's opinion.

815
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,530
The relationship

816
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,160
is a matter of two persons.

817
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,720
I can't decide unilaterally.

818
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,490
And let me tell you the truth,

819
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,130
I think Mingming

820
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,280
likes me very much.

821
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,570
He may not agree with you.

822
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,610
That's ridiculous.

823
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,680
Aunt, did you

824
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
forget something?

825
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,890
Why didn't she throw money at me?

826
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,320
Don't worry. It's settled.

827
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,240
Go.

828
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,890
Let's go.

829
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,860
(Outpatient)

830
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,970
Dr. Zhan and Dr. Cai

831
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:22,680
both are excellent

832
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,890
young doctors in our hospital.

833
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,200
Professor Coben.

834
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,050
What do you think of them?

835
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,570
Based on the professional skills,

836
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,280
Based on the professional skills,

837
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,680
it's really hard to pick one.

838
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,410
It's too bad

839
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,320
you only have one quota.

840
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,410
you only have one quota.

841
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,240
I've seen their resumes.

842
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,530
I've seen their resumes.

843
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,450
Cai has one very impressive.

844
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:47,090
Cai has one very impressive.

845
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,610
And you know,

846
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,530
And you know...

847
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,930
I'm looking for somebody

848
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
who can concentrate and hard working.

849
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,050
I'm looking for somebody

850
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
who can concentrate and hard working.

851
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,090
Hello.

852
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,410
What?

853
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,680
You know she's mentally ill.

854
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,200
Why didn't you keep an eye on her?

855
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,050
I went out to get medicine.

856
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,200
She asked me to tie her up.

857
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:18,930
I didn't do it.

858
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,930
Who would have thought she'd run away?

859
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:21,640
You should have tied her up.

860
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,930
Now what should we do?

861
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,640
Now, at the most

862
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,490
critical time of my career,

863
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,530
you come here and make trouble.

864
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,130
Make trouble?

865
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,450
Your mother is lost,

866
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,840
and you're still
thinking about your career.

867
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,610
Do you have a conscience?

868
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,570
I...

869
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,530
Let me make it clear today.

870
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,200
She's your mom.

871
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,450
Even if she's old, sick,

872
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:39,930
and muddle-headed,

873
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,490
we can't tie her up.

874
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,890
Even if you become a Chief Physician,

875
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,610
we won't cause you any trouble.

876
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,160
Enough, Dad.

877
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,930
Don't lecture me

878
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,200
at this time.

879
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,570
People are watching.

880
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,280
Think about where Mom will go.

881
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,010
She came to the hospital

882
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,010
by herself last time.

883
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,010
Is she in the hospital?

884
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,890
I tell you what,

885
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,450
you go look for her outside.

886
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,890
I'll look for her inside, OK?

887
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,610
Doctor,

888
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,720
have you seen my wife?

889
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,490
You saw her earlier

890
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,970
when she was with me.

891
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,320
It's my mom.

892
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,570
Have you searched the hospital?

893
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,530
Yes, we have.

894
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,360
But we didn't find her.

895
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,800
I'll call the rescue team

896
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:17,930
and ask them to help.

897
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,280
OK.

898
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,840
- Hello, have you seen
- About this height...

899
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,820
- the woman in this photo?
- In black clothes with floral patterns.

900
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,490
No.

901
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,760
Have you seen her?

902
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,240
- OK, thanks.
- About this height.

903
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,490
Have you seen her?

904
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,160
No.

905
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,680
Have you found her?

906
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,130
No.

907
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:44,970
Mom.

908
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,200
Where is she?

909
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,720
Watch where you're going!

910
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,970
I'm sorry.

911
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,360
Mom!

912
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,320
(Information Release Platform)
Dr. Cai's mom was found.

913
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,700
(Conference Room)

914
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,130
Zirui.

915
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,890
Hasn't Dr. Cai arrived yet?

916
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,130
No, not yet.

917
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,200
Sorry, Professor Coben,

918
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,840
let's call the next one.

919
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,970
Let's call the next one.

920
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,970
Call the next one.

921
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:03,570
OK.

922
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,720
Zhan Yan,

923
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,050
it's your turn.

924
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
Lanzhi.

925
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,570
Lanzhi.

926
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,760
Lanzhi.

927
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,490
Lanzhi.

928
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,090
Are you awake?

929
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,280
Lanzhi.

930
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,360
Zhuangzhuang.

931
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,610
Zhuangzhuang.

932
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,640
Zhuang,

933
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,280
is school out?

934
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,050
You haven't been home for three years.

935
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:05,050
Go home with Mom this time.

936
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,160
Yeah.

937
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,800
I'll go home.

938
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,640
Go home.

939
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:10,490
Mom,

940
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,200
