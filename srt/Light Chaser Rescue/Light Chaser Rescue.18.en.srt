Zhou Mingming,

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,130
what's wrong?

18
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,810
You were smug just now,

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,330
right?

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,840
Zhou Mingming,
what's wrong with your legs?

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,530
Trembling.

22
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,770
Go on.

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,440
You should practice more.

24
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,640
Call an ambulance and

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,530
send him to the hospital.

26
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,130
You can't just act cool,

27
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,050
Zhou Mingming.

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,000
You should practice with us.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,610
Exactly.

30
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,440
I get it.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,810
Practice more.

32
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,200
Zhou Mingming, come earlier tomorrow.

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,560
- OK.
- Just try again.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,160
Hello.

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,320
Aiqi,

36
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,250
call a designated driver for me.

37
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,250
Hello, your parcel.

38
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:51,840
Please take it.

39
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,210
Going abroad for further study?

40
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,600
What about Xiong Fei?

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,880
Does Xiong Fei know?

42
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,720
Does your brother know?

43
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,370
Dear me!

44
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
What a bad timing.

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
You and Xiong Fei

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,600
haven't gone steady yet.

47
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,320
If you study abroad for two years,

48
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,320
what would Xiong Fei feel?

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,280
Yuan, well,

50
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
don't worry about it.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,490
Let's think

52
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,810
positive first.

53
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,560
You go abroad for further study

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,410
and realize your dream.

55
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,280
As for Xiong Fei,

56
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,000
though you haven't

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,970
gone steady,

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,090
he's so devoted to you

59
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,650
and will keep chastity for you.

60
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,410
When you come back,

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,600
you'll succeed
both in studies and in love.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,370
Perfect!

63
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,040
I'm not even

64
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
convinced myself.

65
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,210
Well, why would we want

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,210
love and studies at the same time?

67
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,720
Can't one of them wait?

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,290
(Will you come tomorrow?)

69
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,250
(Sure.)

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,050
(I'll wait for you.)

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,320
(I have something to tell you.)

72
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,520
Is that Xiong Fei?

73
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,810
What did he say?

74
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,690
Let me see.

75
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,730
You wouldn't even tell me.

76
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,370
I've kept your secret for nothing.

77
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,760
Let me see.

78
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,540
(I'll wait for you.
I have something to tell you.)

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,370
Good.

80
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,850
He's going to bring out the big guns.

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,880
You needn't worry now.

82
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,520
He has made the decision for you.

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
Don't be upset.

84
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,170
Eat. It's sweet.

85
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,400
Yuan,

86
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,560
I'm back.

87
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,610
Have you eaten?

88
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,930
I bought you bread.

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,200
Yuan, I'm coming in.

90
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,340
(From the United Kingdoms)

91
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,440
You're back.

92
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,000
Well done.

93
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,250
Why are you so happy?

94
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,730
You've learned to take care of Bun-bun.

95
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,320
Of course I'm happy.

96
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,930
Yuan,

97
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,520
the British school I asked Stephen

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,170
to contact for you agrees to admit you.

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,960
Have

100
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,930
you

101
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,810
got the letter of admission?

102
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,960
It doesn't matter if you haven't.

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,050
I've made arrangements for you.

104
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,080
You'll go over there
to learn English first.

105
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,080
You don't have to

106
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,130
worry about the life there.

107
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,200
If you need help,

108
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,440
go to Stephen.

109
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
He'll get everything done.

110
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,050
I'm not in a hurry.

111
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,080
Let's wait for a while.

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
Wait for what?

113
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,560
Why don't you want to go abroad?

114
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,760
I called the headmaster

115
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,690
and the Dean of Studies

116
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,690
of your school.

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,370
They all support you to study abroad.

118
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,200
Don't worry about your work.

119
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,320
Someone will take it over.

120
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,690
I've booked the air ticket for you.

121
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,610
You'll leave tomorrow.

122
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,810
Why don't you discuss it with me?

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,170
Return the ticket.

124
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,290
I'll return the ticket,

125
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,080
only if you tell me

126
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,690
the real reason

127
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,130
why you don't want to go.

128
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,160
Stay at home

129
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,040
today.

130
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,490
I'll send you to the airport

131
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,760

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,520
one portion of wonton.

175
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,250
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,570
I'm closed.

177
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,580
(Where have you been?)

178
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,830
(Shall we train together today?)

179
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,280
(If you want to)

180
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,520
(inquire about Luo Yuan,)

181
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,800
(I can tell you that)

182
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,730
(she went abroad.)

183
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,210
Luo Ben has gone too far.

184
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,490
The lovebirds are separated.

185
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,330
Ding Dingding,

186
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,640
come here.

187
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,850
Run.

188
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,400
Boss, what can I do for you?

189
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,850
What's this?

190
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,000
A photo?

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,370
I know. Where are the photos of me?

192
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,400
There's none.

193
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,370
Why?

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,850
Why do they get chosen?

195
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,280
I took many photos.

196
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,090
Why didn't you choose one?

197
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,640
Boss,

198
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,800
do you really want to discuss something

199
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,370
concerning the rescue team

200
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,640
during work hours?

201
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,370
Cut the crap.

202
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,570
Answer my question.

203
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,920
If you insist,

204
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,250
I'll be frank with you.

205
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Why do I choose their photos?

206
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,570
Because they're cool.

207
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,610
Am I worse than them?

208
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,450
What do you think?

209
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,250
You're far worse than them.

210
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:45,680
Here.

211
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,880
Let me show you your photos.

212
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,880
If your face is on the brochure,

213
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,040
it will be a shame to us.

214
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:58,730
No.

215
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,040
Don't you know how to photoshop?

216
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,000
Photoshop?

217
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,610
Lengthen your legs,

218
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,920
smooth your skin and slim your face?

219
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,970
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,520
I don't have so much time.

221
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Boss, don't forget.

222
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,490
I have to

223
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,760
fulfill the KPI of the entire

224
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,520
Comic Department alone.

225
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,250
I don't have the time.

226
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,610
Is there anything else?

227
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,640
If not, I have to go.

228
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,330
Bye.

229
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:16,090
Ding Dingding,

230
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:16,850
are you doing this on purpose?

231
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,520
Stop!

232
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:17,970
Ding...

233
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,850
Ding Dingding.

234
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,260
(Luo Yuan)

235
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,210
Hello, Luo Yuan.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,090
Where are you?

237
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,450
Hello.

238
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,130
Luo Yuan went abroad.

239
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,000
Did you send her away?

240
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,520
Luo Yuan received
the letter of admission

241
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,730
for studying abroad,

242
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,090
but she decided to

243
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,920
stay for you.

244
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,970
Studying abroad

245
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,040
has always been

246
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,210
her biggest dream.

247
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,680
She has worked so hard

248
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,800
to realize the dream.

249
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:27,730
But now, she would rather

250
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,090
give up her dream.

251
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,680
Xiong Fei,

252
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,570
if it were you,

253
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,040
what would you do?

254
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,920
I get it.

255
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,680
I...

256
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
I like you.

257
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,850
Let go of me.

258
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,440
Let go of my sister!

259
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:44,720
Let her go!

260
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,960
Are you OK?

261
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,400
Stop it! Stop!

262
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,960
He killed him!

263
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,610
He killed him!

264
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,050
He killed him!

265
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,810
Sis.

266
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,420
(Prognosis Control Surgery)

267
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,050
Why are you here?

268
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,570
May I come in?

269
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,640
I sent Luo Yuan abroad.

270
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,200
She must be hating me now.

271
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,010
Why?

272
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,130
She received the letter of admission

273
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,200
for studying abroad,

274
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
but she kept it back from me

275
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,370
and hid the letter,

276
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,240
in order to stay

277
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,480
and go out with Xiong Fei.

278
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,130
She's going out with Xiong Fei?

279
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,330
You don't know

280
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,400
how much effort she has made

281
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,810
for the opportunity to study abroad.

282
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:44,810
I can't just

283
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,160
watch her give it up

284
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,090
so easily,

285
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,850
you know?

286
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Even so,

287
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,530
you should sit down

288
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,240
and have a good talk with her,

289
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,370
rather than interfering in her life

290
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,440
so roughly.

291
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,920
She's a grown-up now.

292
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,530
Moreover,

293
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,610
a girl of her age

294
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,290
who falls in love with a boy

295
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,680
may act a little willfully.

296
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,010
Isn't that normal?

297
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,370
Xiong Fei was once in prison.

298
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,200
He negligently killed a man

299
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,720
to protect his sister.

300
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,480
Now that he was in prison,

301
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,720
he has paid the price.

302
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,480
I have no doubt about

303
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,770
Xiong Fei's moral quality.

304
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,610
But in his case,

305
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,200
he can hardly find

306
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,010
a decent job.

307
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,010
How could he

308
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,010
make Luo Yuan happy?

309
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,240
That's why I think

310
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,850
going abroad

311
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,400
is the best choice

312
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,370
for Luo Yuan now.

313
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,370
Am I wrong?

314
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,530
You're right.

315
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,480
Luo Yuan will understand you.

316
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Do you really think so?

317
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,640
Thanks.

318
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,610
May I lie on your sofa

319
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,160
for a while?

320
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,130
I'll get you a blanket.

321
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,400
Sleep.

322
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:44,620
(You must be tired.)

323
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,160
(You must be tired.)

324
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,850
(It's said that girls will feel better)

325
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,090
(when they receive gifts.)

326
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,090
(You're forbidden to
substitute water for food.)

327
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,460
(Eat less cold food.
Soup nourishes your stomach.)

328
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,920
(Eat less cold food.
Soup nourishes your stomach.)

329
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,160
Why are you here?

330
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:28,720
Can't I come?

331
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,370
Do you come to see me?

332
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,880
I come to see everyone.

333
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,850
Let me show you around.

334
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
I know this place better than you do.

335
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,530
Try to take some good photos.

336
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,610
For one good photo,

337
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,480
you can take a day off.

338
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,720
It's a deal then.

339
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,330
Yeah, I'll keep my word.

340
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,440
OK. Climb up.

341
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,090
No, you...

342
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,570
How do I look?

343
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,400
Smile!

344
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,810
Do you have a poker face?

345
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,850
Help!

346
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
Someone falls into the water! Help!

347
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,770
- Someone falls into the water!
- Help! Someone!

348
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,090
Someone falls into the water!

349
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,610
Anyone there?

350
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,010
Someone falls into the water!

351
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,330
Hurry.

352
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,680
Be careful!

353
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,370
Over there!

354
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,570
Help!

355
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,640
Hurry up!

356
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:14,050
Zhan Yan,

357
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,570
take the medicine later.

358
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,920
Thanks, Jing.

359
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,290
Dr. Ruan,

360
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,050
you didn't say I sent it, did you?

361
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:33,960
No, I didn't.

362
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,810
However,

363
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,880
you can't keep doing this, right?

364
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,440
Ding Dingding told me,

365
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,610
when Zhan Yan saw a man
fell into the water,

366
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,240
she jumped into the water

367
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,400
to save him without hesitation.

368
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,570
Like father, like daughter.

369
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,610
Yes.

370
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,140
(Emergency)

371
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:27,880
Ma.

372
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,130
It's you.

373
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,330
You recognize me.

374
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,050
How dare you come?

375
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,610
Why do you say so?

376
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,290
I saved you.

377
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:37,200
I don't think you did.

378
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,440
Look how hard you hit me!

379
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,440
Be careful.

380
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,290
Knock him unconscious

381
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,640
or you'll drown.

382
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
If it weren't for me, you would be dead,

383
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,810
you know?

384
00:29:58,810 --> 00:29:59,480
If it weren't for you,

385
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,090
other people would have saved me earlier.

386
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,640
I didn't have to be hit by you.

387
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,720
Don't you understand?

388
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,770
If I didn't knock you out,

389
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,810
neither of us would survive.

390
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,720
Aren't you with the rescue team?

391
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,570
Aren't you professional?

392
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,640
Why must you hit people to save them?

393
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,610
I was...

394
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,400
Enough.

395
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,920
Don't say anything more.

396
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,160
I can see

397
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,400
what the problem is.

398
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,200
Get back to whatever you should do.

399
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,920
Don't perform your heroics.

400
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,330
You don't have the ability.

401
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,050
You'll kill people
instead of saving them.

402
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:27,810
You're not fit to

403
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,570
be a rescuer.

404
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,640
What are you talking about?

405
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,330
What?

406
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,570
You wanna hit me?

407
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,640
Fine, you're good at that.

408
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,770
Come on. Hit me in the neck.

409
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,770
As you did last time.

410
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,200
Come on.

411
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,610
How could you be a rescuer?

412
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,370
Who dares to ask for your help?

413
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,610
You have the nerve to say you saved me.

414
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,680
Pah! Shame on you!

415
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,570
He saved you.

416
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,530
Why are you being ungrateful?

417
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,770
You saved me.

418
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
I admit it. Thank you.

419
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,960
But I don't admit

420
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
he helped.

421
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,920
He almost killed me.

422
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,400
It was you

423
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,610
who held on to him underwater

424
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:02,720
and almost killed him.

425
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,010
He's a rescuer.

426
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:05,570
He's supposed to have the skills.

427
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,160
If he can't rescue people,

428
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,200
how could he be a rescuer?

429
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,770
Rescuers are human beings, not gods.

430
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,200
Mingming,

431
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,200
you didn't do anything wrong.

432
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,160
Just ignore him.

433
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,160
Dr. Zhan,

434
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,680
never mind.

435
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,850
Don't go.

436
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,370
I'm telling you this isn't over.

437
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:22,960
I'm in hospital because of you.

438
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,130
I'm gonna sue you!

439
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,770
Fine.

440
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,570
According to the law,

441
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,240
if a voluntary emergency aid

442
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,200
causes damage to the aided person,

443
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,640
the helper shall not bear civil liability.

444
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,290
Mingming.

445
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,370
Dr. Zhan.

446
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,640
You did great.

447
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,480
If it weren't for you,

448
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,090
he wouldn't

449
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,160
be here now.

450
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,200
But if it weren't for you,

451
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,770
I might probably kill him

452
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,240
like he said.

453
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
After all,

454
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,720
I'm not capable enough.

455
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,920
Don't push yourself too hard.

456
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,160
As long as you have a clear conscience.

457
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,160
Coming.

458
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,610
Who is it?

459
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,290
Yuan.

460
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,400
Well, what's going on?

461
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,920
Yuan, I didn't expect

462
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,640
you to be so brave.

463
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:47,720
Even though he's my brother,

464
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,200
he shouldn't interfere in my love life.

465
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,330
I support you.

466
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,010
But I think your brother

467
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,290
would soon find out

468
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,570
you didn't get on the plane.

469
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,720
What are you going to do?

470
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,480
What do you mean?

471
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:05,240
You don't want to live here, do you?

472
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,920
No!

473
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,370
I'll tell you what,

474
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,770
if your brother finds out,

475
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,640
you'll be the prime culprit
and I'll be the accessory.

476
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,720
He'll give me a life sentence,

477
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,610
if not a death sentence.

478
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,160
No.

479
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,480
Don't beg me. No.

480
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,400
OK. Fine.

481
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,610
Sit back.

482
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,290
I can't turn down

483
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,610
a woman in love.

484
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:36,370
Does Xiong Fei know this?

485
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,640
You mustn't go to see him

486
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
or tell him.

487
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,480
Think about it.

488
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,920
Once your brother finds out

489
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,680
you didn't get on the plane,

490
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,090
he'll definitely
watch Xiong Fei closely,

491
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:45,480
right?

492
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,090
He'll catch you in the act
if you go to see him.

493
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,640
Then it's over.

494
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:13,810
Hello.

495
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,760
Hello, Luo Ben.

496
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,010
Are you sure Luo Yuan's flight number

497
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,720
is correct?

498
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,970
I've been waiting for three hours

499
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:18,930
in the airport.

500
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,490
I checked the passenger list

501
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,450
and she wasn't on it.

502
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,010
What?

503
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,130
Don't worry.

504
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,570
I'm gonna ask about the other flights.

505
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:29,610
No need.

506
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,320
She might not have boarded.

507
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:33,640
It doesn't matter.

508
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,010
As long as she's safe.

509
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,010
Sorry.

510
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:38,450
I made you go all that way for nothing.

511
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:39,760
It doesn't matter.

512
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,090
As long as she's safe.

513
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,160
I'm gonna hang up. Bye.

514
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:55,940
(Ben)

515
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,530
(Yuan.)

516
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,610
(Where are you?)

517
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,570
Your brother?

518
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,530
It's about time.

519
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,280
He must have learned

520
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,410
you didn't get on the plane.

521
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,570
You should reply to his message,

522
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,570
or he'll be worried.

523
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,410
Do I have to do this for you?

524
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,970
I...

525
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,490
don't know what to do with you.

526
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,010
Let me think.

527
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,050
(Brother,)

528
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,160
(I didn't board.)

529
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,280
(I'm staying with my friend for now.)

530
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,280
(I need some time to cool down.)

531
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,010
(Don't worry.)

532
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,800
Sir, it's paid.

533
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,640
OK. Thanks.

534
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,100
(Big Bear Wonton)

535
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,410
Xiong Fei,

536
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,280
come out.

537
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,800
What's wrong?

538
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,130
Where do you hide Luo Yuan?

539
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,570
What do you mean?

540
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,490
Where do I hide what?

541
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,050
Answer me, where is Luo Yuan?

542
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,160
Hasn't she gone abroad?

543
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,760
She didn't board.

544
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,200
Xiong Fei,

545
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,760
I'm warning you.

546
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,930
Don't play tricks with me.

547
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,610
My sister would never

548
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,240
be with you.

549
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,610
Never!

550
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,240
I know you did it for Luo Yuan's good.

551
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,200
But I truly like her.

552
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,610
Shut up.

553
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:49,610
Yes.

554
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,130
I've been in prison.

555
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,930
I don't have a good family

556
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,240
or a good job.

557
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:56,840
In others' eyes,

558
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,610
I'm not worthy of her,

559
00:36:58,610 --> 00:36:59,680
one way and another.

560
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,090
So in the beginning,

561
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,200
I always avoided her.

562
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,760
I even turned her down once.

563
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,970
But fortunately,

564
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,450
Luo Yuan

565
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,640
is a different girl.

566
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,010
She's neither

567
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,130
looked down upon me

568
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,010
because of my family,

569
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,410
nor has she kept me

570
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,450
at a distance.

571
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:21,680
On the contrary,

572
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,970
when I started a new business,

573
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,090
she was there to accompany me
and help me.

574
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,450
With her,

575
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,720
I feel happy

576
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,610
and secure.

577
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:34,320
I admit I like her.

578
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,530
I won't run away.

579
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,130
For her,

580
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,450
I will try my best.

581
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,760
You're Luo Yuan's brother.

582
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,090
I hope you can give me a chance

583
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:54,010
to take care of her.

584
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,800
Do you think I'll believe you?

585
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Xiong Fei,

586
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,720
you're good.

587
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,050
In order to keep Luo Yuan,

588
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,840
you can do anything.

589
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,720
We had an honest and open relationship.

590
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,360
I won't hide her.

591
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,360
Anyway,

592
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,570
you have something to do with this.

593
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:21,890
What about you?

594
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,360
Shouldn't you think about

595
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,800
why she tries to avoid you?

596
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,090
Our family matters

597
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,240
have nothing to do with you.

598
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,610
Luo Yuan?

599
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,970
OK.

600
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,280
Thanks, Miss Chen.

601
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,680
If you hear from Luo Yuan,

602
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,890
please tell me as soon as possible.

603
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,890
Thanks.

604
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,760
Bye.

605
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,220
(Zhan Yan)

606
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,610
Zhan Yan,

607
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,760
I want to see you.

608
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,610
Where have you been these days?

609
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,970
I couldn't reach you.

610
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,240
Are you worried about me?

611
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,200
I was worried that you were

612
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,360
not safe alone outside.

613
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,890
Is that because

614
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,160
you like me?

615
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,490
I like you.

616
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,570
I've regretted it since

617
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:41,760
I knew you went abroad.

618
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,450
I regretted not telling you earlier.

619
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,010
Here you are.

620
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,050
Leave them to me.

621
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,010
I'll repair them for you.

622
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,610
I promise they will be
as good as new.

623
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,610
Haven't you found Luo Yuan yet?

624
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,050
Sit down.

625
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,610
Luo Yuan has grown up.

626
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,930
Now she has her own ideas.

627
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,490
Maybe,

628
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,240
she no longer

629
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,200
needs her big brother.

630
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,410
Don't worry.

631
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:24,280
She'll understand you.

632
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,760
It's enough

633
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,640
as long as I know

634
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:30,930
she's safe.

635
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,800
Did she often come here?

636
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,010
Yes.

637
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,800
She used to come here alone

638
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,450
to see the lake

639
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,280
