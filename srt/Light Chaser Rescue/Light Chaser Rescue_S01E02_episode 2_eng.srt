1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,900
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,220
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,136
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,484
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:35,554
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,470
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,440
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,420
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,400
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,950

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,984

20
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,284
What are you doing?

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,160
He was filming you.

22
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,312
Hey!

23
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,732
You're welcome.

24
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:14,552
Why didn't you call the police?

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,620
Don't you know the app "Public Security 110"?

26
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,120
Besides, he's deleted all your video and photos

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,320
so why bother wasting your time?

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,140
Sir, your bread is ready.

29
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,896
Thank you.

30
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,200
Sorry. All bread is sold out today.

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,920
- He bought them all. 
 - Let's go home. 
 - Okay.

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,400
How can you buy them all?

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
Haven't you seen the people behind you?

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,784
Why are you so selfish?

35
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,860
I just happened to come here before them.

36
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,860
What did I do wrong?

37
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,140
If someone ahead of me buys them all, I'll come here early next time,

38
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,372
but not to complain.

39
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,220
If you want, I can send you a bag.

40
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,976
Your phone.

41
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,332
Your phone!

42
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,772
You want the evidence?

43
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,240
Are you really called "Zhan Yan"?

44
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,940
I've seen you three times and you haven't smiled once.

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,360
It's interesting.

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,028
For the last time. Your phone.

47
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,720
You need to be kind when you need help.

48
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,676
It needs you to "Zhan Yan (smile)".

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,760

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,736
 I'm sorry.

51
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,796
 It's you.

52
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,696
Are you that teacher?

53
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,260
Here you're.

54
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,320
Fine. You can take it back now.

55
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,340
Shall I help you?

56
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,992
 Thank you.

57
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,080
 Thank you.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,560
I see.

59
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,440
Where shall I put it?

60
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,492
Here? Okay.

61
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,180
It's really heavy.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,532
No, thanks.

63
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,660
 Do you want to wash your hands?

64
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,940
I'll be off work after this.

65
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,860
I can go back to wash.

66
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm leaving now.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,180
Excuse me, can I wash my hands?

68
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,916
 It's inside.

69
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,316
Stay there!

70
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,544
Put it down!

71
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,820
Who are you?

72
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,940
- Hello. I'm a courier... 
 - Courier?

73
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,800
How can a courier come to our bathroom?

74
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Please listen to me. I'm really a courier!

75
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,840
What can you explain?

76
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,860
Yuan Yuan, go inside to call the police!

77
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,960
Wait! Don't!

78
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,920
Don't rush!

79
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,040
I'm really a courier!

80
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,700
- But... 
 - Do you think I won't hit you?

81
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,820
The box was too heavy for her...

82
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,820
What are you doing?

83
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,980
Preserving the evidence.

84
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,168
Is it necessary?

85
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,960
Sorry, it's a lawyer's habit.

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,836
Your name.

87
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,196
Xiong Fei.

88
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,840
Your job number.

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,240
I've told you it's a misunderstanding.

90
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,900
Excuse me. If you can't cooperate with me, I'll call the police.

91
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,704
Your job number.

92
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,064
3310151.

93
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,380
Can I leave?

94
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,200
Yes.

95
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,688
 Please pardon me!

96
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,700
Yuan Yuan.

97
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,900
I've told you many times not to open the door for strangers.

98
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,560
Don't you know it's dangerous?

99
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,080
What if he's a bad guy?

100
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,380
 You need to apologize to him.

101
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,080
Me? Apologize to him?

102
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,232
Impossible.

103
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,524
Yuan Yuan.

104
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,344
Yuan!

105
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,344
Yuan Yuan.

106
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,740
I know you're kind.

107
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,688
All that I've done is to protect you.

108
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,520
You always think there's no bad guy.

109
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,540
You'll suffer losses! Understand?

110
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,280
Oh, come on.

111
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,600
Calm down.

112
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,220
I've bought your favorite bread.

113
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,080
You knew nothing about it!

114
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,540
He's a good man!

115
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,300
He saved a choking child in the school today!

116
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,380
You've known him for a long time?

117
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,620
Why didn't you tell me?

118
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,540
When did you know him?

119
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,940
I don't want to talk to you.

120
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,780
Come on, Yuan Yuan. Hold on.

121
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,336
Come with me.

122
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,612
Sit here.

123
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,324
Check it.

124
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:41,580
I found a designer to make it for you.

125
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,000
Actually, it's a whistle.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,180
You could have another whistle to use whenever you meet

127
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,300
difficulties and hazards.

128
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,056
As soon as I hear it, I'll come to find you.

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,880
Let me put it on you.

130
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,820
See.

131
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,148
It's beautiful, isn't it?

132
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,192
I'm your patron saint forever.

133
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,500
No hard feelings?

134
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,180
You naughty girl.

135
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,640
You're just a little girl.

136
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,180
Why are you packing?

137
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,140
You want to run away from home?

138
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,440
 No.

139
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,780
 Fengxi School of Special Education invited me to teach.

140
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,180
 So I have to leave tomorrow.

141
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,028
Fengxi?

142
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,060
What a coincidence!

143
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,820
I have to go there, too.

144
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,716
Let's go together.

145
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,160
Have you bought a ticket?

146
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,820
I'll call Ariel to change my ticket. Right now.

147
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I'll go with you and tell you some more details about the evil side of society.

148
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,260
Otherwise, you can't know...

149
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,860
Yuan Yuan!

150
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,400
One!

151
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,108
Two!

152
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,000
Hold it on your shoulder!

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,300
One!

154
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,100
Stretch your arms straight!

155
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,724
Two.

156
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:27,660
One!

157
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,240
Two!

158
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,244
One!

159
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:33,840
Stretch your arms straight, Peng!

160
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,960
Two!

161
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,520
If so, I'm afraid Wukong can't hold it.

162
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,800
One!

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,100
Don't despise me!

164
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,324
If not, you can't make more.

165
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:47,700
Xiong Fei, push it till your arm is straight! Keep it up!

166
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,720
Xiong Fei is standard.

167
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,820
One!

168
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,140
Straighten your arms!

169
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,820
Then it means you really completed one!

170
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,476
Lay down!

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,450
♫  I am the mountain that people lean on  ♫

172
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,980
Let me say something.

173
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,040
You've made some progress but your stamina and explosive power need to be improved.

174
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,120
Let's continue next week.

175
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,430
♫  Chasing the passion for the future, like a dream maker  ♫

176
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,988
Have some water.

177
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:25,184
Here you are.

178
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:30,490
♫  My existence in the river of time,  
 with the body temperature of a moment  ♫

179
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,320
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

180
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,168
Take it.

181
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
Youngsters have good stamina.

182
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,236
Drink some water.

183
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,920
Do you envy them?

184
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Come on. I went to work out yesterday.

185
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,720
Otherwise, I'd be better than them.

186
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,412
Falcon.

187
00:12:54,412 --> 00:12:56,020
Let's change a practice item.

188
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,696
It's not for myself.

189
00:12:58,696 --> 00:13:00,600
Look at Wukong.

190
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,440
He's thin like a monkey.

191
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,348
It's impossible for him to bulk up.

192
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,884
Good idea.

193
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,880
We won't lift logs later on.

194
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,220
- Let's lift Peng!  What do you think? 
 - Great!

195
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,760
 Good idea!

196
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,984
Don't bully an honest guy.

197
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:24,144
Businessmen always say they're honest.

198
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:27,836
Don't show off. Let's have a match when I feel better.

199
00:13:27,836 --> 00:13:31,140
You old boy! Keep trying!

200
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,636
Bye!

201
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,364
He left so quickly.

202
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:41,032
I'm sure he's going to drink.

203
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,440
Hello.

204
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,808
I'm out today.

205
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,840
Why don't you let me do that?

206
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,332
Okay. I see.

207
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,260
What's going on?

208
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,440
The firm narrowed my duty zone.

209
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,348
Why?

210
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:14,620
So many tasks. Can't ensure my work time.

211
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,800
You've worked 24 hours a day, so is it not enough to take a few days off?

212
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,960
As soon as your area shrinks, isn't this a disguise to reduce your income?

213
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,480
How can he? Give me your phone.

214
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,340
- I'll talk to him! 
 - It's okay.

215
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,904
I'm happy just having a job.

216
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:31,088
What are you saying?

217
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:33,400
You're too kind.

218
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,620
Others will bully you. Don't you know?

219
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,740
You need to be macho. Manly!

220
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,660
Just like me, understand?

221
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,184
You can't be that soft.

222
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,640
Remember. Hard!

223
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,340
Hi, dear.

224
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,960
 I thought you'd forgotten me.

225
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,140
 Don't you know what today is?

226
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,996
Today?

227
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,756
Stock the goods...

228
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,840
 I don't think you need to come back.

229
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,340
 Just live with your team!

230
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,160
 Then all our family can live on air!

231
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,920
Wait! Dear, calm down. Listen to me!

232
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,660
I'm now going to...

233
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,676
I haven't finished talking yet...

234
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,256
It's so beautiful here.

235
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:39,480
Shall we go mountain climbing after work?

236
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,460
Pardon me?

237
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,620
I was texting Luo Yuan.

238
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,740
So what did you say to me?

239
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,480
You're a real control freak to her.

240
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,300
She can't bear you anymore.

241
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,580
She is really pissed off this time by going to that school alone.

242
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,292
Anyway, I'm her brother.

243
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:05,840
To tell you the truth, I really envy her sometimes.

244
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,680
Why doesn't she respond to me?

245
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,280
She's already an adult.

246
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,852
She can take care of herself.

247
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,600

248
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,640
Okay, I know.

249
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,400
I'll come to find you when I finish work.

250
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,368
Come in, please.

251
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,524
 Be quiet.

252
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,120
 All right class.

253
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,980
 This is Ms. Luo, a teacher from Linjiang.

254
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:19,060
 Though she's young, she has rich teaching experience.

255
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,420
 I'm sure you'll like her class.

256
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,600
 Please applaud her.

257
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,232
 Do you like dancing?

258
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,928
 Though we can't hear music,

259
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:45,448
 our bodies can feel its rhythm...

260
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,340
 while our hearts can know it's beauty.

261
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,872
 Well done.

262
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,032
Ms. Luo, have a seat.

263
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,272
You again.

264
00:18:43,272 --> 00:18:45,568
So naughty.

265
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,344
This is life.

266
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,768
Come in.

267
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,312
President, here's my report.

268
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,164
I want to join the National General Surgery Exchange next week.

269
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,120
You're bent on academic research

270
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,620
but you should also pay attention to the way you communicate with patients.

271
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,516
I know someone complained this morning.

272
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,696
I heard... it's you who told the patient the way to the Complaint Office.

273
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,844
I know my attitude is undue

274
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:59,100
but I can't stand their indifference to missing the best period of treatment.

275
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,096
I'll accept all your punishment.

276
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:12,464
Yuxiao, come to my office.

277
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,220
National General Surgery Exchange will be held in our city.

278
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,732
Yuxiao, you'll represent our hospital to attend it and make a speech.

279
00:20:47,732 --> 00:20:50,880
I've prepared for so long for the Exchange.

280
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,000
Besides, I applied first.

281
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,692
She's right.

282
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,292
Dr. Zhan is more suitable than me.

283
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,140
Should I let you go as you've applied?

284
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,860
Dr. Cai has stayed here longer than you.

285
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,216
He has more clinical experience.

286
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:08,760
He's the perfect choice.

287
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,700
President, I can't agree with it.

288
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,440
All people are equal before science.

289
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,240
No seniority rank.

290
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,160
Whoever with a higher academic level should go.

291
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Do you think you have the highest level?

292
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,600
- Yuxiao, at the conference make sure you prepare well for it. 
 - I will.

293
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,920
Zhan Yan, go back and reflect on yourself.

294
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,936
I'll go talk to her.

295
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,120
Zhan Yan, you're too rude to him.

296
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,720
I don't despise you.

297
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
Don't think too much.

298
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,420
I know.

299
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,480
Take it easy.

300
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,148
I'll take the minutes and send them to you.

301
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:02,400
Thank you.

302
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,156
You're welcome.

303
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,996
Good!

304
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,700
Mr. Luo, you're really good at it!

305
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,960
Thank you, Chairman Fang.

306
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,084
- Please. 
 - Okay.

307
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:26,960
Is it your first time coming here?

308
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,416
Yes.

309
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:32,700
The environment here is nice, and the golf course was built to international standards.

310
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,860
People my age should practice more.

311
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,680
Sounds reasonable.

312
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,300
An earthquake! An earthquake!

313
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,496
Everyone, come out of the rooms!

314
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:01,120
- Run! 
  - Boys and girls! Run!

315
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,350
An earthquake!

316
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,732
Hurry up!

317
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,660
Hurry!

318
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,496
Come on!

319
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:23,272
Speed up!

320
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,836
 This way!

321
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,904
Hurry and run! It's an earthquake!

322
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,560
Go to the playground now!

323
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,060
Mom...

324
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,596
Run!

325
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,760
Hurry!

326
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,036
Ms. Luo! Leave!

327
00:25:06,036 --> 00:25:08,980
Go to the playground!

328
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,904
 Hurry!

329
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,600
 An earthquake!

330
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,120
 According to the National Seismic Network,

331
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,620
 an earthquake with a magnitude of 6

332
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,860
 happened in Fengxi at 10:28 Beijing time.

333
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,000
 The epicenter distance from the provincial capital city is about 60 kilometers.

334
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,100
 Surrounding areas could definitely feel it.

335
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,120
 It's a shallow earthquake this time with high damage levels.

336
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,660
 The losses caused by the quake are serious.

337
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,820
 Casualties are currently being counted.

338
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,020
 The leadership of the Party and the State

339
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,000
 are attaching great importance to the quake, and have commanded the PLA and PAP

340
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,780
 to work together to provide disaster relief quickly.

341
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,880
 China Earthquake Administration has dispatched

342
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,440
 emergency response teams and work teams,

343
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,800
 216 people in total, to provide emergency rescue and service on the site.

344
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,300
 Red Cross Society of China has allocated 557 tents, 2500 blankets,

345
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,880
 and other disaster-relief materials into the county.

346
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,580
 National Health Commission has assigned more than 10 health emergency teams...

347
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,080
- Peng! 
  - to the disaster area.

348
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,692
Take it and take care.

349
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,540
 Our hospital party committee has considered

350
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,840
 and decided to dispatch medical teams to support the site.

351
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,880
 Zhan Yan will lead the first set and Cai Yuxiao will lead the second.

352
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,316
 President, I apply to join group one.

353
00:26:50,316 --> 00:26:51,800
 Dr. Zhan is a lady.

354
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,520
 I'm more suitable for the lead than her.

355
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,100
 Dr. Zhan has rich experience in disaster relief.

356
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,380
 Her going was decided after careful study by the Party Committee of the Academy.

357
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,364
 I won't let you down.

358
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,800

359
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,460
Director Liu! I'm Qingshan.

360
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,540
The Light Chaser Rescue Team is ready.

361
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
We apply to rescue Fengxi.

362
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:16,760
 I agree. Remember to obey commands.

363
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,260
All the rescue teams are rushing to Fengxi.

364
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,520
- Unified dispatch is necessary to ensure rescue efforts
go smoothly and orderly. 
 -  Roger.

365
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,240
 I'm on the way there.

366
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,260
Call me as you get something new.

367
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,760
Yes.

368
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,736
- Let's go. 
  - Yes, sir!

369
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,630

370
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,970

371
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,400
What's happening?

372
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,840
I can't contact Luo Yuan.

373
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
I have to find her.

374
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,060
- Are you crazy? 
 - Chairman Fang.

375
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,140
Please look after her!

376
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,944
Okay!

377
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,520
 Fengxi Fire Fighting Force rushed to the disaster area.

378
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,920
 They were the first batch of professionals to appear on the scene.

379
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,100
 The Air Force has dispatched large and medium-sized military and civilian transport aircraft

380
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,224
 to transport PLA soldiers and armed police officers and soldiers to the Fengqi disaster area by air in batches.

381
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,744
Please come and help my dad!

382
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,440
Excuse me, how can I get to Fengxi School of Special Education?

383
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,200
They are still inside, but don't go any further.

384
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,480
Aftershocks keep coming, it's too dangerous.

385
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,080
 Let's go!

386
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,500
 Mom! Mom...

387
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,792
 Mom!

388
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,292
 - Mom...  
 - Anyone here?

389
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,940
 Mom...

390
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,040
 Mom...

391
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,160
Kid! Can you hear me?

392
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,100
 Mom...

393
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,140
Kid! Hang in there!

394
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,344
I'll come and save you!

395
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,450

396
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,068
 Be careful!

397
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,840
 Let's go!

398
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,540
 Slow down.

399
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,112
 Watch out!

400
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,668
Captain! Captain!

401
00:31:52,668 --> 00:31:55,148
Captain!

402
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:56,760
Tell everyone to speed up.

403
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,500
- We need to get there ASAP! 
 - Okay!

404
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,408
Kid!

405
00:32:19,408 --> 00:32:22,160
Kid! Hold on!

406
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,740
I can't save you only by myself.

407
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,492
I need to find others.

408
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:31,144
Don't leave me... Don't leave me alone. I'm scared.

409
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,800
I'll be right back! Hang in there!

410
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,972
Anyone here?

411
00:32:38,972 --> 00:32:40,880
Who can hear me?

412
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,200
A kid is here! Come and save him!

413
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,660
Kid? Kid!

414
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,700
 Materials are here.

415
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,120
Hurry up!

416
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,840
 Doctor.

417
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,800
Please be gentle.

418
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,420
 Doctor!

419
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,100
Come and check on him. Hurry!

420
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,500
- No thanks now. 
 - Confirm the blood transfusion location.

421
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,660
- Zirui, prepare for surgery. 
 - Sis!

422
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,620
Sis!

423
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,520
Why are you here?

424
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,892
I was here to take a walk.

425
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,180
What's wrong with your hand?

426
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,600
It's because I was in a hurry to escape and then I fell down.

427
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,320
Find a nurse to patch it up.

428
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,680
Go back with the hospital transport vehicle.

429
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,740
Don't bring others trouble. I need to get to a surgery.

430
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,964
Don't leave me alone...

431
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,600
Kid?

432
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,444
Can you hear me?

433
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,000
Kid?

434
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,220
Kid!

435
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,504
Can you chat with me?

436
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,116
What's your name?

437
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:23,520
My name is Lele.

438
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,020
Lele.

439
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,116
Good boy.

440
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:29,760
Is anyone else beside you?

441
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,452
My mom...

442
00:34:31,452 --> 00:34:33,000
She's here...

443
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,844
Can she talk?

444
00:34:34,844 --> 00:34:38,172
She's sleeping.

445
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,736
Lele, she's exhausted.

446
00:34:45,736 --> 00:34:48,332
Let her sleep for a while.

447
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,900
Lele, don't cry.

448
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,176
Let me tell you a story, okay?

449
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,252
Lele.

450
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:23,180
There was a little boy at your age.

451
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,780
He's the same as you,

452
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:30,530
suffering from a serious earthquake in his childhood.

453
00:35:31,368 --> 00:35:35,960
He and his parents...

454
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,912
were buried beneath a collapsed house.

455
00:35:38,912 --> 00:35:41,256
It was dark all around.

456
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:43,292
He could see nothing.

457
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,412
He was quite scared...

458
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,636
so he kept crying.

459
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,716
 Mom... I'm frightened...

460
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:08,960
 Calm down, my son. Mom is here.

461
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,780
 Don't worry. Someone is on the way to save us.

462
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,400
 Don't be afraid.

463
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,100
 Can they find us?

464
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,900
 Yes.

465
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,660
 I'm sure they will.

466
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,228
But he didn't give up.

467
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:29,828
Lele, he was finally rescued later on.

468
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:34,320
He survived and he had a younger sister.

469
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,368
He had a happy life.

470
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:39,196
So...

471
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,312
So trust me.

472
00:36:41,312 --> 00:36:42,840
Don't give up!

473
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,728
You must hang in there.

474
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:47,084
You will be saved.

475
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,576
Yuan Yuan.

476
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,468
Yuan Yuan.

477
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,590

478
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,844
Lele.

479
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Lele? Lele?

480
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,836
Don't fall asleep!

481
00:37:22,836 --> 00:37:24,500
Lele?

482
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,756
Lele! Wake up, Lele!

483
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,912
Wait!

484
00:37:52,912 --> 00:37:54,200
A kid is here!

485
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,040
Stop! What's going on inside?

486
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,460
He's called Lele.

487
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,160
I was talking with him.

488
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,520
But he has no response now.

489
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm afraid he can't wait.

490
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,960
- Xiong Fei, use Snake Eye to probe inside. 
 - Yes.

491
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,868
Kid?

492
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,160
Can you hear me?

493
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,788
You're that courier.

494
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,676
Hold on.

495
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:21,140
There's a blind zone from this angle.

496
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,800
You'd better probe again from another side to avoid secondary collapse.

497
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Quite professional.

498
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,284
Come on.

499
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,520
Left.

500
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,672
Left. Okay!

501
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,600
It's not complex inside.

502
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,080
- Peng, forcible entry. 
 - Yes.

503
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,280
Falcon, lead others there at once.

504
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
We'll join you soon.

505
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
Roger.

506
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,080
Guys, come with me!

507
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,580
 Yes!

508
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,612
Lele! Hang in there!

509
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,572
 Step aside!

510
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,060
The bleeding has stopped.

511
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,340
Sew it up and I'll go to the next one.

512
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,940
Okay.

513
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
Peng, send him to a hospital nearby.

514
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,880
Yes.

515
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
Wukong!

516
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,480
Excuse me!

517
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,820
Sir.

518
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,700
You'd better leave here at once. It's risky.

519
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,380
Others! Let's go and join the rest.

520
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,700
Captain, you can leave first. We'll tackle it here.

521
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,320
- Okay, cheer up. 
 - We will.

522
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,560
Doctor!

523
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,016
Peng!

524
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,476
What's going on?

525
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,820
He was just saved.

526
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,180
His name is Lele. His mom clasped him tightly before death.

527
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,340
It was hard to separate them.

528
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,840
Come with me.

529
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,340
Let's go!

530
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,440
- Hurry! 
 - Watch out!

531
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,240
Hurry up!

532
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,664
Leave now!

533
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,640
Excuse me, have you seen a teacher called Luo Yuan?

534
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,960
Has she been saved?

535
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,520
The one from Linjiang?

536
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,760
Yes! Exactly!

537
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,940
- Where's she? 
 - She went to save kids.

538
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,016
She's still inside.

539
00:42:53,970 --> 00:43:03,960

540
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,132
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

541
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:21,086
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

542
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:29,124
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

543
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,090
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

544
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:44,194
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

545
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:52,090
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

546
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:59,574
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

547
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:06,690
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

548
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:15,510
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

549
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:21,640
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

550
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:30,440
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

551
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:37,940
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

552
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,864
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

553
00:44:41,864 --> 00:44:45,596
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

554
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:49,194
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

555
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:52,980
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

556
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,690
♫  I can't fly  ♫

557
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:00,344
♫  But I can look up  ♫

558
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:08,270
♫  I'm chasing the light on the road  ♫
