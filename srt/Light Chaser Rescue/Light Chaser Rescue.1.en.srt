Be careful with this foot.

176
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:38,300
Be careful.

177
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,730
Watch it.

178
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,300
Slowly.

179
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,030
Slowly.

180
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,610
Okay.

181
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,820
I got this.

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,850
Go! Go!

183
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,220
Good job! Yes! There you go!

184
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,820
Thank you all!

185
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,420
(Law Positive Law Firm)

186
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,980
(Zhan Yan)

187
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,130
Mrs. Qin.

188
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,370
Attorney Luo, good morning.

189
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,090
Good morning.

190
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:00,850
Same as usual.

191
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,130
Thank you. Thank you.

192
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,670
(At 11:18 this morning,)

193
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,310
(a car accident occurred on Airport Road,)

194
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,180
(causing a serious traffic jam.)

195
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,300
Hello, Attorney Luo.

196
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,240
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

197
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,010
You are welcome.

198
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,540
Here's the invoice
for the new rescue kits.

199
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:23,950
Thank you.

200
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,120
The rescue kits you bought for everyone

201
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
were never used.

202
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,520
But you keep them renewed.

203
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,710
Hope we never have to use them.

204
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,940
What took you so long?

205
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,490
Mr. Ma's been
waiting for you for 20 minutes.

206
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,660
Got held up on the road.

207
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,370
What is this?

208
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,250
I found it.

209
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,220
There's an ID in it.

210
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,530
Let's keep it for now.

211
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:41,890
Okay.

212
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,700
Let's go.

213
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,550
(Someone took the emergency lane)

214
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,420
(and was caught by the police.)

215
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,220
(Can you believe this kind of person?)

216
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,760
(What is)

217
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,460
(the rush anyway?)

218
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,120
Check these regulations here

219
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,950
one by one properly.

220
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,890
Mr. Ma, sorry to have kept you waiting.

221
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,060
Well, you're getting famous.

222
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,770
You're all over the WeChat Moments.

223
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,600
Did you make such a big scene

224
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,540
just to see me?

225
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,770
Thank you for that.

226
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,300
I'll pay the fine for you.

227
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,180
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

228
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:17,640
Enough with

229
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,580
the chit-chat.

230
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,820
Let's talk about business.

231
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,330
You see, our merger case

232
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,350
with Ruyi Pictures

233
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,100
has come to

234
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,340
the due diligence, right?

235
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,120
And everything was going smoothly.

236
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,460
But somehow,

237
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,090
an unknown illustrator showed up

238
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,580
and insisted
on joining other illustrators

239
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,970
together to defend their rights,

240
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,810
saying if we don't agree,
they'll make things big.

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:38,820
Mr. Ma,

242
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,640
just tell me what you want.

243
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,790
Some compensation

244
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,160
is no problem.

245
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,570
But it's impossible to give her credit.

246
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,810
You know,

247
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,180
I could

248
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,100
get that price

249
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,310
just because

250
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,220
we had these

251
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,400
works with KK's name on them.

252
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,760
At a moment like this,

253
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,460
how can I put another

254
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,640
illustrator's name on them?

255
00:15:59,230 --> 00:15:59,940
But the contract

256
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
I drew up for you

257
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,700
had circumvented

258
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,330
the credit problem.

259
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,670
The credit

260
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,750
depends on the illustrators'

261
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,630
contribution to the work.

262
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,750
That leaves a lot of room

263
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,510
for interpretation.

264
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,880
This time is different.

265
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,700
The idea of the story

266
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,370
was originally Ding Dingding's,

267
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,370
and she was the one in charge.

268
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,450
What is her relationship with KK?

269
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,750
In the beginning,

270
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,670
she agreed to let KK

271
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,100
bring her along to draw

272
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,690
under KK's style.

273
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,270
And I agreed to sign her name

274
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,690
on it back then.

275
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,940
But after it was done,

276
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,790
KK insisted that

277
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,510
she's the only one

278
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,040
got to sign her name on it.

279
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
What was I supposed to do?

280
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,470
So,

281
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,330
you thought

282
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,990
she was a pushover,

283
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,390
but it turned out

284
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,720
she's a tough one.

285
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,820
Don't put it that way.

286
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,820
I have to be practical, right?

287
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,570
What contract

288
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,780
did Ding Dingding sign?

289
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,210
The illustrator contract

290
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,350
you gave me.

291
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,960
But that girl

292
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,470
has kept enough sketches

293
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,210
to prove her contribution

294
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,390
deserves the credit.

295
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,480
Then why would she

296
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,240
be willing

297
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
to work with KK

298
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,810
and agree to contribute

299
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,020
her idea to the work?

300
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,950
She was a fan of KK,

301
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,000
and said

302
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,610
as long as she could work with KK,

303
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,340
she'd want

304
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,060
no money

305
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,340
or credit.

306
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:20,270
Mr. Ma,

307
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,370
about that,

308
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,780
do you have any evidence?

309
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,740
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

310
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,270
Hello, Dr. Zhan.

311
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,340
Hi, Zhan Yan.

312
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,620
Director Zha's surgery.

313
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,040
Bring me

314
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,100
the CT scan.

315
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,860
Again?

316
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,950
Is everyone clear now?

317
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:45,710
Okay.

318
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,720
Go with this plan

319
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,230
and get prepared for surgery.

320
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,760
What's going on?

321
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,580
Dr. Zhan.

322
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,950
Zirui, medical record.

323
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:54,990
Dr. Zhan,

324
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,540
didn't you go on a vacation?

325
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,540
Looks like you just got off the plane.

326
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,540
Fang Xiaoya, 16 years old,

327
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,860
came to the hospital
because of abdominal pain.

328
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,720
After examination,

329
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,580
she's diagnosed with a space-occupying
lesion in the pancreatic head.

330
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,670
What's your opinion?

331
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,320
Director Zha had us

332
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,710
in a pre-op meeting,

333
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,650
and we're going to

334
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,710
give her a whipple.

335
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:19,950
Meeting notes.

336
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,620
Here.

337
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,280
You brats up there,

338
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,620
listen up!

339
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,370
On the premise

340
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,710
of safety,

341
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,040
get down here

342
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,520
as fast as possible!

343
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,450
Is that clear?

344
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,580
Yes, sir!

345
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,040
Ready?

346
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,150
Yes!

347
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,190
And, go!

348
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,380
Go, go, go!

349
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,240
You're moving like turtles.

350
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,990
The wounded
would have died several times!

351
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:55,300
Not bad.

352
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,820
Only 0.8 seconds slower than earlier.

353
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,540
Don't ignore the 0.8 seconds.

354
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,300
In the actual rescue,

355
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,810
it is likely that

356
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,850
because of 0.8 seconds,

357
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,280
you'll fail to save the wounded

358
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,510
and get injured instead.

359
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:14,950
So,

360
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,620
all you have to do now is

361
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,340
practice more,

362
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,060
and make it much faster,

363
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,760
more precise, and more accurate!

364
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,450
Understand?

365
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,230
Yes, sir!

366
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,380
Look at you.

367
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,270
Your clean and soft skin

368
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,860
says you haven't trained enough.

369
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,990
A hundred push-ups with weights!

370
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,710
What's so funny?

371
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,340
The same for you!

372
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,060
(Light Chaser Rescue)

373
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,340
Look.

374
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,860
Hey, Falcon.

375
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,340
Falcon.

376
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,910
Giving your tough training again?

377
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,100
You got injured?

378
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,670
Just some scratches.

379
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,510
It's okay.

380
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,670
Don't take those as achievements.

381
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,040
If you want to save others,

382
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,190
ensure your safety first.

383
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,820
Look at Xiong Fei.

384
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,380
Safe and sound.

385
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,340
Why?

386
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,130
He's very skilled.

387
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,860
Think about it, okay?

388
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,760
He was helping Zhan Yan

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,860
and got the scratch.

390
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,990
Yan was there, too?

391
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,040
Is she okay?

392
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,720
Yes.

393
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,780
Luckily, she was there.

394
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,750
Captain.

395
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,380
Captain.

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,990
Good, good.

397
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,300
Like father, like son.

398
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,810
(Zhan Qingshan, a member of Communist Party of China,
founder and captain of Light Chaser Rescue)

399
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,270
Great work, guys.

400
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:49,950
Stay for dinner

401
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,340
if you're available tonight.

402
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,090
Great!

403
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:52,930
I'm free.

404
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,450
I'm free.

405
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm free, too.

406
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
Lots of talks, no action?

407
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,510
Chip in or help.

408
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
Give it to me.

409
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:08,850
What?

410
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,720
I heard

411
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,650
Dr. Zhan took

412
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,150
Director Zha's surgery again.

413
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,450
Dr. Zhan's plan is too risky.

414
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:15,170
I don't think

415
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,380
it's a smart move.

416
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,020
Then what's the point?

417
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,940
The position of
associate senior doctor of

418
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,370
General Surgery Department
is vacant now.

419
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,320
And both Dr. Cai and Dr. Zhan

420
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,720
are candidates for it.

421
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,510
Maybe that's what she's after.

422
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,750
What are you discussing?

423
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,190
If you know the surgical plan,

424
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,150
you'll be surgeons, too, right?

425
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:33,760
If you have time,

426
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,060
just get the jobs done

427
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,540
and gossip less.

428
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,090
The patient in Bed 3

429
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,170
can be discharged early.

430
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,990
He's recovering well.

431
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,300
Yuxiao, I have more faith in you.

432
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,150
Thank you, Director Zha.

433
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,100
Prepare to close her up.

434
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,020
Zirui, you take over.

435
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:17,620
Okay.

436
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:36,320
That was a test for both medical skills

437
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,910
and responsibility.

438
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:39,320
Dr. Zhan

439
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,800
got the job done

440
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
not by luck

441
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,820
but actual strength.

442
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,720
I hope you

443
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,240
learn how considerate

444
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,520
and responsible

445
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,890
Dr. Zhan is for her patients.

446
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,690
And

447
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,090
keep improving

448
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,510
your medical skills as well.

449
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,340
Hi, Dr. Zhan.

450
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,580
Got in the O.R. right after coming back?

451
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,240
Am I supposed to watch Director Zha

452
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,150
cutting out people's organs?

453
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,540
I was in the pre-op meeting.

454
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,520
To be honest,

455
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,510
Director Zha's approach

456
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,020
was also practicable.

457
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,100
Besides,

458
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:28,990
you don't want to

459
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,210
offend your senior

460
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,780
over such a small surgery.

461
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,780
It is practicable,

462
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,340
but it's not the best option.

463
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,060
Since I have to think for the patient,

464
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,750
I cannot always be the nice one.

465
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,710
Yuxiao,

466
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,710
that's the biggest
difference between us.

467
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,910
All right, forget it.

468
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,020
Let me remind you.

469
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,670
In the hospital,

470
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,150
success means everything.

471
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,100
The title exam's coming.

472
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,580
How's your paper going?

473
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm working on it.

474
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,300
Need to put more effort into it.

475
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,380
If you need my help,

476
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,620
just ask.

477
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,430
No, I'm good.

478
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,510
After all, there is only one position.

479
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,230
We're all on our own.

480
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,340
Play fair and square.

481
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:07,990
Actually, both of us

482
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,950
will be associate seniors someday.

483
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,670
How about this?

484
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,300
I won't compete with you this time.

485
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,060
You get it first.

486
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,990
Next time it'll be my turn, okay?

487
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,750
This is not

488
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,190
a matter of giving and taking.

489
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,230
You're so stubborn.

490
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,760
How is your

491
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,930
case study in

492
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,230
diving medicine going?

493
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,230
I left my bag in the car.

494
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:54,780
Look.

495
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,060
What's going on up there?

496
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,930
What's going on?

497
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,510
This is insane.

498
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,560
Ding Dingding!

499
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,280
Dingding!

500
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,850
Ding Dingding, stop it!

501
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,370
We don't want the credit.

502
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,760
That's right.

503
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,990
We'll learn from this mistake.

504
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,410
I know

505
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,650
you're too afraid to go against them.

506
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,520
But we

507
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,620
can't be bullied like this anymore.

508
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,410
Calm down.

509
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,000
Take it easy.

510
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,710
Easy, easy.

511
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,280
Ma Baoming,

512
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,100
you unscrupulous publisher!

513
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,100
(Live)
You signed the unequal contract with us,

514
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,040
took away our work

515
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,520
in disguise,

516
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,610
and gave us no credit.

517
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,270
Painting is our pursuit

518
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,430
and also our way to make a living.

519
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,970
Yes, we paint

520
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,800
to feed ourselves,

521
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,780
but we also have dignity and principles.

522
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,280
The work is like a baby to me,

523
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,960
and now you took it away

524
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,410
and you won't let it take my name?

525
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,510
Does that make sense?

526
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,250
You're still young.

527
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,100
You have
your entire life in front of you.

528
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,230
Don't do it.

529
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,430
Don't jump! Don't jump!

530
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:51,990
Get back!

531
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,020
Don't jump. Calm down.

532
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,460
Get back!

533
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,450
(Police)
Don't do anything stupid!

534
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,300
Easy, easy.

535
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,280
Get back.

536
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,950
Get back. Get back.

537
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,270
Keep order!

538
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,040
Stay back!

539
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,990
Stay back. Stay back.

540
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:06,300
Calm down, Ding Dingding!

541
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,190
What's wrong with her?

542
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:10,820
Don't do it!

543
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,150
Go, get the safety air cushion.

544
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,660
Come down and talk.

545
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,380
Attorney Luo, you're finally here.

546
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,000
I told you

547
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,560
Ding Dingding

548
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,020
is a tough one.

549
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,280
But I didn't expect her

550
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,670
to use her brains that way.

551
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,320
I just told them

552
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,000
to keep her calm,

553
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,380
but it didn't work.

554
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,620
Oh, no.

555
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,930
It's only been a while,

556
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,690
and the viewer number's passed 100,000!

557
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,710
Oh my God!

558
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:35,100
Attorney Luo,

559
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,610
my company is counting on you.

560
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,190
Attorney Luo.

561
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,450
How much will you pay?

562
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,340
Ten thousand.

563
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,230
At the most.

564
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,580
Attorney Luo, please go up yourself.

565
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,800
I won't go with you.

566
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,230
You're involved, yet you're not going?

567
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,340
I'm afraid if I go up there,

568
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,780
she'll be provoked again.

569
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,280
You're my lawyer.

570
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,340
Go talk to her on my behalf,

571
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:52,950
all right?

572
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,670
Okay.

573
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,300
Please.

574
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:56,670
Please.

575
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,040
Zhan Yan, your cousin...

576
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,230
Your cousin
is going to jump off the building.

577
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,690
Don't talk nonsense. What cousin?

578
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,300
She's...

579
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,150
Oh, right, Ding Dingding.

580
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,340
It's a good name to remember.

581
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,270
(Live)
Anyway, today

582
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
I have to talk to Ma Baoming…

583
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,580
(Why is it him?)

584
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,660
(This stream is suspended for violating
guidelines and is being regularized)

585
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,620
It went black?

586
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:44,910
Oh, no.

587
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,510
She jumped?

588
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,040
What are you thinking?

589
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,580
It's a matter of life and death.

590
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,910
Why aren't you nervous at all?

591
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,710
Call the E.R.

592
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,910
I'm going with them.

593
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,060
I hope

594
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,540
anyone who has the same experience

595
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,060
can be brave.

596
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,820
Ms. Ding.

597
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,860
Who are you?

598
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,060
Don't come near.

599
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,230
Or I'll jump.

600
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,510
I won't.

601
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:11,560
I'm your company's

602
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,380
legal counsel,

603
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,170
surnamed Luo.

604
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,750
Where's Ma Baoming? Let him talk.

605
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,510
You can tell me directly

606
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,820
what you want.

607
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,510
I have Mr. Ma's complete authority.

608
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,270
My request is simple.

609
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,620
I want credits and

610
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,430
compensation for all the illustrators.

611
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,270
And,

612
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,860
give us back

613
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,470
every single cent the company

614
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,470
have robbed us all these years.

615
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,750
How about this?

616
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:39,860
You come down first.

617
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,060
Let's talk about it somewhere else.

618
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:42,860
No.

619
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,430
Let's talk right here.

620
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,540
Maybe you can't see clearly,

621
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,230
but I'm sure you can hear it.

622
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,020
KK,

623
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,780
I really

624
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,950
love your work so much.

625
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,540
You're my idol.

626
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,540
You know what?

627
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,020
If I get to learn from you

628
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,540
and work with you,

629
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,240
I'll do it

630
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,620
without pay or credit.

631
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:04,800
As long as you can

632
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,540
learn from Ms. KK,

633
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,670
you'd do it

634
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:09,820
without pay or credit.

635
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,560
Wait.

636
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,000
It was just my gesture.

637
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,710
How can it be taken as evidence?

638
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,300
Let alone

639
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,140
whether your words in this video

640
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,040
can be taken as an oral agreement,

641
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,340
for this comic,

642
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,540
you came up

643
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,860
with a very typical idea.

644
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,060
As for the content
and character settings,

645
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,520
that's what Ms. KK

646
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,340
and all the illustrators discussed.

647
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,990
What about the number of sketches?

648
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,540
I drew the most.

649
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,860
Even if I can't
be the first to sign my name,

650
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,150
you can't leave me out, right?

651
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,860
These are your imitation

652
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:53,890
of Ms. KK's style,

653
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,820
which was agreed upon by both of you

654
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:57,910
from the very beginning.

655
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,270
In this comic,

656
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,860
the lines, the colors,

657
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,800
and the composition of the characters

658
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,690
are all of Ms. KK's

659
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,240
unique style.

660
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
And these are all

661
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,710
protected by law.

662
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,300
Hang on.

663
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,540
Ma Baoming agreed to that.

664
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,620
Okay, I get it.

665
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,800
So Ma Baoming's

666
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,910
been planning this from the beginning

667
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,620
and he never
wanted to give us credit for it,

668
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,300
right?

669
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,620
Just save it.

670
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,950
If you really want to jump,

671
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,520
you wouldn't have waited

672
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,860
until the viewer number
spiked to 100,000.

673
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,270
What do you mean?

674
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:32,470
Are you pushing it?

675
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,670
To tell you the truth,

676
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,270
if you jump,

677
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,300
the company won't

678
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,340
be affected

679
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,520
or suffer any loss.

680
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,560
It will only make this comic

681
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,580
a hot topic.

682
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,510
In this information boom,

683
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,060
news like your jump

684
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,380
will be completely swamped

685
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,190
after tonight,

686
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,100
which means your death

687
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,190
will be worthless and meaningless.

688
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,710
Why are you so cold-blooded?

689
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,620
I'm just trying

690
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,100
to help you analyze.

691
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,150
Ms. Ding,

692
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,270
I've seen your work.

693
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,760
You are a very creative

694
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,780
and talented cartoonist.

695
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,750
Even if your name

696
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,910
is not in this work,

697
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,060
I believe,

698
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,620
as long as you don't give up

699
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,860
and keep trying,

700
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,190
in the future,

701
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,150
you will create

702
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,510
a work that is truly your own.

703
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,910
Mr. Ma has agreed

704
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:34,670
to pay you

705
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,950
ten thousand for your work.

706
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,950
Really?

707
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,780
Yes.

708
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,340
What about the others?

709
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,300
They will, too.

710
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,230
But the amount

711
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,270
will be determined according

712
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,710
to their contribution.

713
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,150
Please come down.

714
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,340
And we

715
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,100
can sign the contract right away.

716
00:32:59,010 --> 00:32:59,820
Do you mean it

717
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,380
that I'll have my own work?

718
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,380
Come on, give me your hand.

719
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,670
Ding Dingding!

720
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:22,890
Ding Dingding!

721
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,430
Oh, my God, that was scary.

722
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,020
That was close.

723
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,340
Thank goodness they have the cushion.

724
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,060
So dangerous.

725
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,190
The cushion saved her.

726
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:29,710
Yes.

727
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,580
How dangerous!

728
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,340
(Ambulance)

729
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,380
Ding Dingding.

730
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,060
Ding Dingding.

731
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:50,750
Are you okay?

732
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,300
You all right?

733
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,780
I was so scared.

734
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,750
Take it easy. Slowly.

735
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,860
Come on, be careful.

736
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,020
I'm glad you're okay.

737
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,020
What are you doing here?

738
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,230
Can't I be here?

739
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,380
You have my bag.

740
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,780
I was looking for the owner.

741
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,500
Central Hospital. Payment on delivery.

742
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:17,270
Thank you.

743
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:23,340
Is this connection established?

744
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,980
With the hospital?

745
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,300
Is it something to be happy about?

746
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,420
Luckily, they got here in time.

747
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,670
Are you okay?

748
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,420
Does she need a check-up?

749
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,940

Ai Rui'er,

754
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,320
please send the diving bag I gave you

755
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,300
to this address.

756

Found the owner?

758
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,760
Guess you have
a connection with this cutie.

759
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,460
You met her twice in two days.

760
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,550
Cutie?

761
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,630
I saw her ID photo.

762
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:41,900
I wonder what happened

00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,940

It's inside, right?

772
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,380
Okay, thank you.

773
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:45,980
Let's learn a new dance today,

774
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,860
okay?

775
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,070
Feel the rhythm with your heart.

776
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,670
Be careful.

777
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:25,980
Yangyang, what's wrong?

778
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,270
Yangyang.

779
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,940
What's wrong?

780
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:31,340
What's wrong with him?

781
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,380
I think he's choking.

782
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,030
Choking?

783
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,660
I got this.

784
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,150
Okay.

785
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,500
He spit it out.

786
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,820
- He spit it out.
- How do you feel, kid?

787
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,860
It's all right.

788
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:46,710
Yangyang.

789
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,980
Are you okay, Yangyang?

790
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,110
Thank you.

791
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,780
I didn't know what to do just now.

792
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,300
Thank you so much.

793
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,300
No problem.

794
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,320
But as teachers,

795
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,230
you need to know

796
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,710
some basic first aid methods.

797
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:02,900
You know about first aid?

798
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,760
This is

799
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,280
Miss Luo.

800
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,230
She was signing

801
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,110
do you know about first aid?

802
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,270
You mean the Heimlich maneuver?

803
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,860
I'm with the Light Chaser Rescue

804
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,420
and know some first aid skills.

805
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,760
You are amazing.

806
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,980
Let's congratulate

807
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:22,940
Attorney Gao for getting

808
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,440
another big case.

809
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,340
Thank you. Thank you.

810
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,420
Congratulations.

811
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,940
Thank you all.

812
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:32,500
Gao,

813
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,820
you are

814
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,550
getting closer to partnership now.

815
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,590
I'll keep it going.

816
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,070
Luo Ben,

817
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,710
try to keep up, all right?

818
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:44,900
I'll follow your example.

819
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,900
Cut it out.

820
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,340
We all know

821
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,980
you like to take a slow start.

822
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,860
Attorney Luo works hard

823
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,980
for the law firm.

824
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,190
If fame and fortune are brought,

825
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,460
we'll all look good.

826
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,150
Am I right?

827
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,500
That's right.

828
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,190
See? What did I say?

829
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,980
In front of Ai Rui'er,

830
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,300
you can't say anything

831
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,460
bad about Luo Ben.

832
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,230
Or

833
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,300
she'll turn right into

834
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,380
his defense attorney.

835
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,110
How's that?

836
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,380
You're speechless.

837
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,380
He,

838
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,550
when will you assign me

839
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,550
a partner like this?

840
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,460
Ai Rui'er,

841
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,670
why don't you come to assist me?

842
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,750
You'll get all the credit.

843
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:21,670
I'm willing to

844
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:23,190
be the man behind you.

845
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,590
You're too late.

846
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,420
The place is taken.

847
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,110
Taken…

848
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,300
Let's play fair.

849
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,380
Hey, Gao,

850
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,750
don't even think about undermining me.

851
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:35,780
You've done that

852
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,190
a lot these years.

853
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,630
Yeah, ditto.

854
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,670
That's right.

855
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,070
Competition helps us improve.

856
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,090
And in that way,

857
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:45,460
our law firm

858
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,780
can have vitality,

859
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,780
right?

860
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,750
Yes.

861
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,750
All right.

862
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,860
Let's make a deal.

863
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,460
Today, we can't let Gao

864
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,820
leave standing up straight.

865
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,750
Give him a toast.

866
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,370
Okay.

867
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,780
Thank you, thank you.

868
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,300
A word?

869
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,340
What's up?

870
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,670
Fangqin Group's

871
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,270
annual bid I told you

872
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,300
is very high.

873
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,940
What do you think?

874
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,630
Why don't you give it to Gao?

875
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,500
He's one case away

876
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,750
from being a partner, right?

877
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:32,980
If you don't want it,

878
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,380
I'll go to Gao.

879
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,170
Pay attention to what I just told you.

880
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:37,630
Okay.

881
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,230
You old fox.

882
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:45,670
He is

883
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,150
on vacation in Fengxi.

884
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,300
Go there

885
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:49,460
as soon as possible.

886
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,230
Okay.

887
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,220
Watch the steps.

888
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:58,980
Slowly.

889
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,410
Make sure you get him

890
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,250
home safely.

891
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,060
Okay.

892
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,770
Be safe.

893
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:06,810
Remember to get me a partner.

894
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:07,670
Okay, okay.

895
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,110
Okay,

896
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:11,980
I'm going.

897
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,970
Remember the thing I told you.

898
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,750
I will.

899
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,070
Got to go.

900
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,150
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

901
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:18,900
Will you give me a ride?

902
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,890
Luo Yuan is off duty now.

903
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,980
I have to hurry back.

904
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,780
You're watching Luo Yuan too closely.

905
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,520
Girls her age

906
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,050
always have dates after work.

907
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,880
Luo Yuan is not like

908
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,610
ordinary girls.

909
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,400
You spoil her too much.

910
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,360
You can't take care of her forever.

911
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,960
Someday, she'll get married.

912
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,720
She'll fall in love

913
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,110
and live her own life.

914
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,200
And so will you.

915
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,800
Yes, you're right.

916
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,190
I won't be here in the next few days.

917
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,270
I have to go prepare

918
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,340
some food for her.

919
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,240
See you tomorrow.

920
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,400
Can I help you?

921
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,110
I want this bread and this one.

922
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,010
Okay, just a minute.

923
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,840
What are you doing?

924
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,360
Delete it.

925
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,490
Delete what?

926
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:32,680
Delete it.

927
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,280
Done.

928
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,970
Empty the Recycle Bin.

929
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,720
All deleted. You can check it.

930
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,240
What are you doing?

931
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,090
