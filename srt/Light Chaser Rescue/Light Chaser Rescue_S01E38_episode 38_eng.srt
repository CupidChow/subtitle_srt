00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,920
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,850
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,550
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,920
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,170
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,170
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,320
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,170
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,420
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,050
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,470
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,920

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,980

20
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,139
 - Let's go together after work. 
 - Okay.

21
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,171
The post-production company can keep working for some time.

22
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,314
But we're about to promote and release the film.

23
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:52,714
We don't have any money right now.

24
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,171
Hello? Who are you calling?

25
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:13,200
 Hello, is it Zhou Mingming?

26
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,400
 I'm Li Jian's father.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,520
Hello, Uncle.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,059
 When are you available?

29
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,490
 I'd like to see you.

30
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,059
Did Li Jian make any mistakes recently?

31
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:26,520
 I'm not going to talk about him

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,739
 but to talk about our partnership.

33
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,957
Li Jian's father talked to Mingming for the whole afternoon yesterday.

34
00:02:41,957 --> 00:02:46,580
He offered to invest in our company's film project to solve our financial problems.

35
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,260
Really?

36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,400
That's great.

37
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,220
He answered my pressing needs.

38
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,400
I talked to them before.

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,342
He didn't seem to be interested in our firm.

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,279
It's all thanks to Mingming.

41
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,060
Yang Zhao and Li Jian got lost when they went camping.

42
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,120
Mingming saved them.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,899
Now both of them do charity work with Mingming.

44
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:18,500
Li Jian's father was so happy when he learned of it.

45
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,050
Mingming does rescue work.

46
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,028
I didn't realize he could find investors.

47
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,660
Yeah.

48
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,760
Qiqi, thank you for all this time.

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,460
It's the least I could do.

50
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,740
You know I have always liked you.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,140
In my mind,

52
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,570
I've always hoped that you could take your relationship with Mingming to the next level.

53
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,800
I understand, Chairman.

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,520
Mingming and I grew up together.

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,770
We know each other very well.

56
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,640
Trust me.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,014
I'll do my best to help him.

58
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,900
- I... 
 - By the way, Chairman.

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,442
Did you see the news?

60
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,330
It made our film a sensation.

61
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,485
What news?

62
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,614
You haven't seen it yet?

63
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,620
Here.

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,728
 Two residents went into cardiac arrest in a row because of a heart attack

65
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,071
 in a community to the south of the city.

66
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,028
 Luckily, the community is equipped with the AEDs.

67
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:27,140
 Neighborhood crews were trained in CPR.

68
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,014
 With their timely assistance, two residents were saved from death.

69
00:04:31,014 --> 00:04:33,471
 We've got the donor of the AEDs,

70
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:36,157
 Miss Ding Dingding, the young cartoonist.

71
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,614
 Hello, I'm a reporter from the TV station.

72
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,200
 I'd like to interview you.

73
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,950
 How did it come to you to donate the AEDs?

74
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,400
 First of all...

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,742
 Please look at the camera.

76
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:48,470
 - Here, look here. 
 - Yeah.

77
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,357
 Hello, everyone, I'm Ding Dingding.

78
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,880
 First of all, just let me explain and clarify it.

79
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:59,410
 The donor of the AEDs is not me but Ms. Ma Ruifen, the CEO of Mingmei Media.

80
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,010
 So you should thank Ms. Ma if you want to.

81
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,485
 And here's the thing.

82
00:05:04,485 --> 00:05:08,557
 She gave me half a million yuan to do something for charity on behalf of her.

83
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:11,260
 Then I heard there was a shortage of first-aid devices in some communities.

84
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,828
 I gave Mingming a better life

85
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:17,242
 so that he can have the right to reject who doesn't suit him.

86
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:21,379
 Now you're the one who doesn't suit him.

87
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:23,220
 I got it.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,679
If I hadn't heard from Qiqi,

89
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:01,420
I wouldn't have known you'd mortgaged this house.

90
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,780
Mom,

91
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,320
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry.

92
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,299
I don't blame you.

93
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm glad.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,980
You did the right thing.

95
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:18,080
Without you,

96
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,060
I'm afraid our company would not have been able to get through a difficult situation.

97
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,600
Son, you've grown up.

98
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,719
I can let you go.

99
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:38,900
Mom, then can I make my own decisions about Dingding and me?

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,619
Let's go inside.

101
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,400
Hello.

102
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,571
Hello, I want to talk to Mingming's mom.

103
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:09,539
- Come in. 
 - Okay.

104
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,640
Over here.

105
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,519
Hello, Auntie.

106
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,128
Why are you here?

107
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:18,080
Mingming is out.

108
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,320
I know. I need to speak to you.

109
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,985
What's there for us to talk about?

110
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:29,259
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

111
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:32,490
I'm not up to anything.

112
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,914
I've got something good to show you.

113
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,859
Look.

114
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,980
I don't like comics.

115
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,100
I didn't ask you if you liked it.

116
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,379
Don't you see who she is?

117
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:51,739
No, I don't.

118
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,019
This is you 30 years ago.

119
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,171
Look closer.

120
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,671
This is where you worked. Are you familiar with it?

121
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,459
You rented a warehouse as an office when you first started your business.

122
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:07,590
Right?

123
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,828
I carried the camera alone back then.

124
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:15,800
This is when you went to the TV station to deliver tapes.

125
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,220
You used to use videotapes, right?

126
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,828
Yeah.

127
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,628
What... What do you mean by this?

128
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,920
I don't mean anything.

129
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,471
Mingming told me about your story of starting a business from scratch.

130
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,728
That was moving when I heard it.

131
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:36,500
I thought it was such a good story.

132
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,314
More people should know about it.

133
00:08:38,314 --> 00:08:42,280
So I did this based on your story.

134
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,660
You're trying to please me again.

135
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,780
Come on!

136
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,380
Auntie.

137
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,260
- Look at this. 
 - Enough. Stop it.

138
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,857
Go. I'm going to take my lunch break.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,485
I'll leave it here.

140
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:02,785
You can see it when you want. I'm leaving.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320

142
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,214
Wait.

143
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,090
You can come back after my lunch break.

144
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,114
Okay. See you, Auntie.

145
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,420
Yuan.

146
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,140
You're back.

147
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,785
Brother, why did Zhan Yan leave?

148
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,514
You already know?

149
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,185
 Luo Yuan, I'm sorry I couldn't say goodbye to you, face to face.

150
00:10:12,185 --> 00:10:14,214
 I'm going to work in a mountainous area

151
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:17,850
 for a year, or maybe longer.

152
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,385
 I know you have a lot of questions.

153
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,742
 I can't explain them all to you.

154
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:25,057
 What I want to say is, whatever happens to me and your brother,

155
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,240
 you're always my sister.

156
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,957
 What happened to you and Zhan Yan?

157
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,714
Just like Zhan Yan said.

158
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:37,540
There's no way to explain many things.

159
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,380
We all have our own positions and thoughts.

160
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,739
Yuan,

161
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:46,220
anyway, stop asking me about it.

162
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,614
Teammates,

163
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:26,671
sorry to interrupt.

164
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,510
There's something I've always wanted to tell you.

165
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:35,714
But I couldn't ever say it.

166
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,214
 Today, I chose this way to say it.

167
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,199
 I'll be more courageous.

168
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:50,742
 Light Chaser Rescue Team has been established for many years.

169
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:53,710
 You joined this big family

170
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,542
 with love for good causes

171
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,614
 and witnessed our development and growth.

172
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:06,860
 But you don't know the reason that I started this civilian rescue team

173
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,914
 is because my whole family

174
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:16,285
 was hit by a horribly destructive earthquake 25 years ago.

175
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,928
 When the earthquake hit,

176
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:23,242
 my daughter and I were lucky to escape.

177
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,457
 But my wife was buried under the rubble.

178
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,100
 There was another couple who was also trapped.

179
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:40,899
 They asked me for help.

180
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:43,442
 But all I could think about was my...

181
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,000
 my daughter's mom.

182
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,019
 So I saved my wife first.

183
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,720
 I didn't know rescue skills,

184
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,671
 which caused a secondary collapse.

185
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:06,042
 As a result, my wife and the couple died.

186
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,857
They had a chance to be saved.

187
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,828
I'm responsible for their deaths.

188
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,720
I've been called a hero for all these years.

189
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,779
I never had the courage to clarify this truth.

190
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,519
I set up this team to atone for my sins.

191
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:48,500
 I hope we can help and save more people in danger

192
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,170
 through professional rescue knowledge and skills.

193
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,557
 I know what I've done

194
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,900
 can never make up for the mistake I made.

195
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,300
 But it's better than doing nothing.

196
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,257
 This is the only consolation I have.

197
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,439
 But the team still has a long and far way to go.

198
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:19,939
 I should leave it to a better man.

199
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:24,050
 So today, I hereby announce

200
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,380
 I am resigning as the captain of the Light Chaser Rescue Team as of right now.

201
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,742
 Luo Ben will replace me.

202
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,260
 It's been so many years.

203
00:15:38,028 --> 00:15:40,810
 I've finally said it out.

204
00:15:41,642 --> 00:15:44,379
 If you can still accept me,

205
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,371
 I'll always be a member of the team.

206
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,457
 I'm a part of this big family.

207
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:24,142
♫  At first, words were disdainful reflections  ♫

208
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:31,685
♫  Until the loneliness after the uproar  ♫

209
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:39,314
♫  At first, people didn't have hometowns  ♫

210
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,620
♫  Until the road is too far into the distance  ♫

211
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:53,800
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

212
00:16:56,157 --> 00:17:02,550
♫  I want to lend you my shoulders when you are lonely  ♫

213
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:09,300
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

214
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:17,085
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

215
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:25,928
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

216
00:17:25,928 --> 00:17:32,014
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

217
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:40,885
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

218
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:48,771
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

219
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,700
 I volunteer to join Light Chaser Rescue Team,

220
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,428
 in a volunteering spirit of

221
00:18:29,428 --> 00:18:33,160
 devotion, friendship, progress, and mutual help.

222
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,628
 I'll train hard and industriously.

223
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:38,771
 In times of various crises,

224
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:42,728
 I'll do my best to save lives.

225
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:55,942
♫  I hope the wind can blow through the lane  ♫

226
00:18:55,942 --> 00:19:02,057
♫  And rest in your arms  ♫

227
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:11,085
♫  The one who loves you and you love 
 will always be with you  ♫

228
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:18,620
♫  It's a stable place for you when turning back  ♫

229
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,214
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

230
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:26,210
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

231
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,650
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

232
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,357
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

233
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,160
Uncle Luodan, your blood sugar and blood pressure are a bit high.

234
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,128
You have to keep taking this medicine.

235
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,228
I'll give you some medicine first.

236
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,350
Drugs are toxic.

237
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,057
I can't take them every day.

238
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,671
Long-term high blood pressure will impair

239
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:29,310
the heart and the kidneys.

240
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,771
So, you must take this medicine.

241
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,120
Do you like it?

242
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,720
Take it.

243
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,120
Little Tashi, you must study hard in the future and attend school.

244
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,199
Thank you, Doctor.

245
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,240
Come on, you kid.

246
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,820
It's okay.

247
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,039
They're all small gifts for the kids.

248
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,400
Make sure you keep taking your medication.

249
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,271
Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

250
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,514
Let's go.

251
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,590
What's this, An?

252
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,385
The masks I had my family send to me.

253
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:37,700
I can't buy them here.

254
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,971
This place is not like Linjiang.

255
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,571
You signed up to support this place with me.

256
00:21:49,571 --> 00:21:52,214
- You're regretting it? 
 - How would I?

257
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,928
I'm here to study and train with you.

258
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:56,357
People in our department all envy me.

259
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:59,970
Xu Zirui said he'd sign up for the next session.

260
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,585
He just got married.

261
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,071
Is he willing to support this place?

262
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,657
Lu supports him.

263
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,585
The students you've trained are all good.

264
00:22:07,585 --> 00:22:12,110
By the way, I thought you said a new colleague would come to help us.

265
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,771
He should be here in a couple of days.

266
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,371

267
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,371
Bye.

268
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,342
- Let me see. 
 - It hurts.

269
00:22:52,857 --> 00:22:54,814
Hold on.

270
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:58,159
It hurts.

271
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,442
- It's okay. 
 - What are you doing?

272
00:23:04,442 --> 00:23:06,171
He dislocated his arm. I'm fixing it.

273
00:23:06,228 --> 00:23:08,240
I saw my son crying.

274
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,520
I won't let you go until you make it clear.

275
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,720
I was just fixing him.

276
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,770
But I saw...

277
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,371
I just saw my son crying.

278
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:20,328
- Which hand is hurt? 
 - This one.

279
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:22,585
Ask him if you don't believe me. I'm the doctor here.

280
00:23:22,585 --> 00:23:24,080
- Can you move it? 
 - Look at my clothes.

281
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,428
I'm not here to hurt Zhuo.

282
00:23:25,428 --> 00:23:27,420
- Does it hurt? 
 - No.

283
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,340
Dad, it's not hurting.

284
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,960
It doesn't hurt?

285
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,160
That's right.

286
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,742
This doctor wasn't lying to you.

287
00:23:34,742 --> 00:23:37,250
She did relocate your son's joint.

288
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,620
Is that so?

289
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,720
Cai Yuxiao.

290
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,471
It's been a while.

291
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,157
I'm really sorry.

292
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,000
There was just a slight misunderstanding.

293
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm sorry.

294
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,028
This is my phone number.

295
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:55,871
Feel free to call me if your son is uncomfortable.

296
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:58,720
Thank you. Thank you.

297
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,257
Let's go, kid. Get up.

298
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,500
Thank you so much!

299
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,700
Dr. Zhan, I'm here to report for duty.

300
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,210
Don't you want me here?

301
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,730
How's that possible?

302
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,820
I just didn't expect the new colleague to be you.

303
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,350
I'll take you to the dormitory.

304
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,771
Okay.

305
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,580
You must be tired from the trip.

306
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,630
I've got some hot water for you.

307
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,085
Thank you.

308
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:36,980
You've changed a lot.

309
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,660
I hardly recognized you.

310
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,739
Really?

311
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:44,240
Sometimes I look at myself in the mirror,

312
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,740
I find that I've changed a lot.

313
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,942
Here, drink some water.

314
00:24:48,942 --> 00:24:50,585
Okay.

315
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:52,530
Thank you.

316
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,371
You're hurt?

317
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,328
I got a minor injury when I worked as a Doctor Without Borders in the war zone.

318
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,900
You were so badly wounded.

319
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,457
What kind of mission was it?

320
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,350
The place was in a war.

321
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,085
Suddenly a shell exploded right next to us.

322
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,114
I didn't expect you to go to such a dangerous place.

323
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,771
Let's talk about you.

324
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:28,214
Why did you come here?

325
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,985
You know,

326
00:25:30,985 --> 00:25:34,100
I've always wanted to support remote areas.

327
00:25:35,357 --> 00:25:38,230
But the conditions here are not like that of Linjiang.

328
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,600
Just let me know if you need anything.

329
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,450
I'll get it to you if I have it.

330
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,799
No need.

331
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,739
It's already good.

332
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,342
Okay, go clean up.

333
00:25:49,342 --> 00:25:51,340
Get some rest.

334
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,620
I'll talk to you about what you need to do tomorrow.

335
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,100
Okay.

336
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:27,019
 Dad, why did you answer my call so quickly?

337
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,600
I thought it was time for you to call.

338
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,760
Good for you. What if I work late next time?

339
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,185
 I've left the team's business to Luo Ben.

340
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,585
 I'm not busy now. I have time to wait for you.

341
00:26:40,585 --> 00:26:42,771
I just think about you.

342
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:44,628
You're out there by yourself.

343
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:46,328
 Take care of yourself.

344
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:49,210
Don't worry, I'm fine here.

345
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:52,070
I work at sunrise and rest at sunset.

346
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,785
I keep a regular schedule. And I have a healthy diet.

347
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,257
I'm really here to preserve my health.

348
00:26:57,257 --> 00:27:00,730
 But I worry if you took your medicine.

349
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,670
 Including the habit of drinking tea at night.

350
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,590
 Did you get rid of it?

351
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,600
 You can't drink tea at night anymore.

352
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,342
 It'll burden the heart and kidneys.

353
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:13,414
 And it's very bad for your stomach.

354
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:17,371
 Do you hear that? And you can't drink alcohol.

355
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:20,620
I quit drinking. The tea is for the day.

356
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,660
Don't worry. I quit drinking.

357
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,728
That's good.

358
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:29,499
Guess who I met today.

359
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:31,679
Is it someone I know?

360
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,014
Cai Yuxiao.

361
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,720
Cai?

362
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,028
 So he went to support there?

363
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,760
Yeah.

364
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,939
I didn't expect to see him here.

365
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:45,780
But he's changed a lot.

366
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,259
I hardly recognized him.

367
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:49,599
Give my best regards to him.

368
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,659
 Yan, Luo Ben asked about you today.

369
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:56,180
 I know cellphone reception there is bad.

370
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,400
Maybe you should take some time to talk to him.

371
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,800
 He's very concerned about you.

372
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,279
Dad, Cai Yuxiao just arrived here.

373
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,542
I'll show him around later.

374
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:09,890
I've got to go.

375
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,060
The Light Chaser Rescue Team has been growing so fast lately.

376
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,210
We've participated in one rescue operation after another.

377
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,885
We successfully completed the tasks that leaders and the public gave to us.

378
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:29,000
I've counted it.

379
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:34,590
As of today, the Light Chaser Rescue Teams in the whole country this year

380
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,357
have been a part of more than 6,000 rescues.

381
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,659
This is Mr. Robert, an international rescue expert.

382
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,657
From today, Mr. Robert will guide us in training.

383
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:54,699
From getting visas, exit formalities, to standardizing technical movements

384
00:29:54,699 --> 00:29:57,257
and rescue process, etc.

385
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,580
In short, everything is fine and detailed,

386
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,414
and everything is carried out in accordance with international rescue standards.

387
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,779
You are just leaving?

388
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:04,180
Why not think it over?

389
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,499
I'd like you to stay.

390
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,879
Thank you so much. I've made up my mind.

391
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,185
Is Luo Ben so important?

392
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:17,400
Even if you can't be together, you can still be good colleagues.

393
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,400
That's not necessary.

394
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,580
It was my plan to study in England.

395
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,939
Now it's time.

396
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:24,250
Old Gao,

397
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,720
maybe Ariel will meet a man better than Luo Ben in the UK.

398
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,740
Don't worry about her.

399
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,290
I'm leaving, then.

400
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,757
Take care.

401
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,339
 Have a safe trip.

402
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,650
Take one. And you.

403
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,114
Come on. Come on. Here.

404
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:20,985
Who wants it?

405
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,842
Count how many I have in my hand.

406
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:27,657
How many are there?

407
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,171
Thank you.

408
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:31,960
Uncle.

409
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,019
Pass these out.

410
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,200
 Here.

411
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,228
Why are you here?

412
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:44,128
I didn't expect you to be the kids' friend so soon.

413
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,728
This is my experience.

414
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:48,457
Whenever I go somewhere new,

415
00:32:48,457 --> 00:32:51,000
I'll keep a good relationship with the local kids.

416
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,714
So I can start the work easily.

417
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,328
I feel you're different but also the same.

418
00:33:04,328 --> 00:33:08,985
You're still Cai Yuxiao who thinks everything through.

419
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:13,030
I think you've changed a lot.

420
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,870
Have I?

421
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,442
Now you think about others.

422
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,240
I was too cold and selfish before.

423
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,420
I never thought of others.

424
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,000
No, it was my fault.

425
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,980
I was selfish.

426
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,971
I did a lot of wrong things to you.

427
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:42,490
I should apologize to you.

428
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,385
It's over.

429
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,328
What about your parents?

430
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,070
After we left Linjiang,

431
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,000
I took them back to their hometown.

432
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,060
Not long after that, my mother passed away.

433
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,742
I took care of my family's stuff

434
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:06,214
and arranged for my father to settle down,

435
00:34:06,214 --> 00:34:08,128
then I went out.

436
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,885
Why did you join Doctors Without Borders?

437
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,114
After I left my hometown,

438
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:20,319
I traveled around aimlessly.

439
00:34:20,319 --> 00:34:23,585
I went to some places with poor medical conditions

440
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:26,980
where I participated in the international volunteer medical service.

441
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,760
I worked and helped the locals in need with them.

442
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:35,079
Later,

443
00:34:36,371 --> 00:34:40,971
I found I lived a full life there.

444
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:44,850
I felt I was quite worthy.

445
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,742
So, I applied to join this organization.

446
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,385
What about you?

447
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:53,528
Why did you come here?

448
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,400
I broke up with him.

449
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,600
Our company has gotten through the difficulties.

450
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,828
The new project is starting up again.

451
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,714
You're busy in the company all day.

452
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:34,200
Your dad won't be back home until the end of the year.

453
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,328
It's hard to have a meal with you two.

454
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:42,057
Mom, since you've said that, I'll send your instructions to my dad.

455
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,371
I'll ask him to come back soon.

456
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,271
I won't have a meeting tomorrow.

457
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,571
I'll spend some time with you.

458
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,057
Do you want to go shopping?

459
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:51,020
Or play cards?

460
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,799
Not tomorrow.

461
00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:55,180
Maybe another time.

462
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,580
Come on.

463
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,857
Now you don't care what's going on outside.

464
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:01,200
You left the company to me.

465
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,114
You've been preserving your health at home.

466
00:36:03,114 --> 00:36:06,142
What's so important that you can't put it off?

467
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,585
I've got a date with Ding Dingding.

468
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,880
- Dingding? 
 - Yeah, Dingding.

469
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,910
Your girlfriend.

470
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,928
She's going to the school to sign books for the kids tomorrow.

471
00:36:21,928 --> 00:36:23,760
She asked me to go with her.

472
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,659
I agreed.

473
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,210
My girlfriend?

474
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,657
Mom, do you mean Dingding?

475
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,659
Do you have other girlfriends?

476
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,585
Mom, eat... eat more.

477
00:36:42,585 --> 00:36:43,785
Here, eat more.

478
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,050
You eat. Don't care...

479
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,240
All right. Enough.

480
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,700
Mom, uh, I'm full.

481
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,400
I'm going out.

482
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,142
You haven't eaten any.

483
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,019
 Dingding!

484
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:16,400
 - Dingding!  
 - I'm coming.

485
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:19,828
My mom is allowing me to be with you, Dingding.

486
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:22,600
You're strangling me!

487
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,314
Dingding, my mom admits that you're my girlfriend.

488
00:37:25,314 --> 00:37:26,342
Really?

489
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:28,971
I'm so happy, Dingding.

490
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,360
Put me down.

491
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,239
What's up? What's so exciting?

492
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:37,942
My mom allowed me to be with Dingding.

493
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:39,828
We can get the license properly.

494
00:37:39,828 --> 00:37:42,942
Luo Ben, come to our wedding by then.

495
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,480
Congratulations!

496
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,785
Why does he look unhappy?

497
00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:51,785
Come on. He broke up.

498
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:53,560
But you send a wedding invitation to him.

499
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:56,720
I'm sorry. I was so excited that I forgot about it.

500
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,071
But don't worry about it. The captain put it all out there.

501
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:01,540
Once it works itself out, the right people will be together sooner or later.

502
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,040
Just like us.

503
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,980
It's not easy for him and Yan.

504
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,242
Yan went to such a faraway place not long after they were together.

505
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:08,779
It's hard to see her.

506
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:12,440
If it were you, I would go to you wherever you are.

507
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,479
Really?

508
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,260
Of course, it's true.

509
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,990

510
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,519
It's nice.

511
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,260
I'll do it with you later.

512
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,060
Your leg has recovered well.

513
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,059
I think your training performance is almost as good as before.

514
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,939
I was doing training when you were at work.

515
00:39:31,939 --> 00:39:33,780
Good for you.

516
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:39,099
Did Guoguo make this bracelet for you?

517
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,819
Yeah.

518
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:43,060
She doesn't let me take it off.

519
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,428
I told her that I was going to work and performing tasks.

520
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:48,157
It's easy to lose it. I asked her if I could wear it at home.

521
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:50,285
She said no. She was angry with me.

522
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:52,514
She asked me to take a picture to send to her every two hours.

523
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:54,214
To prove that I'm always wearing it.

524
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:56,171
Look, kids now are...

525
00:39:56,171 --> 00:39:58,180
She's so cute.

526
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:03,842
You don't know I've never envied you anything before I met Guoguo.

527
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:07,228
Until she became a flower girl in Luo Yuan's wedding.

528
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:10,039
I instantly became her fan.

529
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:13,319
If I had such a lovely daughter like you,

530
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,600
I'd be at home with her every weekend.

531
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,028
I wouldn't come to train.

532
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:19,885
If you like a daughter, you and Zhan Yan should have a baby now.

533
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:22,885
No one else is as close as your kid.

534
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,080
Look at you.

535
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,410
It's been so long.

536
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,357
You guys haven't made up yet.

537
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,820
I don't know how to take this leap.

538
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,240
Is it that hard?

539
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,020
You just fly over there.

540
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,257
Tell her that you miss her.

541
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:43,940
Just show up before her.

542
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,579
Give her a surprise and that's it.

543
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,100
I'm telling you. No problems can't be solved as long as you guys meet.

544
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,300
It's not that complicated.

545
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,571
I'll be honest with you.

546
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,671
I fantasized about countless possibilities.

547
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:03,920
But every one of them failed at the very first step.

548
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,090
Then it's even easier.

549
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:08,328
Isn't it just about booking a ticket on an App?

550
00:41:08,328 --> 00:41:10,857
You can't do it? Let me help you.

551
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,442
Look, my daughter is checking in on me again.

552
00:41:13,442 --> 00:41:16,760
She asked me to take a photo. Wait.

553
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,500
Guoguo.

554
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:02,180
- Where is the emergency center? 
 - Over there.

555
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:19,819
Guoguo,

556
00:42:19,819 --> 00:42:24,590
do you know uncles and aunts of the rescue team all miss you?

557
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,657
When you get well, ask your dad to take you to the rescue team. Okay?

558
00:42:28,657 --> 00:42:30,660
Okay.

559
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,499
So good.

560
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,985
I saw the bracelet you made for your dad today.

561
00:42:37,985 --> 00:42:39,400
It's very nice.

562
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,342
Make one for me in the future. Okay?

563
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:43,928
Okay.

564
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,059
I'm sure you'll be fine soon.

565
00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:01,980

566
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,950
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

567
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,900
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

568
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:26,870
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

569
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:34,350
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

570
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:41,920
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

571
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:50,250
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

572
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:56,920
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

573
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:04,720
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

574
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:13,550
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

575
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:19,800
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

576
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:28,600
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

577
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:36,200
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

578
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,020
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

579
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,750
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

580
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,400
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

581
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,170
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

582
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,900
♫  I can't fly  ♫

583
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,770
♫  But I can look up  ♫

584
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:05,900
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
