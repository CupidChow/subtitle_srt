Tingting!

17

Tingting!

18
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,200
Prepare for rappel.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,810
Yes.

20
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,050
Tingting!

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,130
Report from Luo Ben,

22
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,000
suspected target found at
the foot of the mountain.

23
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,170
It wears the same clothes as Tingting's.

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,250
Keep the situation under control.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,840
No more accidents.

26
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Identify the target as soon as possible.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,810
Copy that.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,720
It’s not her.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
A traveler was reported missing

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,090
to the office last month.

31
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,040
Yes, this is the guy.

32
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,490
We tried to find him on the hill

33
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,410
for more than ten days.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Luo Ben reporting.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,040
The body found under the hill

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,410
is a missing traveler,

37
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,760
a male adult,

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,650
not our target.

39
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,160
I repeat, not our target.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,320
Thank God.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,840
Look.

42
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,440
What did I say to you?

43
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,560
It’s not Tingting.

44
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,040
She’s alive.

45
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,650
She’s still alive.

46
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,600
There’s still hope.

47
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:18,720
Sir,

48
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,840
I promise we’ll get them back

49
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,410
safe and sound

50
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,530
as long as they are still alive.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,720
Thanks.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,600
Thank you.

53
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,000
Sit down.

54
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,600
Thank God.

55
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,760
Thank God.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,690
Don’t worry.

57
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,560
The rescue team will

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,440
keep searching

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,530
until the last minute.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,560
Thanks.

61
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,280
OK. Move.

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,160
Take it easy.

63
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:43,040
Come on.

64
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,370
Loosen it up.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,760
Come on.

66
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,840
Come on.

67
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,970
Captain.

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,880
Luo Ben reported.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,090
It wasn’t our target under the hill.

70
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,090
Not her?

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,000
OK. I got it.

72
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,810
Tell them to cope with the police

73
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,320
and continue the search.

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,410
Yes, sir.

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,930
Officer Chen,

76
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,560
it’s getting dark,

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,490
and it’s raining heavily.

78
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,400
How about

79
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,640
we go back to get some rest?

80
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,520
When the rain stops,

81
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,930
we’ll resume the search.

82
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,760
OK.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,290
Alright.

84
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:31,730
No.

85
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,760
You mustn’t go.

86
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,560
Once you’re gone,

87
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,690
who will find my kids?

88
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,080
The nation pays you,

89
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,640
yet you avoid your responsibility.

90
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,170
Do you deserve your payment?

91
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,200
We are not paid.

92
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,170
I don’t care.

93
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
No one leaves

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,000
without finding my kids.

95
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,170
Go find them. Go find them!

96
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,760
Sir,

97
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,400
don’t get anxious.

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,290
Calm down, please.

99
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,200
The terrain is complex,

100
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,520
and the rain is heavy,

101
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,520
also, it’s getting dark,

102
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
it’s important

103
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
that we make sure
our team members’ safety.

104
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,810
But what about my children

105
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,130
once you’re gone?

106
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:06,880
Please!

107
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,400
Save my children!

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,640
Please!

109
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,730
I’m begging you!

110
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,760
Ma’am,

111
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,370
the rain is heavy,

112
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,050
and the terrain is precarious.

113
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,730
Give them more time.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,050
They never

115
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,730
let Granny worried

116
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,130
before.

117
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,930
I don’t believe they’d

118
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,290
run away to have fun.

119
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,170
Right.

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,560
But Tingting kept saying

121
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,170
that her body and her teeth were painful,

122
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,880
and she felt feeble.

123
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,850
I thought

124
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,400
it was only because she’s growing.

125
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,370
Could anything bad happen?

126
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,170
Zhan Yan calling for Group 1.

127
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,080
Please answer.

128
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,290
This is Luo Ben from Group 1.

129
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,610
Dr. Zhan, speak.

130
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,490
Tingting has been feeling pain
in many parts of her body lately.

131
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,520
I suspect

132
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,200
that she’s in poor health.

133
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,520
She has to be found as quickly as possible

134
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,850
for further examination.

135
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,810
Copy that.

136
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:17,730
Officer Chen,

137
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,400
please calm

138
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,610
Tingting’s dad down.

139
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,640
I’ll keep searching.

140
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,730
OK.

141
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,880
Are you crazy?

142
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,080
Captain said so many times

143
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
that we must keep ourselves alive

144
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
before saving others.

145
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,000
That’s why I’ll keep searching
on my own.

146
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,170
Dapeng,

147
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,130
you take everybody back
to get some rest.

148
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,050
When the rain stops,

149
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:38,880
you can come back out.

150
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,850
You think I’m a coward?

151
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,490
Luo Ben,

152
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,320
we’ll go with you.

153
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,880
We’ll go with you.

154
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,520
Me, too.

155
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,000
More people, more chances
to find them.

156
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,000
I understand how you feel,

157
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,520
but Captain Qingshan

158
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,200
ordered me to be in charge out here.

159
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,560
I must make sure

160
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,250
everybody’s safety.

161
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,690
I can’t put you in danger.

162
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
You worry about us?

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,370
Well, we also worry about you.

164
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,000
If you go missing,

165
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,930
we’ll have to search for you, too.

166
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,930
How about this?

167
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:09,880
Three people in a group.

168
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
We’ll look after each other.

169
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,290
Keep a short distance

170
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,320
between each group.

171
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,370
We’ll report our locations

172
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,250
every ten minutes.

173
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,320
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes, sir.

174
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,220
(Light Chaser Rescue
Must be safe)

175
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,690
What’s up?

176
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,130
Nothing.

177
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,130
How was school?

178
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,640
Did the kids cause trouble for you?

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,560
They were pretty naughty.

180
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Tingting!

181
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,370
Tingting!

182
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,610
Tingting!

183
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,850
Tingting!

184
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,640
Tingting!

185
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,850
Tingting!

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
Tingting!

187
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,520
Tingting!

188
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,370
Are you okay?

189
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,960
Are you okay?

190
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,640
I’m okay.

191
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,640
Listen.

192
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,730
After this slope,

193
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,970
we’ll take a break.

194
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,040
Yes.

195
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,000
Go.

196
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,280
You go up first.

197
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,680
Easy.

198
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:11,370
Have some water.

199
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,000
I’m good.

200
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,570
That’s enough. Enough.

201
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,160
Enough.

202
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,280
I’ll need some, too.

203
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,730
Good.

204
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,640
What are you doing?

205
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,760
There's no hot water in the wilderness.

206
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,800
It’s only enough for one.

207
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,370
This is called circulation.

208
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Can the noodles be cooked thoroughly?

209
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,570
We’re happy enough
to have something warm to eat.

210
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,090
When we were on a rescue mission

211
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,400
inside the mountain,

212
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,040
for five days and nights,

213
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,800
all we had were compressed biscuits

214
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,490
and cold water.

215
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,040
I’m sorry.

216
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,730
No, don’t be.

217
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,400
Any father

218
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,730
would be worried,

219
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,090
and we understand that.

220
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,450
I don’t deserve to be their father.

221
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,000
I was always away from home.

222
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,640
Tingting knew
I have gastrointestinal problems,

223
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,640
and several days

224
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:40,610
before we came back,

225
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,040
she went out to pick
wild hawthorn berries for me.

226
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,610
But we got held up on the way.

227
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,280
The hawthorn berries rotted,

228
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,090
and she and her brother didn’t have any.

229
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,160
Wild hawthorn berries?

230
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,850
You mean,

231
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,130
Tingting wanted to pick
wild hawthorn berries for you?

232
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,610
Where are the wild hawthorn berries?

233
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,160
In the north.

234
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,210
Over there.

235
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,090
All groups, attention.

236
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,250
Destination, the north of the hill.

237
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,330
Set out now.

238
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,450
Group 1, copy.

239
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,570
Group 2, copy.

240
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,680
Group 3, copy.

241
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Tingting.

242
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,000
Pengpeng.

243
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,040
Pengpeng.

244
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,920
Tingting.

245
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,880
Pengpeng.

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,400
Tingting.

247
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,330
Pengpeng.

248
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,760
Tingting.

249
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,330
Manmade coverage.

250
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,850
Target spotted.

251
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,210
Pengpeng is spotted.

252
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,160
We have found Pengpeng.

253
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,520
He’s found. He’s found.

254
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,040
Pengpeng.

255
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,490
Pengpeng, can you hear me?

256
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,490
Pengpeng.

257
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,400
How is Pengpeng doing?

258
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,920
He looks good.

259
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,970
A slight fever.

260
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,640
Come on.

261
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,880
Careful, careful.

262
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,490
It's alright.

263
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:11,850
Pengpeng.

264
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,610
Easy.

265
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
Dad.

266
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,800
Pengpeng.

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,040
Why did you come here?

268
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,000
Where’s your sister?

269
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,000
She’s gone for food.

270
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,160
Officer Chen,

271
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,490
it’s dangerous on the hill.

272
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,280
Please take Pengpeng

273
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,210
down the hill first.

274
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,000
Sure.

275
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:28,920
You stay safe.

276
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,520
- Daddy’s here.
- OK.

277
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:29,920
OK.

278
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Let’s go down the hill.

279
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:42,880
Luo Ben.

280
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,370
We found something.

281
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,250
We suspect

282
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,400
it’s our target’s shoe.

283
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,090
We’re surrounded by slopes,

284
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,730
but I don’t see

285
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,970
clear signs of sliding.

286
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,280
It’s too misty on the hill.

287
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,490
And it’s covered with trees.

288
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,370
Copy.

289
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,130
Dapeng, let’s go.

290
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,400
- Tingting!
- Tingting!

291
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,250
- Tingting!
- Tingting!

292
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:15,970
Tingting!

293
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,570
Tingting!

294
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,970
Tingting!

295
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,370
Dapeng,

296
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,040
look over there.

297
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:32,800
Tingting!

298
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,370
Tingting!

299
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,610
She is really here.

300
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,640
All groups, attention.

301
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,850
Target spotted.

302
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,730
Target is in a coma.

303
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,020
Multiple flesh wounds.

304
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,700
(Emergency)

305
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:22,730
Zhan Yan.

306
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,130
Zhan Yan.

307
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,250
Keep it down.

308
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,730
We’ve got the little girl’s result.

309
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,400
She has acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

310
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,330
Tingting, have some fruits.

311
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,610
Does it taste good?

312
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,570
Easy.

313
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,000
Easy.

314
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,130
OK.

315
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,490
Tingting.

316
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,610
Dr. Zhan, hi.

317
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,040
Thank you.

318
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,610
Miss Zhan, Mr. Luo.

319
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,570
Hello.

320
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,680
How do you feel?

321
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,640
Feeling better?

322
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,090
Don’t worry.

323
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,800
You’ll soon be out of the hospital.

324
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,210
Thank you, doctor.

325
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,490
I’m not worried.

326
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,040
I’m sick,

327
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,210
but I’m quite happy.

328
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,730
Because Mum and Dad

329
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,520
can keep me company.

330
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,850
Tingting,

331
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,490
I won’t leave our house anymore.

332
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,160
Really?

333
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,680
Yes.

334
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,370
I’ll keep my word.

335
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,280
It must have been

336
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,920
very difficult for parents

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,680
to choose to leave their child behind.

338
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,040
I guess

339
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,760
they had no choice at the time.

340
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,280
Even though they choose to stay,

341
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,210
there will be a lot of difficulties

342
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:50,400
for them to overcome.

343
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,040
But I still hope

344
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,850
they can stick together as a family.

345
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,880
When I was little,

346
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,640
I pretended to be sick
so that my parents

347
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,040
could spend more time with me.

348
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,450
Go visit him.

349
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,640
It’s my baby girl’s

350
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,680
favorite vegetable rice.

351
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
Now, now. I’ll take it away for you.

352
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,040
Now. Easy.

353
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,090
You look much better now.

354
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,130
Yan,

355
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,610
I want to talk to you about something.

356
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,400
I don’t want to hear it.

357
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,370
I know

358
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,730
that you’ll go on another mission.

359
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,210
I haven’t even started yet.

360
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,250
Yes,

361
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,920
I have to see to my job

362
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,800
personally.

363
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,000
Only I can do it.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,680
No.

365
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm still having a fever.

366
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,400
Don't you care about me, Dad?

367
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,640
I took your temperature.

368
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,280
You don’t have a fever anymore.

369
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,920
I still have it.

370
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
I still feel terrible.

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The fever came back.

372
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,370
I’m still having a fever!

373
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,640
I said I don’t want it!

374
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,810
23.

375
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,330
24.

376
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,850
Ding Dingding. Ding Dingding.

377
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,400
Ma’am.

378
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,090
25.

379
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,850
Ding Dingding.

380
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,130
You caught a cold?

381
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,810
A cold?

382
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,400
You ruined my face.

383
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Oh, my.

384
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,920
What’s the matter with your lips?

385
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,680
Let me see.

386
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
What’s wrong with your lips?

387
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,240
Your lips…

388
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
It seems awful.

389
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,770
The lipstick you gave me,

390
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,850
it’s a fake.

391
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,290
No manufacturer info.

392
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,240
No date of manufacture.

393
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,160
No license.

394
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,920
Nothing.

395
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,240
It’s an illegal product.

396
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,810
Ding Dingding.

397
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
How come?

398
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,370
Ding Dingding.

399
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:28,010
Right.

400
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,570
You got me in trouble.

401
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,090
My girlfriend used your lipstick,

402
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,640
and now her lips are swollen.

403
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:34,720
She asks to break up with me.

404
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,440
You…

405
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,400
You, too…

406
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,440
The lipstick…

407
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,530
Fortunately, I didn’t use it.

408
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,610
Is it that bad?

409
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,130
What’s going on?

410
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,610
Luckily, I didn’t use it.

411
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,610
Where did you

412
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,810
- get these shoddy lipsticks?
- Yeah.

413
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,330
You are

414
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,160
ruining the image

415
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,530
of our department.

416
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,880
Leave me alone.

417
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,090
I’m busy.

418
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,290
What are you looking for?

419
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,090
Cardboard of a package.

420
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,370
The janitor must have collected it.

421
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,440
I don’t care about

422
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,400
my employee’s eccentric hobby,

423
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,640
but you haven’t turned
in your new chapters of this week,

424
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,440
and here you are,
rummaging through the trash.

425
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,160
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

426
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,130
My last week’s numbers are great.

427
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,050
Can’t I have several days off?

428
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,610
Don’t get cocky

429
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,330
because of a small triumph.

430
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,090
The market is cruel.

431
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,010
What’s more,

432
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,570
your work

433
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,610
hasn’t been honed to perfection,

434
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,240
you know that?

435
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,480
There have been

436
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,530
more and more criticisms lately.

437
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,130
Controversy creates more attention.

438
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,770
That’s a good thing.

439
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,720
Nonsense.

440
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,880
Some of the negative reviews

441
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,720
have influences on the new followers.

442
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,290
Is that supposed to be good?

443
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,240
What did they say?

444
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,720
They said…

445
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,200
Let me see.

446
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,200
They said

447
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,090
"What is this?

448
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,680
A waste of my time. I quit.

449
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,090
I don’t believe

450
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:00,850
it’s the work of

451
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:01,640
someone who used

452
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,330
to create garbage.

453
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,050
She must have a ghostwriter.

454
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,680
This is so unreal.

455
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,530
How dare she claims

456
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,090
'Based on true stories…’"

457
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,480
Alright, alright. Enough.

458
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,640
This is too dumb to influence
the new followers.

459
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,400
If it does,

460
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,440
it means they should have
never been my followers.

461
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,640
But this person

462
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,010
gives your bad reviews
using different accounts.

463
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,010
Light Chaser

464
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,330
will be ruled out
of the ranking list soon.

465
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,240
Do you have any idea

466
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,370
how important staying on the list
is for gaining popularity?

467
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,530
How do you know
they are the same person?

468
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,440
Because

469
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:20,770
it’s the same IP.

470
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,240
I checked.

471
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,530
Found it. Look.

472
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,530
Do you remember

473
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,850
someone who claimed to be my fan

474
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,610
emailed me a box of lipsticks
the other day?

475
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,290
Everyone who used it

476
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,570
had an inflammation.

477
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,720
Could it be this guy?

478
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,770
Very likely.

479
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,880
I have a case to crack.

480
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,370
I’ll get the new chapters

481
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,480
done later.

482
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,290
Wait a minute.

483
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,920
Are you making an excuse

484
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,880
only to slack off?

485
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,640
You go ask around the rescue team.

486
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,680
Everybody’s wife or girlfriend

487
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,530
is after me now.

488
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:54,640
Even if you find him,

489
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
there’s no evidence
for the police to arrest him.

490
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,400
What’s the point?

491
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,370
I want him to know

492
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,810
that he won’t get

493
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,770
away with

494
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,720
hurting others online.

495
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,880
He plays dirty behind the screen,

496
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,680
well,

497
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,920
I’ll hit him hard

498
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,160
in real life.

499
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,530
I tell you what,

500
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,090
people like him

501
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,610
are scared of exposure.

502
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,920
Who are we?

503
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,130
The light chasers.

504
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,850
I’ll throw him in the spotlight.

505
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,130
I’ll come with you.

506
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,610
I think you’re a fool.

507
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,200
Why would anyone use a real address

508
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,160
to send you that?

509
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,090
Why would anyone

510
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,960
email a package from a village?

511
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,050
Who’s the fool here?

512
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,090
You didn’t put on this show,

513
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,530
did you?

514
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,010
Alright, you can leave, bye.

515
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,880
Xuan?

516
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,570
Xuan, why are you running away?

517
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,810
Xuan!

518
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,880
Xuan! Stop!

519
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,050
Slow down, Xuan!

520
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,440
Xuan!

521
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,290
Xuan!

522
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,720
Did you mail me the lipsticks?

523
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,370
Yes.

524
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,370
You wrote the bad reviews?

525
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:58,440
So what if it was me?

526
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,570
But why?

527
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,400
We aren’t enemies.

528
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,370
I simply hate you.

529
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,240
I thought we were friends.

530
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,240
Yes,

531
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,050
when we asked Ma Baoming

532
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,240
for justice,

533
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,370
we were friends,

534
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
but now, I don’t think

535
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,330
you deserve

536
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,680
what you have right now.

537
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,160
Just say you’re jealous.

538
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,570
You pretended to be a follower,
sent her low-quality lipsticks,

539
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,640
and gave her bad reviews online.

540
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
So sinister.

541
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:39,680
Are you so

542
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,610
envious of others?

543
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
She and I started off the same.

544
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,770
I went through as many difficulties
as she did.

545
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,640
Why is she

546
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,370
so lucky

547
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,090
to obtain something

548
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,290
that I can never get?

549
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,440
When she put on the
jumping-off-the-building show,

550
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
she claimed to fight

551
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,010
for everybody’s benefit,

552
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,610
but in the end,

553
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,010
she got the highest amount
of compensation.

554
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,720
Xuan, listen to me.

555
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,960
That’s because Luo Ben…

556
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,880
Keep talking.

557
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,570
You can’t say a word, right?

558
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,770
I don’t know how to explain to you.

559
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,720
I’d like to hear your explanation.

560
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,130
There are many factors

561
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,440
in one’s fortune,

562
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,050
and it’s the viewers’ collective opinion

563
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,200
that determines the reputation
of her work,

564
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,810
not just yours.

565
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,960
If you don’t like it,

566
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,850
just close it.

567
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,160
Out of sight, out of mind, no?

568
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,400
This is unnecessary.

569
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,880
Who the heck are you?

570
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,480
It’s none of your business.

571
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,160
I’m her boss.

572
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,570
I’m the reason

573
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:39,530
why she’s lucky.

574
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
I tell you what,

575
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,880
not only am I going

576
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,720
to promote her as a major illustrator,

577
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,440
I’m also going to make her famous
across the nation.

578
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,370
By then,

579
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,290
even closing the page
of her work won’t help,

580
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,480
because everybody will be

581
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,720
talking about her comic

582
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
and looking up to her success.

583
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,160
Can you tell me
what’s so good about her?

584
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,610
You don’t get

585
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:57,050
to judge her.

586
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,400
Dingding,

587
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,480
let’s go.

588
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,200
Hello, Light Chaser Rescue.

589
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,880
This is the fire brigade,

590
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:39,290
someone fell into the water
in Linjiang river,

591
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
we need you to help

592
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,160
with the rescue at A1 water area.

593
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,240
Roger that.

594
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:08,720
Wukong,

595
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,570
it seems

596
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,290
our water rescue gear

597
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,130
is a bit outdated.

598
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,530
Human salvage and search

599
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,720
are so inefficient.

600
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,440
You know what?

601
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,810
This salvage set

602
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,570
was developed by our captain

603
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,850
based on his past experience.

604
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,400
It may look outdated,

605
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,010
but through generations,

606
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:23,850
it salvaged

607
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,090
dozens of bodies.

608
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,010
Attention, everyone!

609
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,130
Target area arrived!

610
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,400
Search carefully!

611
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,200
Copy.

612
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,810
- Be safe!
- Be careful.

613
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:44,640
Wukong,

614
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:45,960
9 o’clock.

615
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,440
We head 9 o’clock.

616
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,200
Copy.

617
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,370
What is that?

618
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,050
Target spotted.

619
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,480
He looks pretty bad.

620
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,010
Like he’s pregnant.

621
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,090
You weren’t any better than him

622
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,960
at your first water rescue.

623
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,290
Stop teasing others.

624
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,050
W-When was it?

625
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,290
When?

626
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,090
Feeling okay?

627
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,610
You’ll get used to it.

628
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Thank you, Dapeng.

629
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,290
Miss Ding, table’s reserved.

630
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,240
Thank you.

631
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:40,810
No problem.

632
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:48,960
I’m off.

633
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,770
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

634
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,850
You broke the ascender.

635
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,610
What?

636
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,770
I heard you threw up

637
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,050
after your first

638
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:04,810
on-water mission.

639
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,880
Who said it?

640
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,090
Who said it?

641
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,810
Was it you?

642
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:10,810
It was you.

643
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,480
Have you heard

644
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,920
that I was on the primary team

645
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
during the mission,

646
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,530
and that I performed

647
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:18,610
my task excellently?

648
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,810
Yeah,

649
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,330
so I’m now

650
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,440
congratulating to you

651
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,850
on officially becoming a rescuer.

652
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,720
I’ll buy you dinner.

653
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,400
What? You’ll buy me dinner?

654
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,920
Tell me the flavor of the instant noodle.

655
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Hey, will you

656
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,090
come or not?

657
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,530
I’ve had a table

658
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,610
reserved in advance.

659
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:38,720
Wait a minute.

660
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,640
You reserved a table? That’s formal.

661
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,530
- I must come.
- Bye.

662
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:42,370
Send me the location.

663
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
You cheeky bastard.

664
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,160
You don’t do this

665
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,370
every day.

666
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,770
Ding Dingding is treating me to dinner.

667
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,810
Shut up, and don’t drive.

668
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:52,640
Bring a good bottle of wine.

669
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,200
Hurry up.

670
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,050
Will you drink,

671
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,880
you lousy drinker?

672
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,610
It is my treat.

673
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,610
So you’ll pick whatever you like.

674
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:10,920
Take your time.

675
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,680
What do you think of the fish?

676
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
Looks good?

677
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,160
It’s you, then.

678
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,240
How pathetic.

679
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,720
Miss Ding,

680
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,680
do you have

681
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,810
to do that to me?

682
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,010
Ruan said,

683
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,850
teammates like you

684
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,240
are likely

685
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,720
to get PTSD,

686
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,920
what I’m using is

687
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,680
a psychological trick.

688
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,160
It, too, is a form

689
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,090
of therapy.

690
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,850
If you can be

691
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,920
as this creative when you draw,

692
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,570
the comic department

693
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,570
will do a lot better than now.

694
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,850
Hey, I’m serious.

695
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
You’ll bravely face

696
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,810
your greatest fears.

697
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,050
Take a good look at the seafood.

698
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,720
How do you feel?

699
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,290
Less sick, right?

700
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,530
No way. Are you still feeling sick?

701
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,960
Y-Y-You…

702
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,160
Get out of the room.

703
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,290
I was pulling your leg.

704
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,290
Come on.

705
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,850
What’s your problem?

706
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
Thank you for paying

707
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,480
for my therapy.

708
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,130
Here, Miss Ding.

709
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,130
You’re welcome.

710
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,130
Wait, did you

711
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,400
add water to the wine?

712
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
This is fake wine, right?

713
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,290
How come

714
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,530
my wine for you is always fake?

715
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,880
You act like

716
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,160
you had fake wine every time.

717
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,090
About this,

718
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,680
you’ll find

719
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,160
your own reasons.

720
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,960
Don’t blame the wine, alright?

721
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,330
Wait, wait.

722
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,720
Look at the color.

723
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,810
The color looks light.

724
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,570
It’s because

725
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:02,920
the wine is too good for you, Miss Ding.

726
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,480
Come on.

727
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,810
- I think…
- Eat your seafood.

728
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:05,770
Stuff your mouth.

729
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:25,920
Miss Ding.

730
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,370
Hurry up.

731
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,240
At this pace,

732
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,480
we’ll arrive at your house at midnight.

733
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,130
I know.

734
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,290
Turn around and keep walking.

735
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,090
Just keep walking.

736
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,570
No, no, no.

737
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,330
I tell you what,

738
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,610
you aren’t allowed to ask for leave.

739
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,290
I’ll dock your wage
if you don’t come to work.

740
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,680
What is the matter with you?

741
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,720
(It is said that a gift)

742
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,850
(can really cheer a girl up.)

743
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,530
Yan.

744
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,130
Auntie.

745
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,680
Will you be home this weekend?

746
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,160
Can I come for lunch?

747
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,280
Sure.

748
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,720
This is your home as well.

749
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
You come home

750
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,410
whenever you feel like it.

751
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,930
Honey, um…

752
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,360
Yan will be home for lunch.

753
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,890
Write down her orders.

754
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,760
OK, OK.

755
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,160
Yan.

756
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,490
I’ll ask my husband

757
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:35,410
to prepare a feast for you,

758
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,240
alright?

759
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,130
That’s too much trouble.

760
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,050
Just keep it simple. I’ll have anything.

761
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,610
No, no.

762
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,240
You are so busy at work.

763
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,720
You don’t take in much nutrition.

764
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,890
When you’re home,

765
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,200
you’ll be spoiled.

766
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:47,720
Yes.

767
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,010
Auntie.

768
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:53,320
I’d like to bring a friend

769
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,760
with me.

770
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:55,890
Is that okay?

771
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,010
Bring…

772
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,360
A friend?

773
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,610
Boyfriend?

774
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,930
She’s coming with her boyfriend?

775
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,720
Go get ready.

776
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,450
Sure, sure.

777
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,530
Yan,

778
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,970
it’s a deal, then.

779
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,050
We’ll see you on the weekend.

780
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:10,970
OK.

781
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,930
Bye-bye.

782
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,890
I bought many gifts.

783
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,890
But I’m not sure

784
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,800
if your aunt will like them.

785
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,930
They’ll accept

786
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,200
everything that you bought.

787
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,720
It’s a family visit.

788
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,160
It’s not a gift contest.

789
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
Gifts matter, alright?

790
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,680
They are the token of my sincerity.

791
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,610
You're using it already?

792
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,410
Sure.

793
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:55,130
It’s the first gift

794
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,160
that you bought for me.

795
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,530
As if I’m stingy.

796
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,530
You are not.

797
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,680
Girls don’t buy

798
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,130
gifts for men casually.

799
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,320
But this is good.

800
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,930
It’s a good match with your little camel.

801
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,160
I like it.

802
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,320
Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

803
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,890
I’m coming.

804
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,160
- Yan.
- Auntie.

805
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,570
Come in, please.

806
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,050
Ma’am.

807
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,610
Come on. Come in.

808
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,890
This is Luo Ben.

809
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,760
Where’s your husband?

810
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,410
I’m coming.

811
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:29,640
- Sir, nice to see you.
- You, too.

812
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,800
It’s fine.

813
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,490
Give them to me.

814
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:31,930
Seriously.

815
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,720
Thank you. Thank you.

816
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,360
You didn’t need to buy anything.

817
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,490
Mr. Luo, it is you.

818
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,200
Yes, it is me.

819
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,090
Sir.

820
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,840
He and I made a bet.

821
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,490
I won 30 yuan.

822
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,970
You’re unbelievable.

823
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,050
Thank you for your trust, ma’am.

824
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,010
Quickly. Come on in.

825
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,410
Come on.

826
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:45,760
Go.

827
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,410
Come on. Sit inside.

828
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:46,760
Quickly.

829
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,640
It looks pretty.

830
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,490
You picked it?

831
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,840
He did.

832
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,720
I’m not good at picking gifts.

833
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,360
He picked it?

834
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,720
He knows how to pick gifts,

835
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,130
and how to pick a girlfriend.

836
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,530
He’s good at everything.

837
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,490
Yan.

838
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,680
If

839
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,090
your mother,

840
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,800
my sister, was still alive,

841
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,280
she would

842
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,450
be so happy

843
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,610
to see you with such a great boyfriend.

844
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,010
You will

845
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,840
come home with him more often.

846
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,530
Yes, you’re busy at work,

847
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,760
but there will always be time for meals.

848
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,200
Oh, right.

849
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,610
Have you talked about

850
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,800
when you’ll get married?

851
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,280
Not yet.

852
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,570
If he never mentioned it,

853
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,840
you can bring it up.

854
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,490
It’s okay.

855
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,280
Hey, lunch’s ready.

856
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,800
Hurry up.

857
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,720
- Coming.
- Come on.

858
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:14,410
Let’s go.

859
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,280
Come on.

860
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,970
Quickly.

861
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,090
Sit down.

862
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,570
Luo, please sit.

863
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,010
Sit, please.

864
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,050
Thank you, ma’am.

865
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,160
We’ll have a drink, Luo.

866
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,530
- Yeah, yeah. Have a drink.
- Thank you, sir.

867
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:27,840
Here.

868
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:28,930
Here.

869
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,840
Your cooking skill is excellent, sir.

870
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,930
All dishes look delicious.

871
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,200
You’ll come home more often.

872
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,760
Sure, sure.

873
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,280
You’re welcome to come.

874
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,320
Yes, you’re welcome.

875
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,050
Thank you.

876
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,050
(Outpatient)

877
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,610
Does Bed No. 38’s gauze

878
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,530
need to be changed?

879
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,720
38?

880
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,130
(Nurse Station)

881
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:43,720
- Morning.
- OK.

882
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,640
- Yes, No. 38.
- Ruoxi.

883
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
This is for everybody.

884
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,490
You didn’t buy it for me?

885
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,570
Dr. Zhan is so nice.

886
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,280
She bought snacks for everybody.

887
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,680
Come on.

888
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,360
She’s in a good mood.

889
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
Quickly. Come on.

890
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,680
Good morning.

891
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,090
What’s the matter with Dr. Zhan?

892
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,360
She never…

893
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,050
She never said hello

894
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,010
to us.

895
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,490
She’s in love.

896
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,720
How do you know?

897
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,840
Dr. Zhan’s young and successful.

898
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,680
Nothing’s missing in her life.

899
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,530
Other than a relationship,

900
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,450
nothing else

901
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,090
can break the peace of her life.

902
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,760
Good for her.

903
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,200
I want a relationship too.

904
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
You will

905
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,320
have your social dysfunction cured first.

906
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,570
No, I don’t have it.

907
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,410
I think we can ask around.

908
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,610
Have you had breakfast?

909
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,090
I have.

910
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:36,720
Yes.

911
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:37,680
Zhan Yan.

912
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,090
You look different.

913
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,720
Get ready. We’ll make rounds.

914
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,720
- OK.
- Alright.

915
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,240
What’s the matter with Zhan Yan?

916
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Something’s up.

917
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,530
Come on.

918
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:16,010
You’re back.

919
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,130
Mrs. Qin didn’t come?

920
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,610
I haven’t seen her these days.

921
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,760
I think she’s caught up
with family business.

922
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,720
Show me

923
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,410
all the recent cases.

924
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:23,640
Only these

925
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,840
two cases

926
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:25,970
are taken.

927
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,720
Legal aid.

928
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,360
Fine.

929
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,570
I’ll take these.

930
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,800
Anything else?

931
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,320
I now work under Gao Junchi.

932
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,640
He approved it.

933
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,450
You saw

934
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,410
what I sent to you yesterday?

935
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,640
I tell you what,

936
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,530
we’re bros.

937
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,760
Don’t say this again today.

938
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,320
What’s wrong?

939
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
He doesn’t mind.

940
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,160
Alright, stop.

941
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,800
He’s here.

942
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,010
Sunglasses, huh?

943
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,530
Hey, man.

944
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,930
What up?

945
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,490
We are expecting you.

946
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,360
Expecting me?

947
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:29,760
You touched dead bodies.

948
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,640
I won’t high-five you.

949
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,570
I will, then.

950
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,570
Everybody will die in the end.

951
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,130
What?

952
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,200
Are you going to live forever?

953
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,280
It brings bad luck.

954
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,930
You feel me?

955
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,200
Alright.

956
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,450
I feel you.

957
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,640
I hope

958
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,200
you will never need

959
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,890
anyone’s help.

960
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,490
Yes.

961
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:46,530
Help me before I help you.

962
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:47,760
Hey.

963
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,010
All right, he’s only joking.

964
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,010
Go get your bike.

965
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:50,840
It’s been so long since we last rode.

966
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,720
You got rusty, no?

967
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,640
Don’t find excuses

968
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:55,930
if you lose later.

969
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,530
Let’s go.

970
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:57,930
Enough is enough.

971
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,490
Slow down, Li Jian.

972
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,490
Li Jian, slow down.

973
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,530
