00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,780
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,130
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,135
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,490
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:35,960
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,506
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:48,345
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,625
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,675
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,675 --> 00:01:02,275
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:08,875
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,500
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,775
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,072

20
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,720
Well, today, I can't make it.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,891
Just one day. Just help to postpone one day.

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,011
Next time? When is the next time?

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,381
I know. I know you've tried your best.

24
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,520
Fine. Please call me next time.

25
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,280
Hey, you can't be here.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,270
It's dangerous. Come here.

27
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,134
What are you doing here?

28
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:34,028
We're looking for books.

29
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,420
Have you eaten something?

30
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,348
Not yet.

31
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,570
Well...

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,470
I have nothing left.

33
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,750
Only two lollipops.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,894
They're sweet. They are for you.

35
00:02:49,894 --> 00:02:52,500
- Thanks, Sis. 
 - Thanks, Sis.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,140
You're welcome.

37
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,086
Why don't you eat it?

38
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,330
My mom's leg hurts.

39
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,710
I want to keep it for her.

40
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,010
So sweet.

41
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,770
Please remember.

42
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,280
Later, you will have new toys and books.

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,610
You mustn't come here next time. Do you understand?

44
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,652
Yes.

45
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,716
Go back now.

46
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,822
Take care of him.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,548
 Be careful!

48
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:34,860
 Over here! I need help!

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,630
 Please hang on!

50
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,260
 Medical team, please come here!

51
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,400
 Please help me!

52
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,120
 Medical team!

53
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,420
 - One, two, three. 
 - Be careful.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
 Come on!

55
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,718
 That way!

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,730
 Please hang on!

57
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,394
 Please be careful!

58
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,400
 Come on!

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,096
 Zhiqiang, move this!

60
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,450
Run!

61
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,320
Aftershocks, run!

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Xiong Fei!

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,500
Zhan Yan, you haven't slept since yesterday till now.

64
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,670
Take a break for now. I'll takeover the suturing.

65
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,760

66
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,076
Mom is here. My sweetheart.

67
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:03,670
Mom, will I be totally blind in the future?

68
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,630
No. You'll get better.

69
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,700
Xiaolu.

70
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,330
Doctor Cai.

71
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,700
How about Doctor Zhan?

72
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,300
She is so tired; sleeping now.

73
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,260
 Let's line up. One by one.

74
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,150
 Okay, next one.

75
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,430
Zhan Yan, time for the next surgery.

76
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,652
She is sleeping.

77
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,570
Zhan Yan.

78
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,682
She asked me to wake her up.

79
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,736
Why are you here?

80
00:07:07,736 --> 00:07:09,488
Just doing good deeds.

81
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,750
You're awake.

82
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,988
I and Rescue 2 are here.

83
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,250
What? Don't believe it?

84
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,940
This doctor saw that.

85
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,624
He is my witness.

86
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,570
Come on.

87
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,650
Tell me about the situation of your team.

88
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,414
You two talk, bye.

89
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,150
Let's go.

90
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,772
Don't follow me.

91
00:07:49,772 --> 00:07:51,790
Who is following you? It's not your road.

92
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,870
How can you say that?

93
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,006
Okay. Fine.

94
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,040
Not aftershocks, coward.

95
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,892
You scared me.

96
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,970
Who... Who is a coward?

97
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,030
I was afraid that you were afraid.

98
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,944
I'm so unlucky.

99
00:08:24,944 --> 00:08:26,870
I have to find a way to get back.

100
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,900
Don't follow me.

101
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,840
Who is willing to follow you?

102
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,078
Who... Who is following you?

103
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,874
Really!

104
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,270

105
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,590
 Please.

106
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,450
 Have you seen my daughter?

107
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,560
 Who has seen my daughter? I haven't seen my daughter for two days.

108
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,040
 Here is her photo.

109
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,384
The bus is here.

110
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,050
I think this group of wounded have almost recovered.

111
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,950
- Sis. 
 - They'll...

112
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,150
Sister, is that bus from your hospital?

113
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,760
Can we go back to Linjiang?

114
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,050
Sister?

115
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,670
My cousin, she wants to go back.

116
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,670
Yeah, it is. But that's for seriously injured people.

117
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,530
I'm not sure if there is an extra seat.

118
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,860
It's okay, I can stand.

119
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,888
Anyway, I have to go back.

120
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:26,961
Please save one more seat for me. I can pay.

121
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:28,670
Wait!  You said you stayed here to be a hero.

122
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,150
Why do you need one seat?

123
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,760
Because of you, I was hurt.

124
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,690
Why are you so annoying?

125
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,850
What? What's wrong? If it wasn't for you, would I have gotten hurt?

126
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,546
Doctor Zhan.

127
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,750
Can my sister go back to Linjiang?

128
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,846
Yeah, she is on the list.

129
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,100
How about you?

130
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,750
Are you one of the evacuees this time?

131
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,506
What's wrong?

132
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,500
Doctor Zhan is my sister's primary care doctor.

133
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,100
She knows my sister's situation well.

134
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,010
If she can go back with us, that would be great.

135
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,410
Yeah.

136
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,140
Okay. Then I can rest assured.

137
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,504
I told you to get some rest.

138
00:10:11,504 --> 00:10:13,340
But you came to perform another operation.

139
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,910
I will go back to Linjiang soon.

140
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,394
I'd like to save more.

141
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,530
The reporters came with our team this time.

142
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,910
They would like to interview our medical team.

143
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,930
The director told us to do that.

144
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,052
I have no time.

145
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:30,810
Two patients had postoperative reactions.

146
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,814
I need to check them.

147
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,150
You know that I don't like those kinds of interviews.

148
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,550
Okay. I will do it for you.

149
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,292
Thanks.

150
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:44,688
 They're little kids.

151
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:46,400
 What's your name?

152
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,976
 - Okay. 
 - Not enough?

153
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,790
 - Tent three, right? 
 - Yeah.

154
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,260
 Okay.

155
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,490
 Your name?

156
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,260
Sis.

157
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,106
Instant noodles.

158
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,000
Still hot.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
They've been soaking for a while so they are a bit soft and bloated.

160
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,880
You should quickly eat.

161
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,540
Sis, you have no idea how difficult to get hot water in a queue here is.

162
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,360
It was almost my turn, but the hot water was over. I had to re-queue.

163
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,492
So hard.

164
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,130
- Have you had noodles? 
 - I had it when I was waiting for you.

165
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,710
It's hard to get hot water. Have it all.

166
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,650
Thanks.

167
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,426
You're welcome. Quickly eat.

168
00:11:46,426 --> 00:11:48,660
Sis, I remember when we were young,

169
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,910
I made mistakes and my mom forbade me from eating anything.

170
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,610
You would give me something to eat secretly. Do you remember that?

171
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,270
That was a pack of cup noodles. We shared it.

172
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,708
It was really tasty.

173
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,150
Be careful. Come on.

174
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,550
Here.

175
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,090
 Be careful.

176
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,050
 Put your feet on the bed first.

177
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,792
Ms. Luo.

178
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,534
How are you?

179
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,120
The principal... knew you and the kids were safe.

180
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,032
He died in peace.

181
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,280
Get some good rest. Goodbye.

182
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,530
 Brother,

183
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,562
 you haven't apologized to him.

184
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,530
Take your medicine first.

185
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,112
 He saved me.

186
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,380
I know he saved you.

187
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,260
Fine.

188
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,090
I'll apologize to him now. Okay?

189
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,500
Get some rest and take your medicine.

190
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,340
I put the pills here.

191
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,748
Xiong Fei.

192
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,052
What's wrong?

193
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,378
You saved my sister.

194
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:51,006
I won't forget what you did for her.

195
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,594
A reward is not the reason we go to save others.

196
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,208
Thanks.

197
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,920
Don't worry. I will definitely pay you back.

198
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,746
But I don't like you being too close to Yuan.

199
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,368
You are thinking too much.

200
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,960
No, I'm not.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Maybe you don't think too much, but I'm afraid Luo Yuan will think too much

202
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,314
She is an innocent girl.

203
00:15:18,314 --> 00:15:23,024
I don't want her to be influenced by the circumstances around her.

204
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,380
Don't worry.

205
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,170
I and Ms. Luo, we can say we are strangers.

206
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,770
And later we won't have any connections.

207
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,210
Okay.

208
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,480
In the future, if you need advice or help with any legal matters,

209
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,512
you can come to me.

210
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,670
Come in.

211
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,496
Ms. Luo, how do you feel?

212
00:16:06,496 --> 00:16:08,438
Do you feel better?

213
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,611
Doctor Cai, would you mind introducing Ms. Luo's condition to us?

214
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,480
Ms. Luo, they're reporters from Linjiang.

215
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,120
What are you doing?

216
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,046
Please get out.

217
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:23,760
Here's the situation.

218
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,861
I am a doctor at Linjiang Hospital, Cai Yuxiao.

219
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,690
They are reporters from Linjiang.

220
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,560
We'd like to interview your sister.

221
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,660
Interview? There is no interview needed here.

222
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,960
She needs to rest. Please get out.

223
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,200
Don't get me wrong.

224
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,210
They just want to bring some good news to the audiences who care about the Fengxi earthquake.

225
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,412
Good news?

226
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:49,310
Please stop shooting now. Turn off your camera.

227
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,840
Fengxi citizens are suffering from illness or injury, and some of them even died.

228
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,880
As a doctor, you don't save others,

229
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,280
but are accepting an interview here to enjoy the limelight.

230
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,260
Is it good news?

231
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,792
Please get out.

232
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,480
Okay, fine. I'll show you around outside.

233
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,390
Okay. Sorry.

234
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,990
Let's go.

235
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,446
Are you feeling well?

236
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,840
Ignore them.

237
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,300
Medical assistance after the earthquake is a matter of urgency.

238
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,380
You can see that we have a lot of simple operating tables on site.

239
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,771
Doctor Cai, how many operations like this do you handle a day?

240
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,700
I don't count that. As long as there is a need and there are patients, we will do it.

241
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,440
 Thanks for your hard work.

242
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,620
 It is hard work like yours that has saved so many lives.

243
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,720
 What kind of faith is it that sustains you?

244
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,290
 Saving others is our duty as doctors.

245
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,870
In TV interviews, Dr. Cai looks so handsome.

246
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,440
He looks handsome in daily life.

247
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,650
In the TV interview, it's just like his normal style.

248
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,650
And he gets more reputation for our hospital.

249
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,214
Good for him.

250
00:17:57,214 --> 00:18:03,070
Hearing him saying it in a trembling voice, saving one, and one more,

251
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,874
I am so touched.

252
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,640
 Team One has achieved your task so successfully.

253
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,510
 Thanks for your hard work.

254
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:19,100
 And now Team Two is there, our daily work can't run without doctors.

255
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,550
Zhan Yan, please come back with the critically ill patients.

256
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,820
Yes.

257
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,340
 Now we're in on-site settlements.

258
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,530
Lele, I'm going to leave soon.

259
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,820
Later other doctors will take care of you.

260
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,464
All right?

261
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,990
Lele, later when I'm free, I'll visit you.

262
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,390
Be good.

263
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Just watch out.

264
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,964
 Don't fall down.

265
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,190
- What? 
 - Let me.

266
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,290
- Be careful. 
 - What?

267
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,040
He wants to say something.

268
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,976
He's dying.

269
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,510
Hey, bro. Don't sleep.

270
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,110
Please hang on.

271
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,230
- Epinephrine. 
 - Okay.

272
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,226
Please hang on.

273
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,770
Hang on, bro.

274
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,108
Please...

275
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:25,840
Please... Save them.

276
00:20:26,756 --> 00:20:29,540
- Sa... Save... 
 - Save whom?

277
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,364
Sa... Save whom?

278
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,680
Hey.

279
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,808
Hey, man!

280
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,720
According to the clue from the smartphone,

281
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,640
we know that the wife of the deceased was trapped in a place, called Guoya.

282
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,930
In addition to her, there are probably other trapped people.

283
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,286
The Communication Team is spotting the site based on phone signals.

284
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:11,120
She hasn't replied to the message we sent one hour ago.

285
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,152
It is possible her phone is out of battery, or maybe...

286
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,762
In that case, we should arrive soon to check the situation.

287
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:22,780
Captain! We found Guoya!

288
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,220
Great.

289
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,020
Where is it?

290
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,060
Daxiang Village, Lulong County, 10km from Fengxi City.

291
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,790
Right here.

292
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,240
But according to the satellite images, there is no sign of the house.

293
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,650
What is the road traffic situation like?

294
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,930
It's being repaired.

295
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,400
If we leave now, we can be there in the early morning.

296
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,350
And we don't know what's going on there.

297
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:45,090
I suggest we leave as soon as possible.

298
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,260
- Then this road is the only way we can get there. 
 - Right.

299
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,020
Reach the top of the cliff, then rappel down.

300
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,690
It's the quickest. Not too many people.

301
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,660
Xiong Fei. Peng. Be prepared. Let's go.

302
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,458
- Yes. 
 - Yes!

303
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,100
Be careful, everyone.

304
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,288
You too, Captain.

305
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,034
Watch out.

306
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,510
Captain.

307
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,210
Captain. Look.

308
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,240
Get ready to rappel down.

309
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,630
- Okay. 
 - Yes.

310
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,120
Let's go.

311
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,890
Watch out for falling rocks.

312
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,140
Put your goggles on.

313
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,124
Safety first.

314
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,050
Let's go.

315
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,090
- Peng. Xiong Fei. Separate to inspect. 
 - Yes, sir.

316
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,580
I'll go to the back.

317
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,080
Okay.

318
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,150
Captain!

319
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,220
Hey, girl. Can you hear me?

320
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,350
Come on.

321
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,690
Tell me where your wound is?

322
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,720
Save me.

323
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,472
Save my baby.

324
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,074
She's pregnant.

325
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,900
- Pregnant. 
 - Stand up first.

326
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,351
Aunt, it's for you.

327
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,240
Thanks, sweetheart. Be a good girl.

328
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,840
Thank you.

329
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:50,850
Thank you.

330
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,620
Be careful.

331
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,198
Take care of her.

332
00:24:55,198 --> 00:24:57,446
Wait, wait!

333
00:24:57,446 --> 00:24:59,192
No seats left.

334
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:00,921
We can stand. I do have an emergency.

335
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:02,410
It's unsafe to be overloaded.

336
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:03,630
Wait for the next bus.

337
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,970
 Attention.

338
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,410
 Attention. Target, Guoya.

339
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,170
A pregnant woman is here, she's about to give birth.

340
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,020
We need an obstetrician.

341
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,650
Doctors, please report.

342
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,650
Feiyu, roger that.

343
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm at the base. No doctors on the team are available.

344
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,420
I can go.

345
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,800
Who are you?

346
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,560
Surgeon, Zhan Yan. From Linjiang Central Hospital.

347
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Minored in obstetrics in college. Have midwifery experience.

348
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,620
That's great. I'll report to the captain now.

349
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,880
Captain, Feiyu here.

350
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,996
You can take my seat.

351
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,310
But what about you?

352
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,126
I have a mission.

353
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:44,266
Yan, be careful.

354
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,310
How is it?

355
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,950
Dr. Zhan, you can't go to Guoya.

356
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,990
Why can't I?

357
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,126
Our captain rejected it.

358
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,490
Captain Qingshan, this is Zhan Yan.

359
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,350
An emergency baby delivery in Guoya.

360
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,520
Why can't I go to help her?

361
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,896
I know how you feel.

362
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:02,748
You are a doctor.

363
00:26:02,748 --> 00:26:05,380
 But you don't have the skills to live in the wild.

364
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,860
The landform of Guoya is complicated.

365
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,691
It's dangerous for you if you help her.

366
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,690
Isn't it dangerous for other doctors?

367
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,040
Fine. Listen. Can you rappel?

368
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,510
 No, you can't.

369
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,200
If you arrive at Guoya, you must rappel down a cliff,

370
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,180
so that's why I asked the doctor who has accepted our training to come and help her.

371
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,260
Do you understand now?

372
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,300
Though I don't know how to rappel, other team members can teach me.

373
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,450
 Dr. Zhan,

374
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,510
we don't have enough time now to train someone who knows nothing of rappelling.

375
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,370
We can't risk your life, either.

376
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,902
It's nonsense.

377
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:43,730
Dr. Zhan, thank you.

378
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,398
I'll try to call other doctors.

379
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,590
I'm a member of International Medical Rescue.

380
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,002
For the safety of the pregnant woman, take me to Guoya now.

381
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,820
I got injured because of you, you don't want me to stand. Right?

382
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,200
If you can't stand, go to the next bus.

383
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,100
Sis left it for me.

384
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,360
Your sis stays to help others, but you're not hurt and are trying to run away.

385
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,052
How could cousins be so different?

386
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,310
- What? 
 - If you're shouting, I'll kick you out of here.

387
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,140
It's nothing. Don't stare.

388
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,860
We can leave now, sir.

389
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,414
I thought you were a doctor.

390
00:27:24,414 --> 00:27:26,350
But I am not an OB/GYN.

391
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:30,594
I can help her, but I'm afraid of any accidents in the process.

392
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,650
Can we carry her out of here?

393
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,150
No.

394
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,268
Her water has broken, so she can't move.

395
00:27:37,268 --> 00:27:38,410
What about the truck?

396
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,346
No, it doesn't work.

397
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:44,110
Please save my baby.

398
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,410
It'd be better if we had a helicopter.

399
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,586
It's too late to say it.

400
00:27:48,586 --> 00:27:50,472
Give me a minute.

401
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,690
Hold on.

402
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,800
Director Liu, this is Qingshan.

403
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,822
We are in Guoya.

404
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,590
What is it?

405
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,750
That's good.

406
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,180
I see. That's great.

407
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,700
Feiyu.

408
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,060
 I just got informed that the road to Guoya has been restored.

409
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,890
 We need a car to bring Zhan Yan here.

410
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,021
A car? Where can I find one?

411
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,220
Let's go.

412
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,450
The road to Guoya has been restored. No need to rappel.

413
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,410
Captain asked to find a car to bring you there.

414
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,446
But there's no car here.

415
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,660
Dr. Zhan, get on.

416
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,546
Hold me tightly.

417
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:03,300
Dr. Zhan, this is the second time you have gotten in my car.

418
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,250
Do you think I want to do it?

419
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,930
Do you... often talk to people in this way?

420
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,310
It depends on who I talk to.

421
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,540
You can't always have a prejudice against me.

422
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,790
Hold what?

423
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,240
Prejudice.

424
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,992
What?

425
00:29:15,992 --> 00:29:17,472
Hold onto me!

426
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:19,292
Look at the road!

427
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,071
- Ready. Captain. 
 - Well. Come on.

428
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,140
Let's carry her there.

429
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,640
Slowly.

430
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,620
Come on.

431
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,190
Three. Go.

432
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,800
There.

433
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,110
Good.

434
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,810
Slow down.

435
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,060
Do we have another way to go?

436
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,660
Of course.

437
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,490
Like what Captain and others have done, go through there by foot and go down by ropes.

438
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,580
Are you kidding?

439
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,640
The patient can't wait anymore.

440
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,420
Dr. Zhan, have you tried sand driving?

441
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,400
Yes. So?

442
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,104
Hold me.

443
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,960
♫  I will always believe in sincerity and kindness  ♫

444
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,680
Doctor... Where is the doctor?

445
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,204
She'll be here soon. Hold on.

446
00:30:50,204 --> 00:30:51,990
- Peng. 
 - They're here.

447
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,550
Peng, stay with her.

448
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,880
The doctor has arrived. Don't give up.

449
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,270
♫  The dreams I carry will be burning  ♫

450
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:09,850
♫  Will be flaming hot  ♫

451
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:16,570
♫  Will be blooming  ♫

452
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:23,070
♫  Will be shining  ♫

453
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:30,970
♫  Becoming light  ♫

454
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,604
 How do you make the first diagnosis to different patients?

455
00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:46,070
 What we should pay more attention to is the patients who groan loudly,

456
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,650
 it doesn't mean they are seriously injured.

457
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:51,450
Dr. Cai also looks handsome today.

458
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,930
Citizens sent him flowers. The media interviewed him.

459
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,930
Patients register for his consultancy.

460
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,550
Now he has become an influencer.

461
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,160
Don't have designs on him.

462
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,650
"When the earth shook, a disaster occurred.

463
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,250
It's you who saved many lives and brought us hope.

464
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,520
A tribute to Dr. Cai Yuxiao. A soldier in white."

465
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,790
Dr. Cai, nice to meet you.

466
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,170
I'm a reporter from Linjiang Daily.

467
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,080
May I invite you to an exclusive interview about the earthquake rescue?

468
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,890
No, I'm sorry. As a doctor, it's my duty to save people.

469
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,752
So I think you should feature what happened there to people.

470
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,700
Zhan Yan, you stayed in the earthquake area the longest.

471
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,410
Most of the patients were saved by you.

472
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,410
But he accepted the interview and stole your glory.

473
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,820
Whoever accepted the interview has nothing to do with me.

474
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,170
I don't care about it. And I don't want to do it.

475
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,790
You should accept it.

476
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,940
It's not for yourself. You represent rescue Team One who went to help at the disaster area.

477
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,030
What do you mean?

478
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,210
Don't you know it?

479
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,350
The hospital plans to reward the most excellent rescue team.

480
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:54,540
if you don't fight for it, the award will go to rescue Team Two, to Cai Yuxiao.

481
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,220
 After the Fengxi earthquake, leading comrades, enterprises and institutions, relevant organizations,

482
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,920
 and people from different regions worked together to try their best

483
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,630
 to support the earthquake area in different ways.

484
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,800
 Today, we invited the chairman of Dian Shi Cheng Jin Media Company, Mr. Ma Baoming.

485
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,340
 Mr. Ma said, when he knew the earthquake happened in Fengxi,

486
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,870
 he immediately sent two thousand boxes of water

487
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,930
 and one thousand boxes of instant noddles,

488
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:31,450
 to extend his sincere care to the people there.

489
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:36,014
 Thanks to many people like Mr. Ma, who did a lot for...

490
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,510

491
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,360
Mr. Ma, I just heard the news that you sent goods to the earthquake area.

492
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,340
I want to show my respect to you.

493
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,690
 To be honest, I should thank you.

494
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,720
 You've solved the problem of Ding Dingding.

495
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,980
 And we sold the copyright right away, and got a new investment.

496
00:34:02,752 --> 00:34:05,400
You lost money buying water and cup noodles,

497
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,540
but you did show the best image to the public.

498
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,516
A clever move, Mr. Ma.

499
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,100
 Well...

500
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,810
Well, Mr. Ma, about Ding Dingding's case, a new idea came to my mind,

501
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:20,030
so I need to talk with you.

502
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,670
- Hello, Weiwei. 
  - Dingding, how's your painting?

503
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm on it. I'm painting.

504
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,550
 You need to hurry. Submit it before the deadline.

505
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,250
 I entrusted it to you because you're punctual.

506
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,340
Don't worry. I'll submit it on time.

507
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:50,838
And Weiwei, the deposit...

508
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,520
 Well... I'll transmit it to you soon.

509
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,460
How soon will it be?

510
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,950
Hello?

511
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,820
What the hell? Always hangs up when speaking of money.

512
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,940

513
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,750
Oh my god.

514
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,942
That was fast.

515
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,568
But it's weird.

516
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,680
But my payment is less than 100 thousand yuan.

517
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,250

518
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,660
Mr. Ma.

519
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,160
Hi, Ding Dingding.

520
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,800
It looks like you didn't block my phone call.

521
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
Why would I do that?

522
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,350
I know you so well.

523
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,460
Even though you say so, you will still curse me secretly.

524
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:46,850
I transferred you 100 thousand yuan.

525
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,954
Did you get it?

526
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:51,430
Your money...

527
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:55,762
My money is used to stop you from cursing me.

528
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:59,360
Mr. Ma, if you don't tell me the truth, I dare not accept it.

529
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,160
 What if it is another trap you set up for me,

530
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,550
then your lawyer will sue me again, and I will lose.

531
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,900
No worries.

532
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,910
I gave you money, because it's my lawyer's advice.

533
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,542
You're so young, so you tend to act without thinking.

534
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,880
But you're a potential painter.

535
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,620
I hope we'll have other chances to cooperate again in the future.

536
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,810
So don't push each other into a corner. Am I right?

537
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,150
It's your lawyer's advice.

538
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,770
Well, please wait for a second, Mr. Ma.

539
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,620
Listen to me. Please say what you just said again.

540
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,740
I want to record it as evidence.

541
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,430
What?

542
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,940
Sis.

543
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,000
Why are you here?

544
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,560
My dad made wonton with chicken soup.

545
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,160
He asked you to come home and have dinner this weekend.

546
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,540
I have to work this weekend.

547
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,888
But say thanks to your mom and dad.

548
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:52,670
You said you had to work last time.

549
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,050
If you don't join us, my mom will take it as my fault.

550
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,400
Fine. When are you available?

551
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:03,440
In a few days. I've been busy recently.

552
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,810
Oh, right, Sis.

553
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,540
Can you share these with your colleagues in the Emergency Department?

554
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,072
Last time, I jumped... I brought so many troubles to them.

555
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,574
Now you feel sorry for it?

556
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,700
You should reflect on yourself.

557
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,531
I know. I was forced to do it. I had no other choice.

558
00:37:24,531 --> 00:37:29,210
But I didn't expect that the wicked publisher now knows his fault,

559
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,950
so he gave me money for the copyright, which is worth 100 thousand yuan.

560
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,730
There is no such thing as a pie in the sky.

561
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:38,060
Are you sure he's not digging a hole waiting for you?

562
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:41,080
I don't think so. He said his lawyer gave him this advice.

563
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,120
I recorded his words.

564
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,540
Luo Ben?

565
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,341
It's him. I think it's fair that he helps me.

566
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,200
He should do it.

567
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,100
When his sister had surgery, I gathered my friends to donate blood for her.

568
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,804
Anyway, this time, we are completely even.

569
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,666
Thank you, Sis.

570
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,750
Come home for dinner when you're free.

571
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,120
Yuan.

572
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,570
Is he okay?

573
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,191
- Sweetheart. 
 - I'm sorry. He's sleeping and had a nightmare.

574
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,370
 Honey, why did you push me down?

575
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,101
- I bought you bread. 
  - You fell by yourself.

576
00:38:40,101 --> 00:38:42,610
 How can I fall accidentally? You must have pushed me.

577
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,910
 I didn't do it.

578
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,230
Are you happy about it?

579
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,930
 I didn't push you.

580
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,000
 You fell accidentally.

581
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,950
You know I have lumbar disc protrusion.

582
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,340
Don't beat me! Listen to me. Why are you so angry?

583
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,834
Are you happy to have bread, or are you happy to see me?

584
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,734
 Of course, I'm happy for... for you.

585
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:01,630
Try it.

586
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,690
 I just snored. Do you have to be so mad?

587
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,390
 Every man snores.

588
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,130
Yuan, do they often quarrel like this?

589
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,450
 My waist hurts... Fine, I know. Stop it. It's more painful.

590
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,010
Can you have a good rest here? Are they too noisy for you?

591
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,550
 My voice is quiet enough. Not loud.

592
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,890
Luo Yuan, I'm coming to check your wounds.

593
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,870
-  Other people won't consider me. 
 - Your snore is too noisy. Don't you know?

594
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:27,020
 Snoring is one of the things that I can't control.

595
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,020
 What about this? Find me a doctor.

596
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,910
 Or just say you don't want me to breathe.

597
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:36,930
- That's enough of you. 
 - You always win. I can't do anything about it, can I?

598
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,958
Dr. Zhan.

599
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,180
Yuan is now in good condition. Thank you.

600
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,770
That's my job and duty. You don't have to thank me.

601
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:53,374
And Dingding told me that you've asked compensation for her.

602
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:55,310
That's not my money.

603
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:59,370
So it is just that... "The hand of giving roses has a lingering fragrance."

604
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:03,206
I see what you are capable of as a lawyer.

605
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:07,046
But it depends on whether my client agrees to cooperate.

606
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,320
Dr. Zhan.

607
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,210
There's something else. I need a favor from you.

608
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,344
What is it?

609
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:19,810
Luo Yuan should stay in a quiet ward.

610
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,400
I believe you noticed that the patients next to her are super noisy.

611
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,560
I don't believe she can get a good rest there.

612
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,808
So I hope you may arrange a single ward for her.

613
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:33,650
There is no vacant single ward now.

614
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:35,918
Could you try to do something?

615
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:39,288
There's no single ward, so what can I do about it?

616
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,164
You are a doctor. You will find a way to do something.

617
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,770
What you mean is that have a ward in our hospital

618
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:53,990
but I purposely don't give you a ward, so you need a doctor to open a backdoor.

619
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:55,910
This is what you think of our hospital.

620
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:58,510
This is what you think of us as doctors?

621
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,680
I just want to change a ward.

622
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,420
You don't have to lecture me.

623
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,730
I'm not giving you a lecture.

624
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,706
I'm just telling the truth.

625
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:29,800
Well, we prepared so many dishes, and hoped that your cousin

626
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,120
would come home and eat something nutritious.

627
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,460
But you didn't bring her home.

628
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,060
I'm your real daughter, you know it?

629
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,568
You're always thinking of her.

630
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,940
Yan behaved like an adult when she was young,

631
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,850
and did everything perfectly in school and the hospital.

632
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,054
You're not like her.

633
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,100
I'm not, I know.

634
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,250
You are university teachers and highly educated, am I right?

635
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,320
But couldn't cultivate your only daughter into a scholar.

636
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,160
I understand how you feel.

637
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:02,200
But listen to me, you will realize the top student will leave their parents in the end.

638
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,000
As for me, I am the angel from Heaven sent to stay by your side forever, Mom.

639
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,200
So when will our angel grow her wings and fly away from home?

640
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,830
I will never leave.

641
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,306
I can't live without my dad's wonton.

642
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
Here.

643
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,270
Yan didn't come home today, tomorrow I'll make some dishes

644
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,814
and take them to her.

645
00:42:25,814 --> 00:42:27,500
You'd better not.

646
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,620
She doesn't like visiting us,

647
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,060
and she doesn't want us to disturb her, either.

648
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,430
Nonsense.

649
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,320
When did Yan say she didn't like to come home?

650
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,021
It is true. She likes to be alone.

651
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,400
So you should leave her alone.

652
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:51,018
People have to spend a lifetime to overcome the bad memories of childhood.

653
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,590
I want to take care of her.

654
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,720
Yan looks indifferent to us.

655
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,200
But she knows in her heart who loves and cares about her.

656
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,800
Am I right?

657
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,720
Yan's dad... He is also nice to Dingding.

658
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,690
And Dingding calls him uncle, and she is in a good relationship with him.

659
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:16,320
The young shouldn't bear the burden of what happened in the past. Understand?

660
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,570
What on earth? Why did you mention him?

661
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,936
This guy, I won't forgive him for the rest of my life.

662
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:37,990

663
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,424
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

664
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,344
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

665
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:02,396
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

666
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:09,360
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

667
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:17,752
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

668
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:25,376
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

669
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:32,710
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

670
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:39,980
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

671
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:48,776
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

672
00:44:48,776 --> 00:44:55,020
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

673
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:03,800
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

674
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:11,200
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

675
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,136
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

676
00:45:15,136 --> 00:45:18,876
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

677
00:45:18,876 --> 00:45:22,488
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

678
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:26,248
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

679
00:45:26,248 --> 00:45:29,960
♫  I can't fly  ♫

680
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,836
♫  But I can look up  ♫

681
00:45:33,836 --> 00:45:41,560
♫  I'm chasing the light on the road  ♫
