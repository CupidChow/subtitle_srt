1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,070

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,700
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,100
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:22,000
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,000
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,390
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,200
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,500
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,600
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,300
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,900
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:15,600
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,200
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,300
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,400
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,000

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,900

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Tingting!

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,300
- Rappel down. 
 - Yes, sir.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,120
Tingting!

23
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,500
Luo Ben reporting.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Suspected target found at the foot of the mountain.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,800
 Clothing features are consistent with Tingting.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Contain the situation.

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Prevent further damage.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,100
Get the target identified as soon as possible.

29
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,600
Copy.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
It's not Tingting.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,900
There was a backpacker missing reported last month.

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
That's him!

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,000
We searched for more than ten days.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,700
Luo Ben speaking.

35
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,700
At the foot of the mountain, the remains are that of a missing backpacker.

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,600
An adult male. He's not our target.

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,600
 Repeat, not our target.

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,200
Thank goodness!

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,500
See? What did I say?

40
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,800
It's not Tingting.

41
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,600
Tingting is still alive. She's alive.

42
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,000
There's hope.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Brother, as long as she's alive,

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,900
I promise we will bring her back safe and sound.

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,300
Thanks.

46
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you all.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
Take your seat.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,500
Thank goodness.

49
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,800
Thank goodness.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,800
Calm down. We won't give up until the very last moment.

51
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
Thank you.

52
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,900
All right! Pull up!

53
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,700
Steady!

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,000
All right. Release the rope.

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,700
Come on.

56
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,300
Keep going.

57
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,800
Captain!

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Report from Luo Ben. The body at the foot of the mountain was not our target.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
It wasn't?

60
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,800
Okay, I get it.

61
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,500
Tell them to cooperate with the police and keep searching.

62
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, sir.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Officer Chen, it's getting dark and the rain is heavy.

64
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,000
Shall we take a break and come back later when the rain stops?

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,300
- Okay. 
 -  Yeah.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,700
No! You can't leave!

67
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,000
What about my kids?

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,700
The government pays you. Now you want to take a break at a critical time.

69
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,200
How could you do that?

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,300
We don't get paid!

71
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,400
I don't care!

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,100
None of you can leave until my kids are found.

73
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,700
Go look for her! Go!

74
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,300
Tingting's father. Calm down, please.

75
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
Take a deep breath.

76
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,200
The mountain terrain is complex.

77
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,000
The rain is pouring.

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,700
And it's getting dark. I must keep my teammates safe.

79
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,000
What about my kids if you leave now?

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm begging you. Please save my kids.

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
I'm begging you.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,500
Please save them.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,400
Grandma, it's raining heavily and the terrain is complex.

84
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,000
Give them some time.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,100
The children never make us worried at home.

86
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,300
They'd never come home late for playing outside.

87
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,700
Right.

88
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:49,500
Tingting keeps complaining about feeling sore and weak,

89
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,100
and she's having a toothache.

90
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,900
I thought that's natural for growing children.

91
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,100
Is it bad?

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Zhan Yan to Team One. Come in.

93
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Luo Ben from Team One.

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,700
What's up, Dr. Zhan?

95
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Tingting has multiple body aches. She might be in a bad condition.

96
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
Please locate her soon and take her to further inspection.

97
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,600
Copy, Luo Ben out.

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,100
Officer Chen.

99
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,500
Please try to calm Tingting's father while I search for her.

100
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,400
Okay.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
Are you nuts?

102
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100
Don't you remember what Captain says?

103
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,500
You must stay alive to search for others.

104
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,400
That's why I'm going on my own.

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,100
Peng, take them back for a break.

106
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,000
Come back when the rain stops.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,800
That's not my way of doing it.

108
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Luo Ben, I'm in.

109
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
- So are we. 
 - Count me in.

110
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,700
The chance is higher if we do it together.

111
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
I understand how you feel.

112
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,500
But Captain Qingshan asked me to coordinate on-site.

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,100
I must keep everyone safe.

114
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,800
I can't have you risk it.

115
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,100
You care about us.

116
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,700
We care about you, too!

117
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,200
What if you get lost?

118
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
We'd have one more lost person.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,800
All right.

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,500
Work in groups of three.

121
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,200
Eyes sharp.

122
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,300
Keep close to other groups.

123
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
Report your location every ten minutes.

124
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
 What's wrong?

126
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,700
Nothing.

127
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,400
How's your day?

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Are the kids behaving?

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,300
 They are giving me a headache.

130
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,500
Tingting!

131
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
- Tingting! 
 - Where are you?

132
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,800
Tingting!

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,400
Can you hear me?

134
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,000
- Tingting!  
 - Tingting!

135
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,400
Where are you?

136
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,200
Are you all right?

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,700
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm good.

138
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,100
Well, let's take a break at the top of this hill.

139
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,400
Okay.

140
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,700
Come on.

141
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
- After you. 
 - Steady.

142
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
Have some water.

143
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,900
I'm good.

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
All right, that's enough.

145
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,100
That's enough.

146
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,000
I'll use the water later.

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,600
All right.

148
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,300
What's that for?

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,700
We don't have hot water here.

150
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,800
It's only enough for one share.

151
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
We're cycling the water.

152
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Is that enough to cook the noodles?

153
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,500
At least it's warm now.

154
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,500
In previous rescue missions,

155
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,200
we only got hardtack and cold water five days in a row.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,400
No need to apologize.

158
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,900
As a father, you must be worried about your children.

159
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,000
I understand.

160
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,200
I failed my children.

161
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,500
I'm away from home most of the year.

162
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,100
Tingting knows about my stomach illness.

163
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,000
After knowing we were coming home, she came here to pick hawthorns.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But we got delayed on the way.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,400
Tingting and Pengpeng kept the hawthorns for us.

166
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,100
The hawthorns went bad, but they still kept them.

167
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,700
Hawthorns?

168
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,200
Are you saying that Tingting is here for hawthorn?

169
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,200
Where can you find them?

170
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,400
North hill.

171
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,100
That way.

172
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,500
All groups. To the north hill.

173
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
- Set off now. 
 - Group One, copy.

174
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,600
- Group Two, roger. 
 - Group Three, copy that.

175
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,700
Tingting!

176
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,500
Pengpeng! Pengpeng!

177
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Tingting!

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Where are you?

179
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,400
Can you hear me?

180
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,900
Hello?

181
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
Tingting?

182
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Man-made covering!

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,600
We found one.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,100
We found Pengpeng.

185
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,900
They located Pengpeng!

186
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
They found him!

187
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,200
Pengpeng.

188
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,700
Pengpeng, can you hear me?

189
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,500
Pengpeng, how do you feel?

190
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,900
His vital signs are good.

191
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Just a small fever.

192
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,900
Here.

193
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,000
Careful.

194
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,500
It's all right.

195
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,000
- Pengpeng! 
 - Watch your step.

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Dad.

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,100
Pengpeng, why are you here?

198
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
Where's your sister?

199
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,500
She's looking for food.

200
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,600
Officer Chen, it's dangerous here.

201
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,400
You should head out with Pengpeng.

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,900
- Okay. Take care. 
 - Sure.

203
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
All right. Let's go.

204
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,500
Luo Ben, we found something.

205
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,700
We found a shoe. It might belong to the target.

206
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,100
There are slopes here.

207
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,700
But there is no clear sign of sliding down.

208
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,200
The fog is heavy.

209
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,400
There are trees all around.

210
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,600
Received!  Received!

211
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Peng, let's go to them.

212
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,300
Tingting!

213
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,200
- Tingting! 
 - Can you hear me?

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,500
Tingting!

215
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Where are you?

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,500
Tingting.

217
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,900
Peng! Look over there!

218
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,300
Tingting! Tingting!

219
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,500
She's really here.

220
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
Attention. We found the target.

221
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,300
She's unconscious with multiple abrasions.

222
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,700

223
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,400
Zhan Yan.

224
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Quiet.

225
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
We got the result.

226
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,200
It's acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

227
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,700
Tingting, have some fruit.

228
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Is it good?

229
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,400
Slow down.

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,400
Eat slowly.

231
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,700
All right.

232
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,400
Tingting!

233
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
Dr. Zhan! Thank you.

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,700
Ms. Zhan. Mr. Luo. You're here!

235
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,300
How do you feel? Any better?

236
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,500
Don't worry.

237
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,100
She'll be discharged soon.

238
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,200
Thank you.

239
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm not worried at all.

240
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
I am ill.

241
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,600
But I'm not upset.

242
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
That way, dad and mom can stay by my side.

243
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Tingting, I will never leave you.

244
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,800
Really?

245
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,100
For real.

246
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,000
Mom must do what she says.

247
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,300
Parents always choose to leave their children because of thousands of difficulties.

248
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,700
When they chose to leave, they did what they had to do.

249
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,500
Now they have to stay here.

250
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,600
There must be many difficulties awaiting.

251
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,800
I just hope that they can stay together as a family.

252
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,800
When I was a child, I used to feign illness to have my father stay.

253
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You should visit him.

254
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,500
 That's your favorite dish! It's ready.

255
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
 Stay still. I'll take the towel.

256
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
 There, slowly.

257
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 Feel any better?

258
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,600
 Yan, I want to talk to you about something.

259
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,800
 Stop it.

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,700
 I know you're going on a mission again.

261
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,100
 I didn't even get to talk.

262
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,600
 Right.

263
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,700
 I have to go on my own.

264
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,800
 Only I can finish this job.

265
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,600
 No! I'm still burning with fever!

266
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,200
 Are you leaving me alone, Dad?

267
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,000
 I just took your temperature.

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,300
 It's been brought down.

269
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,900
 No! I'm having a fever! I feel awful!

270
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,200
 I'm burning up again. I'm having a fever.

271
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,400
 I said I don't want it!

272
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,300
23.

273
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,100
24.

274
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,400
Ding Dingding. Ding Dingding.

275
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,700
Sister-in-law.

276
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,600
25.

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,100
- Ding Dingding. 
 - Are you having a cold?

278
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
What are you talking about?

279
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,200
It's because of you!

280
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,300
Oh my goodness.

281
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,500
What happened to your mouth?

282
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,700
Let me take a look. What happened?

283
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,200
Your mouth. It looks severe.

284
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,200
The lipstick you gave me, it's fake.

285
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
No manufacturer. No date of manufacture.

286
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,900
No production license number.

287
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,200
There isn't even a mark! It's counterfeit!

288
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
- Ding Dingding. 
 - How did that happen?

289
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,700
- Ding Dingding. 
 - Look!

290
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,400
What have you done?

291
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,000
My girlfriend used your lipstick.

292
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,700
Her mouth is swollen!

293
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,800
She'll break up with me.

294
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,600
You... You used it, too.

295
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,700
The lipstick!

296
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,600
- Thankfully, I haven't tried it. 
 - It's serious.

297
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,200
What's going on?

298
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,700
I didn't get to use it.

299
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,400
Where did you get them?

300
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,700
You are blemishing the image of our department.

301
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,300
Leave me alone. I'm busy.

302
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,600
What are you looking for?

303
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
A delivery package.

304
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,100
The cleaner must have taken it.

305
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I don't care about your little hobby.

306
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,700
But you haven't handed in the assignment. Can you root through the trash later?

307
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,300
The performance last week was great. Can I take two days off?

308
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,200
Be humble in victory, will you?

309
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
The competition is fierce.

310
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
Besides, I know you can do better.

311
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Do you know that you're receiving more criticism?

312
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Controversy will bring us more topics.

313
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,000
- It's a good thing. 
 - It's not!

314
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,300
The negative comments drive many new fans away.

315
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,700
What did they say?

316
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,300
It goes like...

317
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,100
Let me take a look.

318
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,000
It says what is this mess?

319
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,500
It's a waste of time. I'll quit.

320
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,000
The illustrator's previous work is trash.

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
This is way beyond her level.

322
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
She must have ghostwriters. It can't be true.

323
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,900
- This one says it's about a real event... 
 - That's enough. Stop it.

324
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,100
If I lose my new fans because of these slanders, then they are not real fans.

325
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,300
But this person is commenting using different accounts.

326
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
Light Chaser Rescue is about to fall off the chart.

327
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,200
Rankings bring you traffic.

328
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,700
How do you know it's the same person?

329
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,300
I worked on it. They are from the same IP.

330
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Found it. See?

331
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,000
Do you remember one of my fans sent me a box of lipsticks?

332
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,400
I gave them away. Those who used them had allergies.

333
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,900
Is it from the same guy?

334
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,400
Very likely.

335
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll work on it.

336
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,600
As for the assignment, wait for my return.

337
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,600
Really?

338
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Is this some new excuse to slack off?

339
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,600
You can ask around yourself!

340
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,700
Our teammates' wives want me dead!

341
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,600
Even if we catch him, the police can't do anything.

342
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,300
It won't work.

343
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,300
I must deliver a message.

344
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,600
You could be anonymous on the internet.

345
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
But that doesn't give you the right to slander people.

346
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,100
Now he's playing tricks over the internet.

347
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,600
Okay. I'll teach him a lesson in real life.

348
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm telling you!  Exposure is what they fear the most.

349
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,500
Who are we? We are light chasers.

350
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll expose him.

351
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,900
I'll go with you.

352
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,800
Are you stupid?

353
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Why would someone use an authentic address?

354
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
This place is far too remote to be a fake address.

355
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Guess you're the stupid one.

356
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,500
Are you making the whole thing up?

357
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,800
You may leave at any time. Bye.

358
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Xuanxuan?

359
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,800
Why are you running away from me?

360
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,300
Stop!

361
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,500
Xuanxuan, stop!

362
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,300
Hold on! Xuanxuan.

363
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
Xuanxuan.

364
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,340
Xuanxuan, did you send me the lipsticks?

365
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,020
That's right.

366
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,320
You slandered me online.

367
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,099
So what?

368
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,720
Why did you do that?

369
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,359
I mean you no offense.

370
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,020
I hate you. That's all.

371
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,499
I thought we were friends.

372
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:19,899
We were.

373
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:24,000
We used to be friends when we were going against Ma Baoming.

374
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,379
But now, I don't think you deserve what you have now.

375
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,519
This is envy.

376
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,520
But sending counterfeit lipsticks

377
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,099
and posting negative reviews, these are so vicious.

378
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:41,360
Can't you accept the success of others?

379
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,819
We shared similar backgrounds.

380
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:50,220
I've been working hard over the years. Even harder than she has.

381
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,899
Why?

382
00:23:51,899 --> 00:23:56,540
Why could she get what I dream of out of good luck?

383
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,699
Even when she went to jump off a building,

384
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:01,460
she said she was doing it for our good.

385
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:04,360
In the end, she got more compensation than anyone else.

386
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,879
Xuanxuan, listen to me. That's because of Luo Ben.

387
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,939
Go on!

388
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:11,820
Now you're speechless.

389
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,620
I don't know how to explain it.

390
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,579
I don't think you can at all!

391
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,999
Luck won't come to you for no reason.

392
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,300
Besides, it's the viewers that judge the quality of her work.

393
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,160
It's not up to you.

394
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,019
You can close the page if you don't like her.

395
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,419
You don't have to see it. This is not necessary.

396
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:33,939
Who are you?

397
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,139
It's none of your business.

398
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,619
I'm her boss.

399
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,680
She got her luck because of me.

400
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,939
I'm telling you! I will make her a big shot.

401
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,599
Her work will be popular all over the country.

402
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,320
By that time, turning off the page won't work for you.

403
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,579
Because everyone will talk about her and admire her work.

404
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,119
What's so good about her?

405
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,700
That's not for you to judge.

406
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,159
Dingding, let's go.

407
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:36,259
Hello, Light Chaser Rescue.

408
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:37,839
 This is Fire Service Squadron.

409
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,440
 There is an overboard accident.

410
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,499
 We need your assistance. Please head to the A1 area for rescue.

411
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,899
Copy.

412
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,079
Wukong, our water rescue equipment is out of date.

413
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,980
Searching and salvaging by hand is so inefficient.

414
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,499
Stop complaining.

415
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:19,960
Captain improved this hook based on his water rescue experience.

416
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,459
It looks insignificant.

417
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:25,460
But our team has recovered dozens of bodies with it.

418
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,760
Attention.

419
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,480
We've arrived at the target area. Search carefully.

420
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,459
Solid copy.

421
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,160
Hang tight.

422
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,799
Wukong. Nine o'clock.

423
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:47,499
To the right.

424
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:48,859
Copy.

425
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:58,020
What is that?

426
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,700
Target located.

427
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,439
Is it that severe?

428
00:27:09,439 --> 00:27:11,360
Even pregnant women don't puke badly like that.

429
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,119
You were just like him on your first mission.

430
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,740
Stop making fun of him.

431
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,300
Me? When was that?

432
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,840
That's a lie!

433
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,740
Are you okay?

434
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,060
Just get used to it.

435
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,379
Thanks, Peng.

436
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,640
Ms. Ding, I've booked the seat for you.

437
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,499
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

438
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,519
- Time to go. 
 -  Bye-bye.

439
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,320
- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.

440
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,300
The ascenders are broken.

441
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,560
What's up?

442
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,720
I heard that you puked after your first water rescue mission.

443
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,239
Who told her?

444
00:28:07,239 --> 00:28:08,840
Who was it?

445
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,260
- Is it you? 
 - It must be you!

446
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,839
Do you know that I'm the main rescuer this time!

447
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,060
And I did a great job.

448
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:24,460
 Of course. I'm calling to congratulate you on becoming a major rescuer.

449
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,379
 I'll treat you to dinner.

450
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,559
You, treat me?

451
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:32,979
Instant noodles of a new flavor?

452
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,279
Do you want it or not? Just say it.

453
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,760
I even booked seats for us.

454
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,979
Hold on.

455
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:40,699
Booking seats? That sounds ceremonious.

456
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:42,880
I'm in! Send me the address.

457
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,539
Don't despise me.

458
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,620
Pigs might fly!

459
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,120
Ding Dingding will treat me to dinner!

460
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,660
Shut up! Leave your car and get a cab.

461
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,199
Bring a bottle of wine. Hurry up.

462
00:28:53,199 --> 00:28:55,600
Are you serious? You're not a good drinker.

463
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,560
It's on me.

464
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,960
Pick whatever you want.

465
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,579
Take your time.

466
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,639
What do you think of this one?

467
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,379
Looks good.

468
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,819
There it is.

469
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,799
What a waste!

470
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,879
Ms. Ding, is this necessary?

471
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:46,760
Is this some kind of trick?

472
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:53,060
Ruan told me stress reactions might give you flashbacks later.

473
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:56,339
This is hair of the dog.

474
00:29:56,339 --> 00:29:59,240
It's psychotherapy, I guess.

475
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,000
If you could stay creative when illustrating,

476
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,520
our department would be much better.

477
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,100
I'm serious.

478
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,960
You must face what you're afraid of.

479
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,700
Take a closer look at the seafood.

480
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,479
Feel it.

481
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,940
It's not nauseous, is it?

482
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,180
Hold on. Are you puking again?

483
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,419
Come on.

484
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,819
- Use the bathroom. 
 - Got you!

485
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,740
- Here. 
 - You're a psycho!

486
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,439
Thank you for spending so much on this therapy, Ms. Ding.

487
00:30:37,439 --> 00:30:38,880
You're welcome.

488
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:46,259
No, why does your wine look like it has been mixed with water?

489
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:47,959
Is it a fake?

490
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,080
Why do you always say that the wine I gave you is fake?

491
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,119
It's just you. Every time it's like drinking fake wine.

492
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,019
Examine your own faults first.

493
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:57,319
- It's not about the wine. Okay? 
 - Hold on.

494
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,579
Look at that.

495
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:00,760
The color looks subtle.

496
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,920
That proves you don't know about wines.

497
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,739
- Here. Just eat. 
 - I think...

498
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,620
Eat, so you won't comment.

499
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,279
Ms. Ding. Hurry up.

500
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,399
It will be midnight when you get home if you keep dawdling.

501
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:31,880
I know. Turn around and go.

502
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,540
Move.

503
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,220
It must be my illusion.

504
00:32:36,439 --> 00:32:38,980
I'm telling you. Don't ask for leave.

505
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,440
I'll dock your pay if you ask for leave.

506
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,039
What's wrong with you?

507
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:51,400
 I heard that girls will feel better when they receive gifts.

508
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,580
Yan.

509
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,080
Auntie.

510
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,439
Are you at home this weekend?

511
00:34:17,439 --> 00:34:19,119
I want to have a meal at your place.

512
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,439
Of course!

513
00:34:20,439 --> 00:34:21,679
It's your home, too.

514
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,160
Come back anytime you want.

515
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,880
 Honey, come over.

516
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,319
Yan will come back.

517
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:28,880
See what she likes to eat.

518
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,619
Sure.

519
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,319
Yan, I'll have my husband make you a feast.

520
00:34:35,319 --> 00:34:36,799
 All right?

521
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:37,980
Don't bother.

522
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,200
Just make it simple.

523
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,660
No way!

524
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,800
Usually, you are so busy at work and don’t eat any nutritious food.

525
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:45,940
Nutrition matters!

526
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,879
- We're on it. 
 - That's right.

527
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,860
Auntie.

528
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,880
I'd like to bring a friend with me.

529
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,140
Is that okay?

530
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,519
A friend?

531
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:01,360
Boyfriend?

532
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,780
 Yan will come back with her boyfriend!

533
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,779
- Get prepared! 
 - I get it.

534
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:08,880
Okay, Yan. It's a deal.

535
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,400
See you this weekend.

536
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,120
Sure. Bye-bye.

537
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,840
I bought some gifts.

538
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,959
I hope your auntie likes them.

539
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:39,459
As long as the gifts are from you, they'll like them.

540
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:42,079
We're there to visit them. It's not about gifts.

541
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,039
But they matter.

542
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:46,639
They show my sincerity.

543
00:35:51,379 --> 00:35:52,560
You're using it!

544
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,060
Of course!

545
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,980
That's the first gift I got from you.

546
00:35:57,699 --> 00:35:59,480
Sounds like I'm stingy.

547
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,180
Not at all.

548
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,680
Don't send out gifts easily.

549
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,379
It's a perfect gift.

550
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,380
It matches your camel ornament.

551
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,219
I like it.

552
00:36:10,219 --> 00:36:12,379
Thank you, Dr. Zhan.

553
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,540
Coming!

554
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:21,519
- Yan. 
 - Auntie.

555
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,320
- Come in. 
 - Auntie.

556
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,860
Come on, get in.

557
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,940
This is Luo Ben.

558
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,319
Where's your husband?

559
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:28,260
Coming.

560
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,099
Hello.

561
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,959
It's all right. I can handle it.

562
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,279
- Thank you so much. 
 - No need to bring gifts.

563
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:36,340
- It is you! Mr. Luo! 
 - Yes.

564
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,740
- Sir. 
 - I made a bet with him.

565
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,740
He owes me 30 yuan!

566
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,820
You're a miser.

567
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,500
Thank you for trusting me.

568
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,860
Come in, please.

569
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,660
- This way. 
 -  Come on.

570
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,860
Take a seat. Hurry.

571
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,299
Looks great.

572
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,440
Did you choose it for me?

573
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,999
He did.

574
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,279
I'm not good at this.

575
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,019
It's good for him!

576
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:08,979
Good at picking gifts and selecting a girlfriend!

577
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:11,280
He's got what it takes.

578
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,240
Yan.

579
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,739
Well, if your mom,

580
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:27,459
my elder sister were still alive,

581
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:31,180
I'm sure she'd be glad that you have a good boyfriend.

582
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,060
How happy she would be.

583
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:44,199
Be sure to come often.

584
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,780
I know you are busy.

585
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,419
You can drop by to have meals with us.

586
00:37:53,419 --> 00:37:58,559
By the way, when will you get married?

587
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,939
It's too soon!

588
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:06,499
You can bring it up if he doesn't!

589
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,040
It's all right.

590
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,939
Lunch is ready! Come over.

591
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:13,979
- Coming. 
 - Hurry.

592
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,660
- Come on. 
 - Here. Hurry up.

593
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,440
Take your seat. There.

594
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,660
- Sit down. 
 -  Thanks.

595
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:24,119
I'll drink with you.

596
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:27,180
- Sure! 
 - Thank you!

597
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,199
- Here. 
 - All right.

598
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,899
You are good at cooking!

599
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,080
They look delicious!

600
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,759
- You are welcome to my house. 
 - Thank you!

601
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:35,239
Good to see you back.

602
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,479
- Welcome! 
 - Thanks.

603
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:38,900

604
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,380
Should we change the dressing for Bed 38?

605
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,979
38.

606
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:42,980

607
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,679
Morning.

608
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:46,799
- Right, No. 38. 
 - Ruoxi.

609
00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:47,919
Divide them up.

610
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:49,440
I thought you bought them for me!

611
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,120
It's so nice for Dr. Zhan! She buys us snacks!

612
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,339
- Come over. 
 - She's in a good mood.

613
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,919
Hurry up.

614
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:00,439
Good morning.

615
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,540
Did Dr. Zhan take the wrong medicine?

616
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,960
She never took the initiative to greet us before.

617
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,140
She must be in love!

618
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,779
How do you know?

619
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:19,599
She's young and talented, living life to the fullest.

620
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,880
Love is the only thing that could change her.

621
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,619
It's so good of her. I want a romantic relationship!

622
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:27,699
You?

623
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,879
Get rid of your social anxiety first!

624
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:32,020
I don't have that!

625
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,860
We should talk to him.

626
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:35,560
Have you had breakfast?

627
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,940
- Yeah. 
 - I have.

628
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,739
Zhan Yan, you look different today.

629
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:43,779
Get prepared. Time to make rounds.

630
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,379
- Yeah. 
 - Sure.

631
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,199
What happened to Dr. Zhan?

632
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,599
Did she receive some kind of stimulation?

633
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,180
Hurry up.

634
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,800

635
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,460
You're back!

636
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,380
Where is Grandma Qin?

637
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,560
It's been a few days.

638
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,719
Something came up at home, I guess.

639
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,960
Brief me on the recent cases.

640
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,699
There are only two cases left unattended.

641
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,279
Legal assistance.

642
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,219
All right. I'll take them.

643
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:42,659
What's up?

644
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:44,279
I'm under Gao Junchi's leadership now.

645
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:46,299
He gave out the order.

646
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,560
Did you see the message yesterday?

647
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,599
I'm telling you.

648
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,680
He's our brother. Don't bring it up.

649
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,079
That's not a big deal. He doesn't mind it at all.

650
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,019
Cut it off.

651
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:12,359
He's here.

652
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:18,560
His sunglasses...

653
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:21,180
Hey, man!

654
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,380
What's up?

655
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,440
We're waiting for you.

656
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,119
Is that so?

657
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,919
You just touched a body. I don't want to touch it.

658
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:32,920
I don't mind it!

659
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,520
We'll all become dead bodies one day.

660
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,180
What? Are you immortal?

661
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,439
It's unlucky. Have a little compassion.

662
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:39,359
Fine.

663
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,800
I wish that you'll never need others' help.

664
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,540
That's right. I don't help others.

665
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,380
And I don't need help.

666
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,019
- That is... 
 - Cut it off. He's joking.

667
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:50,760
Get your bike out. It's been a while.

668
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,379
Can you keep up?

669
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,780
Don't make excuses if you fall behind.

670
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,180
Just go.

671
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,580
That's enough.

672
00:42:41,539 --> 00:42:44,140
Slow down, Li Jian.

673
00:42:46,179 --> 00:42:49,340
Wait for us, Li Jian! You two!

674
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:07,990

675
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,150
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

676
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:24,700
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

677
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:32,670
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

678
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,450
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

679
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:47,320
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

680
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:55,270
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

681
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:02,720
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

682
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:10,020
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

683
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:18,750
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

684
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:25,000
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

685
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:33,770
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

686
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:41,250
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

687
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,170
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

688
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:48,900
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

689
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,570
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

690
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,250
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

691
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,970
♫  I can't fly  ♫

692
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,670
♫  But I can look up  ♫

693
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:11,600
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
