1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,060

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,870
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:18,114
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:22,026
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,474
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:36,144
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,360
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,596
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:48,530
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,510
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,560
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,260
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:08,860
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,610
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:22,240
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,390
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,060
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,990

19
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,990

20
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,710
Are you okay?

21
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,690
You put the bag in the microwave.

22
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:59,660
I forgot.

23
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,440
You forgot?

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,149
You just moved here?

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,830
Do you live across the hall?

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,676
You tell me.

27
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:12,270
It's quite a coincidence.

28
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,246
That's a crazy coincidence.

29
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:17,129
Wait!

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,880
The building office says the new tenant is a rescue worker who's conscious of fire safety.

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,309
That's why I didn't come over to check.

32
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,750
I didn't expect you to...

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,570
I think it's a mistake.

34
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,609
A mistake?

35
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:35,930
Don't you know not to use elevators when there's a fire?

36
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,250
I... I was in a hurry.

37
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,190
Besides, this is my house not yours. Why should I listen to you?

38
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,753
Fine.

39
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:47,535
I'll complain to the office about your landlord unless you move out.

40
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,170
Well played!

41
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,589
Tell me what you want to do.

42
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,729
You can live here if you want.

43
00:02:54,729 --> 00:02:57,921
But you have to learn about fire safety.

44
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:00,037
All right. I know.

45
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:08,194
Sis.

46
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:18,170
Mr. Luo, I'm sorry.

47
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,529
We haven't had a chance to give the new tenant the safety manual.

48
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:23,950
Please be kind and stop complaining.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,745
We'll correct it until you're satisfied.

50
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:28,230
What are you talking about?

51
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,330
I don't eat people.

52
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,225
Yeah.

53
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,531
Mr. Luo, I believe the renter across the hall has realized her mistake.

54
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,446
Please forgive her.

55
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:43,189
Here. Give them those.

56
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,042
Just in case.

57
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,442
 That's how it is.

58
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,050
 So he's not going to complain about me?

59
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,550
 No.

60
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,830
Thank you.

61
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,730

62
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,109
That's so scary.

63
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,249
If it happened in the comic universe,

64
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:28,390
there'd be a relationship between Luo Ben and me.

65
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,894
Why?

66
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,738
It's obvious.

67
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,089
He helped Ma Baoming screw me over.

68
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:37,892
Then I saved his sister in the earthquake.

69
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,660
He helped me recover some of my losses.

70
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,050
Now I take this money and live across from him.

71
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,206
Who knows what will happen?

72
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,818
Don't eat too much junk food.

73
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:50,090
I'm about to try to learn how to cook.

74
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,221
You just used an oven and you called the police.

75
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:55,428
Learn your safety manual first.

76
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,181
Sis, why are you on his side?

77
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:02,250
You just moved out. What are you going to do?

78
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,150
What can I do? Keep doing comics.

79
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,370
I can't do anything else and I don't like them.

80
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,000
Lately, I've got a creative block. I don't know what to paint.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,089
- Go out to clear your head. 
 - I can't go out anymore.

82
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,450
There was an earthquake when I went for a walk last time.

83
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,174
I lost my job. More than that, I met Zhou Mingming.

84
00:05:26,174 --> 00:05:28,469
By the way, Sis. You have a lot of ideas.

85
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,846
Help me out there.

86
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,949
Don't you like superheroes? Draw one yourself.

87
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:41,090
Draw a superhero?

88
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,197
That's a good idea.

89
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:45,589
Why didn't I think of that?

90
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:50,550
Look!  There are Hulk, Spider-Man, and Captain America abroad.

91
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,238
There's one around with us, Light Chaser Rescue Team.

92
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:03,401
Sis, if you don't want me to paint them, I'll try another.

93
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:07,030
It's your work. No concern for my feelings.

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,190
Then I'll probably go to the rescue team more often.

95
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,265
Will you be unhappy?

96
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,309
You can do what you like. Why should I be unhappy?

97
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,602
Yan, you're so nice.

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,900

99
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,200

100
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,170
Zhan Yan is here. Zhan Yan.

101
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,229
Waiting for me?

102
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:47,689
There's big trouble. We're really upset.

103
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:49,766
Now we need your decision.

104
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:53,150
- Let me tell you. 
 - Slow down. The sky is not falling.

105
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:54,850
Is it confirmed?

106
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,692
I saw it in the hospital office.

107
00:06:56,692 --> 00:07:00,564
Cai Yuxiao, his team was nominated as the Advanced Disaster Rescue Team.

108
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,178
The meeting will vote on it this afternoon.

109
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:05,090
We started rescue when we were first on the scene.

110
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,089
For the golden 72 hours, three days and three nights,

111
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,310
Zhan Yan barely slept a wink.

112
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,989
We're not convinced if we can't share the honor.

113
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:16,929
Right. We worked hard as they did. The honor also belongs to us.

114
00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:19,102
All right. I got it.

115
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:21,130
Get back to work first.

116
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:23,269
Get out.

117
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,749
Go.

118
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,486

119
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,220
What is Zhan Yan thinking about?

120
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,109
She's not going to give it to Cai Yuxiao for saving face.

121
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:49,989
Yeah.

122
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:51,889
How could Zhan Yan do that this time?

123
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,789
Don't worry. This is not who Zhan Yan is.

124
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:56,977
That's strange.

125
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,750

126
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,150
Come in.

127
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:15,950
Dean, I have to examine my mistake with you.

128
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,170
Come on, Dr. Zhan. You're always bold and straight.

129
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,449
Tell me what it is.

130
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,780
The hospital wants to give the advanced spot to Team 2.

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,449
I'm responsible for that.

132
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:35,320
It's the hospital's decision.

133
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,521
What's your responsibility?

134
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,410
As head of Team 1, when I was back,

135
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,429
I didn't update you and the hospital party committee in time.

136
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,789
As a result, the hospital didn't know about our work.

137
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:48,949
This is my responsibility.

138
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,250
So, I made a report about our work in the disaster area.

139
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,106
Please review it.

140
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,110
I also hope the hospital can judge our work objectively.

141
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,870
If we fit the criteria, please give us the honor.

142
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,509
But there's only one Advance placement.

143
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,073
Well, that's your job, Dean.

144
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,690
Dean, it's not my personal honor but my whole team's.

145
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,965
So, I'll try to fight for it.

146
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,120
 You can do it.

147
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:34,429
 Come on.

148
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:41,682
 Good.

149
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,230
 Hold on. Your turn.

150
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,209
 Higher. Here.

151
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,230
 40.

152
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,030
 Hold on.

153
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,349
 Okay.

154
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,969
 - One more. 
 - Yes.

155
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,518
What's up?

156
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,869
Mingming!

157
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,721
Mingming, you're reliable.

158
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:45,110
Not at all. The least I could do.

159
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,010
Then you should do that more often.

160
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,789
If there's a chance.

161
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:54,129
Senior Falcon, honestly, I'm here to make opportunities.

162
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,510
I think Light Chaser is awesome.

163
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,392
I'd like to join it.

164
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,949
Bu... Buddies, can he?

165
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,297
- Nice equipment. 
 - Cool.

166
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,506
 Good equipment.

167
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,530
 - Great. 
 - Yeah.

168
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,209
Uncle, why not?

169
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:15,029
It's not funny to participate in public interest rescue.

170
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:17,929
I'm not kidding. I'm very serious.

171
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:20,269
Do your parents know about this?

172
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,909
I've grown up now. Look, I'm a big girl.

173
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,510
I've even moved out. They don't need to know it.

174
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,349
Dingding, we do life-saving work.

175
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:33,329
Every detail is a matter of life and death.

176
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:38,090
It needs excellent rescue skills, a strong body, and a strong sense of responsibility.

177
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,610
You're new to these. How can you?

178
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,370
Uncle, don't worry.

179
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,469
I can learn from scratch. I'm not afraid of hard work.

180
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,510
Okay.

181
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:52,490
Let me ask you. Why do you want to join Light Chaser?

182
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,465
I admit, it isn't entirely unselfish.

183
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:00,150
But can't you assign me a position that's not so tough?

184
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,630
You're not in it yet. But you start picking.

185
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,130
Look at you.

186
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,766
Uncle.

187
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,230
Uncle.

188
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:16,994
Actually, it's Sis that asked me to come.

189
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,578
Yan.

190
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:24,089
Yan told you to?

191
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,390
How's she doing? Is she fine?

192
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,249
She's doing well. Don't worry, Uncle.

193
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:33,189
Well, here's the thing.

194
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:36,370
My new house almost caught on fire the other day.

195
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,410
Sis was worried about me.

196
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,809
She asked me to learn some safety.

197
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:44,329
I just figured... you got professionals and ready safety here.

198
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:45,669
That's great, right?

199
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,110
Safety?

200
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,217
Dingding, if you just want to master some basic safety,

201
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,969
I can teach you right now.

202
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:55,909
No need to join Light Chaser.

203
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,449
I want in because I'm trying to learn

204
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:02,390
more and more professional rescue knowledge.

205
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:07,510
Besides, Uncle, I also want to do something for the public interest.

206
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:13,209
Well, in that case, I can always come to tell you about Sis. Okay?

207
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,809
You're quiet. I'll take that as a yes.

208
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,290
Thank you, Uncle. I'm leaving.

209
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:21,769
I won't eat the apple. Bye.

210
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,400
Trust me. I'll speak well of you later.

211
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Thank you.

212
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,900
What are you doing here?

213
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
What's that? You can come but I can't?

214
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,700
Well, Zhou Mingming wants to join the rescue team.

215
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm taking him to see Qingshan.

216
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,600
He can't join.

217
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
He has a character problem.

218
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,000
No.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He just gave us all this equipment.

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
He's a good boy.

221
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Hear that?

222
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,100
Light Chaser is a nonprofit organization.

223
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,400
We can't yield to capitalists.

224
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,000
If you're really generous, just leave them here.

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,800
If they're just for trade, get out of here with them.

226
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,100
No.

227
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,900
We'll talk later if he leaves or not.

228
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,600
But the equipment can't leave.

229
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,800
He's not right for rescue.

230
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,500
He faints at the sight of blood. He can't even save himself.

231
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,100
You're not in charge. It's not up to you.

232
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,400
I'm a part of the rescue team now. I have the right to object.

233
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,600
Wh... Wh... What?

234
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,800
You also joined the rescue team?

235
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,900
Senior Falcon, she's selfish.

236
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,100
She wanted to run away when she was in Fengxi.

237
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,500
- You know what? She didn't care... 
 - Say it again!

238
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,700
Fire her. See? She's violent.

239
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,100
- Who's selfish? 
 - It's dangerous to let her in.

240
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,400
Stop!

241
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,500
What are you two doing?

242
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,400
Do you think I'm not here?

243
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,300
- She started it. 
 - Shut up!

244
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,400
It's not child's play. Don't bring up the past.

245
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Let me tell you.

246
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,600
No one is perfect.

247
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Take our members in the rescue team as examples!

248
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,500
Everyone has merits and demerits.

249
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,400
Well, if the cap fits, wear it.

250
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,700
If you two want to join the rescue team, remember this rule:

251
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,200
friendship first.

252
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,000
No more fighting.

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,200
Or neither of you can stay.

254
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,400
If you two understand what I'm saying, just nod your heads.

255
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,600
That's right.

256
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Come on, shake on it.

257
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,400
Dr. Zhan. Dr. Cai. Congratulations!

258
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,900
You're great!

259
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,000
Thank you all.

260
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,300
Well, break it up.

261
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,970
Get to work.

262
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,170

263
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,300
Congratulations!

264
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,110
I heard that you went for it with the dean.

265
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,800
Nothing personal.

266
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,600
I'm just being realistic.

267
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,800
I understand.

268
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,300
I know your personality.

269
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,500
That's good.

270
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,000
The dean went for another spot.

271
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,800
Everyone's efforts were not in vain.

272
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
When it's time to vote the associate chief physician,

273
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,600
I didn't think you'd think like that.

274
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,100
I'm convinced if I lose to you.

275
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, we agreed it was a fair fight, you can do your best.

276
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Okay.

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,200
Don't cry if I win.

278
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,800
Did you see me cry?

279
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,700
No, not really.

280
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
Cheers!

281
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Zhan Yan, thank you for winning honor back to our team.

282
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,300
Our heads can be held high now.

283
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,800
Zhan Yan.

284
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
This is for you.

285
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,600
You all deserve it.

286
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
Thank you, Zhan Yan.

287
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,000
The family of the patient in Bed 13, that lawyer, you should buy him coffee.

288
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
Why?

289
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,800
The day you took off, Dean Qiu came to do rounds, it was he that defended you.

290
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,600
We got our honor back. He's a part of it.

291
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,900
- He did help with this. 
 - Yes.

292
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,500
- This is on me. 
 - Okay, Dr. Zhan.

293
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,300
I heard you got an Advanced placement.

294
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Congratulations!

295
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,800
That's why I bought you coffee. Thank you.

296
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,100
If you're talking about me speaking for you in the ward last time, that was Luo Yuan's idea.

297
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,900
I was just conveying it for her.

298
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,000
Well, thank you for doing that.

299
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,800
You do pay your debts.

300
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,400
So do you.

301
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,500
Nice.

302
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,020

303
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,200
It's raining.

304
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,000
It's heavy.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
Go. Slowly.

306
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,660

307
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
Do you like it that much?

308
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
You have to wait for it in the rain.

309
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,700
I thought you said Luo Yuan liked it.

310
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm just paying my debts.

311
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,700
The rain is over. Take me to the bus stop out front.

312
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,400
It's so kind of you to buy Luo Yuan snacks in the rain.

313
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,000
Anyway, I should take you home.

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,200
Or Luo Yuan will yell at me.

315
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,500
Turns out you're afraid I'll ruin your image as a good brother in her mind.

316
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,500
My image as a good brother is solid.

317
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,000
But I think, I can change my image as a bad lawyer.

318
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,200
Since when did you care what people think?

319
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,700
I didn't care about it before.

320
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,000
 Yes, please.

321
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,100
Some soft music.

322
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,600
 Okay, here's some soft music for you.

323
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,700
The other company is in debt.

324
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,000
As the guarantor, if we're responsible for repaying the loan,

325
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,600
we'd have serious financial trouble.

326
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,800
So, you did a great job.

327
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,000
That's why we won the case. I owe you one.

328
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,600
Not at all, Chairman Fang.

329
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,900
I just did what a lawyer should do.

330
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,200
If you're talking about favors, it should be me that owes you one.

331
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,500
Did you forget I broke your motorcycle when I was in the earthquake area?

332
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,700
You didn't ask me to pay for it.

333
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,000
It seems that you're also good at talking.

334
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,500
We should talk more often.

335
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,200
Then I'm looking forward to working with you further.

336
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,300
No problem.

337
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,200
Chairman, a phone call for you.

338
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Excuse me.

339
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,000
Lansheng, what's up?

340
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,500
What?

341
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,800
Okay. I'll be right there.

342
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
My child is missing.

343
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,900
 Jie!

344
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,300
 Jie!

345
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,600
Back to the break room.

346
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,000
Got it.

347
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,000
Jie.

348
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,700
It's my fault.

349
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,900
Why did I fall asleep?

350
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,900
He ran away. I don't know where he went.

351
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,600
What if... What if he's in any danger...

352
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,400
Don't scare yourself.

353
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
I've already called the police. Jie will be fine.

354
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
No, I have to find him.

355
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,700
- Lansheng. 
 - I have to find him.

356
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,400
Manager, let me see the drone video.

357
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,900
Stop.

358
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,400
Zoom in.

359
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,100
Look! A kid's balloon.

360
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,200
He must still be on the field.

361
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,300
Keep looking for him. I'll go out and check.

362
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay.

363
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,500
 The wind is three to four meters per second from the southeast today.

364
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,100
 That means blowing from the northwest at six to eight meters per second.

365
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,500
 The security camera has the kid's last disappearance in 16 minutes ago.

366
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,100

367
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,500
Jie! Jie!

368
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,020
Jie! Jie!

369
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,960

370
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,100
Chairman Fang, I may have found Jie.

371
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Jie!

372
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,300
- Jie! 
 - Chairman Fang.

373
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,200
Be careful.

374
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Chairman Fang, Jie may have fallen.

375
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,000
We bought this place for developing it.

376
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
For security reasons, there's always a net.

377
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Uh... We... We don't know how a kid could come in.

378
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,900
Let me tell you... If anything happens to my child, I'll never let you go.

379
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,400
- Chairman Fang. 
 - Uh... Sorry.

380
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,300
Now, we should first figure out if the kid has fallen.

381
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,000
We've called the fire department.

382
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,600
Chairman Fang, I'd suggest you seek assistance from Light Chaser Rescue Team.

383
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,600
They have a professional rope team that can go directly to the cave.

384
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,200
- Okay. 
 - Fine.

385
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,000
All right.

386
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,300
- Jie. 
 - It's fine.

387
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,300
Hello, it's Light Chaser Rescue Team.

388
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,300
 I'm out of the hospital. I know a good noodle restaurant.

389
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:53,000
 I was just passing by your station. Want to eat with me?

390
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
 I'm out on a mission.

391
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,900
 It's okay. I have nothing to do anyway.

392
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,400
 I'll wait for you here.

393
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,100
 I don't know when I'll be done.

394
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,100
 Don't wait for me.

395
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,160

396
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,980
- Is this the spot? 
 - Yes.

397
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,500
Okay.

398
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,000
Captain, the cave is 15 meters deep.

399
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,800
15 meters, so deep.

400
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,900
Mr. Fang, after our evaluation and judgment,

401
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,800
we decided to carry out this rescue mission with Light Chaser Rescue Team.

402
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Then it's the fastest and the success rate is great.

403
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,800
Chairman Fang, I was once part of rescue missions of Light Chaser Rescue Team.

404
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,700
I believe them. Please trust them.

405
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,600
Captain Qingshan, I don't know about rescue.

406
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,800
But you must save my child, please.

407
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,400
We're trying to find a way.

408
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
This hole is 15 meters deep.

409
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,100
But there's a net inside it.

410
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,600
It's in disrepair and it's not tight, but it still acts as a buffer.

411
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,300
Okay.

412
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Don't worry, Chairman Fang.

413
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,800
- How? Is it tight? 
 - Yeah.

414
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,500
Okay.

415
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,600
You must be careful.

416
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,000
Save the kid as soon as possible.

417
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,800
Yes.

418
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,100
All right, put it on.

419
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,880

420
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,900
It's open.

421
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,200
Okay.

422
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,100
Be careful.

423
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,400
Go.

424
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
Go.

425
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,600
Here. Get ready. One, two, go.

426
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,500
One, two, go.

427
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,200
Up. One, two, go.

428
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Up.

429
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Here, come on.

430
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,000
Up.

431
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,400
Up.

432
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,200
Jie!

433
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,200
Hold it. Come on!

434
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,700
Go that way. The safe zone.

435
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,000
- Slowly. 
 - Here, easy.

436
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,300
 Drop it. Let's go.

437
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,900
 Here, watch out!

438
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,500
- Come on, stretcher. 
 - Jie!

439
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,000
 - How is it? 
 - It's okay.

440
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,300
 - Hurry. 
 - Thank you.

441
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,600
 - Be careful. 
 - Oxygen!

442
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,400
 Hurry.

443
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
Quickly! Go! Be careful.

444
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
 Go!

445
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
Xiong Fei isn't up yet.

446
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,600
Go.

447
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,300
Drag the rope.

448
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,000
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm okay.

449
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,200
 Bye, Brother Hai.

450
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,500
 - Slowly. 
  - Oaky.

451
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
 Be careful.

452
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,200
 - Bye. 
 -All right.

453
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,600
 See you tomorrow, Brother Hai.

454
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,700
 - Get to bed early. 
 - Okay.

455
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,100
 - Easy. 
 - Okay.

456
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,300
 - Brother Hai, I'm leaving. 
 - All right.

457
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,000
Be careful.

458
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,800
 Bye, Brother Hai.

459
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Little girl.

460
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
Are you here to get a delivery?

461
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,800
Looking for someone?

462
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Who are you looking for?

463
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,300
Look!  We're off duty.

464
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
Maybe you should try again tomorrow.

465
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,000

466
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,200
 I know a good noodle restaurant.

467
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,900
 I was just passing by your station.

468
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,800
 Want to eat with me?

469
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,980

470
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,800
You're still here so late.

471
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,300
I'll take you home.

472
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,200
Don't come to me anymore.

473
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,700
You know your brother doesn't want us to see each other.

474
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,600
 He is always paranoid.

475
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,600
 He thinks I want to be in love with you.

476
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,800
 You don't think so, do you?

477
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,200
No.

478
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,300
Do you think that restaurant is still open?

479
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,200
Have a taste. Just taste...

480
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,600
Let's take it easy, okay?

481
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,900
What do you want to eat?

482
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,900

483
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,000
I'll eat liver noodles.

484
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,700
Okay, I'll order it.

485
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,500
Buddy, two bowls of liver noodles.

486
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,600
 - Okay. 
 - One with chili.

487
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,500
 - One without chili. 
 - Okay, wait a moment.

488
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
 I'll be home soon.

489
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,300
 Don't disturb me.

490
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,500
Hold on. One moment.

491
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
This one without chili is for you.

492
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
You just got out of surgery. Don't eat spicy food.

493
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,900
You like vinegar, too?

494
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Any more?

495
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
All right. Enough.

496
00:34:19,692 --> 00:34:22,218

497
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,200
Go. I'll take you home.

498
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,000
Get on.

499
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,800
Hold on.

500
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,100
Yuan!

501
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,500
Where did you go?

502
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,700
Why are you back so late?

503
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,000
 Brother, you're still awake?

504
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,400
You hung up when I called you.

505
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Do you know it's dangerous for a girl to be out alone so late?

506
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,900
If you had gotten back any later, I'd have called the police.

507
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,900
 Brother, when will you find me a sister-in-law?

508
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,800
Where's this coming from?

509
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,000
Yuan.

510
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,434
Hey?

511
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,200
Is she in a rebellious phase?

512
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,700
Thank you, Grandma Qin.

513
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
- Thank you, Lawyer Luo. 
 - You're welcome.

514
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,200
Good for you.

515
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,800
So, you're the lifesaver for the Fang Family.

516
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,600
Who else but you should be the legal counsel of Fangqin Group?

517
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,100
Chairman Fang didn't mention that.

518
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,600
Chairman Fang owed you a big one.

519
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,200
It's a matter of time before he repays it.

520
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,600
We can't get a contract with favors alone.

521
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,800
I know.

522
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,600
However, people are always sentimental.

523
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,200
The current condition reminds me of the first case we took.

524
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,200
Was I stupid back then?

525
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,100
I thought hard work paid off.

526
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,100
I thought I could succeed if I worked hard.

527
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,800
In fact, everything happens in the right place and at the right time.

528
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,400
Sometimes, luck is also a part of strength.

529
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,200
I heard so much about your glorious deeds from He and Gao Junchi.

530
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,500
They liked your efforts and persistence.

531
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,300
You were always the first one in and the last one out.

532
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,710
You always crouched downstairs, eating instant noodles and researching.

533
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,600
I remember you faced the most famous lawyer in the industry

534
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,100
when you took the first case.

535
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,200
Everyone thought you couldn't win.

536
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,000
The client even asked He to replace you.

537
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,200
Gao Junchi was ready to take it.

538
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,600
But you convinced He with your efforts.

539
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,500
You got the evidence and won the case.

540
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:37,738
As a result, I had a problem with Gao Junchi.

541
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,100
Honestly, the reason that I chose to work with you between you and Gao Junchi

542
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,700
was because I thought you had so much potential.

543
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,300
How? I didn't let you down. Right?

544
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,400
Of course not. Even better than I expected.

545
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,400
That's all for today's training.

546
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,300
Dismissed.

547
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,900
Dude, your wife is here.

548
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,000
- Take Peng home? 
 - Hello.

549
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,600
- Honey.  Why are you here? 
 - I'm here to see Captain Ruan.

550
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,300
Well, for what? Come on. Go home.

551
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,900
Let go! Don't stop me!

552
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,500
You brat! Did you do something bad again?

553
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,100
Have some water.

554
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,600
I've always supported him no matter what he did all these years.

555
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,700
However,

556
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
he doesn't care about me or our family anymore.

557
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,200
I'd rather leave him.

558
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,700
 I understand.

559
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,400
 Is it because Peng always is always going on missions lately?

560
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,900
 You know what, I'll talk to Peng.

561
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,600
Peng, your wife is really angry.

562
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,500
You should take it seriously.

563
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,000
But you should ask her to take it easy

564
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,400
about helping the kid with homework.

565
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,300
A Peking University professor may not be able

566
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,500
to tutor his kid to get into Peking University. Right?

567
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,200
All right. Don't listen.

568
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,800
Come on. Go.

569
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,500
Let me hear a bit more.

570
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,100
Take care.

571
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,300
 He broke my heart.

572
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,700
Look.

573
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,300
Comfort her.

574
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,900
In fact, I'm not selfish.

575
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:06,400
I just don't understand what makes a man

576
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,400
who can't take care of his family save others.

577
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,700
You're right.

578
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
The principle of our rescue team is:

579
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,500
getting support from the family before joining rescues.

580
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,100
You know what, we'll force Peng to take a month off

581
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
and keep him away from rescues or training.

582
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,200
No. I don't mean that.

583
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,500
I don't want to quit.

584
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,200
Peng, about this, you must obey the organization.

585
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,400
I'm sorry. I forgot our wedding anniversary.

586
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,600
And I'm sorry. I didn't take on more things at home.

587
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,300
But now that we are married, I won't allow you to talk about divorce.

588
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,200
This is the lipstick that you didn't get on the livestream platform.

589
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,800
I bought the last one in the mall.

590
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,200
It's expensive in the mall.

591
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,400
It's nothing.

592
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,700
I'll buy it no matter how costly it is if you like it.

593
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:05,000

594
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:16,282
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

595
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,800
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

596
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:31,200
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

597
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,300
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

598
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:46,100
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

599
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,200
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

600
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,300
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

601
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,800
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

602
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:17,600
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

603
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:23,800
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

604
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:32,600
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

605
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:40,200
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

606
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,000
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

607
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,700
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

608
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,400
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

609
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,100
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

610
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,900
♫  I can't fly  ♫

611
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,700
♫  But I can look up  ♫

612
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:10,000
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
