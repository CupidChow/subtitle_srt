00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,800
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,750
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,450
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:35,720
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,470
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,470
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,980

20
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,970

21
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,320

22
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,310

23
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,280

24
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,859
 I definitely can't.

25
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:29,380
 Yeah, though I want to.

26
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,299
Mr. Luo, Chairman Fang is here.

27
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,810
- Mr. Luo. 
 - Chairman Fang.

28
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,199
You don't need to bother to come. Please sit.

29
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,860
Thank you.

30
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,079
You're busy with both work and rescue,

31
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,219
but I'm not that occupied compared with you.

32
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,760
So, I came for you.

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,860
You're kidding, Chairman Fang. You must be very busy, too.

34
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,140
You've come all this way. There must be a case.

35
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,119
Exactly. I've got a case for you.

36
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,960
And a difficult one, too.

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,700
Luo Ben?

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,980
Why is he here?

39
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,599
- Is that Luo Ben? 
 - Yes.

40
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,240
Last month there were rumors of layoffs at the factory.

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,659
It seems to be true now.

42
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,380
They've even got legal counsel.

43
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,719
If there are no orders for the factory, they won't keep us idle.

44
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,980
I just don't know how many people will be laid off.

45
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,420
And I don't know who.

46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,020
Be prepared.

47
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,480
All right.

48
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,219
No wild guesses. Time to work.

49
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:01,039
Let's go.

50
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,699
Go.

51
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,000

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,540
The HR couldn't handle me, so they asked you to deal with it.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,159
Listen!  It's impossible to make me sign an agreement.

54
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,382
I will not.

55
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:31,180
Qiu Zhigang, a workshop handler aged 32,

56
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,095
has been employed for two years and was recommended to the factory through the community.

57
00:04:35,095 --> 00:04:38,279
I don't think I need to say any more than that.

58
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:45,340
Don't get me wrong.

59
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,879
Nobody cares about your past.

60
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,959
Layoffs are just normal market behaviors.

61
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,080
You said you were not at fault, while you didn't contribute either.

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,020
You're a loner and not a team player.

63
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,080
You're not competitive on equal terms.

64
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,580
So please, do understand.

65
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,399
If you sign the agreement now, you'll receive generous compensation.

66
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,179
 Luo Ben! Luo Ben!

67
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:10,859
 Luo Ben!

68
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,600
Xiong Fei!

69
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,060
Come to see the captain?

70
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,660
Yan has bought you some fruit.

71
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,399
Thank you.

72
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,751
Xiong Fei, how is it?

73
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:28,200
Can the new members adapt to physical training now?

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,320
Not bad.

75
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,139
Much better than the previous group with Luo Ben and Mingming.

76
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,520
Youngsters focus on physical exercises now.

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,100
Their physical fitness is quite improved.

78
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,200
Zhigang, calm down.

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,719
Shut up! Bring Director Xu here!

80
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,640
Cross my name off the layoff list.

81
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,740
- Or... I'll jump from here. 
 - Okay! Okay!

82
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,339
I'll take her down when I jump.

83
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,499
Qiu Zhigang, what are you doing? Leave there!

84
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:55,380
Qiu Zhigang! What are you doing?

85
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,400
Get out of there.

86
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,840
- You're out of your mind? Leave! 
 - The building is too high.

87
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,230
I'm afraid we can't make it.

88
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,966
We should call the police. I'll get the rope.

89
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,200
Okay.

90
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,319
Zhigang, a job isn't worth it. Are you mad?

91
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,559
Talk to the director about your requests.

92
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:12,000
It's just a job.

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,580
Chen Xing.

94
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,420
What?

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,730
Okay. Get prepared. I'm coming.

96
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,210
What's up?

97
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,379
Someone at the auto parts factory is about to jump off a building.

98
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:30,159
- It's not far from here. Get over there. 
 - Okay.

99
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:32,080
I'll go with him.

100
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,620
All right.

101
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,500
Qiu Zhigang, calm down. You're committing a crime.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,580
Shut up! Or I'll throw you down right now!

103
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,579
Calm down, Qiu Zhigang! Calm down!

104
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,379
It's just a job!

105
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,060
Think about your parents!

106
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,340
- Ariel. 
 - Luo Ben.

107
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,619
- Stay there. 
 - Don't move.

108
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,700
Or I'll throw her off.

109
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:01,260
You're Qiu Zhigang, right?

110
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,380
I know the layoff is unacceptable for you for a short while.

111
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,579
Release her, and we'll talk about your requests.

112
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,720
Say yes to my conditions first, or I'll throw her off.

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,419
Qiu Zhigang,

114
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,220
the job is important for you now.

115
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,699
But do you really want to commit a crime for a job once again?

116
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:25,320
Hurry up.

117
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,720
You two get the anchor point, and you two the rescue rope.

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,445
- Roger that! 
 - Roger that!

119
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,030

120
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,699
- Zhigang! 
 - Zhigang, keep calm!

121
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:08,660
It's not that bad. Get down from there.

122
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,600
It's not a big deal.

123
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,220
She's Luo Ben's colleague.

124
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,340
Ariel.

125
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,130
Xiong Fei, be quick. Follow me.

126
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,980
-  I'll tell you on the way. 
 - Okay.

127
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,799
Step back! Step back!

128
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,780
Zhigang, get down from there.

129
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,939
We want to help you.

130
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,880
But don't hurt the woman.

131
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,340
I'm the legal counsel.

132
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,780
I can talk to you on behalf of Director Fang.

133
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,259
How about this?

134
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,280
Release her. Take me as your hostage.

135
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,780
Don't move. Don't play tricks.

136
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,799
I promise. I'll play no tricks.

137
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,879
I just want to take her place.

138
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't come closer.

139
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,380
I've told you. I won't resist.

140
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:06,340
 Stop it.

141
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,699
Do you...

142
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,480
Do you think it's okay?

143
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,840
Don't play any tricks.

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,700
I won't.

145
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,079
The guy has been employed for two years.

146
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,260
He's quite hard-working. But he has a bad character.

147
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,790
Here.

148
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,939
Work with me, and find a chance to inform Luo Ben.

149
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,400
Okay.

150
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,259
Release her.

151
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:57,280
Come closer.

152
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,700
All right.

153
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,419
Look!  The guy has taken the girl's place.

154
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,100
Yes.

155
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:18,979
Ariel, get out of here.

156
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,600
I'll talk to him.

157
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,340
I believe that he wants to get things right.

158
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,679
Ariel, here.

159
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,859
Take it easy. Here.

160
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:40,319
Qiu Zhigang, you've already had two years' work experience.

161
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:46,239
Even though you're fired, you can find a job elsewhere.

162
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:51,860
But if you jump off now, you won't have a chance to prove yourself.

163
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,439
Trust me.

164
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:55,559
I'm a lawyer.

165
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:00,300
If you find yourself treated unfairly, I can help you.

166
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,039
You're on their side.

167
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,459
You won't help me.

168
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,400
Company layoffs are not aimed at you personally.

169
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,939
And it's not because of your criminal past.

170
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:15,380
If you think it's unfair, I'll find a lawyer for you.

171
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,820
You can defend your rights by legal means,

172
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,960
instead of doing something illegal, as you are now.

173
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,080
Qiu Zhigang, answer me.

174
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,159
Have you ever thought of your parents?

175
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,700
I saw your CV just now.

176
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,259
Your parents are in their 70s.

177
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:03,520
If anything happens to you, who can they rely on in the future?

178
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,160
You were in prison, and they worried about you.

179
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,499
Do you really want to break their hearts once again?

180
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:31,940
Is it okay?

181
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,299
- It seems so. 
 - Yes.

182
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,620
Mom and Dad, I'm sorry.

183
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,459
Qiu Zhigang, trust me.

184
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:51,459
Come in, and we'll meet your demands as much as we can.

185
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,940
Come in first.

186
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,419
Are you willing to help me?

187
00:12:57,419 --> 00:12:59,459
Of course.

188
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:00,939
Come.

189
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,100
Qiu Zhigang!

190
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,520
 Help me!

191
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,860
 Help!

192
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,060
 Qiu Zhigang!

193
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,120
 Catch him!

194
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:20,279
 Catch Zhigang!

195
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,619
 Help!

196
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,639
Hold my hand.

197
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:33,360
Help! Help!

198
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,739
I'll pull you in.

199
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,840
Hold on.

200
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,979
Hold my hand. Don't move. Hold on.

201
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,419
Help! Xiong Fei, come down!

202
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,079
Help me!

203
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,920
 Hold on. Hold on, Zhigang.

204
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,440
I can't hold on much longer!

205
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,500
I don't want to die.

206
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,639
 Hold on for a while.

207
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,639
Hold on to me!

208
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,580
Help!

209
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,539
Xiong Fei!

210
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,060
I can't hold on!

211
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:45,659
Zhigang!

212
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,815
Are you all right?

213
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,800
Thank you.

214
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,660
How can you do that?

215
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,539
What a fool!

216
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,460
Can you recognize me?

217
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:04,460
Thank you, buddy. Come with us.

218
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,959
Xiong Fei.

219
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,020
Good job, Xiong Fei.

220
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,100
Stay safe.

221
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,540
Retrieve the rope.

222
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,899
Luo Ben!

223
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:34,680
Are you okay?

224
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,019
I was scared to death just now.

225
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,140
I'm okay.

226
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,339
I'll send you home.

227
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,720
- Luo Ben. 
 - Shen Ruoxi, I'm here for Qiu Zhigang.

228
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
Turn right ahead. He's in ward seven.

229
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,540
Thank you.

230
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,100
Zhan Yan.

231
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,439
Luo Ben's here. He's visiting Qiu Zhigang.

232
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:19,639
Have you given Xu Zirui the data he wanted?

233
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,079
I'll give it to him right away.

234
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,719
Well... I think he must have come to see you.

235
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,139
Don't go far away.

236
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:26,759
Don't go far. I'm leaving.

237
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,539
Don't go far.

238
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,700
The company will give the worker compensation to you.

239
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,480
You can sign the agreement if there's no other problem.

240
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:02,299
Look at this.

241
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:07,799
It's the employment training form from the community.

242
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:11,299
Fill it out and give it to the community, and they'll help you.

243
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,300
Thanks.

244
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,020
People should look forward.

245
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,700
Let bygones be bygones.

246
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,939
You've made mistakes and you've lost something.

247
00:18:21,939 --> 00:18:25,720
You should cherish your future even more.

248
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,059
It's easy to say, but hard to achieve.

249
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,859
Hello, sister.

250
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:42,920
 When are you coming back?

251
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,879
Just closed the stall. In half an hour.

252
00:18:45,879 --> 00:18:48,939
I'd like to talk to you when you get back.

253
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,159
Okay.

254
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:53,880
I've got something to tell you, too.

255
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,160
 Okay, bye.

256
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,299
Dad!

257
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,719
- You're back. 
 - Hello.

258
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:08,400
Don't stand still.

259
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,320
Wash your hands for dinner. We've got a guest.

260
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,300
Okay.

261
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,779
Go.

262
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,719
Come. Sit down.

263
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,259
Who's that?

264
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:29,939
 Your sister's boyfriend.

265
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:31,620
Is he?

266
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,499
Hurry up.

267
00:19:40,499 --> 00:19:42,479
Come.

268
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,499
Sit down.

269
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:45,639
Fei, let me introduce him.

270
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:46,880
This is Su Zhan.

271
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,419
And this is my brother, Xiong Fei.

272
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,219
- Nice to meet you. 
 - I've heard a lot about you.

273
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:55,799
Xiong Fei, you said you wanted to tell me something. What is it?

274
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,880
Nothing. Forget it.

275
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,000
Cheers!

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,780
Here.

277
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,399
- To Mr. and Mrs. Xiong. 
 - Thank you.

278
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:08,279
Thank you. Thank you.

279
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,500

280
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:19,900
Hello.

281
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,920
 This is Ariel. Would you be willing to meet with me?

282
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,499
I've broken up with Luo Ben.

283
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:38,460
You're more straightforward than I expected.

284
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,460
Right. I did ask you out because of him.

285
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,120
You were there yesterday.

286
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,959
What's your opinion?

287
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,700
About what?

288
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,560
About Luo Ben's saving me.

289
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,459
What do you think of it?

290
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,500
Since we became partners,

291
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,520
all the colleagues in our company have thought we would make a great couple.

292
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,740
Of course, that's also what I thought.

293
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,340
Until you appeared.

294
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,740
Do you think it's because of me that you didn't become a couple?

295
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,759
When the landslide occurred in Fengxi, he took a great risk in saving you.

296
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,460
I've never seen him care about anyone like that except for Luo Yuan.

297
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,339
But now I know, that he also cares about me like that.

298
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,179
So I won't give up this time.

299
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

300
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:39,780
He would have done the same even if you were Shen Ruoxi.

301
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,759
No. Quite the contrary.

302
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,560
I can see it very clearly.

303
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,060
Instead, you're deluding yourself.

304
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,760
Luo Ben and you are out of the question.

305
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,759
The matter of Luo Ben and your father is a dead end that you will never be able to untie.

306
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,060
You'd better let go and give best wishes instead of torturing each other.

307
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,840
Luo Ben told you that?

308
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,840
Without your father's mistake back then, his parents wouldn't have died at all.

309
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,460
And he wouldn't have been sent to the orphanage.

310
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,639
Fortunately, he was adopted by Luo Yuan's parents, who treated him like family.

311
00:22:21,459 --> 00:22:25,819
But what if someone else had adopted him?

312
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,200
He was only seven years old.

313
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,300
What would his life be like? Have you ever thought about it?

314
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,620
I don't care about your business with him.

315
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,019
And don't bother meddling in my business with him.

316
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,620
If you two could be together, you wouldn't have come to me today.

317
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,520
Since you've broken up, don't bother each other.

318
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
President, I want to join the counterpart support.

319
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,520
You do?

320
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,019
The support plan is for the young doctors who have just graduated.

321
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:17,039
Certainly, it's better that an experienced doctor like you to come.

322
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,239
But the hospital needs you, too.

323
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:24,600
Being a doctor is to save lives.

324
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,459
In fact, I had this idea a long time ago.

325
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:29,360
I just happened to come across the chance.

326
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:33,940
There are many outstanding doctors here,

327
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,540
such as Xiaolu, Zirui, and Cong Zhou.

328
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,219
They have long since grown up, and are ready to take on their own.

329
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:46,120
It's time to release some stress and opportunities for young doctors,

330
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,280
so that they can grow through practice.

331
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,020
Young doctors should have more sense of responsibility and mission.

332
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,980
I support you in doing more good.

333
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,739
Thank you, Dean.

334
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,040
Here, wedding candies.

335
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,019
For all of you.

336
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:04,920
You're welcome.

337
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,239
What about me? Hurry.

338
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:07,199
Give it to Cong.

339
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:09,079
Cong, eat the wedding candies.

340
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:10,639
You're such a lucky man.

341
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:11,380
Thank you.

342
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,559
I'm off to work. Okay.

343
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,680
Congrats!

344
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,999
Thank you.

345
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,699
Thank you. Here, candies.

346
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:20,680
What happened?

347
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,639
For all of you.

348
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:24,279
What are you doing?

349
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,419
Xiaolu and you?

350
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,300
You... I didn't have your wedding drink. It's all of a sudden.

351
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,340
Just got our marriage license today.

352
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,520
Take your candies first. Wait for my wedding invitation.

353
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,739
Good.

354
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:39,339
What a man. He married Xiaolu secretly.

355
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,999
You don't know how hard it was.

356
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:43,599
I won't be able to court any other woman for the rest of my life.

357
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,680
You want to court other women?

358
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,959
Xiaolu and Zirui, congratulations.

359
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:51,000
Thank you.

360
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,379
When is your wedding? Western or Chinese?

361
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,539
 You seem more eager than any of us.

362
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,019
 We plan to discuss this with our parents.

363
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:02,139
 Xiaolu, be sure to find a good wedding company.

364
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:04,159
 Enjoy the wedding!

365
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,460
The earthquake has occurred on an island in South Asia.

366
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,120
They sent a request for help to international rescue organizations.

367
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,899
International Rescue is an expression of humanity.

368
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:18,540
The Light Chaser Rescue Team should join the rescue.

369
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,680
I know.

370
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:23,379
You've prepared for the international rescue for all these years.

371
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Right.

372
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,280
The Light Chaser has been established for more than ten years.

373
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,080
It has the ability to join the international rescue.

374
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:39,339
But I can't continue to lead you guys.

375
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,240
Qingshan, Light Chaser Rescue can't do it without you,

376
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,560
no matter in the past, in the present, or in the future.

377
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,579
I know. I don't want to leave you, either.

378
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:03,599
But now my fitness, ability, and everything else are not enough to be the team leader.

379
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,379
I will only be a drag to everyone if I continue to lead the team.

380
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,780
I've found myself a successor.

381
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,159
- Luo Ben. 
 - Right.

382
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:26,380
He's young, competent, daring, knowledgeable, and forward-looking.

383
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,519
Luo Ben's good.

384
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,139
He has strong personal ability and prestige among team members, too.

385
00:26:33,139 --> 00:26:36,080
But he didn't join the latest missions.

386
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,019
He has some feeling about me personally.

387
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,299
I think we should give the members a little time, and take it slowly.

388
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,119
I have watched him grow step by step

389
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,259
into a caring and responsible rescuer.

390
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:59,320
If he quits the team for me,

391
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:02,600
it will be a pity.

392
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:13,819
Hello, Chairman. Hello, President Ming.

393
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:16,760
As of today, the film is in post-production.

394
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,240
Don't worry, Mom. I'll keep my eye on it.

395
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,779
You also contributed to bringing the project back from the dead to the present.

396
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,459
I know that.

397
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:28,380
I've contributed nothing, Mom. I was just working for you.

398
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,679
Since when have you become modest?

399
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,100
You'll never know.

400
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,239
Mom, actually it's all because of Dingding's encouragement.

401
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,680
I did it to prove...

402
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,885
You need to prove nothing.

403
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:41,239
Staying away from her is the best way to prove yourself.

404
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,480
- Chairman. 
 - Qi, the bank loan will be approved in two days.

405
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,160
As soon as the money arrives, pay it to the post-production company.

406
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,360
Okay.

407
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,759
Keep an eye on him.

408
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,680
Don't let him see that Ding Dingding again.

409
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,019
Okay.

410
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,895
Nice shot.

411
00:28:10,895 --> 00:28:12,415
Well played.

412
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:14,859
Mingming, you're here?

413
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,700
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

414
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,920
Come to play.

415
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,320
Why is Ding Dingding not here?

416
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,840
Busy with creations.

417
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,339
We're drinking and singing, while she's drawing comics about rescue.

418
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,020
What a great mind above all of ours.

419
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,340
You're just jealous.

420
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,620
What's wrong? Haven't seen you for days.

421
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,499
Did you miss me?

422
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,519
Your favorite drink.

423
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,860
Thank you.

424
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,899
Mingming, don't keep the fun to yourself.

425
00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:40,899
You must share the joy with us.

426
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:41,799
All right.

427
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,520
Then I'll introduce you to the rescue team.

428
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,659
Be my subordinates. Reluctantly, but I'll lead you.

429
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,659
Stop it. It's a thankless job.

430
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,419
But we can play outdoors.

431
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,900
Climbing, camping, field parties...

432
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,420
What about these?

433
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,820
Okay.

434
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,960
You want to go outdoors?

435
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,800
You can fall into a ditch on a bike.

436
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,100
The blame is on the gears.

437
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,260
Gears.

438
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,939
Any recommendations for outdoor gear shops?

439
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:14,939
I really have.

440
00:29:14,939 --> 00:29:17,100
A teammate of mine is the owner of an outdoor gear shop.

441
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,580
I'll give you his WeChat.

442
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,999
Really?

443
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,260
Dapeng?

444
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,899
That's him.

445
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,039
Quite good.

446
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,120
Looks professional.

447
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,700
One, two, three, four, five.

448
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,160
Exactly five of us.

449
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,380
Hey, Aiqi. What's the matter?

450
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,220
What?

451
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:56,460
Mom!

452
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,700
What happened?

453
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,479
The bank rejected our loan application.

454
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:14,639
The chairman fainted from anxiety.

455
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:16,660
Why did the bank reject us?

456
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,379
I've asked Manager Zhang of the bank.

457
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:23,499
He said that after a reassessment, the loan to us was considered too risky.

458
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:25,120
What about other banks?

459
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,539
Our company has been Manager Zhang's client for a long time.

460
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,840
If even he won't approve our loan,

461
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,840
other banks will be even less likely to do so.

462
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,039
Okay.

463
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,599
Go back now. I'm staying here.

464
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,520
Mingming, is that you?

465
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,200
Mom.

466
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:54,279
Help me to the office.

467
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:58,279
Mom, the doctor said that you need to rest.

468
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:02,320
How can I rest when the company is in such big trouble?

469
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Qiqi, contact Manager Zhang.

470
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,680
I'll talk to him about the loan by myself.

471
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,159
Mom!

472
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,240
Mom, I'll talk to Manager Zhang.

473
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,540
Be at ease. I'll try to solve the loan.

474
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,660
Just rest easy now.

475
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:29,999
Chairman, Mingming can do this.

476
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,560
Mom, you can count on me.

477
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,919
Good boy.

478
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,339
This is fine. This one is retractable.

479
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,199
Mingming called me. Don't worry.

480
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:54,459
A friend of his is a friend of mine.

481
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:57,099
Feel free to look around. Let me know what you need.

482
00:31:57,099 --> 00:31:58,839
My wife will find you everything.

483
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:00,059
- Okay. 
 - Good.

484
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,539
Look at the beautiful color.

485
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:04,480
It's not a big shop.

486
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,080
A franchise store? What's the brand?

487
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,360
Yes. Not a big shop,

488
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,399
but with everything you need for the outdoors.

489
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,639
I can only recommend something to my friends if I use it myself and find it good.

490
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,020
I don't need a recommendation.

491
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,619
I just want the best, and the most expensive.

492
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:23,640
Good.

493
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,219
Come.

494
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,440
Pick what you like.

495
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,960
Well, then, what if I like everything?

496
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,380
Buy them all, then.

497
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:37,980
Even the best equipment can only be of assistance.

498
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,959
The most important thing is safety awareness.

499
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,660
What are you doing?

500
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,170
Hey, please wrap these up. All of these.

501
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,780
Coming soon.

502
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,779
Do your business properly.

503
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,060
Do you have other colors for this?

504
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,619
I'll go check it.

505
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:58,620
And these...

506
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,479
All of these.

507
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:03,780
Manager Zhang, please listen to me.

508
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,239
We're really just down to this final payment.

509
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:10,620
With this money, our film is sure to be a huge success.

510
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,120
Manager Zhang. Hello.

511
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,959
What about the other two banks?

512
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:26,900
We can delay no more. We must pay the contractor this week.

513
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,470
They're about to stop working.

514
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,805
And they're going to sue us for the breach of contract.

515
00:33:30,805 --> 00:33:32,899
All the materials are in their hands.

516
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:37,019
If it does go that far, the consequences will be unthinkable.

517
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,420
I'll try something else.

518
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,980
What's the matter?

519
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:16,119
Nothing. I just miss you.

520
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,159
Oh my. You're suddenly so affectionate.

521
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,439
I'm not even accustomed to it.

522
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,099
- You're painting? 
 - Or what?

523
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:29,539
My boyfriend didn't ask me out.

524
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:33,339
My bad.

525
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:40,199
When I'm done with this, would you like to take a long trip with me?

526
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:43,479
- Is it a deal? 
 - Deal.

527
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:46,300
I'll think about it, then.

528
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,560
What about Xinjiang?

529
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,540
The fruits there are very sweet. And there's a beautiful view.

530
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,480
You must take photos of me. Okay?

531
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,220
Anywhere you want.

532
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,320
Then I must make a great plan.

533
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,860
Let's take a two-week trip and go to both South and North Xinjiang. All right?

534
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,580
Why are you so good to me?

535
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:08,419
Are you hiding something from me?

536
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:09,960
Nonsense.

537
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,840
I'm hiding nothing from you.

538
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,459
- Nothing? 
 - Nothing.

539
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:16,119
- Really? 
 - Really.

540
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:21,240
I just find it particularly relaxing and happy being with you.

541
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,939
After all, you have such a lovely girlfriend. Right?

542
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,080
Do your work. I'm here with you.

543
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,999
I won't do it unless you kiss me.

544
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:35,119
Once more.

545
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,000
Luo Ben.

546
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,119
Luo Ben.

547
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,600
Ariel.

548
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,279
What a coincidence.

549
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,740
You said you would take me out for exercise, but you never did that.

550
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,699
I had to exercise on my own.

551
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:48,539
Don't say that.

552
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,919
Mind your leg.

553
00:36:50,919 --> 00:36:52,699
You've had surgery.

554
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:54,340
Be at ease.

555
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,200
I'm all good.

556
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,259
By the way, it's for you.

557
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,540
What is it?

558
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,360
A sports watch.

559
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,860
It can detect heart rate, exercise volume, and various body functions.

560
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,260
Suitable for fitness enthusiasts like you.

561
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:13,000
No need for that. Keep it for yourself.

562
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,680
You are training so intensely now that all your body indicators need to be monitored.

563
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,459
Put it on.

564
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,479
I'm good, Ariel. Thank you.

565
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:32,500
After such a long time,

566
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,300
I don't believe that you never knew I liked you.

567
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,800
Ariel.

568
00:37:51,819 --> 00:37:56,340
I've always thought of you as a partner.

569
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:01,339
You really don't feel anything for me?

570
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,439
If I really liked you,

571
00:38:04,439 --> 00:38:08,139
then I wouldn't be able to hide my feelings for you.

572
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:09,760
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,039
I don't have such feelings.

574
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,000
Would our relationship have been different if I had confessed my love to you earlier?

575
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:22,900
Then I would have given you the same answer earlier.

576
00:38:26,879 --> 00:38:28,399
I've got it.

577
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,579
Let's go cycling together.

578
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,440
Okay. Let's go.

579
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
Let's go.

580
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:40,660
- Hurry up. 
 - I'm coming.

581
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,440
 An elderly man was lost near Changshan District, No. 56, Lane 38, Changshan Road.

582
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,519
 The mission has been posted. Please start registration.

583
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,619
 - Wukong. 
 - Snail.

584
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:26,359
 Dapeng.

585
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,980

586
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:40,779
- Here. It's still hot. 
 - Good.

587
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,080
Take it.

588
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,640
- I'm starving. 
 - Here.

589
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,900
- There's more! 
 - Okay.

590
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,979
- Give me one. 
 - We like you more.

591
00:39:46,979 --> 00:39:48,240
All you do is eat?

592
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,419
 Thank you. You're the prettiest.

593
00:39:50,419 --> 00:39:51,410
- May you get prettier. 
 - The prettiest.

594
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,520
Sweet talkers.

595
00:39:52,525 --> 00:39:53,765
I'll take one more, then.

596
00:39:53,765 --> 00:39:55,360
Has any of you seen Luo Ben recently?

597
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,840
He hasn't been here for a while.

598
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,539
- He has not been on the last few rescue missions. 
 - That's true.

599
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,620
Maybe he's busy working, instead of being idle like you guys.

600
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,439
We're not...

601
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,879
Wow, here he is.

602
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,619
Luo Ben, we're talking about you.

603
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,755
You haven't been here for a while. Come and have a bite.

604
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:15,559
It's delicious.

605
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,060
What do you mean by that?

606
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,540
I won't be coming here anymore.

607
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:32,280
Why?

608
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,400
Luo Ben, are you quitting?

609
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,079
Captain, what's wrong?

610
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,920
Why is he quitting?

611
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,260
Yeah, why are you quitting?

612
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,180
Did something happen?

613
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,980
Don't be temperamental. We regard you as our brother.

614
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,620
What's the matter?

615
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,540
You're all my brothers.

616
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,619
And you'll always be.

617
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:12,780
I'll continue to do rescue work, too.

618
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:19,200
But I won't come to Light Chaser Rescue anymore.

619
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,160

620
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,919
What's going on?

621
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,799
There are five million yuan on the card.

622
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,499
Pay the contractor first.

623
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:45,219
I'll find a way to pay the rest.

624
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:47,620
You... Where did you get the money?

625
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,399
Does the chairman know about it?

626
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:51,180
Don't ask.

627
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,619
You must tell me.

628
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:55,270
I have the responsibility to report to the chairman.

629
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,880
- Mingming. 
 - I mortgaged the house.

630
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,979
It's too risky.

631
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,480
If the repayment is late, the bank will take the house.

632
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,260
I know. But there's no other way.

633
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:15,179
Don't tell my mother about this.

634
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,840
Okay.

635
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,200
 Don't use my family as an excuse.

636
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,790
 Fine. Let's drink.

637
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,019
 Here.

638
00:42:39,019 --> 00:42:40,319
How delightful.

639
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:41,679
Yes.

640
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,360
Smells good. The kebabs are ready.

641
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,620
Share them yourselves.

642
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,120
Okay.

643
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,380
Darling, the kebabs.

644
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:56,480
With just a few of us, there's no fun.

645
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,479
What do you want?

646
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,940
Call Zhou Mingming.

647
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:08,319
What? Now?

648
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,139
It's okay. He used to be on call.

649
00:43:12,139 --> 00:43:13,760
Not anymore.

650
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,600
He's doing rescue work even if he's free.

651
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,360
- He'll ignore you. 
 - Right.

652
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,700
Rescue?

653
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,079
That reminds me.

654
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:23,160
He's a rescue team member now.

655
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,519
We can tell him that we're lost in the mountain and we need rescue.

656
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:27,925
- How about that? 
 - You're cheating him?

657
00:43:27,925 --> 00:43:29,810
- How sly you are. 
 - No, you can't do that.

658
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,280
What's wrong with that?

659
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,820
I'll call him.

660
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:46,990

661
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:57,050
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

662
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,300
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

663
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:12,570
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

664
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,450
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

665
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:27,320
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

666
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:35,270
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

667
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:42,520
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

668
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:49,920
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

669
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:58,750
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

670
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:05,000
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

671
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,670
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

672
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:21,250
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

673
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:25,070
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

674
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,800
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

675
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,570
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

676
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:36,250
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

677
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,070
♫  I can't fly  ♫

678
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,770
♫  But I can look up  ♫

679
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:51,400
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
