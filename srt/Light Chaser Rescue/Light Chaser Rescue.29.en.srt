Is school out?

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,530
You haven't been home for three years.

19
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,530
Go home with Mom this time.

20
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,640
Yeah.

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,280
I'll go home.

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,130
Go home.

23
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,970
Mom.

24
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,690
I'm Zhuangzhuang.

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,080
I'm your son.

26

Lanzhi.

27
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,610
He's Zhuangzhuang.

I'm Zhuangzhuang.

29

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,530
No.

31
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,170
He's not.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
Lanzhi,

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,210
you lost your memory.

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,760
He is Zhuangzhuang.

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,810
You saw his picture

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,040
on the hospital's wall, didn't you?

37
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:21,840
Picture?

38
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,530
Yes, Mom.

39
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,880
Look,

40
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,490
I'm Zhuangzhuang.

41
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,250
It's me.

(Cai Yuxiao)

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,130
I'm your son, Mom.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,410
You don't even remember me.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,530
Useless me.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,320
I always forget that you've grown up.

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,320
I'm sorry, Mom…

48
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,810
- Zhuangzhuang.
- That you're ill.

49
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:58,810
Mom,

50
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,370
you're in the hospital now.

51
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,600
Don't worry.

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,090
The doctor will cure you.

53
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,810
You'll be okay.

54
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:07,720
I…

55
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,970
I believe you, Son.

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,280
Luo Ben.

57
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,490
I thank you

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,000
for this.

59
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,410
You take care of your mother.

60
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,970
I have decided to quit my job

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,650
to look after my mother.

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,090
The project in Fengxi,

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,440
Zhan Yan and I both value it.

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,530
Now that she's got the opportunity,

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
I congratulate her.

66
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,160
She's going to Fengxi?

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,000
Have some vegetables.

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,130
Dr. Cai said

69
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,760
he'd quit his job

70
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,410
to look after his parents.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,490
He's worked so hard for so long.

72
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,840
It's a shame that he quit.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,720
What would

74
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,690
your choice be?

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
You have made your
choice already, right?

76
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:34,960
You know?

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,610
If I didn't learn it from Cai Yuxiao,

78
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,400
you'd tell me

79
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,320
when you're in Fengxi, right?

80
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,960
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,850
I didn't make up my mind
at the time.

82
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,560
Then we could have had a discussion,

83
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,730
not like now,

84
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,640
it has become a notification.

85
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,730
This is a very precious

86
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,930
opportunity for me.

87
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:00,810
So you thought

88
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,960
I'd stop you

89
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,880
after you told me?

90
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,200
I don't mean that.

91
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,850
I…

92
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,200
I just wasn't sure

93
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,250
how to tell you this.

94
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,760
Zhan Yan,

95
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,930
I want to live with you.

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,290
I want to be able to see you

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
whenever I miss you.

98
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,690
But in the meantime,

99
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,690
I'll support

100
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,610
your pursuit of career.

101
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,250
A long-distance relationship

102
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,930
won't be a problem

103
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,560
for me.

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,370
It is my fault.

105
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,730
Why did you make the decision

106
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,610
without talking to me?

107
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,050
You really thought

108
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
I'd forbid you?

109
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,520
I see.

110
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,400
My feelings

111
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,080
are only your burden.

112
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,400
It looks like,

113
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,850
as a boyfriend,

114
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,850
I'm not good enough.

115
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,440
All right, let's keep eating.

116
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,370
I'll drive you home after dinner.

117
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,250
See? I told you

118
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,960
to talk to him about it.

119
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,320
You see

120
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,930
how difficult it is now?

121
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,520
No wonder he's mad at you.

122
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,880
You know what's unacceptable

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,370
for men?

124
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,000
What's unacceptable for them

125
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,850
is that women don't value them.

126
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,490
It is my fault.

127
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
But he doesn't have to be so mad.

128
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
You're a single-minded person.

129
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,810
I'm not surprised

130
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,080
that you are inconsiderate.

131
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,490
Am I?

132
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,880
What a dumb question.

133
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,960
You are!

134
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
You're so bad at dealing with
human relations.

135
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,560
What's your suggestion?

136
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,930
Am I supposed to give up?

137
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, that's what I mean.

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,200
Is that really necessary?

139
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,320
He's mad about me not telling him.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,760
He said he'd support me.

141
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,130
And you believed it?

142
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,960
Men don't mean

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,810
what they say.

144
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,490
Just talk to him.

145
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,460
(Resignation Letter Cai Yuxiao)

146
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,930
Yuxiao's left.

147
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,560
And you

148
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,000
will go to Fengxi with Professor Koben.

149
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,200
Two core doctors are gone,

150
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,760
which puts me in a bad situation.

151
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,610
Considering the reality of the hospital,

152
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
I want you to stay.

153
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,520
However,

154
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,730
it is a rare opportunity to participate in

155
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,810
Professor Koben's project.

156
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,370
I hope you take this chance

157
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,640
and learn as much as possible.

158
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,400
I will.

159
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,610
Have you turned over

160
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,640
your duties?

161
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,730
I have.

162
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,050
What about your life?

163
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,730
Will going to Fengxi

164
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,850
cause any problems?

165
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,130
Just tell me.

166
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,370
Maybe the hospital can help.

167
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,320
No problem.

168
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Hello, your package.

169
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,490
OK. Thank you.

170
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,160
Hello, your package.

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,370
OK. Thank you.

172
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,000
Is there an end?

173
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,680
All packages are here?

Y-You bought all these?

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,490
What are you doing?

176
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,250
I'm about to leave.

177
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,250
I bought you

178
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,610
some clothes for the season changes.

179
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,880
You'll be away for years?

180
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,880
I'm not there yet.

181
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,850
I'm not sure.

182
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,090
Alright. I got it.

183
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,880
Thanks anyway.

184
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,640
Anything else?

185
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,250
Can you not act like this?

186
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,040
I will come home whenever I can.

187
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,970
What a happy life I live.

188
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,400
My girlfriend buys me

189
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,520
clothes for all year

190
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,680
before she leaves.

191
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
Can we have a normal conversation?

192
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,250
You're leaving.

193
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,000
What else can I say?

194
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,640
You're home.

195
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,680
Brother.

196
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,280
Why did you buy all these clothes?

197
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:39,800
I didn't.

198
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,000
Zhan Yan did.

199
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,400
You had a fight?

200
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,850
(Zhan Yan,)

201
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,570
(I'll have my
wedding pictures taken tomorrow.)

202
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,160
(Can you come and help me?)

203
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,060
(Luo Yuan)

204
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,850
Yuan,

205
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,450
I may run late.

206
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,280
How about you start without me?

207
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,800
We'll take some more over there.

208
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,130
Look here.

209
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,880
Very good.

210
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,730
You can be more relaxed, lady.

211
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,130
Groom, get closer.

212
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,130
Get closer, yes.

213
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,520
Bend down, yes, yes.

214
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,160
Together.

215
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,450
Good. Let's take this one.

216
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,520
Lower. Yes.

217
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,570
Good.

218
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,450
Smile, lady.

219
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,400
Smile.

220
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
Yes. Good, good.

221
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes. Very good.

222
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,490
Yuan.

223
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
What are you doing here?

224
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,680
Luo Yuan asked me to come.

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,640
Yuan said

226
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,450
that you must be here

227
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,640
when we take the pictures.

228
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:05,730
They will take pictures

229
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,800
of us together.

230
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Groom and bride.

231
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,160
We'll take the second one.

232
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,280
Go.

233
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,130
I see you're not busy.

234
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,330
I thought

235
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
you'd have a lot to pack.

236
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,330
I started packing a long ago.

237
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,330
I'll be there for three years.

238
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
I'll need to take a lot with me.

239
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,680
Is that so?

240
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,520
Well,

241
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,250
I'll certainly see you off.

242
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,880
You don't have to, if you're busy.

243
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:36,970
Many of my colleagues

244
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,210
are going to see me off.

245
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,730
Why didn't you tell Luo Yuan

246
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,880
that you'd go to Fengxi?

247
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,800
She takes you for a good friend.

248
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,210
She can see you off, too.

249
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,190
Luo Yuan is your sister.

250
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,520
Why didn't you tell her

251
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,570
that you've been acting like

252
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,280
you'll break up with me
after knowing I'm going to Fengxi?

253
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,570
You shouldn't keep it from her.

254
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:17,450
Come on.

255
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,920
Closer.

256
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:19,730
Yes.

257
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,450
Head.

258
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,090
Lean towards…

259
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,330
Yes, yes.

260
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,610
Good.

261
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,680
Great. Come on.

262
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,680
Try another pose.

263
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,130
Hey, dresser,

264
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,090
fix the bride's make-up.

265
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,640
Wipe off her sweat.

266
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,000
OK. Good. Good.

267
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,520
Luo Yuan seems very happy.

268
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,610
Yes.

269
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,280
She wants us to have her best wishes.

270
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,730
But she would never have thought

271
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,880
we'd be separated soon.

272
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,610
We won't if you don't want to.

273
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,680
So it's my fault, then?

274
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,160
It is my fault

275
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,610
that I didn't talk to you about it.

276
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,370
But are you sure
you share no responsibility at all?

277
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,330
You did the wrong thing first

278
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,250
and here you're blaming me?

279
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,400
Do we need to draw a timeline?

280
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,640
Don't you make it look like
you're completely innocent.

281
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,490
Don't you change the subject.

282
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,490
I'm talking
about your project in Fengxi.

283
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,730
And I'm talking about your attitude.

284
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,970
What's wrong with my attitude?

285
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,730
You think you have a nice attitude?

286
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,490
Do I not have a nice attitude?

287
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,610
Go get some rest.

288
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,680
Yuan, you look beautiful.

289
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,330
Guys,

290
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,760
please stand in position.

291
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,330
So

292
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
we can save a lot of time.

293
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,330
Go stand in position.

294
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,800
You go.

295
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,400
Go.

296
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,800
Closer.

297
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,610
Yes, get closer, please.

298
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,280
Yes. Good, very good.

299
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,850
Look at me. Look at the camera.

300
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,490
Keep smiling.

301
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Good.

302
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,570
Good.

303
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,250
Change your pose.

304
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,130
Listen,

305
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,520
back to back.

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,680
Back to back.

307
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:09,920
Backs attached.

308
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,130
Good. Hold still.

309
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,330
Smile.

310
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,130
When will you leave?

311
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,250
After their wedding on the 7th.

312
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
Great.

313
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,730
Another pose.

314
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,570
How about

315
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,130
you stand face to face?

316
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,400
Get closer, sir.

317
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,760
A bit closer.

318
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,130
Face to face.

319
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,090
Arm on her waist.

320
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,040
Arm on the lady's waist.

321
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,850
Closer, closer.

322
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,000
Yes, closer.

323
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,520
Good, good. That's it.

324
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,880
Hold still, please.

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,760
Eyes.

326
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,210
Don't be so uptight.

327
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,880
Relax. Smile.

328
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,680
Yes, sweet smiles.

329
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:55,400
Please,

330
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,450
over there.

331
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,210
Good.

332
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,850
Now, look at me.

333
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,250
Smile.

334
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:08,400
Wait a minute.

335
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,490
I'd like them

336
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,810
to be in our pictures, is that okay?

337
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,330
Sure.

338
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,400
Come on. Come over.

339
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,200
You'll be in the pictures together.

340
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,160
Closer.

341
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:18,960
Good.

342
00:17:24,570 --> 00:17:25,240
Good.

343
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,810
Another pose.

344
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,570
Come on.

345
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:42,850
You and Zhan Yan
are having a fight, huh?

346
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,200
It is her fault.

347
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,880
Be the bigger man.

348
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,770
As if you have

349
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,290
much experience.

350
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,680
No, I…

351
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,770
I learned all my experience

352
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,530
with Luo Yuan.

353
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,770
That's more like it.

354
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,610
I only asked for half a day off.

355
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,770
I'll go back to the hospital soon.

356
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,850
I'll take a cab.

357
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,240
He's an idiot.

358
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,570
Don't sulk.

359
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,090
I'm not any better than him.

360
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
I went to see Ding Dingding.

361
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:02,680
Mom,

362
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,480
it's so busy at the company.

363
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:05,960
Your workload is heavy.

364
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,240
Why did you go to see her?

365
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,570
If I hadn't,

366
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,720
you would have gotten married,

367
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,050
no?

368
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,810
No way.

369
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,440
I'd ask for your approval first.

370
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,610
So you did plan to?

371
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,330
I tell you what,

372
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:24,770
I won't allow it.

373
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,330
Why, Mom?

374
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,400
Do you hold any

375
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,330
misunderstanding against her?

376
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,370
Misunderstanding?

377
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,130
She always talks me back.

378
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,810
She's uncultured,

379
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,010
and undereducated.

380
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:33,610
You are the only one

381
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,880
who falls for her.

382
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:36,720
You're attracted

383
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,050
to her face, aren't you?

384
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,920
Yes, she does look pretty.

385
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,370
No, no.

386
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,370
It's true that she makes illogical

387
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
and wild speeches,

388
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,200
but she

389
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,090
has a good heart, Mom.

390
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
Stop saying good things about her.

391
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,400
Listen to me, Mingming.

392
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,440
You're out of her league.

393
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,440
I told you so many times

394
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,610
to date a girl

395
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,090
with good qualities.

396
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,960
A girl with good qualities

397
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,420
has to grow

398
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,680
in a good family.

399
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:05,440
These good qualities

400
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,880
don't develop in one day or two.

401
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,200
Mom,

402
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,880
her parents

403
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,010
are college professors.

404
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,610
And those college professors

405
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,370
raised a girl like her?

406
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,010
Stop. Stop.

407
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,050
Dingding.

408
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,440
Dingding.

409
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,720
What are you doing here?

410
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,050
Why didn't you pick up my call?

411
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:35,880
I was drawing.

412
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,050
I muted my cellphone.

413
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,640
Are you okay?

414
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,200
Why wouldn't I be okay?

415
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,480
I just learned that my mom
spoke to you.

416
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,090
Why didn't you tell me?

417
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,720
Your mom's little trick

418
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,130
couldn't work on me.

419
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,400
I grew up outsmarting

420
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,130
my parents.

421
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,530
She looks down on me now,

422
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,720
but it doesn't mean
she won't change her mind later.

423
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,330
Am I right?

424
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,570
I'm sorry.

425
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,160
I apologize to you on behalf of my mom.

426
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,130
Don't say sorry.

427
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,330
I just adjusted my mindset.

428
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,130
Your apology softened my heart.

429
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,010
And I don't want to be soft-hearted.

430
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,010
Attagirl.

431
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Oh, right.

432
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,330
If your mother ever picks on me again,

433
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,810
I'll give you a hard time,
do you hear me?

434
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,770
Sure.

435
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:15,290
You said it.

436
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Promise?

437
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,290
Promise.

438
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,200
What if you regret it?

439
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,880
Well, you'll give me
a hard time, won't you?

440
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,090
Are you serious?

441
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,090
Yes. Bring it on.

442
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,400
Come on.

443
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,810
Ouch.

444
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,920
Still hasn't arrived.

445
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,330
Are you sure it's today?
What time is it?

446
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,720
No rush.

447
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,640
Maybe it's just the traffic.

448
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,580
Could it be

449
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:44,530
that she doesn't know the way?

450
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,440
I'd better go find her.

451
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,530
Yeah, we'll go with you.

452
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,440
Come on.

453
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,330
Dad.

454
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,880
Mom.

455
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,810
You're home.

456
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,570
Your brother worried

457
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,010
that you didn't know the way home.

458
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,160
How could I forget the way home?

459
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,050
Is everything okay?

460
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,440
Yeah.

461
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,090
Good.

462
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,880
Glad you're home.

463
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,090
Your mom and I

464
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,130
will cook two more dishes.

465
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,370
Don't stand out here.

466
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,010
Xiong Fei,

467
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,130
take your sister home.

468
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,050
Go.

469
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:34,960
Come on.

470
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,400
Get inside.

471
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,370
Sister.

472
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,200
Welcome home.

473
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,850
You're still thin.

474
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,090
Take this.

475
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,880
What are you doing?

476
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,240
I don't need it.

477
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,200
I was abroad for years.

478
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,090
I didn't take good care

479
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,400
of you and our parents.

480
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,200
Now that you're getting married,

481
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,530
this is the least

482
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,720
that your sister can give to you.

483
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,960
Sister, I sell wontons now.

484
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,090
I can provide for the family.

485
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,570
I appreciate your goodwill.

486
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,680
But I won't take the money.

487
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,010
The steamed fish is here.

488
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,370
Here, Mom.

489
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,530
Be careful, it's hot.

490
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,570
Careful.

491
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:32,880
Come on.

492
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,640
Thank you, Mom.

493
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,570
Xiong Fei's getting married.

494
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,050
Xiong Dan's home.

495
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,370
It's double happiness,

496
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,720
double joy

497
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,010
for our family.

498
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,480
Yes.

499
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,130
Today,

500
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,480
we'll have a drink.

501
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,290
I'll fill you up.

502
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,850
Let me. Let me.

503
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,290
Thank you, Dad.

504
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,160
Dad, I didn't know you had this.

505
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,130
When did you buy this?

506
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,850
Your dad bought one
when you were born,

507
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,130
and another bottle
when your brother was born.

508
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,850
Did you?

509
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,720
He said he'd open it

510
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,680
when you got married.

511
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:57,680
You have some, too.

512
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,770
Easy, easy.

513
00:23:59,400 --> 00:23:59,810
Here.

514
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
Happy marriage to Fei,

515
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,090
and a better future to Dan.

516
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:05,610
Great.

517
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,160
Thank you, Dad.

518
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,090
Thank you, Dad, Mom.

519
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,610
- Thank you, Mom.
- Good health to you.

520
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,400
Cheers.

521
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:09,920
Cheers.

522
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,610
Good.

523
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,530
Let me. Let me.

524
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,810
You keep drinking with Dad.

525
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,130
We are bad drinkers.

526
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,480
Your mother sure is.

527
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,480
Pour some for your sister.

528
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,290
A little. Just a little.

529
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,090
We'll take six sets of pictures.

530
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:30,960
Not a small amount.

531
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,530
So

532
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:32,370
you'll keep smiling.

533
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:32,770
Sure.

534
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:34,570
I'll teach you the poses.

535
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,850
Just follow my instructions.

536
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,130
Sir.

537
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,610
Hi.

538
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,810
I'd like to know

539
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,010
if you have saved

540
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,240
our pictures on the computer?

541
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,070
Those pictures?

542
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:44,910
I'm sorry.

543
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,850
Your pictures

544
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:47,860
were to serve

545
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,810
as reference
for the groom and the bride,

546
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,090
so I deleted them.

547
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,330
Sure. No problem.

548
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,720
Wait.

549
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,770
I remember.

550
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,920
The man

551
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:56,880
with you,

552
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,160
he made a copy of every picture

553
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,200
on that day.

554
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,400
You can ask him.

555
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,400
The groom?

556
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,130
No.

557
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,680
The bride's brother.

558
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,860
(Business Management Service Contract)

559
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,130
Any problem with the contract?

560
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,330
No.

561
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,530
I'll print it.

562
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:54,770
What's the matter?

563
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,680
Nothing, but can't we talk?

564
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,160
Talk to someone else.

565
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,370
I'm busy.

566
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,200
Are we bros or not?

567
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
You won't tell me
that you're getting married?

568
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,440
Who's getting married?

569
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,770
How do you explain this?

570
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,370
Nothing to explain.

571
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,530
Won't you defend yourself,

572
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,200
Attorney Luo?

573
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,090
I guess it's happening, huh?

574
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,810
Luckily, I made a copy.

575
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,370
Enough of this.

576
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:31,370
Give me that.

577
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,330
Why so serious?

578
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,370
It's a good thing.

579
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,050
I'm happy for you.

580
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,050
I know you want me
to have the red packet.

581
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,160
But be patient.

582
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,530
You seize the opportunity,

583
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,010
and kill Ai Rui'er's hope
the sooner the better.

584
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:50,680
What are you talking about?

585
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:51,850
Go finish your work.

586
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,680
What's on your mind?

587
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,530
I don't know what my mother

588
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,160
will do with me.

589
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,370
It always intrigues me.

590
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,290
Your mom's like that,

591
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,160
so life mustn't be easy

592
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:27,570
for your dad, right?

593
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,850
My dad has gotten used to her

594
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,240
over the years.

595
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,610
How did your dad

596
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,770
fall in love with your mom?

597
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,370
My mom chased my dad, actually.

598
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:42,480
My mother's family disapproved
their marriage.

599
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,330
Because my dad

600
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,810
was just an insignificant reporter.

601
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,130
A reporter?

602
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,850
Did your dad

603
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,720
learn some illegal transactions,

604
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,440
and helped the police solve the case,

605
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,680
so your mother

606
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:56,480
fell for your dad

607
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,720
and married him?

608
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,130
Your head

609
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,200
is full of wild thoughts.

610
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:00,850
But

611
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,530
your mother really strikes

612
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,240
as a snob.

613
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,530
After they got married

614
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,570
and started up their business,

615
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,610
my dad was busy

616
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,920
covering stories out there.

617
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,530
He'd be away from home for months.

618
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,680
My mom undertook

619
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:16,370
the entire business.

620
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,810
The company

621
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,090
started to make money,

622
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
and then grew bigger and bigger.

623
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,160
My mother sacrificed a lot.

624
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,570
I get it.

625
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,680
Your mother

626
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,570
thinks her success

627
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:30,680
can be copied

628
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,770
after what she lived through.

629
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,480
See?

630
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,960
She has

631
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,740
this idler son like you

632
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,090
in the family.

633
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
She thinks

634
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,720
only a girl as good as herself

635
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,370
can be a match for you.

636
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:46,880
So that

637
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,160
you will achieve something.

638
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:48,960
It looks like

639
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,290
I am out of your league.

640
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:51,850
Don't worry.

641
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
I'm not like my dad.

642
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,920
I will take responsibility,

643
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,050
and I will protect you.

644
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,850
Louder. I didn't hear you.

645
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,920
I said, I will protect you.

646
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,240
Louder.

647
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,770
Come on.

648
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,160
Look at all the people here. Knock it off.

649
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,330
It's fine. Come on.

650
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,050
I said!

651
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,880
I will protect you.

652
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,680
OK. Fine.

653
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,570
Focus on your comic.

654
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,640
What is this?

655
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,480
My boyfriend.

656
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,400
(My Boyfriend)
Is this how I look?

657
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,090
Yeah.

658
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,050
Very handsome.

659
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,880
Redraw me.

660
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,720
You have no clue.

661
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,770
This is abstractionism.

662
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,810
Redraw me. Now.

663
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,010
I won't. Listen to me.

664
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,130
You will hang it on the wall

665
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
and frame it.

666
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,400
You will frame it, do you hear me?

667
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,330
Will you redraw me or not?

668
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:37,680
No, I won't.

669
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,330
Again, will you?

670
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:38,850
I will not.

671
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,290
Come on.

672
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,610
No. You pitch me!

673
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,960
Come on. Redraw me, quickly.

674
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,060
(Happiness)

675
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,050
Look.

676
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,240
Is it in the middle?

677
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,050
Yes.

678
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,160
Everything seems good.

679
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,130
Thank you, Sister.

680
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,200
Not at all.

681
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,330
After you're married,

682
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,640
you'll be nice to your wife.

683
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,330
Trust me, I will.

684
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:06,050
You'd better hurry up

685
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,330
and start to see someone, too.

686
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,370
Well…

687
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,240
What will be will be.

688
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,530
Yuan,

689
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,200
I won't be seeing you

690
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,050
in the morning anymore.

691
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,530
He's coming.

692
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,330
Look.

693
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,050
- Congrats.
- Congrats.

694
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,680
Looks smart.

695
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,610
Best wishes to you.

696
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,240
- Go!
- Go!

697
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,050
- Best wishes to you.
- Thanks.

698
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,160

00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,200
We'll divide into two groups.

874
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,930
Xiong Fei and I, group 1.

875
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,010
Group 2,

876
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Luo Ben, Dapeng.

877
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:29,890
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

878
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,800
It's a deep pit.

879
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,530
We don't know what's down there.

880
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,760
We can't go down there at one go.

881
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:36,410
It'll be segmented descent.

882
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,360
Safety points will

883
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,530
be set along the descent.

884
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,200
Xiong Fei will take the special cordage,

885
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,720
and other necessary equipment.

886
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,760
I will go down first.

887
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,840
You will assist me.

888
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:46,800
Captain,

889
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,970
I have a stronger body.

890
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:48,570
I will go down first.

891
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,360
Captain,

892
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,090
I apply to

893
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,160
pair up with Xiong Fei,

894
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,090
and we'll descend together.

895
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,200
Captain, I…

896
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,160
Stop. Follow my order.

897
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,640
All right.

898
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,240
Go get ready.

899
00:40:58,610 --> 00:40:59,570
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

900
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,050
- Wei.
- Son.

901
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,890
Please save my son!

902
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,970
You must get him out!

903
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,970
We'll do our best.

904
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,320
He is still alive!

905
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,160
OK. OK.

906
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,610
We'll do the best we can.

907
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,320
I promise we will.

908
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,160
Xiong Fei,

909
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,320
I'll go down first.

910
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,160
Son.

911
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,450
Wei.

912
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,490
No. 1 reporting.

913
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,680
I am now 20 meters

914
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:59,450
deep in the pit.

915
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,240
All clear.

916
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,970
No. 2, descend.

917
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,530
Copy.

918
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:07,640
Xiong Fei,

919
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,720
be safe.

920
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:09,970
Luo Yuan is waiting.

921
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,970
Sure.

922
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,840
No. 1 reporting. No. 1 reporting.

923
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,640
We are now

924
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,320
50 meters deep in the pit.

925
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,490
No victim spotted.

926
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,130
Request for further descent.

927
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,090
Affirmative.

928
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,360
