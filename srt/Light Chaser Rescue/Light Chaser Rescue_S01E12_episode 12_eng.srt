2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,790
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,160
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,090
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,410
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,660
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,410
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:43,540
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,410
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,560
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,590
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:02,190
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,890
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:15,560
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,210
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,340
 I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,710
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,070

19
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,900

20
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,528

21
00:01:44,528 --> 00:01:48,785

22
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:50,557

23
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:55,700

24
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,720

25
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:03,680
- Rounds record. Thank you. 
 - Congratulations, Dr. Cai.

26
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,828
- Congratulations, Dr. Cai. 
 - You all know it?

27
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,800
Yan.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,080
Congratulations, Director Cai.

29
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Yan, I think the leaders' decision is just about seniority.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,940
They may think I've been here longer than you.

31
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,780
Don't be modest. Everyone has seen your excellent work.

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,620
You deserve it.

33
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,040
All right. I just got ahead of you.

34
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,250
You follow me.

35
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,370
Don't wait for me. Or I'll outpace you.

36
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,020
I hope you outpace me. Bye.

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,630
 Director Cai.

38
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,220
Zhan Yan, are you all right?

39
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,942
Why shouldn't I be?

40
00:02:46,942 --> 00:02:49,990
You can talk to us if you feel aggrieved.

41
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,600
Am I that kind of sore loser?

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,590
You conceded but you don't like losing.

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,000
-  Then why did you ask? 
 - I...

44
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,700
Keep your mouth shut.

45
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,950
What did I do?

46
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,800
Don't rub it in.

47
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,990
That's for the good of Zhan Yan.

48
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't get through to you.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,990
Did I say something wrong?

50
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,380
Thank you.

51
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,830
Here, coffee.

52
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,770
Okay. Thank you.

53
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,810
Congratulations! Good things come in pairs.

54
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,340
Where is this coming from?

55
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,160
First, you're already the associate chief.

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,280
Second, you're in charge of the meeting on rebuilding Fengxi.

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,430
Zhan Yan is also on the meeting list.

58
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,760
When you're alone with her by then, you should be prepared for it.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,280
When you two come back, you declare that you're not single.

60
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,770
So, it's a double celebration.

61
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,840
You're making up a story. It's not as simple as you say.

62
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,410
Don't play dumb with me.

63
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,320
I'm the only one who knows you and Zhan Yan were in love in college

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,650
in the hospital. Right?

65
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,050
I already got it.

66
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,250
When you two declare that you're in love,

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,470
I must reveal a big secret.

68
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,650
I've been holding it all the time, which is killing me.

69
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,910
You can't wait. You should grab the chance.

70
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,050
Or someone else will take Zhan Yan.

71
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:25,670
Fine. It just takes time. I know what I'm doing.

72
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,700
It can wait?

73
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,770
You're in no rush to get a wife?

74
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,142
Think about it yourself.

75
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:35,990
I have a short temper.

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,890
All right. The guys want to celebrate with you tonight.

77
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,850
I'll organize it.

78
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,610
It's on you.

79
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,650
No problem.

80
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,785
By the way, I got a thing. I'm leaving.

81
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,970
You must ask Zhan Yan to come.

82
00:05:17,414 --> 00:05:18,720
- Welcome. 
 - Yan. Here.

83
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,750
Yan.

84
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,820
Cong Zhou and some other colleagues are here to help me celebrate.

85
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,957
You don't mind, do you?

86
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,510
Today is your day. Don't mind me.

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,660
Okay. Come on.

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,910
You're here.

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,870
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,970
Come on, sit.

91
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,900
This is not my seat.

92
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,610
We're just having dinner together. Don't go there.

93
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,160
- Come on. Sit.  
 - Just sit down.

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,270
Sit down. I'm starving.

95
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,770
Sorry, I'm late.

96
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,160
Feel free to order what you want to eat and drink.

97
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,530
No need to save my money.

98
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,780
- Cool. 
 - A director is really different. Generous.

99
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,000
Nonsense. I didn't mistreat you when I wasn't a director.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,080
I just want you to get a few more promotions.

101
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,410
Then we can have several free meals. Right?

102
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,840
You don't want the meals. You want to ride the director's coattails.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,450
- Whose coattails? 
 - Your coattails.

104
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,580
All right. You two are late. Here.

105
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,010
You must have a drink.

106
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,150
Okay. Here.

107
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,510
Here, Dr. Zhan.

108
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,240
None for Dr. Zhan. I'll drink for her.

109
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,210
You're way too... You're way too partial to her.

110
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,240
Dr. Zhan, it's Director Cai's big day.

111
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,220
You should drink to him.

112
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,320
I've got surgery tomorrow morning. I'll drink juice.

113
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,580
You're not the only one in our hospital.

114
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,370
Just ask Director Cai to change your shift.

115
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,630
No.

116
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,540
It is a party. We must follow the rules.

117
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,770
Dr. Zhan has surgery tomorrow. She can't drink.

118
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,380
You know what, I'm off tomorrow.

119
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,057
I'll drink for her. Drink as much as you want.

120
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:53,300
- How? 
 - Then let's drink to our heart's content.

121
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,390
You said it. Come on, to Director Cai.

122
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,730
Come on!

123
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,210
Here!

124
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,520
Congratulations!

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,740
Thank you all. Thanks.

126
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,860
Director Cai is okay.

127
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,100
Sure, of course.

128
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,160
- You just ride on his coattails. 
 - Come on.

129
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,060
Coattails again!

130
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,310
Why isn't Director Cai back from the bathroom?

131
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,030
Come on, check on him.

132
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,670
Ignore him. Let's drink.

133
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,860
Come on, drink.

134
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,870
- Pour. 
 - To Director Cai.

135
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,170
I'm leaving.

136
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,760
We drink it ourselves. What's the point?

137
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,470
We should toast Director Cai, right?

138
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,942
He'll be back shortly.

139
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,560
Take it easy.

140
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,930
Zhan Yan.

141
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,120
 - You won't drink it up? 
 - No, I can't.

142
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,950
Are you leaving?

143
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,640
I have the first surgery tomorrow morning.

144
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:42,400
Okay. I'll see you out.

145
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,630
They're too crazy.

146
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,200
I know it isn't your scene. Don't mind it.

147
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,450
They're just happy for you.

148
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,700
You always stressed it was a fair fight between us.

149
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,540
The hospital named me the associate chief.

150
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,742
You're not unhappy, are you?

151
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,180
No.

152
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,380
If it was judged by our expertise alone,

153
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,090
I wouldn't be convinced.

154
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,414
All things considered, you're more qualified than I am.

155
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,270
I lost fair and square.

156
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,180
Congratulations. I mean it.

157
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,910
Well, I'm glad you think so.

158
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,610
Make each other better and make progress together.

159
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,170
I think it should be the best state.

160
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,100
What do you think?

161
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,928
Here's the car.

162
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,740
Okay.

163
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,614
Let me get the door.

164
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,357
Go back.

165
00:08:53,357 --> 00:08:55,480
Okay. See you.

166
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,260
Bye.

167
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,285
Dr. Zhan.

168
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,714
What a coincidence! You're also here for the meeting?

169
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:33,910
We're the support unit of the hospitals' reconstruction after the Fengxi earthquake.

170
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,610
What are you doing here?

171
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,980
Fangqin Group donated a batch of medical equipment.

172
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,600
I represent them at the meeting to hand it over.

173
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,120
Captain Qingshan, you're here too.

174
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,740
Lawyer Luo, you're here.

175
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,880
Chairman Fang specifically asked me to express gratitude to you.

176
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,310
For what?

177
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,240
You helped us train the enterprise rescue team.

178
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,610
It's a big help in the financing negotiation.

179
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,580
Well, I didn't expect that.

180
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,170
Thank you. Let's go.

181
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,670
Go.

182
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,900
According to the unified plan of the central government,

183
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:30,350
the reconstruction of Fengxi is conducted fully.

184
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,500
Residential houses, schools,

185
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,357
hospitals and so on are the focus.

186
00:10:35,357 --> 00:10:40,520
The reconstructed Fengxi Hospital, funded by the government, will be completed at the end of this year.

187
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,040
By then, lots of medical appliances donated by Fangqin Group,

188
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,610
an enterprise of Linjiang will come in one after another.

189
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,740
The most urgent thing now is Fengxi Hospital's talents introduction, training,

190
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,340
and its completion and operation.

191
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:01,028
- Thank you. 
 - At this time, we should work together effectively.

192
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,990
Yan, you're here too.

193
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,260
The hospital asked me to.

194
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,070
Yan.

195
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:21,814
I think that Dr. Cai is quite concerned about you.

196
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,071
What exactly do you want to say?

197
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:29,030
I know you've known each other for many years, and you're colleagues.

198
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,142
But being friends and being family are not the same.

199
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:34,140
Get to know him better.

200
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,750
It's my business. None of your concerns.

201
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,071
I'm doing it for your own good.

202
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,990
- Can I have your food tonight? 
 - Of course.

203
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,740
- Twice-cooked pork? 
 - Too rich.

204
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,860
Ribs?

205
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,640
Why are they leaving?

206
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,271
I thought we agreed to go to the Xishan Homestay together.

207
00:11:56,271 --> 00:11:58,230
- Why are they leaving alone? 
 - Yeah.

208
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,480
If I hadn't stopped you two, you'd have been the third wheel.

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,460
What do you mean?

210
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,560
Xiaolu, it's not horrible to have poor eyesight

211
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,640
but to be insensitive.

212
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,980
What are you saying, Cong?

213
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,690
Why am I insensitive?

214
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,250
You can't even see that?

215
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,450
Dr. Cai has plans today.

216
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,120
What's that?

217
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,040
All right. Stay out of it.

218
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,440
You two go get some groceries with me at the market.

219
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,960
- We'll be there later. Let's celebrate in Xishan. 
 - Okay.

220
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,510
- Let's go. 
 - Go.

221
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,390
Come on.

222
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,290
We should have stayed the night here.

223
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,280
They booked Xishan Homestay. I heard it was great.

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,814
There are all single-family houses that can see hills from the door.

225
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,060
Be careful.

226
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,950
Come in.

227
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,890
Look. Your clothes are wet. Go upstairs and get changed.

228
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,480
Okay.

229
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,620
Come on down.

230
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,190
Zhan Yan, I have something to tell you.

231
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,300
I've never been ready for it.

232
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:22,950
I think it's time today.

233
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,740
Go ahead.

234
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,460
We did have a great relationship at college.

235
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,530
At that time, people around us all thought we were the best couple.

236
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,560
I expected you to marry me as soon as possible after graduation.

237
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:50,350
I never thought you'd break up with me before graduation.

238
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,080
- Stop it. 
 - Let me finish it.

239
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,180
You told me we were not right for each other.

240
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,128
I know it was because of your parents.

241
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:04,714
I know what you're afraid of.

242
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,671
You're afraid of marriage.

243
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:11,771
You fear we can't be true to each other after we get married.

244
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:15,657
So, I don't want to force you.

245
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:19,314
You don't want our former relationship to go public in the hospital.

246
00:15:19,314 --> 00:15:21,880
I respect your wishes.

247
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,570
However, Zhan Yan, what I want to say is,

248
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:31,770
I'll always be there for you, in the past, now, or in the future.

249
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:36,190
I hope I can make you feel secure someday.

250
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,110
And let you accept me with all your heart.

251
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,920
For this day, I've been working hard.

252
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,930
I became the associate chief with my efforts.

253
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,957
I bought this house near the hospital,

254
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:02,600
because I want you to believe I'll give you a home.

255
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,200
I'll make you feel happy and safe.

256
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,300
I'm ready now.

257
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,060
Zhan Yan, are you willing to accept me again?

258
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,500
Thank you for saying so much to me today.

259
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,710
I said we were not right for each other. I meant it.

260
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,070
Now, I can only tell you that.

261
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,120
I'm really sorry.

262
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,090
But what I want to say is, you have always been that respectable senior in my heart.

263
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,410
Zhan Yan.

264
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,971
Actually, if I was not your choice,

265
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:59,460
all the efforts and sincerity you put in would have been seen.

266
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,860
You chose the wrong girl.

267
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,450
It's okay.

268
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,030
I've been waiting for seven years.

269
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,580
I'll keep waiting.

270
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,290
You don't have to decide now.

271
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,000
I just hope, after today,

272
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:23,842
you can think about what I said today. Okay?

273
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,100
They should be here soon.

274
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,957
I saw a cellar over there.

275
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,914
I'll go pick the wine.

276
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,350
 Yuxiao, have you made it?

277
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,900
 We're coming back now.

278
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,050
Landslide.

279
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,380
Zhan Yan, landslide!

280
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,520
Zhan Yan!

281
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,420
Zhan Yan! Run!

282
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,310
Zhan Yan!

283
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,660
Zhan Yan!

284
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,930
Zhan Yan!

285
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,590
Zhan... Zhan Yan!

286
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,540
Come on, let me.

287
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,550
Hold on, Zhan Yan.

288
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,860
Mudslide again.

289
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,950
Zhan Yan, this isn't working out.

290
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,970
I'll go get someone.

291
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,290
Zhan Yan!

292
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:22,820
I asked you to stay because I want to talk about secondary disasters

293
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,480
we may encounter during the reconstruction.

294
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,020
Armed police and firemen are limited now.

295
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,980
Especially during the critical period of reconstruction,

296
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,890
Recently, affected by typhoons,

297
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:35,920
secondary disasters like storms, floods, mudslides,

298
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,620
landslides, and so on, hit Fengxi all the time.

299
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:43,110
I hope Light Chaser Rescue Team can assist

300
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,830
the follow-up disaster relief and mitigation work.

301
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,180
I see. Leave any tasks to us.

302
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,920
Light Chaser Rescue Team will do its best to cooperate.

303
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,542
- Thank you, Captain Qingshan. 
 - Excuse me.

304
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,650
Cai Yuxiao, what's up?

305
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,170
I'm with Zhan Yan. We're in Xishan Homestay.

306
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:09,920
 She's buried, Uncle Zhan.

307
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,750
I'm sorry, Uncle Zhan.

308
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,480
I didn't protect Zhan Yan.

309
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,000
Send me the location immediately.

310
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,620
Looks like we should wait till the rain slows down.

311
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,210
Well, speaking of, this area is not far from Xishan Homestay.

312
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,070
We just don't want to disrupt Dr. Zhan.

313
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,500
Or it'd be great for us to get a coffee there.

314
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,480
 We interrupt for an emergency road condition.

315
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,010
 A landslide hit Xishan. One homestay has been buried.

316
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,457
 If you're passing through Xishan, please be careful.

317
00:22:44,457 --> 00:22:47,450
 - If you're passing there, please be careful.  
 - Xishan Homestay.

318
00:22:50,671 --> 00:22:52,285

319
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,620
 The number you have dialed is not available.

320
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,750
It's disconnected.

321
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,028
I'll call the doctor they're with.

322
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,780
Hello? Dr. Cai. It's Ariel.

323
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,540
I saw the news about Xishan landslide.

324
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,750
- Are you okay? 
  - Zhan Yan...

325
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,720
 Zhan Yan is buried under the ground.

326
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,390
Zhan Yan! Zhan Yan!

327
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,250
Zhan Yan!

328
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,710
Zhan Yan!

329
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,880
Zhan Yan!

330
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,150
 Yan.

331
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,520
 There are 30,000 liters of air in a 3-meter-high

332
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,030
 house of 100 square meters.

333
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,090
 The oxygen level is 20% of it.

334
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,720
 If the oxygen level in the air is less than 18%,

335
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,300
 it'd be suffocating.

336
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,230
Okay.

337
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,560
All right.

338
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,540
Roads are slippery. You must be careful.

339
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,670
Get to the scene as soon as possible.

340
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,040
- Director. 
 - Captain.

341
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,180
This is Xishan Homestay's structural blueprint.

342
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,290
This homestay has four floors on the ground and one basement.

343
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,800
According to the structural maps, the basement is 120 square meters.

344
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,350
Ruled out space of furniture, indoor items,

345
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,260
and the influx of mud,

346
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,860
in her peaceful state, we have about six hours to save her.

347
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,160
 Well, theoretically, an adult needs 10,000 liters of air per day.

348
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,380
 So, when someone is trapped in a completely closed room of 100 square meters,

349
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,320
 he has, like, three days of air.

350
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,870
 But his mood,

351
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,470
 when he's nervous and upset,

352
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,070
 or when he's calm,

353
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,980
 his oxygen requirements are completely different.

354
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,370
 Almost one time over.

355
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,890
 Once you are trapped, you're easily scared, desperate, and emotional.

356
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,830
 Three days will be reduced to a day and a half.

357
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,140
 Yeah.

358
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,140
 Right.

359
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,140
 Therefore, whatever the case may be,

360
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,950
 the first thing is not to make yourself crazy.

361
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,990
 Use every possible condition around you to save yourself.

362
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,040
 Wait for rescue to come.

363
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,450
 Hold on until the last minute.

364
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,750
If the space is smaller, or there are other uncertainties,

365
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,550
there may be only two to three hours.

366
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,790
How long till we get there?

367
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,860
At the current speed, I'd say around 20 minutes.

368
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,600
Zhan Yan.

369
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,220
- Zhan Yan. 
 - No answer.

370
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,630
We don't know how Dr. Zhan is.

371
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,590
- Zhan Yan. 
 - Zhan Yan.

372
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,440
- Dr. Zhan. 
 - I'll check it out.

373
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,340
There are falling rocks. It's too dangerous now.

374
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,800
More dangerous inside. Won't you wait for the rescue team?

375
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,170
I'm with the rescue team.

376
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,720
Don't go in.

377
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,120
What if there are falling rocks inside?

378
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,120
What if it collapses and there's a landslide?

379
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,190
Aren't you afraid of death?

380
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,880
Ariel.

381
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,000
If something happens to me, take care of Luo Yuan for me.

382
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
No.

383
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,440
Zhan Yan.

384
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,850
Luo Ben is going down to save you.

385
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,440
You're the one who should go in. You're a coward.

386
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,020
Easy for you to say.

387
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,340
If it were Luo Ben in there, would you be able to save him?

388
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,520
Do you know rescue?

389
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,960
Zhan Yan!

390
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,960
Zhan Yan!

391
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,000
Zhan Yan!

392
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,960
Zhan Yan!

393
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,680
Zhan Yan!

394
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,900
Don't speak. I'll bring you out.

395
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,150
- Go. 
 - Leg.

396
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,540
Hold on.

397
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,050
How's your leg? Is it okay?

398
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,130
Hold on. I'll bring you out.

399
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,790
Here.

400
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,540
Come on.

401
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,590
Easy.

402
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,910
Landslide again.

403
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,580
- Landslide again. 
 - Luo Ben.

404
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,750
- Run, Luo Ben. 
 - Get out.

405
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,460
 - Landslide. 
 - Get out.

406
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,020
- Get out! 
 - Ariel.

407
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,420
 Run!

408
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,190
Watch out!

409
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,850
Zhan Yan!

410
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:08,580
A second landslide struck Xishan.

411
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,250
 Here. Fill this out. Right here.

412
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,350
Why are you here?

413
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,014

414
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,542
 I was just passing by.

415
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:50,885
There are too many cars. It's not safe.

416
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:53,790
Try not to come if there's nothing.

417
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,040
 Why are you avoiding me?

418
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,540
 Have I made you unhappy?

419
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,210
No way.

420
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,042
It's the holiday. There are many parcels. I'm a little busy.

421
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,190
You showed the kids the rescue team last time.

422
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,580
I wanted to go with you.

423
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,080
 It's okay. I understand.

424
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,171
I have to go.

425
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,314
Anything else?

426
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,585
Luo Yuan.

427
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,214
Something happened to your brother.

428
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,380
Hold on.

429
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,960
 Here's the latest road condition.

430
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,400
 A second landslide hit Xishan.

431
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,720
 If you're on your way there, please be careful.

432
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,970
 If you're passing through Xishan, please be careful.

433
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,290
Hello, comrade.

434
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,540
There's a landslide up ahead. Please turn around.

435
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,110
 Roads near Xishan have all closed.

436
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,840
 You can't get in.

437
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,985
 We'll do everything we can to assist the fire brigade to rescue.

438
00:33:18,985 --> 00:33:20,880
 Luo Yuan is worried about her brother.

439
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,757
Can you stay connected with us all the time?

440
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:24,580
Okay, I'll tell her.

441
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,120
You must be careful, too.

442
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,530
 I know.

443
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,120
They must bring Yan back.

444
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,660
Luo Yuan.

445
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,080
The government rescue team and Captain Qingshan will arrive at the site soon.

446
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,190
You must believe they'll get your brother and Dr. Zhan out.

447
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,180
Don't worry.

448
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,840
We can always know the situation over there.

449
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,070
Luo Ben.

450
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,750
I'm here.

451
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,540
Are you okay?

452
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,210
I'm fine.

453
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,440
How are you?

454
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,710
Here.

455
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,114
Be careful!

456
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,470
Hand. Here.

457
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,920
Let me see.

458
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,530
It's okay.

459
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,900
I took care of it. It's okay.

460
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,410
Let me check your back.

461
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,660
I'm fine.

462
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,590
Are you scared?

463
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,950
I feared it was too dark in here and you'd cry.

464
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,271
Do you know...

465
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,471
we might not get out of here?

466
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,800
No.

467
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,120
I'm the closest one.

468
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,460
So, I came here first.

469
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,540
Captain Qingshan should be here soon.

470
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,790
- Luo Ben. 
 - Zhan Yan.

471
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,190
- Luo Ben. 
 - Zhan Yan.

472
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,300
- We're here! 
 - Here!

473
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,810
- We're here! 
 - Here!

474
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,380
We're here!

475
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,528
 - Come on! Some help over here. 
 - Coming.

476
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,340
Ruan, any news about Yan?

477
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,180
The captain is there. They'll be fine.

478
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,640
 Hurry up. A landslide hit Xishan Homestay.

479
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,300
 Two people are trapped.

480
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,230
 At present, police, firemen, and the civilian rescue team...

481
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,550
This place looks so dangerous.

482
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,400
Qingshan has been in a more dangerous and complicated situation.

483
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,050
I believe in him.

484
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,820
Our job right now is to save our strength and wait for good news.

485
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,080
Eat. Put the food over here.

486
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,130
Luo Yuan, eat something.

487
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,128
Your brother will be sad when he sees you are haggard.

488
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,450
Come on. Keep driving. Here.

489
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:32,120
Come on. More.

490
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,860
 Further!

491
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,510
 Okay.

492
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,100
Captain, all heavy machines are ready.

493
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,100
Okay.

494
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,514
Windows are semi-recessed.

495
00:37:50,514 --> 00:37:53,820
Their location is special, which can alleviate the impact of the mud.

496
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,390
They dug this place out and got in.

497
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:59,540
Our focus should be here.

498
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,140
Okay. Saving lives is our highest priority.

499
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,520
- Do with this plan. 
 - Okay.

500
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,920
Yes.

501
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,870
You're hurt.

502
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,900
Let me check.

503
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,420
I'll take care of it.

504
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,430
I'm okay. No need.

505
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,685
Well, then, I'm afraid you won't be able to last till they get here.

506
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,928
Dr. Zhan, I'm a man.

507
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:45,328
I say I'm okay, then I'm okay.

508
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,490
You shouldn't have come.

509
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,000
You shouldn't have come.

510
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,720
What?

511
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,240
Do you regret it?

512
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,990
Do you regret it?

513
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,570
Are you okay?

514
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,680
Zhou Mingming, do you have any drinks?

515
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,570
You... Take it easy!

516
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,580
If you're drunk, it's so high, it won't be easy to get down.

517
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,000
Zhou Mingming, that's not alcohol.

518
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,640
Are you kidding me?

519
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,090
How could I get fake drinks?

520
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,630
Then why am I still scared now?

521
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,470
I thought alcohol gave people courage.

522
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,470
Captain Qingshan is on his way to save them.

523
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,090
Don't worry. You don't have to do that.

524
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,170
Let me tell you.

525
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,050
You know what?

526
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:29,550
I... I didn't do well in school since I was a kid.

527
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,940
The teachers didn't like me. My classmates hated me.

528
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,271
And my parents thought I didn't get an honest job.

529
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:38,640
Only Sister Yan...

530
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,860
Only Sister Yan likes me.

531
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,890
She encouraged me to do comics.

532
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,270
She said I was talented.

533
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:52,420
It seems that Sister Yan is the only one who likes me.

534
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:56,210
Everyone dislikes me. Why?

535
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,320
You're kind of talented.

536
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,680
If you put your talent in the right way, more people would appreciate you.

537
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,720
What?

538
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,500
Sister Yan also told me that.

539
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,980
I'm so scared now.

540
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,350
Sister Yan is alone. She must be scared.

541
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:22,520
What if she can't hold on?

542
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,010
What if she... she cries alone? Sister Yan...

543
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,300
All right. Let me tell you.

544
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:31,850
Your sister always saves lives. She's done many good deeds.

545
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,240
So, she'll be fine.

546
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:40,190
But you, if I figured you couldn't drink, I wouldn't have gotten you so much.

547
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,450
No, I can hold it very well.

548
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,590
I'm a good drinker.

549
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:46,440
I drink a lot.

550
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,120
I'm a good drinker.

551
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,490
Dingding. Dingding.

552
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:25,630
Zhang, inform logistics to send supplies here.

553
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,600
Go and ask them to send everything here.

554
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,290
Okay? Go.

555
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:04,970

556
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,490
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

557
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,840
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

558
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:29,610
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

559
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,590
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

560
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:44,560
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

561
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:52,510
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

562
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:59,960
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

563
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:07,160
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

564
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:15,990
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

565
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:22,240
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

566
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:30,910
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

567
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:38,490
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

568
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,410
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

569
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:46,140
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

570
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,810
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

571
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:53,590
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

572
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,310
♫  I can't fly  ♫

573
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,910
♫  But I can look up  ♫

574
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:08,440
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
