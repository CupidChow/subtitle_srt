00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,900
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,225
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,235
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,490
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:35,960
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:39,470
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,525
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:48,245
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,625
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,675
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,675 --> 00:01:02,275
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:08,875
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,875 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,350
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,500
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,775
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,072

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,261
 Dongzi!

21
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,200
 You can't go in. It's too dangerous.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
 Let me go. Let me go.

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,781
 - Let me in. 
 - Calm down.

24
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:48,200
 - Dongzi! 
 - Calm down.

25
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,660
 - Dongzi! 
 - Captain.

26
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,760
Captain.

27
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,780
Falcon, what's the situation now?

28
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,760
When the earthquake happened, everyone acted quickly,

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,800
so most of the teachers and students came out.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,520
Only an old principal and Ms. Luo from Linjiang

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,960
were buried in the debris, because they were rescuing the young students.

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,920
Okay.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,380
Look.

34
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,520
Have you identified their position?

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,480
Not yet, but we're narrowing our search.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,700
Captain Qingshan, my sister is still there.

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,800
Please rescue her.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,240
Luo Yuan?

39
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,400
We're searching for her.

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,440
Captain.

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,140
My sister can't talk, but she can hear you.

42
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,200
She can't talk?

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,940
Yes. She can't talk.

44
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,440
This is important.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,080
The trapped person can't talk.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,960
She might communicate with us in other ways.

47
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,520
It might be walls, pipes, stones, and whistles.

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,000
Pay attention to those. Separate!

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,620
Yes, sir. Captain.

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,760
- We've identified the position. 
 - Okay.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,336
Anyone? Anyone?

52
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,044
Ms. Luo.

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,212
Ms. Luo, is that you?

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Good.

55
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,992
Don't be afraid.

56
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,972
We'll get out alive.

57
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:10,116
Someone will come to rescue us.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
Don't be afraid.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,288
I'm good.

60
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,720
This place is a little narrow.

61
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,700
I have to keep up my strength.

62
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,320
Now, I can't talk to you.

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,172
Well, I'm right down here.

64
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm with you.

65
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,628
Don't be afraid.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,260
 Why haven't they come out yet?

67
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,116
Yuan Yuan!

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,352
Yuan Yuan, can you hear me?

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,940
Yuan Yuan, don't be afraid.

70
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,460
I'll rescue you soon.

71
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,600
 Are you injured?

72
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,988
Hold on, I'll rescue you soon.

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,960
Captain, my sister is injured.

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,440
Rescue her.

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,000
We'll try our best to rescue your sister.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Thank you, aptain.

77
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,960
Can you hear me?

78
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,200
We're Light Chaser Rescue Team.

79
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,812
We're here to rescue you.

80
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,360
We're Light Chaser Rescue Team.

81
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,720
We're here to rescue you.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,956
Can you hear me?

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,201
 Nurse, when can I walk?

84
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:32,500
 Not now. Wait here.

85
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,200
 Okay.

86
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,500
 Thank you, nurse.

87
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,720
 You're welcome.

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Why don't you eat the egg noodles?

89
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,920
Aren't you hungry, Lele?

90
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:50,240
Sister Yan, let me tell you, he hasn't eaten nor drank for a long time,

91
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,764
and he won't read comic books.

92
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,300
The milk was warmed for you.

93
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,008
Drink it while it's still warm.

94
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,120
If you don't want it, I'll drink it.

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,404
I'll drink it.

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,900
How about this?

97
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,240
Do you believe that I'm a magician?

98
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,712
I can do magic for you.

99
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,460
See?

100
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,936
A butterfly.

101
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:03,440
Once upon a time, a butterfly's favorite food was milk and butter.

102
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,800
That's why it is called a butterfly.

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,720
After the butterfly drank milk and ate butter,

104
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,440
they grew a pair of colorful and beautiful wings

105
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,980
to protect them and live strong in nature.

106
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,040
Well, do you want to be like a butterfly,

107
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,984
to protect yourself and others, and be brave?

108
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:52,092
Sis, you are much more gentle to children than to me.

109
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,520
Zhan Yan, you need to check a patient there.

110
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,920
Okay.

111
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,640
Take care of him.

112
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,396
No problem.

113
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,500
Do you want some noodles?

114
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,800
Look. They smell delicious.

115
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
Here.

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,420
There is a signal.

117
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,760
I'll make a call.

118
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,770

119
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,860
Mom, I'm with my cousin.

120
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,916
Don't worry.

121
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,740
My cousin is good.

122
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,940
Can you care about me first?

123
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,520
Am I your real daughter?

124
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,160
Ask Dad to make more wontons.

125
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,444
I really want to eat some.

126
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,420
Okay, I'll hang up.

127
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,040
Okay, okay. I'll take care of myself.

128
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,780
Goodbye, my dearest mom. Bye-bye.

129
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,960
Hello, Wenbo.

130
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,520
Sorry, I'm in the disaster area.

131
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,840
The phone had no signal.

132
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,000
I just got some signal just now.

133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,360
I saw your message about letting me send you my manuscripts.

134
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,160
Well, I came out to relieve pressure, and just happened to meet this.

135
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,360
Wait for me.

136
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,792
Tomorrow... I'll be back before the day after tomorrow.

137
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,220
Okay, no problem. Goodbye.

138
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,980

139
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,120
Sis, when will the hospital's car arrive?

140
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,500
Will it come today?

141
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,396
I don't know.

142
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
I have an operation to do.

143
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,820
Well, Mingming.

144
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,980
You said you contacted someone.

145
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,680
Why is there no one to welcome us?

146
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,900
The signal is bad here. I contacted them.

147
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,560
They said no one has time to welcome us,

148
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,140
and asked us to put the goods in the tent first.

149
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,640
Captain. Preliminary judgment.

150
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,960
She is buried by heavy debris, and the space is narrow.

151
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,516
 I need to check if I can clear a way out.

152
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,440
According to the scene he transmitted, he can go there from the south.

153
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,820
There are more supports. It will be safer.

154
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,960
Xiong Fei, go there from the south.

155
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,920
 There are more supports and fewer barriers.

156
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,620
Copy that.

157
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,080
Fatty. Li Jian.

158
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,740
Where are they?

159
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,760
Who are you?

160
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,400
You're from Linjiang?

161
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,700
We're from the same place.

162
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,560
You're also from Linjiang?

163
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,264
You're here to send donations?

164
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,660
I'm here to send goods.

165
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,640
I'm here to supply supplies. Are the front lines strong?

166
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,620
Are you going back to the city?

167
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,680
Yes. But the goods...

168
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,848
The goods are still here.

169
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,900
It's okay, I'll help you with it.

170
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,652
You? Are you sure?

171
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,920
I'm not that useless.

172
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,280
Well done. You seem pretty strong.

173
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,560
I'm Zhou Mingming, and you?

174
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm Ding Dingding. Here, take this.

175
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,600
I need to make a call.

176
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,820
Well, what do you mean?

177
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,460
The goods are still here. And you drove my car away.

178
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,120
How could you do that?

179
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,720
Just wait. I'll teach you a lesson when I go back.

180
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,960
Ms. Luo.

181
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,456
Can you hear me?

182
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,224
Besides your leg, where else are you feeling pain?

183
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,920
Yuan Yuan...

184
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,352
How's the kid?

185
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,152
Hold on, I'll get you out of here.

186
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,568
What does she mean?

187
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,500
My sister said, there is someone down there.

188
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,932
Is it the principal?

189
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,200
Principal, we're Light Chaser Rescue Team.

190
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,000
Hold on, we'll rescue you now.

191
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,612
Can you hear me, Principal?

192
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,500
Captain.

193
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,300
My sister's leg was buried, and her stomach was also injured.

194
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,120
We don't know how seriously she was injured.

195
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,600
Can you rescue her as soon as possible?

196
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Obviously, you know something about emergency rescue.

197
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,920
Then you need to calm down.

198
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,600
We need to make a safe and effective rescue plan

199
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,760
according to the specific conditions of the trapped people.

200
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,940
But the trapped person is my sister.

201
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,740
She is in great danger now. How can I be calm?

202
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,040
How long do you need to make a plan?

203
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,188
Can you hurry up?

204
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,960
I know. This is a charity rescue.

205
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,220
But if you rescue my sister, I'll donate money to your team,

206
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,000
as much money as you want.

207
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,192
Sir, whether it's rescuing your sister or others, we'll try our best.

208
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:23,280
And we risk our lives to rescue, it's not for anyone's donation.

209
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,760
- Wukong. 
 - Yes, sir.

210
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,860
- Invite a doctor to come here. 
 - Yes, sir.

211
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,360
Hurry up.

212
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,740
I brought some goods for the disaster area.

213
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,380
The goods are here.

214
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,156
You unloaded all these?

215
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,920
Wow, you're so strong. Well done.

216
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,720
Thank you for what you've done for people here.

217
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,920
Take a break.

218
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,940
- Hello, please check these. 
 - Okay.

219
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,980
Thank you for what you've done for Fengxi disaster area.

220
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,560
It's a piece of cake.

221
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,520
It's okay, I don't need to rest.

222
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,720
I've thought about it. I'll sleep on the way back.

223
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,240
You can drive, right?

224
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,860
You want to go back now?

225
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,700
Aren't you going back to Linjiang?

226
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,920
Yes, I am, but not now.

227
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,540
You said you'd go back as soon as you unloaded the goods.

228
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,700
I didn't say that.

229
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,760
Wait! I asked you if you would go back.

230
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,780
You said you would go back.

231
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,120
But I didn't say when to go back.

232
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,440
Wait!  You cheated me?

233
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,580
You were willing to help. I didn't force you.

234
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,520
Okay, fine. I was willing to help.

235
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,220
Then when will you go back? Can I take your car?

236
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,580
Of course.

237
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,780
As for when I'll go back, three days at least.

238
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,760
Maybe I'll stay longer.

239
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,380
Since I'm here, I need to dosomething for the disaster area.

240
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,000
Three days?

241
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
No, it'll be too late.

242
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,660
If you want to go back in a hurry, you can take someone elses car.

243
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,880
I can't promise you a time.

244
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,704
Well, how can I happen to find a car that will go back to Linjiang?

245
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
All the goods are unloaded.

246
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,280
Just go back with me.

247
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,920
You can do nothing here.

248
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,600
I can do many things, okay?

249
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,261
The supplements are here. There are many things needing to be done.

250
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,120
Well, please have a look around.

251
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,000
Life rescue is needed here.

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,360
And I can promise you, if you stay here, you can do nothing

253
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,960
and you'll cause trouble. Understand?

254
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,840
I don't believe you.

255
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,200
Then try it.

256
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,460
I promise you'll beg to go back within a day.

257
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,600
Let's wait and see!

258
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,664
Be careful.

259
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,900
Don't be afraid, Dongzi. Dad is here.

260
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,960
Thank you.

261
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,780
Don't be afraid.

262
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,832
I'm fine.

263
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,621
- Paper and pen. 
 - Here!

264
00:20:10,621 --> 00:20:12,528
Hurry up!

265
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,688
This position is too special.

266
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,980
What's wrong?

267
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,920

Any movement now

268
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,840

may imperil the trapped people.

269
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,240
It will take at least three hours to make some kind of support.

270
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,400
They are both injured.

271
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,476
- I'm afraid... 
 - No.

272
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,980
Captain, my sister is only 26 years old.

273
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,220
She likes children and dancing.

274
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,500
Her beautiful life is just beginning.

275
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,040
I promised my parents, I'd take care of her.

276
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,100
I won't let anything happen to her.

277
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,600
You...

278
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,100
Fine.

279
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,860
If you won't go, I'll go.

280
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,901
- Mr. Luo. 
 - It's dangerous.

281
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:05,320
- You can't go in. 
 - Let me go!

282
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,600
Mr. Luo, calm down.

283
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,180
I can't let Yuan Yuan be there alone.

284
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,040
Mr. Luo, calm down.

285
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,480
We need professional guidance from doctors now.

286
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,100
Let's wait for the doctor and listen to her.

287
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,580
Maybe the situation is not as bad as we thought.

288
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,960
Yan.

289
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,520
Two people are in the debris and are both injured.

290
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,520
You need to check them inside.

291
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,580
- I want to go as well. 
 - It's too dangerous inside.

292
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,480
You'll only cause trouble.

293
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,000
My sister can't talk.

294
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,840
Even if you go inside, you can't communicate with her,

295
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,700
so I must go with you.

296
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,440
Let him go with us.

297
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,200
Okay.

298
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,920
Xiong Fei, Yan, and Mr. Luo, you three go in together.

299
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,040
The building structure below is very unstable.

300
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't act rashly.

301
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,076
Listen to Xiong Fei's order.

302
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,320
I know.

303
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,220
For my sister's safety, I won't act rashly.

304
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,580
Yan.

305
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,516
Be careful.

306
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,640
I know.

307
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,120
Follow me.

308
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,440
Get prepared.

309
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,344
 Yes, sir!

310
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,200
Be careful.

311
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Wait, Xiong Fei!

312
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay.

313
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Mr. Luo!

314
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,292
 Mr. Luo, are you okay?

315
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,900
Mr. Luo!

316
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm fine.

317
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,900
Let's go.

318
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,400
Principal. Principal.

319
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,800
How's she?

320
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,100
I'm not worried about her foot.

321
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,500
I'm worried about her spleen.

322
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,700
She needs to have an operation.

323
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,500
What can we do now?

324
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,000
Is it too late?

325
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,600
It's not too late if she can be rescued soon.

326
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,300
Principal. Principal.

327
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
From now on, don't move, and keep your position.

328
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Save your strength, until you're rescued.

329
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Trust me, you'll be fine.

330
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,500
Dr. Zhan, check the principal here.

331
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,900
Okay.

332
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,700
What about my sister?

333
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,600
Stay with her and don't move.

334
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,100
Dr. Zhan...

335
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
It's okay.

336
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,452
Dr. Zhan said, you'll be okay.

337
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,700
Everything is going to be okay.

338
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
Hold on, Principal.

339
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,800
Principal.

340
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,600
Principal.

341
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,000
How do you feel now?

342
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,500
Ms...

343
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,500
- Ms. Luo... 
 - She's fine, don't worry.

344
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,300
Then I'm relieved.

345
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,400
Yuan,

346
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,600
I'll find the best doctor to cure you.

347
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,800
Your legs will be fine.

348
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,400
You can continue to dance.

349
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:20,000
You can go to special education schools for further study abroad.

350
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,000
You have always said that I intervened in your life too much.

351
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
As long as you recover,

352
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,300
you can do anything you want.

353
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,100
Just do the things you like.

354
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,400
I'll support you.

355
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
As long as you recover,

356
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,200
as long as you're happy. Okay?

357
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,000
Yuan Yuan.

358
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,800
Yuan Yuan.

359
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,000
Dr. Zhan!

360
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,300
Dr. Zhan, Yuan is coughing up blood.

361
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,600
Dr. Zhan!

362
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
Yuan Yuan!

363
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,100
Leave me alone.

364
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,800
Go to see Ms. Luo.

365
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,500
Here's an injection to relieve the pain.

366
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,200
Don't bother.

367
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,684
Don't waste time.

368
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,464
I know I'm dying.

369
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,944
Rescue Ms. Luo.

370
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,400
I... I invited her here...

371
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,800
Don't worry.

372
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,100
I'll rescue her.

373
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,500
Hold tight.

374
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,200
 Yuan Yuan.

375
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,600
 You'll be fine.

376
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,100
 Is she okay?

377
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,600
 Here.

378
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,100
 Be careful.

379
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,000
Be careful!

380
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,600
Zhan Yan! Zhan Yan!

381
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,500
I'll do the operation, you help me.

382
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,100
Okay.

383
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,800
Preliminary judgment, splenic rupture, compressive damage of other organs.

384
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
The degree of damage is uncertain.

385
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,900
There is no time to prepare.

386
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,800
And there is no condition, so I hope you can do your best.

387
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,200
No problem.

388
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,500
Dr. Zhan!

389
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Please cure my sister.

390
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,300
Director Liu.

391
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,600
Light Chaser Rescue Team has completed the investigation and rescue work

392
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,100
in Fengxi School of Special Education.

393
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,700
We safely transferred 137 teachers and students,

394
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,900
and rescued three buried teachers and students.

395
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,400
Unfortunately, a teacher died because of his serious injuries.

396
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,200
- Now is the golden time for life rescue. 
 - I know.

397
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,700
 Although you are tired, I still need to arrange a mission for you.

398
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,200
Director Liu, just name it.

399
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,800
Now the main force is in a heavy disaster area.

400
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,300
You still have to give full play to your advantage.

401
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,400
 Take Fengxi School of Special Education as the fulcrum,

402
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,000
 carry out an investigation and rescue around it.

403
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,100
There is a market eight hundred meters from the school.

404
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,500
This place should be a key point.

405
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,700
Okay. Mission accepted.

406
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,100
You and your team members should be careful.

407
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
Director Liu, don't worry.

408
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,400
We'll surely complete the mission.

409
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,200
Gather up!

410
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,100
The next destination, Fengxi Market.

411
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,700
 - Go there. Keep in touch! 
 - Okay!

412
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,100
 - Go there. 
 - Go there. Follow up.

413
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,000
 - Follow me. 
 - Okay.

414
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,300

415
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,400
 - Be careful. 
 - Watch out, everyone.

416
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,700
 Be careful.

417
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,400
 There is someone, check there.

418
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,900
 There is one person.

419
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,000
 Hurry up!

420
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,300
 - There is someone. 
 - Be careful, help him out.

421
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,100
 Come on, help him.

422
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,400
 Be careful.

423
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,600
 There is someone.

424
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
 Hold on.

425
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,200
 Be careful.

426
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,300
 Be careful with the bricks.

427
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,900
 Watch out for his hand.

428
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,800
 Be careful.

429
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,700
 - Be careful. 
 - Don't press him.

430
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,500
Someone, come here.

431
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,200
 Careful.

432
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
 Hold on.

433
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,600
 Hold on.

434
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,032
 We'll rescue you, man.

435
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:42,800
 Just hold on.

436
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,384
 Be careful.

437
00:30:46,384 --> 00:30:48,300
 Watch out for his arm.

438
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,000
 Come on, carry him out.

439
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
 Come on. Carry him out.

440
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
 Move away.

441
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,600
 Fix the fracture.

442
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
 Move away.

443
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
 Be careful.

444
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 Watch out for his hand.

445
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,100
Peng! Peng!

446
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,600
- Peng, something urgent. 
 -  Help me.

447
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,100
 Help me.

448
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
Come on.

449
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,400
Be careful.

450
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,700
One, two, three.

451
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,900
Be careful.

452
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,100
Whose dog is this?

453
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,800
- Ask whose dog this is. 
 - Okay.

454
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,700
If no one wants it, take care of it for me.

455
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,100
Okay, I'll give it my lunch to eat.

456
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
Here.

457
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,700
Be careful.

458
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,800
What happened?

459
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,200
This is a sign of human life.

460
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,300
Wait, there must be someone down there.

461
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,000
Continue. Continue to search.

462
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,400
Dig!

463
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,000
Anyone?

464
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
Who is it?

465
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,180
What are you doing?

466
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
It's you?

467
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,600
You don't know what I'm doing? I'm rescuing you.

468
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,700
If there is an aftershock, you'd be buried. Understand?

469
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,900
You'll be buried. I'm looking for my computer, bro.

470
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,500
I almost reached for it. I need to reach for it again now.

471
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,200
Why am I so unlucky once I met you?

472
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Why are you still doing this? You want to commit suicide?

473
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,600
I want my computer.

474
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,800
Which one is more important?

475
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,500
The computer is my life, understand?

476
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,400
My manuscripts are in the computer. They're all my painstaking effort.

477
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
Okay, fine, you can just commit suicide like this.

478
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,600
I won't rescue you if there is an aftershock.

479
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
I won't be so unfortunate.

480
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,300
Once I go inside, there is an aftershock?

481
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,300
Go!

482
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,600
Be careful.

483
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,400
Are you afraid?

484
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,800
No.

485
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,100
It seems it's over.

486
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,900
Continue.

487
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,000
It's so scary.

488
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,200
Are you injured?

489
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,700
Roll your trouser.

490
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,600
Oh my god.

491
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,200
Blood...

492
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,200
You are afraid of blood?

493
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,320

494
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,400
 Dad?

495
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
 Mom?

496
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,100
 Dad?

497
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,000
 I want my mom and dad.

498
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 Where have you gone?

499
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,600
Mr. Luo. Don't worry.

500
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,200
Dr. Zhan will try her best.

501
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,300
Your sister will be fine.

502
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Well, how's the principal?

503
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,700
I've arranged everything for him.

504
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,200
The principal knew what situation he was in.

505
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,400
He died in peace.

506
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
If I can, I want to do something for him,

507
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,800
but I was...

508
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
I understand your feelings.

509
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,200
We living people shouldn't let him down.

510
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,700
Just accept his kindness.

511
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,560
You've learned about earthquake rescue before?

512
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,700
I'm just interested in it.

513
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,700
How long do we have to walk?

514
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,800
I can't walk anymore. I'm dizzy.

515
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,600
You're dizzy, I'm dizzy.

516
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,400
I almost didn't make this journey, I'm exhausted to death.

517
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
I can't figure it out.

518
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,700
Since you're afraid of blood, why do you come here and be a volunteer?

519
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
If you are rich, donate more money.

520
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
Why did you come here?

521
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,400
I was injured because of you.

522
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,800
If you hadn't come, I would have gotten my computer.

523
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,300
Then you wouldn't need to get inside. Then you wouldn't get injured.

524
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,400
Then you wouldn't blame me.

525
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,800
In all, you're the one to cause all this.

526
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,300
I don't care what you say.

527
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,200
I'm injured because of you.

528
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,700
You need to be responsible for me. You can't just leave me here.

529
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,000
What?

530
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,600
I can just let the doctor take care of you.

531
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,800
It seems you can't drive now.

532
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,200
I'll find a way to go back to Linjiang.

533
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,900
Hurry up.

534
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,600
There is a doctor.

535
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,000
- Doctor. 
 - Doctor.

536
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Hurry up.

537
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
 Wait for a second, I'll treat it for you.

538
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Ding Dingding?

539
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,800
Doctor!

540
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,000
Doctor, he is injured.

541
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,700
Please treat his wound.

542
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,800
Dingding, why are you here?

543
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,100
Uncle, luckily you're here.

544
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,500
Check his leg. He is seriously injured.

545
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,400
Sit down and let me have a look.

546
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,300
Why are you here?

547
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,600
You know him?

548
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Uncle, let me tell you, this lawyer helped the evil publisher cheat me.

549
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,000
I didn't even get the right of authorship for my comics.

550
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,300
We did that according to the contract.

551
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,000
Don't mention your contract to me.

552
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,500
Excuse me, can you stop arguing now?

553
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,100
My blood is draining, guys.

554
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
Okay.

555
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,800
Uncle, be careful. He is afraid of blood.

556
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Hold on. I have to disinfect you with iodine.

557
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,100
It hurts.

558
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,300
Are you a doctor?

559
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm not, but this is just a skin injury.

560
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,800
I can treat it for you.

561
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,800
Okay. Turn around.

562
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,600
- There is no blood? 
 - Yes, it's all bound up.

563
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,300
You're good at binding up.

564
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,700
You're more professional than doctors.

565
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,200
Bro, what's the name of your team?

566
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,400
I've never seen your uniform.

567
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,000
We are the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

568
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,800
This is our team uniform.

569
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,900
Cool.

570
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,000
I envied those who can wear uniforms when I was little.

571
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,400
Can I join you?

572
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,000
Of course.

573
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,800
But you need to pass the tests.

574
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,200
Uncle, forget it. Look at him.

575
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,700
He is so weak, and is afraid of blood.

576
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,000
He needs someone else to save him.

577
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,800
If you talk like this, I'll sue you for insulting my personality.

578
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,600
Mr. Lawyer, there is such a regulation in the law. Right?

579
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,400
Article 246 of the Criminal Law, crime of insulting others.

580
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,600
Do you hear it?

581
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Uncle, look. He is evil.

582
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Even if he passes the tests, you can't let him join.

583
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,000
Your uncle isn't the one to decide it.

584
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
My uncle is the captain, what?

585
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,600
Doctor, how's my sister?

586
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,800
The operation is still in progress, but the patient needs more blood.

587
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,400
Our bloodstock is not enough.

588
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
Who is blood type A?

589
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,600
I'm type O, for emergency use.

590
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,800
I'm type AB.

591
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,400
Is there a type A? Type A is the best.

592
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,400
What blood type are you?

593
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
- I... 
 - Are you type A?

594
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,400
You can draw his blood.

595
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,500
But I'm still injured.

596
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,800
You won't die because of it. It's urgent to save lives now.

597
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,300
- But I've drained so much blood, I... 
 -  Please.

598
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,800
Save my sister.

599
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,400
I'll be straightforward.

600
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,800
Your sister is innocent.

601
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
We want to save her life, it doesn't mean we can forgive you.

602
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,100
Enough, Dingding.

603
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,400
I'll ask the team members to donate blood.

604
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,800
Okay.

605
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,600
Follow me.

606
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,000
Hurry up.

607
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,300
Be careful.

608
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,500
You are awake?

609
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,200
Where am I?

610
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,800
The field hospital. You passed out after donating blood.

611
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,900
But don't worry. You drank dextrose liquid.

612
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,900
The doctor said you'll be fine when you woke up.

613
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,200
Well, have some rest here.

614
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,700
I need to go back to Linjiang.

615
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,000
You can't leave.

616
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,200
Who will take care of me if you leave? Let's leave together.

617
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Why are you sticking to me now?

618
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,200
I have something urgent to do.

619
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,600
You asked me to donate blood. You can't leave.

620
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
- Let me go. 
 - No.

621
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,800
Let me go...

622
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,200
No.

623
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay, I won't go.

624
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,900

625
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,700
Dr. Zhan, how's my sister?

626
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,900
She is out of danger now.

627
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,600
Thanks. Thank you.

628
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,500
If you really want to thank me, do something for the disaster area.

629
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,100
When the principal was dying,

630
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,500
he was still caring about Ms. Luo and kids in the disaster area.

631
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,600
Okay. Okay.

632
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,600
Thank you.

633
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,600
Back then, the principal made efforts

634
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,600
to build this Hope Primary School.

635
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,700
But now, it's collapsed.

636
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,340
The kids need  to travel a long distance to go to school.

637
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,900
Chief, here.

638
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,800
This... This is my gift for the village.

639
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,200
I hope the principal may rest in peace.

640
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,800
I believe the principal also hopes

641
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
the school can be rebuilt as soon as possible.

642
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,700
 After the earthquake in Fengxi happened, PLA soldiers,

643
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:49,700
 armed police soldiers, firefighters, Red Cross Society of China, non-governmental rescue organizations,

644
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,800
 all went to the disaster area for rescue work.

645
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,800
 They carried out search and rescue in the affected area,

646
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,000
 prevented secondary disasters, transferred the trapped people, built tents,

647
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,600
 organized medical treatment centers to treat the people there.

648
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,200
 The emergency center has implemented traffic control on roads leading to Fengxi,

649
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,600
 to guarantee emergency access,

650
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,200
 and has fully launched emergency communication,

651
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,700
 to ensure smooth communication.

652
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,400
 Communication in some areas is back to normal.

653
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,100

654
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,580

655
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:35,000

656
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:43,300
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

657
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:50,446
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

658
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,300
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

659
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,400
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

660
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:13,200
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

661
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,300
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

662
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:28,700
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

663
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:35,900
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

664
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:44,700
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

665
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:50,900
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

666
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:59,600
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

667
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:07,300
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

668
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:11,000
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

669
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,800
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

670
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,500
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

671
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,300
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

672
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,900
♫  I can't fly  ♫

673
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,700
♫  But I can look up  ♫

674
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:37,700
♫  I'm chasing the light on the road  ♫
