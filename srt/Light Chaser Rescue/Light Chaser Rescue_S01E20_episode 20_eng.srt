♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,124
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:21,936
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,484
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:35,570
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,506
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,506 --> 00:00:48,680
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,520
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,670
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,270
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,670
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:36,110

19
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,200

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,180
One-and-two-and-three-and-four, five-and-six-and-seven-and-eight.

21
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,180
Switch your leg.

22
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,540
Two-and-three-and-four-and-five, six-and-seven-and-eight.

23
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,310
One-and-two-and-three-and-four, five-and-six-and-seven-and-eight.

24
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,114
One-and-two-and-three-and-four, five-and-six-and-seven-and-eight.

25
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,550
Stop.

26
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,720
A deep breath.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,830
Exhale.

28
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,530
It's not like those normal masks.

29
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,850
You can use this to breathe.

30
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,038
I don't know what to choose.

31
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,570
Why does life always leave me so many tricky questions?

32
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,234
Give me some advice, please.

33
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,008
Life is essentially about tricky questions.

34
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:47,758
The reason why you feel confused is that you are so afraid of losing.

35
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,500
Xiong Fei,

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,644
I understand your worries aboutlosing, because everyone is the same.

37
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:59,030
But we still make a choice.

38
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,574
If you really want my advice,

39
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,530
just ask yourself first.

40
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,342
Which one makes you more frustrated if you lose it?

41
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,240
The answer is always here.

42
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,290
 I understand the significance of rescue to you.

43
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,502
 I don't want you to feel sad.

44
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:00,618
 I'll bring Doubao back to you tomorrow.

45
00:05:00,618 --> 00:05:03,530
 Thanks for being with me during this time.

46
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,696
 If it's convenient, bring him to our rescue team tomorrow.

47
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,030
Xiong Fei will be today's chief drillmaster of 300-meter steeple chase.

48
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,630
Xiong Fei. Attention, please.

49
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,862
Our training begins.

50
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,040
You're late.

51
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,890
Have you made your decision?

52
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,500
He made the choice.

53
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:47,430
Let's welcome Xiong Fei to make a summary of today's training.

54
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,810
Today, you did a very good job overall.

55
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,554
Some of our female members conquered their fear of heights.

56
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:07,190
But some of you were not focused,

57
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,590
so you're slower than before.

58
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,110
I hope you can pay more attention.

59
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,056
Don't slack off.

60
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:18,198
Unless you turn the rescue actions into a kind of instinct,

61
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:20,826
you can do better in real situations.

62
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,606
I have another thing to inform you.

63
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,850
Today is the last time for me to be your drillmaster.

64
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:46,361
- What? 
  - Why, Xiong Fei?

65
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:49,544
Xiong Fei, what are you talking about?

66
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,690
Because of my private reasons,

67
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,330
- I will secede from the team. 
  - Why are you doing that?

68
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,590
 Why?

69
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,314
 - Why? 
 - What's happening?

70
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,432
I'm in love with a girl.

71
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,514
I hope that I can put the focus of my life on her

72
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,818
and accompany her more.

73
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,834
I want to do everything to make her happy.

74
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,922
I'm really privileged to be your teammate.

75
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,916
Thank you!

76
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,530
Brother.

77
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,274
Look at what you have done.

78
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,500
I've made my decision, anyway.

79
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,530
Don't listen to his words.

80
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,990
Don't you mind leaving us alone?

81
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,650
 - That's it. 
 - Yeah.

82
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,270
Xiong Fei, reconsider it, please.

83
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,210
You don't need to quit even when you have a girlfriend.

84
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,236
How could you do that?

85
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,150
Chen Xing, you run fast,

86
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,614
but pay attention to stability.

87
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,140
Mingming, remember to step hard when you pass the double rope pool

88
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,550
so that you won't swing.

89
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,540
I wish you happiness.

90
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,400
You made great progress, but remember to focus on physical training.

91
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,216
Got it.

92
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:14,190
Take care of Yuan Yuan.

93
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,482
This is my choice.

94
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,620
I'm sorry, Captain.

95
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,354
I let you down.

96
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:06,000
No.

97
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,758
As a member of the rescue team, you're doing very well.

98
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,748
Every one of us has his or her own stories.

99
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:18,964
We can understand that.

100
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,040
Luo Yuan is a good girl.

101
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,072
Give her all of your love.

102
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:29,150
The volunteer rescue means a lot of sacrifices.

103
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,366
Your job, career, and family.

104
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:33,250
You can't handle them at the same time.

105
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,578
So don't blame Luo Ben.

106
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,840

107
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,526
Xiong Fei!

108
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,270

109
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,446
 You're always our teammate!

110
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,740

111
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,540
Luo Ben!

112
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,760
Hey!

113
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,560
Halt!

114
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,250
Why don't you leave, instead of Xiong Fei?

115
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,180
Can't you show a little bit of conscience?

116
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,664
Falcon died because of you, and Xiong Fei also defended you!

117
00:14:53,664 --> 00:14:58,312
We would never take you as our friend if it were not for Xiong Fei.

118
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,350
He made the choice himself.

119
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,630
I just raised my requirements.

120
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,660
There's no need for him to leave the team.

121
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,760
You are a monster.

122
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,248
Peng, calm down.

123
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,610
You're a lawyer.

124
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,976
You must be very familiar with Xiong Fei's background!

125
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:16,290
How many obstacles he has transcended!

126
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,650
If he chooses to take responsibility for someone,

127
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,770
he must be totally committed!

128
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,990
I didn't deny his love for Luo Yuan, but I have my own consideration.

129
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,138
Your consideration?

130
00:15:28,138 --> 00:15:31,780
To rescue others means to face life and death all the time.

131
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,580
Your life may be held in your teammates' hands in the next second.

132
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,812
Trust is crucial to us!

133
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,410
You don't trust Xiong Fei.

134
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,230
You don't trust anyone.

135
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:47,322
You can't do rescue work and you don't deserve to be our buddy.

136
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,524
 Zhan Yan, thank you.

137
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,320
 Blessings to you both.

138
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,410

140
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,700
Hello?

141
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,300
Hi, are you fully convinced to be defeated by Xiong Fei?

142
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,510
I supposed that you called to comfort me.

143
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:49,594
I could have, but you must admit that you underestimated him.

144
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,706
I admit that this time...

145
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,188
I got completely defeated by Xiong Fei.

146
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,202
However, I think perhaps Xiong Fei is more fit to take care of Luo Yuan.

147
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,714
I know you don't feel good,

148
00:17:08,714 --> 00:17:11,990
but you should be happy that Luo Yuan got the right man.

149
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,210
Xiong Fei is worthy of marriage.

150
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:19,174
I'll adjust my state of mind.

151
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,552
You told me something right.

152
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:25,770
 If we want a peaceful life,

153
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,160
 we must have a happy family first.

154
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,032
I think it is also suitable for you.

And earphones.

166
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,980
Listen, you can sing antiphonal songs, but don't sing alone.

167
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,770
♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

168
00:19:17,778 --> 00:19:26,078
♫  We'll go after what's appealing to us  ♫

169
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:32,850
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

170
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,460
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

171
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,590
♫  I'll be soft and silent  ♫

172
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,976
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

173
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:52,321
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

174
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:24,440
♫  Everyone has his own story  ♫

175
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,800
♫  We are all chasing a better life  ♫

176
00:20:31,336 --> 00:20:33,724
Yuan has grown up.

177
00:20:33,724 --> 00:20:36,496
She went for her own happiness.

178
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:39,466
But I'm still here.

179
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,122
I'll always be there if you need me.

180
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:51,367
♫  We all have our dreams in this world  ♫

181
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,530
Do you still want the answer?

182
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:03,807
♫  I love the way you look at me  ♫

183
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:08,089
♫  I'd always be touched by it  ♫

184
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:15,550
♫  I promise to the beating heart  ♫

185
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:22,558
♫  I love you the way you love me  ♫

186
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,770
♫  Our hearts are beating at the same pace  ♫

187
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:36,074
♫  We'll go after what's appealing to us  ♫

188
00:21:36,074 --> 00:21:42,894
♫  Like the stars shining at night  ♫

189
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:47,630
♫  I want to shine in the darkness  ♫

190
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,764
♫  I'll be soft and silent  ♫

191
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:54,978
♫  Feeling the pulse  ♫

192
00:21:54,978 --> 00:22:02,684
♫  I will always love and be touched by you ♫

193
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,711
Cheers. Congratulations to you two.

194
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:10,850
You're finally together.

195
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,780
I remember a saying... All shall be well, Jack shall have Jill. Unbelievable.

196
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,910
- Unbelievable. 
 -They're not married yet.

197
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,550
Xiong Fei. Luo Yuan. Blessing to you both. Come on, cheers.

198
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,831
- Thank you. 
 - Bless you, cheers.

199
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,540
She said thank you.

200
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,270
I'm lucky to have you guys as my friends.

201
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,720
Xiong Fei, you understand sign language!

202
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,908
I'm still learning.

203
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,998
When can I have someone to treat me like this?

204
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,250
Alright, that's enough. Let me have my dinner, please.

205
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,340
Look at the expression in her eyes! I don't want to eat.

206
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,780
Ding Dingding, are you a bullet comment?

207
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,630
I don't want to argue with you today. You're annoying.

208
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,501
I almost forgot it due to your interruption.

209
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:06,890
I think Xiong Fei's little diner... we'd better think about how to make it booming.

210
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,230
Think about it. What should we do in case your brother plays some tricks again?

211
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:19,780
Don't you major in business management? Do you have any ideas?

212
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,750
Actually, word-of-mouth communication may be the best way for Xiong Fei's little diner.

213
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,620
Or we can make it an internet celebrity restaurant.

214
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,320
- Or... 
 - I think that's good.

215
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,070
Being popular on the internet.

216
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,430
Let's see.

217
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,680
I have my idea now.

218
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,376
I'll show you a surprise.

219
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,290
Okay. Thank you so much.

220
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,354
Thank you, Miss Ding.

221
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:48,038
No worries.

222
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,900
Here we are.

223
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,530
You have training tomorrow morning.

224
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,730
Just go back home.

225
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,110
Have you forgotten something?

226
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,762
You're not a very good girlfriend.

227
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,554
What?

228
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,762
We've spent four hours together since we entered Chang Ba.

229
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,676
These four hours with you were the best four hours of my life.

230
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:37,450
I hope that every minute in our future

231
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:43,266
can be as happy as these four hours.

232
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,420
Zhan Yan,

233
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,348
I'd like to thank God for bringing you to me.

234
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,830
All right, it's time to leave.

235
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,520
See you.

236
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,370
Goodbye.

237
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,870

238
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,000

239
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,900

240
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,900
Yuan Yuan.

241
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,494
You came back so late.

242
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,920
Yuan Yuan.

243
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,432
Don't hate me, please.

244
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:13,646
I did everything just for you.

245
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,768
 I know.

246
00:26:16,768 --> 00:26:22,460
 But I don't want you to have Xiong Fei make a choice between me and his rescue career.

247
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,517
Since he chose you, you should be the most important to him.

248
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,710
Recently you've always been with the rescue team.

249
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,720
I hope it doesn't affect your work.

250
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,264
Don't worry, I've asked for a leave from the law office.

251
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,084
Black tea or green tea?

252
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:57,900
- Black tea, please. 
 - Okay.

253
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,150
Luo Ben,

254
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:05,280
it's obvious you're very serious about rescue services. You're committed.

255
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:09,500
But your integration into the group still needs more time.

256
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,810
Don't be too anxious.

257
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,770
Lately, our teammates have a small complaint,

258
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,148
but not for you personally.

259
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:22,540
They just miss Xiong Fei very much.

260
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,000
Xiong Fei has been with us for so many years.

261
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,870
We finished various missions and saved people together.

262
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,082
We're like brothers.

263
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,380
I understand.

264
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:42,868
After all, Xiong Fei and Falcon both left because of me.

265
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:46,910
It's understandable that they have complaints and blame me.

266
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,710
Fine.

267
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:54,800
Captain, I hope you can give me more missions as many as possible.

268
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,570
I'd like to shoulder more responsibilities in the team.

269
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,320
You're experienced. Please give me your advice as for expertise.

270
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,810
No problem. Only if you want to learn it.

271
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:11,798
I've already drunk your tea, then I can be your disciple now.

272
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,880
That's your point, huh? You didn't take a sip yet.

273
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,208
It's not that easy to be my disciple.

274
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,370
I think you'd better agree, because we'll be a family sooner or later.

275
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,222
Zhan Yan is my girlfriend now.

276
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,090
You've gone too far.

277
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:40,278
You want to be both my disciple and take my girl away.

278
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:45,556
Neither of them is an easy task, especially the second one.

279
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:51,426
Listen. I'll always keep an eye on you for my daughter as a father.

280
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:57,578
I'm not afraid of anything since I dare to chase Zhan Yan.

281
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,060

282
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,790

283
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,990
That's amazing, Ding Dingding.

284
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,990
I didn't expect you to be good at car painting.

285
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:23,100
I'm good at a wide range of things.

286
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,770
If it were not for my mom's constraints, I would be a surrealistic artist somehow.

287
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:29,860
Or more likely to be sur-not-realistic?

288
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,270
Would you shut up?

289
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,770
Don't hit me.

290
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,270
Well, now it's your showtime.

291
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,300
Sir, one portion.

292
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,614
- Here you are.   -  Thank you.

293
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,161
- Welcome next time.  
 - Okay.

294
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:43,140
Two portions, please.

295
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,090
Two, right? Okay, wait a moment.

296
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,581
- One portion. 
 -  I want two portions, sir. 
 - Smells good.

297
00:29:47,581 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm queuing up.

298
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,408
It seems fresh.

299
00:29:50,408 --> 00:29:53,500
Is the shop owner from Light Chaser? I've seen him in the news.

300
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,580
Really?

301
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,860
- Smells yummy. 
 - Nice.

302
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,010
You're definitely right. The shop owner was a rescue team member.

303
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,881
- If the dining car is not here, 
  - No.1, right?

304
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:02,510
it would be used for rescue.

305
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,950
The rescue team!

306
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,540
No wonder he's well-known.

307
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,620
- That's a very hard job. He's a hero. 
 - Yours, please.

308
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,770
- We must come more frequently. 
 - Yes.

309
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:12,250
One more second.

310
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,820
They really have a better business.

311
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,720
My strategy seems to be correct.

312
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,780
You're just boasting. It's my contribution.

313
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,160
 I'll go upstairs now.

314
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:53,660
Yuan Yuan, I hope you won't misunderstand your brother.

315
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,170
 Xiong Fei, are you sure that you're leaving the team?

316
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,732
 Your worries as a brother are reasonable.

317
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,220
 Congratulations, you have passed my test.

318
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,100
 From now on, I won't intervene in your decision

319
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,916
 about whether to stay in the rescue team or not.

320
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,200
 Giving up the work was my own choice.

321
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,624
 I'll take good care of Luo Yuan and not make her worry.

322
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,300
 Okay.

323
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,880
 I hope you remember what you said today.

324
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,440
 If you let her down, I won't forgive you.

325
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,206
You have a good brother, so you're supposed to be happy.

326
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,300
You're back, Yuan.

327
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,100
What happened?

328
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,300
Did Xiong Fei make you unhappy?

329
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,300
Yuan?

330
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,900
 Brother, sorry.

331
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,300
 I know everything now.

332
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,700
At least Xiong Fei has nice cooking skills.

333
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,600
I don't need to worry about your diet then.

334
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,932
 Meals made by you will always be the best for me.

335
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
Promise me to never change the ranking.

336
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,800
 Of course.

337
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,090
All right, go wash your hands.

338
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,900
Our feast is ready.

339
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,300
Look. This is your favorite sour-sweet fish.

340
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,800
Let me pour the gravy and get it ready for lunch.

341
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,500
Looks good, right?

342
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,900
I've already sugared it.

343
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,100
If you add more it will be too sweet.

344
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,200
When did my Yuan become so addicted to sweetness?

345
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,100
Too sweet!

346
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,100
- Which one do you prefer, chicken or beef? 
 - Beef.

347
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,500
Oolong tea or green tea?

348
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,600
Coffee.

349
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,500
Just drink oolong tea with me.

350
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,900
- Oranges or apples? 
 - Grapes.

351
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,200
Let me pick up some oranges with vitamin C.

352
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,400
Why do you ask me since you've decided?

353
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,100
Shall we go to your home or mine tonight?

354
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,700
 Yuan is not at home.

355
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,500
What are you talking about?

356
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Cooking, I mean.

357
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,300
What are you thinking about?

358
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,000
Nothing. I'm also talking about that.

359
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
What are you laughing at? Stop it.

360
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,600
Fine, I'll stop.

361
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,900
A real story?

362
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:10,800
"Miss Ding will always be beautiful and gorgeous.

363
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,500
Fans of Ding Dingding."

364
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,100
What's this?

365
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,800
Look! I have my fans.

366
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,200
I'm popular!

367
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,400
What are these?

368
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,900
Lipstick.

369
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,900
So many of them! Why not distribute them to everyone?

370
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,500
- Hey... 
 - Get out.

371
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,900
Why are you so stingy? You have so many of them...

372
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,700
Leave or not?

373
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,000
Hurry up.

374
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,700
Don't come into my office hereafter. Leave, now.

375
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,800
You're too stingy.

376
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,800
Come on, just take it. Everybody has gifts.

377
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,600
Send them to your girlfriend or sisters.

378
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Thank you.

379
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,100
I have only one requirement.

380
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,200
Offer me more materials, guys.

381
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,500
No problem!

382
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,400
- Dingding, you really did a wonderful job. 
 - Of course.

383
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,200
- Don't worry. 
 - She's a great artist!

384
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,600
- She'll be known by everybody soon. 
 - Yes.

385
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,000
I like your comments. One more for you.

386
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank you.

387
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
I want it, too. I want another for my mom.

388
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,900
Okay. Share them by yourselves.

389
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,200
Thank you, Dingding.

390
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,540
- Brother Peng. 
 - Save some for me.

391
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,900
Why don't you take one?

392
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,200
It's for women. Why should I take one?

393
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,600
- Well... 
 - Save one for me, guys.

394
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,600
Go back and send it to your wife.

395
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,700
There will be less criticism for you tonight.

396
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,400
Here. I have an extra one.

397
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,300
You don't understand.

398
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,700
Love hides under beating and scolding. Don't you know that?

399
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,500
Checking goods?

400
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,700
You scared me!

401
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,300
- Is it for me? 
 - Yes.

402
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,600
A lipstick?

403
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,900
Xiang Man'er? Never heard of this brand.

404
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,600
My teammate gave it to me. It can't be terrible.

405
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,500
Who gave it to you?

406
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,200
What a generous guy.

407
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What happened to you?

408
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,900
Xiong Fei quit the rescue team.

409
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,100
I thought it was Luo Ben who forced him,

410
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,600
but it turned out to be a girl who made him quit when I asked him.

411
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,200
He seems to be a little dull.

412
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,800
Against my expectations, he is such a romantic man.

413
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,500
Is that romantic?

414
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,500
It's nothing but a relationship. The cost is too high.

415
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,900
So you think that women are less important than rescue, right?

416
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,600
You misunderstand me again. I don't mean that.

417
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,700
So what do you mean?

418
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,900
They're not the same thing. How can you compare them?

419
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,500
Why can't I?

420
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,300
Well... you get angry again.

421
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Check the goods by yourself.

422
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,190
Just some goods.

423
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,500
I'll order them.

424
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,700
Here are your desserts.

425
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,400
You're really omniscient.

426
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,200
Taste it.

427
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,200
Isn't it a basic skill that a boyfriend should have?

428
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,600
So is there an advanced one?

429
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,800
Take it easy. You'll come to know in the future.

430
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:52,794
I have plenty of time.

431
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:56,000
So are you good at pleasing girls?

432
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,100
In my whole life I could only please two girls.

433
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,400
The first one is Luo Yuan,

434
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,700
and the second one is you.

435
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,900
What?

436
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,600
A mission has come.

437
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,200
Two kids were lost in the mountains.

438
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,200
We're going to help the police.

439
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,900
Let me come with you.

440
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,400
It's dangerous there.

441
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
I'm a doctor. I can help you.

442
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,500
Okay.

443
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:47,958
According to the weather forecast, it's going to rain in your region.

444
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,900
It brings more difficulty to our rescue.

445
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,400
Remind everyone to make mental preparations.

446
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,150
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

447
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,700
 Can you work together?

448
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,400
- No problem. 
 - No problem.

449
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,700
 That's good.

450
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,100
I blamed you unjustly for Xiong Fei's issue.

451
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,900
I apologize.

452
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,600
Assemble here.

453
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,400
Yesterday someone saw two kids entering the mountain at noon,

454
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,100
and they still haven't come back.

455
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,520
What kind of clothes were they wearing when they left home?

456
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,400
Their grandmother said Tingting wore a yellow coat and black jeans.

457
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,500
Pengpeng wore a white pullover and a pair of black-gray trousers.

458
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,100
You didn't know they were missing?

459
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,900
We just finished work in town this morning.

460
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,400
We didn't even get to see our kids.

461
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,200
I beg you, please. Please find them. Please.

462
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,800
Could you think about the places they might wander off to?

463
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,200
On the back hill were some wild waxberries, and Tingting always goes to pick them.

464
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,000
But I searched it when I came back. Nobody was there.

465
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,900
Don't worry. We're planning the rescue,

466
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,700
and we have the Light Chaser Rescue Team helping us.

467
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,600
They're experienced in field rescue.

468
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,100
Once we get any news, we'll tell you immediately.

469
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

470
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,640
Lu, confirm these two positions immediately.

471
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,300
Yes, sir.

472
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,200
 I'm the chief commander of this operation.

473
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,000
 Luo Ben will be in charge of the scene.

474
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,300
- Him? 
  - Yes.

475
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,700
 He has no experience in it.

476
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,600
 Peng, you assist him.

477
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,700
Okay. I'll coordinate with him.

478
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,700
And Zhan Yan is also here.

479
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,600
Arrange for her to stay with the left-behind family members to take a better look at the situation.

480
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
 - Maybe there are other useful clues. 
 - Yes, sir.

481
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:58,000
 Everyone, please coordinate with the police.

482
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 - Let's go! 
 - Yes, sir!  
 - Yes!

483
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
Let's set off!

484
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,200
See you later.

485
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,900
Wait a second.

486
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,600
Take this. You may need it.

487
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,400
Wait for me to come back.

488
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,100
Be careful.

489
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,500
Report from Snail.

490
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,000
 The hill in the east has been searched.

491
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,200
 No targets there.

492
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,200
Wait!

493
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,400
Tingting!

494
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,300
- Prepare to rappel. 
 - Okay.

495
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,170
Tingting...

496
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,500
Report from Luo Ben.

497
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,000
We've found the suspected target down the hill.

498
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:26,030

499
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,700
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

500
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:43,426
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

501
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,664
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

502
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,700
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

503
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:06,900
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

504
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,600
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

505
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:21,900
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

506
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,200
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

507
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:38,000
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

508
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,200
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

509
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:52,900
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

510
00:44:52,900 --> 00:45:00,500
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

511
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,300
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

512
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,100
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

513
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,800
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

514
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,500
♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

515
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:19,200
♫  I can't fly  ♫

516
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,900
♫  But I can look up  ♫

517
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:31,000
♫  I'm always on the road chasing the light  ♫
