16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,360
What have you been

17
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,440
up to lately?

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,330
I signed up

19
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,170
the training of
a non-profit rescue team.

20
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,810
It's good to join
a non-profit organization.

21
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,480
I approve of your choice,

22
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,890
and I'm happy for you.

23
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,810
But of all the non-profit projects,

24
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,330
why did you have to take

25
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,840
on such a dangerous occupation?

26
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,330
What if your life

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,890
is in danger?

28
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:02,410
Have you thought about it?

29
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:02,970
Mom.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,840
The rescue team

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,440
takes self-protection very seriously.

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,690
They believe that only
by keeping ourselves safe can we…

33
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,080
I know what kind of missions

34
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,840
your rescue team executed.

35
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,970
When you're in those dangerous places,

36
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,130
your safety will be

37
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,000
out of your control.

38
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,650
I don't care what others do,

39
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:17,810
I

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,970
don't allow it.

41
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,600
Mom.

42
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,160
Please don't be dictatorial.

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
I'm your mother.

44
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,130
Every decision I make

45
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,210
is in your best interest.

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,280
Ever since I was a little kid,

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,040
this has been

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,690
your justification

49
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,880
for all your arrangements.

50
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,280
My college.

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,490
My major.

52
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,440
My friends.

53
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
These are all your orders.

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,760
But this time,

55
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,090
I want to be my own boss.

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,090
You want to be your own boss, huh?

57
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,560
Yes.

58
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,760
Then how about

59
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,410
you manage the company well?

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
Mom,

61
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,090
do you have to do this to me?

62
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,370
You're spoiled.

63
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,370
You should

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,530
learn to take some responsibility.

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,280
Up here. Here.

66
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,370
The rain

67
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,530
is on and off all the time.

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,880
I'm worried

69
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
that our son will get wet.

70
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
He'll be fine.

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,930
Don't worry about him.

72
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,600
He's not a child anymore.

73
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,410
It's okay.

74
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,530
He's home.

75
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,600
- You're home.
- Dad.

76
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,600
We'll have fried dumplings for lunch.

77
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,600
They will be soon done.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Mom,

79
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,560
I had lunch outside.

80
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,600
You'll have them tomorrow.

81
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,210
OK.

82
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
Have some fruits.

83
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,210
You want to work overtime?

84
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,370
Wow, you are watching

85
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,410
a popular drama.

86
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,090
Your sister

87
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,560
recommended it to me
on the phone yesterday.

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,970
She's a fan of it as well.

89
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,040
I tell you what,

90
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,210
it's a lot of fun.

91
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,160
Son,

92
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,370
you don't get to eat regularly

93
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,690
as a deliveryman.

94
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,530
It's bad for your stomach.

95
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,650
I'm fine, Mom.

96
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,040
You know I've got a robust body.

97
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,160
Also,

98
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,600
I work hard, I earn more.

99
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,130
So I can take good care of you.

100
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,410
Well, good.

101
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,210
We'll be even happier

102
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,370
if you get a girlfriend.

103
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,930
He's very busy.

104
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,690
He won't have time for a relationship.

105
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,410
You said

106
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,600
it wasn't easy

107
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,280
to get a job nowadays.

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,160
If he doesn't have a job,

109
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,040
he'll have less chance

110
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,280
to get a girlfriend.

111
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,490
I'm not saying he's jobless.

112
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,880
I said, he's busy.

113
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,250
I know my son.

114
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,210
I tell you what,

115
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,960
many girls are attracted to him.

116
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,810
Your son, huh?

117
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,300

I didn't.

What's up?

His hands are injured.

141

I'm always proud

of my vocation.

166

But

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,930
When someone makes a choice

176
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,130
at a life-and-death moment,

177
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,250
you can respect him
for his virtue,

178
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,250
but you can't blame him
for his selfishness.

179
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,960
It's human nature to stay alive.

180
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,250
So people instinctively

181
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,610
choose to protect themselves.

182
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,170
There's no right or wrong in this.

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,730
Our country pays a lot

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,810
to nurture every single doctor.

185
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,170
You are a doctor.

186
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,850
Only in the hospital

187
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,730
can you provide the most value

188
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,400
and save more lives.

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,370
You can't just

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,170
leave like this.

191
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
Sir,

192
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,000
I really don't have the courage

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,400
to stay here anymore.

194
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,130
When you just got into college,

195
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,850
your family had no money for you.

196
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,400
You came to my office

197
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,810
and told me

198
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,080
that you wanted to finish college.

199
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,640
You search your heart

200
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,930
for your commitment

201
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,730
and courage

202
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,130
at the beginning.

203
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,660
(Operation Room)

204
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,820
(Operation Room)

205
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,370
It's my operation,

206
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I'll do it myself.

207
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's begin.

208
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,780
(Linjiang Central Hospital)

209
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,020
(Mingmei Media)

210
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,680
What a crappy company.

211
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,400
It should be shut down one day.

212
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,040
Hello.

213
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,370
May I ask

214
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,880
if Zhou Mingming is at work?

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,730
Not yet.

216
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,280
Unbelievable.

217
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,850
He'll be fired sooner or later.

218
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,970
What is it?

219
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,450
Why must you call me early
in the morning?

220
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,330
What?

221
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,580
(Yesterday Is History
Enrich Your Life Today)

222
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,040
You're new, right?

223
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,450
I didn't see you before.

224
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,610
I came here a couple of times.

225
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,970
It's the first time I see you.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,610
You look glamorous.

227
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,850
Do you work here as well?

228
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,610
Which department are you in?

229
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,130
I…

230
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Comic department, I guess.

231
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,570
Comic department?

232
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
How come I never

233
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,450
heard of this department before?

234
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,760
Who's your boss?

235
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,640
Good question.

236
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,370
I don't even know

237
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,730
what his name is.

238
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,800
They call him Director Ming.

239
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,730
I can tell that he's a bad boss.

240
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,610
I came several times,

241
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,640
but I never met him.

242
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,970
You may not know this,

243
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,370
but Director Ming

244
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,920
is the president's son.

245
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,090
I know.

246
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,330
I mean he's incompetent

247
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,490
to be a director.

248
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:42,680
I shouldn't

249
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,850
work under Director Ming,

250
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,850
I should go straight to the president.

251
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,760
Why would you want
to see the president?

252
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,490
I should file

253
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,880
a complaint to the president.

254
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,760
You see.

255
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
It's not right

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,610
to put his son

257
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,760
in charge of such

258
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,850
an important department.

259
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,730
He doesn't have what it takes

260
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,730
to be a director.

261
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,730
He's ruining

262
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,730
my comic career.

263
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:12,730
Ma'am,

264
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,250
did you see the president?

265
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,130
I did.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Just between you and me,

267
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,280
what is the president like?

268
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:25,520
Is she

269
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,570
a stern old lady?

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,490
Or

271
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
perhaps he's

272
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,280
a geezer,

273
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,130
am I right?

274
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,040
Your coffee is ready.

275
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,210
I'll make you a cup.

276
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,970
No, thanks.

277
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,520
Ma'am.

278
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,570
Look what you did!

279
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,130
I'll clean your dress up.

280
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,400
Relax. Relax.

281
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,130
Sorry, sorry. I'm really sorry.

282
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,450
You'll see me in my office.

283
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,000
You…

284
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,330
You are in real trouble.

285
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,210
Could she be the president?

286
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,920
Mingming,

287
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,880
our company has such a broad
scope of businesses,

288
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,610
you're interested in none of them

289
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,450
but comic.

290
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,250
Fine,

291
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,490
even if it's a new business

292
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,040
that you developed,

293
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,160
tell me,

294
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,640
what are you going to do next?

295
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:40,640
Mom,

296
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,880
comics are super

297
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,490
trendy online.

298
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,850
How trendy?

299
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,640
Have you done a market survey?

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,570
Have you done a promotion plan

301
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,400
or a development strategy?

302
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,160
How does it earn money?
How does it grow?

303
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,280
What's its potential?

304
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,760
Ma'am.

305
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,680
Mingming just bought the copyrights,

306
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,450
everything else is in process.

307
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,250
Don't you defend him.

308
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,680
OK.

309
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,880
If you're really into comics,

310
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,250
well, you have one chance
to do it well.

311
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,850
There will be a comic department.

312
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,090
You'll be in charge.

313
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,450
But

314
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,160
I have certain requirements

315
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,760
for the yields
of the comic department.

316
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,160
Won't you grab a pen?

317
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,920
Oh, I need to write it down?

318
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,450
Mom, just tell me. I'll keep it in mind.

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,520
OK.

320
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,850
By the end of the first month,

321
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,090
click rate, topic popularity

322
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,090
and top-search count

323
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,370
are to come out on top

324
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,370
in the IP product ranking.

325
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,040
By the end of the third month,

326
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,450
get into the top 10.

327
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,210
By the end of the sixth month,

328
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,370
the comics are to be serialized,

329
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,730
and an offprint is to be punished.

330
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,280
Also,

331
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,450
within this year,

332
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,570
the IP comprehensive incubation

333
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,000
is to be completed.

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,610
So?

335
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,000
You get me?

336
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,090
Mom,

337
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,490
do you honestly

338
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,920
treat comics as an IP product?

339
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,520
If you can't achieve your goal,

340
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,730
and if I don't see any results,

341
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,760
all the investments

342
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,640
in the comic business

343
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,880
will be deducted
from your annual salary.

344
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,800
That's all.

345
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,330
I-It's…

346
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,490
We didn't have any experience
in the comic business.

347
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,210
We know nothing about it.

348
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,640
You know
what the president is like.

349
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,090
Every department

350
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,370
has to meet her requirements.

351
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,520
But you see the targets.

352
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,250
How do we achieve them?

353
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:26,280
You think I can't do it?

354
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,610
No.

355
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,880
The president only

356
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,210
wants you to admit
that it's out of your depths,

357
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,490
and that will be the end of it.

358
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,570
Just call it quits.

359
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,250
Well, I happen

360
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,330
to enjoy challenges.

361
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,640
No experience, no groundwork.

362
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,610
But it makes me get more excited.

363
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,280
The comic department
is now officially founded.

364
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,160
The decision has been made.

365
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:50,340
(In-patient)

366
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,610
Yuan,

367
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,450
you keep packing.

368
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,450
I need to do something.

369
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,850
We're going to leave here.

370
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,960
Where are you going?

371
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:12,920
I…

372
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,920
I don't feel right

373
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,090
on my back.

374
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,130
I'll go see the doctor.

375
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,640
No, no, no.

376
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,570
It's no big deal. I'll be right back.

377
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,810
I saw your medical record.

378
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,960
I think you're pretty much recovered.

379
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,440
So you have been

380
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,640
secretly paying

381
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,480
attention to my injury, Dr. Zhan.

382
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,720
Yes.

383
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,400
Ouch.

384
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,440
Is it always this painful?

385
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
No, only when you patted me.

386
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,330
I'll sterilize

387
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,530
your wound again.

388
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,290
It's not healed anyway.

389
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,570
It may hurt a little. Bear with it.

390
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:55,680
I'm good now.

391
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,920
When you are out of the hospital,

392
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,480
you'll keep a light diet.

393
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,770
No water on the wound.

394
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,810
Have your bandage renewed regularly.

395
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,530
OK.

396
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Dr. Zhan,

397
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,960
will you come over this weekend?

398
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,570
Why?

399
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,330
We had a deal.

400
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,330
If we escape death,

401
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,440
you'll try out my cooking

402
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,880
at my place this weekend.

403
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,640
Sure.

404
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,770
At 6:00 PM.

405
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,240
Going out?

406
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,130
I need to speak to you.

407
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,810
I should

408
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:51,810
have listened to your advice.

409
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,810
They keep

410
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,770
ruining my work.

411
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,290
This is insulting.

412
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,090
Please help me out.

413
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,160
Is there a way for me

414
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,290
to end the contract?

415
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,610
It's explicitly written

416
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,010
here in the contract.

417
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,610
Just pay them.

418
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,090
I don't have so much money

419
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,880
to pay them right now,

420
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,130
otherwise, why would I
ask for your help?

421
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,960
If my cousin knows this,

422
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,770
she'll give

423
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,240
me an earful.

424
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,440
You haven't told your cousin about it?

425
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
I was too afraid to tell her.

426
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,090
Ding Dingding,

427
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,370
usually, people

428
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,530
pay me consultant fees.

429
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:26,810
But

430
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,850
seeing that we're friends,

431
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,400
you can make the payment
in another form.

432
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,200
Come on, Mr. Luo.

433
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,370
You just got attracted

434
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,370
to my cousin.

435
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,720
Now, your eyes

436
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,570
are on me?

437
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,200
I don't think it's appropriate.

438
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,090
I say comic artist

439
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,610
is a suitable job for you,

440
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:46,810
as you're pretty imaginative.

441
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,050
Fill it out.

442
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,160
Questionnaire on Zhan Yan's hobbies.

443
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,570
Any allergies?

444
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,200
Her favorite…

445
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:06,330
Alright.

446
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,240
One answer

447
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,570
for one contract.

448
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,050
Do you have so many contracts?

449
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,480
I'll have more in the future.

450
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,090
Fine.

451
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:18,850
Deal.

452
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,090
Favorite fruit?

453
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,370
Durian.

454
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,330
Favorite flower?

455
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,160
Daisy.

456
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:30,810
Are you finished?

457
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,570
Let me see.

458
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,810
Not yet.

459
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,480
I see

460
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,530
you're very dedicated.

461
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,570
I think

462
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,090
we may be family in the future.

463
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,570
Are you sure

464
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:41,680
you'll be so petty?

465
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,370
If you turn "maybe" into "will be",

466
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,480
then I won't be petty.

467
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,530
Never mind. I'll be counting on myself.

468
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,960
Are you finished?

469
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,770
One more minute.

470
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,680
Come on.

471
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

472
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,240
I'll deal with it myself.

473
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,480
Favorite fruit.

474
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,640
Durian.

475
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,610
(Starting from tomorrow,)

476
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,720
(you will clock in every day)

477
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,130
(at 10:00 AM sharp.)

478
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,370
What are these weird hobbies?

479
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,680
What's wrong with this company?

480
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,680
I'm an artist.

481
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,090
I don't clock in.

482
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,010
It's time for you to fulfill your promise.

483
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,960
Tell me what to do.

484
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,960
I warned you

485
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,200
to learn

486
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,640
about the work pattern,

487
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,200
but you didn't listen.

488
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,330
Now, the contract was signed,

489
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,440
and you took the money,

490
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
what else can you do?

491
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,440
I suggest you

492
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,200
just clock in and out every day

493
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,570
like any other employees.

494
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,480
So this is your conclusion?

495
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,960
You asked me to review the contract,

496
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,400
and I did

497
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,130
with much care.

498
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,440
Is there any problem?

499
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,010
I don't think it's a good deal.

500
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,480
Give it back to me.

501
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,050
It is sold.

502
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:51,960
No refund.

503
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,570
I'll tell my cousin.

504
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,400
How dare you?

505
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,240
I will.

506
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:55,880
Try me.

507
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,570
Yuan.

508
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,570
Practicing?

509
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,010
Keep it up.

510
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,330
Keep it up.

511
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,130
Yuan.

512
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,810
Would you like to buy

513
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,570
some new clothes in the mall?

514
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,530
Yuan,

515
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,290
we're out of tissues.

516
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,530
Go buy some.

517
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,880
Yuan,

518
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,090
it's the weekend.

519
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,290
Don't just stay at home.

520
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,720
Hang out with your friends.

521
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,770
Oh, you like

522
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,880
that crayfish pasta, right?

523
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,330
I'll give you the money.

524
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,680
You'll treat your friends to it.

525
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,200
Look.

526
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,180
(Transfer)

527
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,090
Brother.

528
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
You're expecting a visitor?

529
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,050
How do you know?

530
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,720
Just tell me to leave you alone.

531
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,050
You got your money. Just go.

532
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,720
Move.

533
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,720
No beating around the bush
the next time.

534
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,370
Good luck.

535
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,010
Just go.

536
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,720
Naughty girl.

537
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,140
(Job Vacancy)

538
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,400
(Busy?)

539
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,240
(Can we have)

540
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,200
(dinner together tonight?)

541
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,960
Miss.

542
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,810
You came to see Xiong Fei again?

543
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,160
Xiong Fei left.

544
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,480
He doesn't work here anymore.

545
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,480
Didn't he tell you?

546
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Miss Luo.

547
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,130
Are you waiting for Xiong Fei?

548
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,160
You have an appointment?

549
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,200
What if he doesn't come?

550
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,010
That fool.

551
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,400
Xiong Fei.

552
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Come to the team immediately.

553
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
It's urgent.

554
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,920
Alright. Bye.

555
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,090
These

556
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,240
need to be polished,

557
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,570
or they'll wear off quickly.

558
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,810
Thank you.

559
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:37,720
Falcon.

560
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:39,440
Falcon.

561
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:41,370
Hey.

562
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,160
What's this?

563
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,570
It's…

564
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
Oh, it's for Miss Luo.

565
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,720
Miss Luo, look.

566
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,810
The wontons that Xiong Fei made.

567
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,770
They're very nice.

568
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,050
You don't get these out there.

569
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,330
Uh.

570
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,810
C-Can I have one box?

571
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,570
OK, OK.

572
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,850
Why didn't you text me back?

573
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,640
I was busy.

574
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,130
New job?

575
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,090
I know everything.

576
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Miss Luo,

577
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,480
I'm sure you're busy in your life, too.

578
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,130
Please don't come here anymore.

579
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,050
You don't like me here?

580
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,370
No.

581
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,640
No.

582
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,090
It's not what I mean.

583
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,440
Then why are you avoiding me?

584
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,200
Why would you want

585
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,530
to be my friend?

586
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,330
You don't want to be my friend.

587
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,160
Then why were you by my side

588
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,010
when my brother had the accident,

589
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,570
and now you just ignored my message?

590
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,440
This is hurtful.

591
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,090
Friends reply to messages.

592
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,090
Is it cool to not reply to messages?

593
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,850
I truly want to be your friend.

594
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,400
Why are you so cold

595
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,570
to your friend?

596
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,880
I…

597
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,090
Come on. Don't…

598
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,810
Don't be mad, please.

599
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,960
It's my bad.

600
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,400
I…

601
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:40,960
I promise

602
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,440
I'll text you back at once.

603
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,370
I'll be the first to text you.

604
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,850
Try my wontons.

605
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,090
They're good, right?

606
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,130
Don't you want to open a shop?

607
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:54,850
Open a shop?

608
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,640
You and your sister

609
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,090
do keep your house tidy.

610
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:02,610
I don't really let

611
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,850
Luo Yuan do the housework.

612
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,400
She's a girl.

613
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,200
I just spoil her.

614
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,640
With great power
comes great responsibility.

615
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,130
You do balance your work
and life well.

616
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,960
There aren't many good men like me

617
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,570
who have a good career

618
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,960
and take good care of his family.

619
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,960
Mr. Luo,

620
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,480
are you selling yourself?

621
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,130
I must sell myself

622
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,960
to any interested clients.

623
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,530
What about you, Dr. Zhan?

624
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,400
Are you interested?

625
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,880
Let me see the dishes.

626
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:47,880
Sit down, please.

627
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,290
What do you think?

628
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,290
Pretty nice.

629
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,960
These are only appetizers.

630
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,200
This is the main course.

631
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,680
I assume

632
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,370
it's your specialty.

633
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,840
Open the lid.

634
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,240
Zhan Yan,

635
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,800
when I was told you were trapped,

636
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,280
I was so afraid that I'd lose you.

637
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,410
I regret

638
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,680
that I didn't

639
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,240
face up to my true feelings earlier.

640
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,200
Yet, I thank fate

641
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,410
for offering me the opportunity

642
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,610
to have this

643
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,800
unforgettable piece of memory.

644
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,610
Zhan Yan,

645
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,050
I like you.

646
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,280
And what's your answer?

647
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,410
I never thought about it before.

648
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,840
Let's have dinner first.

649
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,490
No worries.

650
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,970
You take your time.

651
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,240
How is it?

652
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,320
Is it good?

653
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:39,890
It's pretty good.

654
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,050
What do you mean, pretty good?

655
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,970
That sounds so insincere.

656
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,610
Let me try.

657
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,490
How good is it?

658
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,970
This is how you should comment.

659
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,240
It has

660
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,320
a rich texture.

661
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,570
It's salty, savory.

662
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,240
Just wonderful.

663
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,410
I'm going to the bathroom.

664
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:48,020
(Zhang's Wontons)

665
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,160
Hello.

666
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,760
Seven?

667
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,680
It-It's mine.

668
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:08,970
Thanks.

669
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,530
It's hot. Be careful.

670
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,760
Thank you.

671
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,890
You want me to take some notes, right?

672
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,450
Here, try it.

673
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:17,720
It's so thoughtful of you.

674
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:18,680
Thank you.

675
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,640
Here. All served.

676
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,280
Here.

677
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,280
It's hot. Be careful.

678
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:37,840
Here's yours.

679
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,680
Please enjoy.

680
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,200
Thank you.

681
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,780
(Mingmei Media)

682
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,280
Good morning.

683
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,800
Morning.

684
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,320
Mr. Zhou, you're quite early today.

685
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:51,890
Morning.

686
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,360
Good morning, Ling Yiqin.

687
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,090
Ding Ding…

688
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,280
Mr. Zhou.

689
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,140
(Mingmei Media)

690
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,200
Ding Dingding.

691
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,970
You startled me.

692
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,200
I thought it was my boss.

693
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,360
You are late.

694
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,090
Duh. I overslept.

695
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:10,840
Did the boss come?

696
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,800
He did,

697
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,970
and he has waited
for you for two hours.

698
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:14,930
Won't you apologize to him?

699
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,890
Why would he wait for me?

700
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,160
You're late on the first day.

701
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,970
You'll receive a penalty.

702
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,050
I'm only a few minutes late.

703
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,280
How much?

704
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,490
I don't remember

705
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,240
that I saw this before.

706
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,130
The company got it for you.

707
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,930
Ding Dingding.

708
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,050
Thank you for your hard work.

709
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:35,840
Our boss

710
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,930
seems to take me too seriously.

711
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,410
It's 11:06.

712
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,050
Ding Dingding,

713
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,490
according to your hourly pay,

714
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:41,360
you'll be deducted 10 yuan

715
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,200
for every minute late.

716
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,840
66 minutes.

717
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
That will be 660.

718
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,280
Come on.

719
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,490
I'm only a little late.

720
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,640
660 is too much.

721
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,450
Attendance time

722
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,010
affects the fortune of the company.

723
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,930
I'll make it 666.

724
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,720
A fortuitous number.

725
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,160
I think you're an idiot.

726
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,360
Wait a minute.

727
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,490
How do you know

728
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,360
how much the company pays me?

729
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,410
Because I'm in charge
of the office.

730
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,360
Come off it.

731
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,570
I honestly believed
I would lose money.

732
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:07,360
I was worried for a moment.

733
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,280
It is real.

734
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,490
You haven't got enough sleep, right?

735
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,570
Actually yes, and it's on you.

736
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,450
Alright, alright. Just go.

737
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,890
I'm busy. Leave me alone.

738
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,760
Work hard, and fast.

739
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,450
I got it.

740
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,970
Sorry, Miss Li.

741
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,570
I worked late last night,
so I got up late.

742
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,010
You get yourself ready

743
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,320
for the meeting soon.

744
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:35,090
A meeting?

745
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,680
Who wants a meeting?

746
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,720
Director Ming.

747
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,160
Finally,

748
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,680
I'll see the boss.

749
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,450
Miss Li,

750
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,130
I thought it was a meeting.

751
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,360
Only the two of us?

752
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,840
Miss Li?

753
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:51,530
Hey.

754
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,130
Are you allowed to sit here?

755
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,240
It's the boss's seat.

756
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,890
Director Ming, everybody's here.

757
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,130
Can the meeting begin?

758
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,760
Yes.

759
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Director Ming?

760
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,010
So you're Director Ming?

761
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,320
So your mom's the president?

762
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:12,720
The meeting has begun.

763
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,760
Let us not waste time.

764
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,640
I see, Zhou Mingming.

765
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:20,680
So you have been

766
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,360
behind the plot.

767
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,130
Miss Ding,

768
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,970
we're in a collaboration.

769
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,570
I'm not behind any plot.

770
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:27,410
Don't you

771
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:28,450
put on airs here.

772
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,530
Yes,

773
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,450
I admit that I offended you.

774
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,720
And it's okay
that you want to get even.

775
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,680
But do you have to spend all the effort

776
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,610
to pull this off?

777
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
Actually,

778
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,050
I see the talent in you.

779
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,570
Very funny.

780
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,090
You want games?

781
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,570
Well, I'm out.

782
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,610
Miss Ding.

783
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:43,410
When you're home,

784
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,680
please wire us the penal sum.

785
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,970
What penal sum?

786
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:48,720
Read the contract.

787
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,840
If Party B

788
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,360
breaks off the contract,

789
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,280
Party B is to return the down payment,

790
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,130
and pay three times as much as
the down payment as penalty.

791
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,490
We'll have a meeting, right?

792
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:01,890
Come on.

793
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:02,680
