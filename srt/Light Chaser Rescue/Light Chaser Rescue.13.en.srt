16
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,130
As we breathe recirculated air,

17
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,480
oxygen level

18
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,200
will decrease

19
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,920
and carbon dioxide level will increase.

20
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,000
When carbon dioxide level

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,920
is higher than 4%,

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,890
and oxygen level

23
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,000
is lower than 17%,

24
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,640
the human body will suffer from hypoxia,

25
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,050
which can lead to
pulmonary edema, cerebral edema,

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,530
electrolyte imbalance, shock,

27
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,760
and even brain death.

Dr. Zhan.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,600
Your pessimistic attitude

30
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,280
will affect me

31
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,250
and make me emotional too.

32
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,810
I'm trying really hard

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,370
to keep myself calm

34
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,130
and breathe normally.

35
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,410
What do you think

36
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,250
I should say?

37
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,040
You must believe

38
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,440
that people out there

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,970
are trying to save us.

40
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:53,880
Don't you notice

41
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,250
there is no sound here?

42
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,760
That means the mud is too thick.

43
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,930
Maybe we won't be able

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
to survive that long.

45
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,600
Should we

46
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,210
talk about something else?

47
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,160
If...

48
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,560
If we're going to die here,

49
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,410
why don't we

50
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,040
get to know each other before we do?

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,930
If we get out of here,

52
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,810
maybe

53
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,040
we will become Damon and Pythias.

54
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Do you want to

55
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,410
exchange secrets with me?

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,440
Actually,

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,250
it's not my first time

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,600
to be trapped in a place like this.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,720
I'm an earthquake orphan.

60
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,090
My parents

61
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,090
died in

62
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,810
the Qingsen Earthquake

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,130
25 years ago.

64
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,970
Do you remember
the training at that time?

65
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,930
I didn't mean to disobey.

66
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,880
It was because the situation

67
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,880
reminded me of my parents.

68
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,610
No wonder you're so good to Luo Yuan.

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,690
I treat Luo Yuan well

70
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,200
not because of the earthquake.

71
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,690
Luo Yuan is not my biological sister.

72
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,640
I was adopted

73
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,810
by Luo Yuan's parents.

74
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,640
Before the adoption,

75
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,760
I was staying
at Heart&Heart Welfare House,

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,250
the same one

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,490
Lele is at now.

78
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,850
Later,

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,730
my foster parents died.

80
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,250
Taking care of Luo Yuan

81
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,490
had become

82
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,880
the biggest motivation in my life.

83
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,370
So you've been working so hard

84
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,930
for her.

85
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,170
I don't allow myself

86
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,000
to slack off,

87
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,560
because it was all my fault

88
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,490
that Luo Yuan

89
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,490
became like this.

90
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,050
Yuan!

91
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,690
Yuan, what's wrong?

92
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,740
(Linjiang People's Hospital)

93
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,610
Sorry. It's all my fault.

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,490
You should hit me.

95
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,640
Later,

96
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,880
I worked hard

97
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,760
to make money.

98
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,610
I swore

99
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,930
to give Yuan

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,690
the best and happiest life.

101
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,000
I remember once

102
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,960
Yuan got sick

103
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,810
and was in need of surgery.

104
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,080
I didn't even have 50,000

105
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,810
to pay for the medical bills.

106
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,520
You know,

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,850
it was more suffocating

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,760
at that time than the two of us

109
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
being buried here.

110
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,000
From then on,

111
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,560
I have never

112
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,050
done any more pro bono work.

113
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,400
I only take business cases

114
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,930
and divorce cases.

115
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:56,370
I envy Luo Yuan.

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,170
She has a brother who loves her so much.

117
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,610
She's just a child without parents.

118
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,440
What is there to envy her?

119
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,320
Because I have nothing.

120
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,880
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
There is no need to be sorry.

122
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,560
I've been used to it.

123
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,560
When I was about five years old,

124
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,560
my mother died.

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,370
You wouldn't believe it.

126
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,130
It was also the Qingsen earthquake
that killed her.

127
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,000
So, I'm also

128
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,490
a victim of that earthquake.

129
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,000
We're getting close!

130
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:08,490
Stop the heavy machinery!

131
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:08,970
Hurry!

132
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:09,850
Use rescue shovels!

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,640
Yes!

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,090
Stop the heavy machinery!

135
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,130
Use rescue shovels!

136
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:14,520
Keep up!

137
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,970
Hurry up!

138
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:17,970
Hurry!

139
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
One time, a patient complained

140
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,210
that I had a bad attitude.

141
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,640
He said I must have lacked love
as a child.

142
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,520
I was so mad

143
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,330
and got in a big fight with him.

144
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,490
Later I thought about it,

145
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,880
he was right.

146
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
Smile.

147
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,570
Smile.

148
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,520
Good.

149
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,680
One, two, three.

150
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Mom!

151
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,680
Yan.

152
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,400
Good girl.

153
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,640
I'll check out first.

154
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,730
Hello, please wait for a moment.

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,490
Our staff need to

156
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,330
verify the information first.

157
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,850
What happened later?

158
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,130
The earthquake started.

159
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,280
My mom died.

160
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,760
Mom!

161
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,520
In fact, my childhood memories

162
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,000
are fragmentary.

163
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,090
I only remember

164
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,730
my dad found me

165
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,610
at the temporary shelter

166
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,730
with the little camel
my mom bought for me.

167
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,640
But my mom didn't come with him.

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,520
I thought

169
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
she died in the earthquake.

170
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,370
Later, my dad founded

171
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,640
a non-profit civil rescue organization

172
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,330
to provide public relief.

173
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,880
So,

174
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,330
your dad...

175
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,090
Your dad is Qing...

176
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,520
His full name

177
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,210
is Zhan Qingshan.

178
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:38,880
Well...

179
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,160
Did you have

180
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,210
some kind of problem later?

181
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,090
When I was in middle school...

182
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,980
(Zhan Qingshan,
the Everyday Hero in Qingsen Earthquake)

183
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:54,880
Didn't you say

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,880
that my mom was dead

185
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,250
when you saw her?

186
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,370
You liar.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,570
Yan.

188
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,920
Why didn't you save Mom first?

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,920
I did.

190
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,970
Then why

191
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:03,570
didn't she survive?

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,850
Why does the newspaper

193
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,250
say that you saved the little boy first?

194
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,330
I have lost my mom

195
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,040
while you are

196
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,730
the applaudable hero?

197
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,520
That's when I knew

198
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,130
my dad had the time

199
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,160
to save my mom,

200
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,970
but he chose to save someone else first

201
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,280
and then everything was too late.

202
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,040
My mom never had a chance

203
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,570
to give me that camel herself.

204
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,000
I guess...

205
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,000
Captain Qingshan

206
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,680
must have his own reason

207
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,250
to do that.

208
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,370
Maybe.

209
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,680
After all,

210
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm also a member of

211
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,000
the International Medical Rescue Team.

212
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,880
I'm fully aware

213
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,490
that people have little choice

214
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,210
in a catastrophe

215
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,000
like this,

216
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,330
but so what?

217
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,520
For me,

218
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,210
that was my mother.

219
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,210
My mother died.

220
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,570

221

Director Liu has an urgent call for you!

225
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,450
Hurry!

226
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,800
Everyone stop!

227
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,040
Stop now!

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,660
(Light Chaser Rescue)

229
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,610
- We just had a new evaluation.
- How is it?

230
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,800
The soil is sinking.

231
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,040
There is a danger of collapse inside!

232
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,570
I have to call it off!

233
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,370
What's more,

234
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,850
there's not much oxygen in there

235
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,130
based on time.

236
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,970
We just got the forecast

237
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,130
from the weather department.

238
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,330
A bigger rainstorm

239
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,280
is on the way.

240
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:26,970
Qingshan.

241
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,970
We don't have much time left.

242
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,100
Based on your experience,

243
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,580
what is your judgment now?

244
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,980

landslides and debris flow

246

247
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,820
It's very dangerous!

248
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,820
Director Liu,

249
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,940
you should evacuate with everyone,

250
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,300
and I'll stay!

251
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,220
- No, Captain!
- You can't do that!

252
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,180
I can't leave!

253
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,740
Director Liu,

254
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm not a captain right now,

255

I said it was because of
the bottle of white wine.

350
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,860
I suggested the hospital buy some.

351
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,020
It has an anesthetic effect
and is anti-inflammatory.

352
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
You can still make jokes now.

353
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,120
I remember

354
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,740
we talked a lot

355
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,220
when we were in the basement.

356
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,740
We are supposed to keep it a secret.

357
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,020
I know.

358
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,980
I mean,

359
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,700
the last moment...

360
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,140
I don't remember it.

361
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,460
But I do.

362
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,700
I have a better memory than you,

363
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,300
and I think I should be able

364
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,460
to remember an extra 30 seconds.

365
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,300
It doesn't matter.

366
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,020
I'll wait for you to remember it.

367
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,220
Where is she?

368
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:27,780
- 719.
- It's over there.

369
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,860
Over there?

370
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,700
The second room.

371
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,740
- That's the one.
- Yan.

372
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,380
Yan.

373
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,460
Yan.

374
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,460
Yan.

375
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,420
Where did you get hurt?

376
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,020
- Let me see.
- Auntie, Uncle.

377
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,220
Slowly.

378
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,100
Where did you get hurt?

379
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,660
I'm fine, Auntie.

380
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,220
Is it your leg or...

381
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,380
You really scared me.

382
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,380
Anything relevant to

383
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,260
disaster or calamity

384
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,300
just makes me quiver.

385
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,380
All right, Mom.

386
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,540
Mom, stop it.

387
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,020
She is all right now.

388
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,700
Well,

389
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,260
I haven't introduced him to you.

390
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,380
This is Luo Ben. He is an attorney.

391
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Ding and Mrs. Ding.

392
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,660
You are Luo Ben.

393
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,420
Ding Dingding told me about you.

394
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,660
Are you injured?

395
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,660
Ding Dingding told us

396
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,140
that you saved Yan. Thank you.

397
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,980
Thank you very much.

398
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,100
You're welcome, Mr. Ding.

399
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,940
That's what I should do.

400
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,700
Luo.

401
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,460
It's rare to see

402
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,940
a brave and caring young man

403
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,260
like you.

404
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,900
Thank you very much

405
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,460
for saving Yan.

406
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,780
You're welcome, Mrs. Ding.

407
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,380
Well,

408
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,300
when Yan

409
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,620
leaves the hospital,

410
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,260
you're welcome to come to our house

411
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,780
and have some wontons we make ourselves.

412
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,900
Okay.

413
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,700
Aunt.

414
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,180
He is a busy attorney.

415
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,220
No matter how busy he is,
he still has to eat.

416
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,900
I have to eat.

417
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:41,780
Exactly.

418
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,220
Mrs. Ding.

419
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,540
I'll help you cook then.

420
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,500
Can you cook?

421
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:49,300
Yeah.

422
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
Besides work,

423
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,380
I like to cook

424
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,940
and do housework.

425
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,700
That's rare.

426
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:56,780
See?

427
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,700
Dingding.

428
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,780
This is the right lifestyle

429
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,700
of young people.

430
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,700
You should love your job

431
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,700
and love your life.

432
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,460
Mrs. Ding, you're a good communicator.

433
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,420
You look like someone

434
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,700
who cooks really well.

435
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,220
It would be

436
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,980
a great honor if I have the luck

437
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,700
to taste

438
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,260
your cooking.

439
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,260
Then you must come to our house

440
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,700
and try the wontons we make.

441
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,300
We have a secret recipe.

442
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:23,620
Dad, Mom.

443
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,540
That's enough.

444
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,700
You're acting like
he is your son-in-law.

445
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,220
You...

446
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,100
I have something important to say.

447
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,740
There is one person

448
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,300
we should thank

449
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,140
for the survival of Yan and Luo Ben.

450
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,940
We thanked him.

451
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,620
It's my uncle.

452
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,780
Do you know how dangerous

453
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,900
the condition was
at the end of the rescue?

454
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,900
Almost everyone was about to give up.

455
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,380
It was my uncle

456
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,940
who said,

457
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,620
"Right now,

458
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,220
I'm not a captain of the rescue team,

459
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,780
I'm only a father."

460
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,980
How moving that is.

461
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,180
What's wrong with you guys?

462
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,780
Aren't you moved?

463
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:06,860
Yes.

464
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,380
Luo Ben risked his life

465
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,740
to save my cousin,

466
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,370
but he also

467
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,300
got trapped in there,

468
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,020
right?

469
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,780
If it wasn't for my uncle,

470
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,710
my cousin and Luo Ben

471
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,100
would have died this time.

472
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:16,900
Dingding.

473
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,700
Don't talk about death now.

474
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,620
Mr. Ding.

475
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Mrs. Ding.

476
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,940
To be fair,

477
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,740
we should

478
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,860
thank Captain Qingshan

479
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,900
this time.

480
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,140
Where is he?

481
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,020
Yeah.

482
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,420
Where is he?

483
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,940
(ICU 708 Bed 15)

484
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
Qingshan.

485
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,180
The kids have grown up.

486
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,620
We can't

487
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,540
be there for them forever.

488
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Look at you.

489
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,740
You're over 50 now.

490
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,460
Let the young people

491
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,900
do rescues.

492
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,540
I'm healthy enough

493
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,140
to keep doing it.

494
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,380
If one day

495
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,100
I can't do it anymore,

496
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,220
I believe

497
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,260
you will take good care of Yan.

498
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,420
Uncle.

499
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,420
You only worry about other people.

500
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,180
What about you?

501
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,660
It's too hard for you to be alone.

502
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,420
Dingding, it's not hard.

503
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,300
(ICU 708 Bed 15)
I have Yan,

504
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,100
she is an excellent daughter.

505
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,460
I also have you.

506
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,100
My life is not hard at all.

507
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,740
Don't worry.

508
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,260
I swore after that thing

509
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,700
happened to Xiaojie

510
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,300
that I would take good care of her

511
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,970
and keep her out of any danger.

512
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,020
I didn't do my job well.

513
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,220
You've taken

514
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,220
99 steps.

515
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:46,940
Why can't you

516
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,740
take the last step?

517
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,460
You were young when you found out

518
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,180
the truth,

519
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,620
but I believe

520
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,220
you're also trying to let it go.

521
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,620
This is a great opportunity.

522
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,700
Why can't you

523
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,220
give it a try?

524
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,740
Zhan Yan, you're trying to escape.

525
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,220
You don't get it.

526
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,140
The last step

527
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,900
is for my mom.

528
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,220
Yan.

529
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,220
Lie down.

530
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Get some rest.

531
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,740
I'll go back to my ward.

532
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,700
Mr. Luo.

533
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,940
Thank you for saving Zhan Yan.

534
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,220
Thank you.

535
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,900
You don't have to say that, Dr. Cai.

536
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,300
Zhan Yan

537
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,420
and her family

538
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,900
have already

539
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,700
thanked me.

540
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,700
Yan.

541
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,700
I... I...

542
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,460
I know you're disappointed in me.

543
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,260
To be honest, I was...

544
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,220
I was also flustered.

545
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,700
I wanted to

546
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,700
get you out,

547
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,620
but you were trapped there
before I had a chance.

548
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,860
Everything happened

549
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,860
too fast.

550
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,140
What I did... is...

551
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,860
I made a mistake.

552
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,940
I hope you can give me a chance

553
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,220
to make amends.

554
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,260
Okay?

555
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,300
It was an instinctive behavior

556
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,980
to protect yourself.

557
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,420
You did nothing wrong,

558
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,140
and I don't blame you.

559
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,660
No.

560
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,500
I was wrong in this matter.

561
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,860
I'm willing to spend the rest of my life

562
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,260
making up for my mistake.

563
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:02,980
No.

564
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,180
I'll take care of you

565
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,260
and protect you.

566
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,500
I will give you the best life.

567
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,140
I swear from this day on,

568
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,300
I will never put you

569
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,940
in any danger again.

570
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,420
I mean it.

571
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,740
Yuxiao.

572
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,980
I thought I made it very clear

573
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,420
when we were in the homestay.

574
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,700
We're not right for each other.

575
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,460
It has nothing to do
with the earthquake.

576
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,620
You're still a good senior

577
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,260
and a good colleague of mine.

578
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,020
It's just

579
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,540
nothing would change

580
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,940
even without the earthquake.

581
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,940
No.

582
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,460
Yan, listen to me.

583
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,300
I...

584
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
I agreed

585
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,900
to break up with you

586
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,300
only because I wanted to use the time

587
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,740
to prove myself.

588
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,540
You know I love you.

589
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,460
You are the most important person

590
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,260
in my life.

591
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,380
I've never liked anyone else.

592
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,380
I wanted to marry you

593
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,420
when we were together.

594
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,700
You only love yourself.

595
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,260
You never loved me.

596
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,540
I'm tired.

597
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,500
I want to have some rest.

598
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,940
Thank you.

599
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,220
Okay.

600
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,300
You know what,

601
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,980
life is wonderful.

602
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,420
It's full of

603
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,020
surprises and scares.

604
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,980
You might get caught

605
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,700
in a landslide when you go on vacation.

606
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,300
Who would know that?

607
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,900
Zhan Yan was buried alive

608
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,860
and made it out.

609
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,900
She is

610
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,940
lucky enough.

611
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,860
She survived a catastrophe and is bound
to have good fortune later on.

612
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,180
I'm still scared

613
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,260
when I think about it.

614
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:23,220
I mean,

615
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,860
if we went with her,

616
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
would we also be buried in there?

617
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,100
But we might not be

618
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,660
as lucky as Zhan Yan is.

619
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:33,980
Haven't you

620
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,020
noticed something?

621
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,180
There are cuts and bruises

622
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,140
on Dr. Cai's ten fingers.

623
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,460
He got that when he dug the earth

624
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,420
and tried to save Dr. Zhan.

625
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,860
What's the use of that?

626
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:43,940
At the critical time,

627
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,460
it was Mr. Luo who came forward

628
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,260
and risked his life

629
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,300
to save Zhan Yan.

630
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:47,980
Yeah.

631
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,500
That's why

632
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,460
misfortune tests the sincerity

633
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,700
of a relationship.

634
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,100
That's right.

635
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,740
Dr... Dr. Cai.

636
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,940
Dr. Cai.

637
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,620
Dr. Cai.

638
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,300
What's going on?

639
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,100
Stop guessing.

640
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:14,860
Go do your work.

641
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,780
Let's go.

642
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,020
Here. Misfortune will test our friendship.

643
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,260
That's right.

644
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:45,700
Dad.

645
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,780
Open the door.

646
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:47,660
Dingding.

647
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,700
You should take a cab home.

648
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,060
You're out of our way.

649
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,180
Wait, how am I out of your way?

650
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,220
Are you not going home?

651
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,060
Your dad and I

652
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,500
just got back.

653
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:55,860
A few friends of ours

654
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,220
will meet us at the hotel
to welcome us back.

655
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,020
We're going straight to the hotel.

656
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,380
I want to eat

657
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,620
chili chicken made by Dad.

658
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,700
I haven't bought chicken.

659
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,820
It will take time to cook.

660
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,220
All right.

661
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,540
You can eat it next time
when you come back.

662
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,420
We're in a hurry.

663
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,220
We don't want to be late.

664
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,220
I gotta go.

665
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,060
- Bye.
- Let's go.

666
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,020
Don't worry too much.

667
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,220
The doctor said your brother
wasn't badly hurt.

668
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,700
He should be on the mend in no time.

669
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,420
Take the lists.

670
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,420
Look, here are the medical bill
and the prescription.

671
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,140
And this.

672
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,420
You might need it.

673
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,580
Hai.

674
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,900
Yes, something is going on here.

675
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,980
I-I forgot it.

676
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,300
Sorry. I'll be right there.

677
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,540
All right.

678
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,620
I gotta go.

679
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Text me if anything happens.

680
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,260
Yuan.

681
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,980
You've grown up.

682
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,860
You can take care of me now.

683
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,700
Did you think about me

684
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,380
when you were trying to save Zhan Yan?

685
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,180
Of course,

686
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,700
you were the first person
coming to my mind.

687
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,780
It's just

688
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,220
I had to

689
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,300
save Zhan Yan in that situation.

690
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,020
Brother.

691
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,860
Are you

692
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,260
in love with her?

693
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,340
Don't be ridiculous.

694
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,020
That was only because
she saved your life.

695
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,980
I did it to return a favor for you.

696
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,700
Alright.

697
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,220
Captain.

698
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,260
How is your injury, Mr. Luo?

699
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,660
Thank you.

700
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,540
I'm much better now.

701
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,060
I want to say thank you

702
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,220
for saving Zhan Yan.

703
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,060
Otherwise, I don't think she could
make it out on her own.

704
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,060
We should thank you, Captain.

705
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,580
It was you

706
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,340
who got me and Zhan Yan out of there.

707
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,980
There is no need to thank me.

708
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,100
Zhan Yan is my daughter.

709
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,100
I know.

710
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
She rarely mentions

711
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,860
our relationship to anyone.

712
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,620
I think Zhan Yan

713
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,780
is still bothered by something.

714
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,980
I think

715
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,700
you should be more proactive.

716
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,820
Hai, sorry

717
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,900
that I'm late.

718
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,140
Take this.

719
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,700
This is...

720
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,900
You've asked for leave
three times this month.

721
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,060
Eight days in total.

722
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,580
You took the least orders

723
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,100
and made the least deliveries
in the company.

724
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,020
The company has a policy

725
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,780
that anyone who finishes last
for three months in a row

726
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,980
will be fired.

727
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,700
This is double salary for this month.

728
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,140
That's all

729
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,700
I can do for you.

730
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,500
Thank you, Hai.

731
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,780
Sorry to have caused you trouble.

732
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,540
Xiong.

733
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,260
Just take my advice.

734
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,980
We're normal people.

735
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,380
It's good enough to live our lives well.

736
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,860
Don't try

737
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,620
to be a hero.

738
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,100
Well,

739
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,580
you look like

740
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,300
you just came back

741
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,580
from the Flaming Mountains.

742
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,740
Do you feel that hot?

743
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,700
I'm so burned up.

744
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,620
Your cousin was saved.

745
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,260
She is safe and sound now.

746
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,060
Why are you still upset?

747
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,420
It was your fault

748
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,780
to get me drunk.

749
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,260
I didn't even get to see

750
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,100
how my cousin was saved.

751
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,260
Can you blame me for that?

752
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,820
You asked me for a drink.

753
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,860
The beer was expensive.

754
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,020
I haven't asked you for the money.

755
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,260
I have no money. I'm poor now.

756
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,540
Didn't you just get the royalties

757
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,700
from our company?

758
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,700
Why did you say you're poor?

759
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,260
My friend.

760
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,380
Only the housekeeper knows
how high the cost of living can be.

761
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
I just moved out from my family.

762
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,660
I pay one month's deposit
and three months' rent in advance.

763
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,700
It cost me tens of thousands every year.

764
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,140
I have to be economical.

765
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,300
Money is earned,

766
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,580
not saved.

767
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,060
You're lucky to be signed

768
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:14,820
by our company.

769
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,900
Just work hard.

770
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,340
It pisses me off when you mention that.

771
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,140
I also want to create a good work,

772
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,700
but that Director Ming

773
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,100
in your company has to pretend

774
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,300
to know something he doesn't know

775
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,020
and mess with my train of thought.

776
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,620
I just...

777
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,860
Is it because he pretends to know
what he doesn't know

778
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,740
or you're not good enough at it?

779
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,980
I'm not good enough?

780
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,260
If I'm not good enough,

781
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,700
why do I have so many readers

782
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,700
and why is my work so popular?

783
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,500
A creator

784
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,540
shouldn't always try to please

785
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,700
the market and the readers.

786
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,180
I'm not trying to please the market.

787
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,260
I'm drawing exactly what I want to draw.

788
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,980
Besides, a lot of people like it.

789
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,740
What does that mean?

790
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,740
It means my readers

791
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,220
have read my mind.

792
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,300
It was your director

793
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,140
who insisted that I have to

794
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,100
change my work according to his ideas.

795
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,380
I didn't mean that. I...

796
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,780
It's nothing.

797
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,020
Anyway,

798
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,700
for the birth

799
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,780
of a great comic,

800
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,420
I've decided to try everything
to fight against this person.

801
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,540
What kind of person

802
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,140
is Director Ming?

803
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,780
Male or female?

804
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
Tall or short? Skinny or fat?

805
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,700
Are you okay?

806
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,380
It's okay. I'm just mad.

807
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,060
Does he have

808
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
violent tendencies?

809
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,220
No comment.

810
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,780
Don't tell me you've never
met this person before.

811
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Yeah.

812
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,820
An ordinary employee like me

813
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,540
has no chance

814
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,700
to meet the senior leadership.

815
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,300
That's sad.

816
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,580
See,

817
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,180
that's how you're treated
when you get a job through your family.

818
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,780
You won't be valued at all.

819
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,420
Just work hard.

820
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,300
Mom.

821
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,420
Mingming.

822
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,900
Where have you been?

823
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,060
I had a meeting
with my colleagues at work.

824
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,100
What's the matter, Mom?

825
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,020
I thought

826
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,220
you went to the training class.

827
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:16,660
The training class is over.

828
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,620
My classmates

829
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,100
and I will treat our mentor

830
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,860
to dinner someday.

831
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,180
Mingming.

832
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,700
What's the last name

833
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,020
of your mentor?

834
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,500
Zhang.

835
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,780
Zhang Weilin, right?

836
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,820
Yes.

837
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,380
I went to visit him to thank him

838
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,820
for teaching you.

839
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,580
Did you go to see him?

840
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:38,700
Yes.

841
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,620
Professor Zhang said

842
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,500
he really wanted to know

843
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,300
what Zhou Mingming looks like.

844
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,700
Zhou Mingming paid for his lessons,

845
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,580
but he only saw his name

846
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,540
on the attendance book.

847
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,660
He also mentioned

848
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,660
that Zhou Mingming said

849
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,100
he had important things to do this week.

850
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,860
There were time conflicts

851
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,980
and he couldn't make it to the class.

852
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,260
Mom.

853
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,820
I'm sorry.

854
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,660
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

855
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,180
Tell me

856
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:11,780
what you've been

857
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,820
up to lately.

858
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,540
I signed up for

859
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,240
the training of
a non-profit rescue team.
