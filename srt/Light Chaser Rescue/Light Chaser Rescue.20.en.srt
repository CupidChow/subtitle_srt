It looks different

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,160
from other masks.

26
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,130
This is the breathing switch.

27
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,250
I don't know how to choose.

28
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,410
Why does life always

29
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,840
raise difficulties for me?

30
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,440
Give me some advice, Jing.

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,530
Life is supposed to

32
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,210
raise difficulties for us.

33
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,250
The reason why you
don't know how to choose

34
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,970
is because you're too afraid to lose.

35
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,130
Xiong Fei,

36
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,130
I understand your worries.

37
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,970
Because everyone is afraid to lose.

38
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,160
But you still have to choose.

39
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,600
If you really want

40
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,810
my advice,

41
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,880
I advise you to ask yourself.

42
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,530
Losing which will make you

43
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,560
more grieved?

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,530
The answer is always in your heart.

45
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,880
(I understand rescue
means a lot to you.)

46
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,050
(I don't want you to be agonized.)

47
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,200
(I'll return Bun-bun tomorrow.)

48
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,730
(Thanks for your company these days.)

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,690
(If it's convenient,)

50
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,690
(send it to the rescue team tomorrow.)

(Light Chaser Rescue)

52
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,930
Today, Xiong Fei will be

53
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,290
your chief instructor of the

54
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,640
300 m obstacle-run training.

55
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,730
Xiong Fei.

56
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,930
Everyone, attention!

57
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,000
Training starts!

58
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,250
You became slower.

59
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,960
Have you thought it over?

60
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,690
Has he decided?

61
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,810
Xiong Fei,

62
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,640
please summarize

63
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,810
today's training.

64
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,610
Today,

65
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,250
you performed well as a whole.

66
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,810
Some girls overcame

67
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,730
their fear of heights.

68
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,440
But some didn't focus

69
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,610
and were slower than before.

70
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,250
I hope you'll work hard

71
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,080
and don't slack off.

72
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,490
Only by turning the moves

73
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,520
into instinctive responses,

74
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,290
could you do better

75
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,320
during rescues.

76
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,320
There's another thing

77
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,930
I want to tell you.

78
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,930
Today

79
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
is the last time

80
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
I train with you.

81
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,560
What do you mean?

82
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,440
Why, Xiong Fei?

83
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,130
Xiong Fei,

84
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,640
what are you talking about?

85
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,050
For some personal reason,

86
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,440
I'm quitting the rescue team.

87
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,560
Why are you quitting?

88
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
Why?

89
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,960
- Why?
- What's wrong?

90
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
I've fallen in love with a girl.

91
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,290
I hope

92
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,200
to pay more attention to her

93
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,170
from now on,

94
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,130
and spend more time with her.

95
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,440
I'll try my best

96
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,320
to make her happy.

97
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,130
I'm really honored

98
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,290
to be one of you.

99
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,040
Thanks, everyone.

100
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,640
Dapeng.

101
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,520
What's wrong with you?

102
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,610
I've made the decision.

103
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,370
Don't take his words seriously.

104
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,090
Do you really want to part from us?

105
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,450
Exactly.

106
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,250
Yeah.

107
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,610
Xiong Fei,

108
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,130
consider it again.

109
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,490
You don't have to quit the team
to be in a relationship.

110
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,970
What are you thinking?

111
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,490
Chen Xing,

112
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,210
you're fast.

113
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,970
But you should pay attention to
stability training.

114
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,730
Mingming,

115
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,570
when you cross
the double-rope pool again,

116
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,850
cling to the ropes with your feet

117
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,640
to stop the ropes from swinging.

118
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,850
I wish you happiness.

119
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,920
You've made great progress.

120
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,040
But you should focus on
physical training.

121
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,330
Got it.

122
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,450
Take care of Yuan.

123
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,610
This is my choice.

124
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm sorry, Captain.

125
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,640
I let you down.

126
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,040
No.

127
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,800
As a rescuer,

128
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,000
you did a great job.

129
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,730
We each

130
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,640
have our own special situation.

131
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,000
We understand that.

132
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,730
Luo Yuan is a good girl.

133
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
Take good care of her.

134
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,520
Non-profit rescue

135
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,610
requires us

136
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,880
to sacrifice a lot.

137
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,680
We just couldn't reconcile

138
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,160
work and career with family.

139
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,130
So,

140
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,640
don't blame Luo Ben.

141
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:52,940
(Light Chaser Rescue Xiong Fei)

142
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,640
Xiong Fei!

143
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:19,300
(Light Chaser Rescue)

144
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,640
You'll always be our teammate!

145
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,540
(Light Chaser Rescue)

146
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,130
Luo Ben.

147
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,450
Luo Ben.

148
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Stop!

149
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,130
Why don't you leave?

150
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,000
Could you at least

151
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,970
have a conscience?

152
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,250
When Falcon died because of you,

153
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,730
Xiong Fei spoke for you.

154
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,250
If it wasn't for Xiong Fei,

155
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,520
we would never take you

156
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
as a brother.

157
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,130
He made the choice himself.

158
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,730
I just made a request.

159
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,450
He doesn't have to

160
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,570
leave the rescue team.

161
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,680
You're no human!

162
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,250
Dapeng, calm down.

163
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,280
You're an attorney.

164
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,680
You must have found out

165
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,250
Xiong Fei's background.

166
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,920
How hard it was for him

167
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,850
to become who he is today?

168
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,520
If he decides to

169
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,680
be responsible for someone,

170
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,450
he'll be wholehearted.

171
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,880
I don't deny

172
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,160
his love for Luo Yuan,

173
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,280
but I have my own consideration.

174
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,130
Your consideration?

Engaging in rescue,

176
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,400
you're under the threat

177
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
of death at all times.

178
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,970
Next second, your life

179
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,370
may rest in a teammate's hand.

182
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,090
You don't trust Xiong Fei.

183
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,920
You don't trust anyone.

184
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,090
You're not fit for rescue.

185
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,570
You don't deserve to be our brother.

What do you think?

193
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,040
Do you sincerely admit

194
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,370
losing to Xiong Fei?

195
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,610
I thought you called

196
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,370
to console me.

197
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,400
I will,

198

199
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,680
you misjudged him.

200
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,330

202
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,520
I completely

lost to Xiong Fei.

204

Xiong Fei is worthy of her trust.

211
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,330
I'll adjust my attitude.

212

As you rightly say,

213
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,160
if you want a secure life,

214
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,290

I don't want to fight with you today.

288
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,330
Annoying.

289
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,570
I forgot the proper business

290
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,640

291
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,960
As regards

292
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:03,770
Xiong Fei's food truck,

293
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,090
we should find a way

294
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,960

295
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,090

296
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,810
your brother comes with

297
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,440
another wicked idea?

299
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,880
you majored in business management?

300
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Do you have any ideas?

301
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,480
Actually,

302
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,850
a small food truck like Xiong Fei's

303
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,010
is better to travel by word of mouth;

304
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,680
or to be

305
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,370
turned into a trendy food truck;

306
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,480
or...

307
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,240
I think that's a good idea.

308

a qualified girlfriend.

322
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,770
What's wrong?

323
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,010
It's been four hours since we

324

left the singing bar.

325

every minute we spend together

330
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:37,920
will be

331

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,570
I did that

348
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,960
all for your own good.

349
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,130
I know you did that for me,

350
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,810
but I don't want you

351
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,810
to force Xiong Fei

352
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,960
to choose between me

353
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,640
and his beloved rescue work.

354
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,570
Now that Xiong Fei chose you,

355
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,610
you should be

356
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,770
the most important to him.

357
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,240
Recently,

358
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,480
you've spent a lot of time with us.

359
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,330
Did it affect your work?

360
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,810
It doesn't matter.

361
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,090
I've asked for leave from the firm.

362
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,610
Would you like black tea or green tea?

363
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,290
- Black tea.
- OK.

364
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,680
Luo Ben,

365
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,440
I can tell,

366
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,480
you're very serious

367
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,370
about the rescue work.

368
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:07,770
But it still takes time

369
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,610
to fit into the team.

370
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,810
Don't be impatient.

371
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,200
Recently,

372
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,010
the team members
have some complaints against you.

373
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,570
But it isn't personal.

374
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
They don't want Xiong Fei to leave.

375
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,880
Xiong Fei has been with them

376
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,640
for many years.

377
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,330
They fulfilled tasks

378
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,050
and rescued people together.

379
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,160
They are affectionate to each other.

380
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,680
I know.

381
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,130
After all, Xiong Fei and Falcon

382
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,290
both left

383
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
because of me.

384
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,290
If they have complaints

385
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,090
against me,

386
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,810
I understand them.

387
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,680
Good to know.

388
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,530
Captain,

389
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,680
I hope that in the future,

390
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,290
you'll assign me

391
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,570
as many tasks as possible.

392
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,850
I still hope to

393
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,770
play a bigger role in the team.

394
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,640
You are an expert.

395
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,770
Please instruct me more

396
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,370
on professional skills.

397
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,400
OK.

398
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,010
As long as you're willing to learn.

399
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,720
Then after I drink the tea you made,

400
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,050
you'll officially be my master.

401
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,290
You set me a trap here.

402
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,680
You haven't drunk the tea yet.

403
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
I don't easily

404
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,160
recruit apprentices.

405
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,810
I think you'd better

406
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,960
recruit me.

407
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,370
Anyway, sooner or later,

408
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,570
I'll be your family.

409
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,370
I'm with Zhan Yan now.

410
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,530
That's a bigger trap.

411
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,720
You want to learn from me

412
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,330
and take my daughter away as well.

413
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,610
Neither of the things is easy,

414
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:43,920
especially the second one.

415
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,610
I'm warning you,

416
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,920
as her father,

417
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,770
I'll watch over you for her.

418
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,610
Since I dare to chase Zhan Yan,

419
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,680
I won't be afraid of you.

420
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,780
(Wonton that makes you explode)

421
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,820
(Big Bear Wonton)

422
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,090
You're good, Ding Dingding.

423
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,920
I didn't know

424
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,090
you could paint on the truck.

425
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,570
I can do a lot of things.

426
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,570
If my mom wasn't too strict with me,

427
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,400
I would

428
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,370
at least

429
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,850
be a surrealistic artist now.

430
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:28,480
I think

431
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,960
you're unrealistic, aren't you?

432
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,160
Cut the crap.

433
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,090
Don't always hit me.

434
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,130
OK.

435
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,480
You can show your capabilities next.

436
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,640
Sir, I'd like a portion.

437
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:39,240
Here you are.

438
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,680
Thanks, sir.

439
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,720
Hope you like it.

440
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,160
OK.

441
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,090
Two portions, sir.

442
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,090
Two portions, right?

443
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,920
OK. Wait a minute.

444
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,680
I want one.

445
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,770
Sir, I want two.

446
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,370
It smells so good.

447
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,440
It's a long line.

448
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,960
They look fresh.

449
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,200
Isn't the owner a member of
Light Chaser Rescue?

450
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,480
I saw him on the news.

451
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,050
Really?

452
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,770
- Three portions.
- It's really good.

453
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,010
You're right.

454
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,850
The owner

455
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,010
is really a rescuer.

456
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:00,010
If the food truck

457
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,330
isn't here...

458
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:00,880
No. 1, right?

459
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,160
...he must be busy with the rescue work.

460
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:03,920
Is he a rescuer?

461
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,240
No wonder he's so great.

462
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,720
It must be hard.

463
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,480
He's a hero.

464
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:08,850
Yours.

465
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,200
We must support him more.

466
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:10,850
Sure.

467
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,400
Wait.

468
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,920
Their business is much better.

469
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,290
My strategy seems to be right.

470
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,880
You only know how to brag.

471
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,850
I'm the one who really helped.

472
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm going upstairs.

473
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,920
Yuan,

474
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,880
about one thing,

475
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,880
I don't want you
to misunderstand your brother.

476
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:57,370
Xiong Fei,

477
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,330
are you sure

478
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,480
you'll leave the rescue team?

479
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,010
I understand your concerns

480
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,770
as a brother.

481
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,010
Congratulations.

482
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,330
You've passed my test.

483
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,090
From now on,

484
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,200
I won't interfere with your decision

485
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,680
on whether staying on the team

486
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,130
and continuing with the rescue work.

487
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,770
Leaving the rescue team

488
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,200
is my own choice.

489
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
I'll be responsible for Luo Yuan

490
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,640
and not let her worry.

491
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,130
OK.

492
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,330
I hope you'll

493
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,480
remember what you said today.

494
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,920
If you hurt Luo Yuan,

495
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,680
I won't let you off.

496
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,480
You have a good brother.

497
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,370
You should be happy.

498
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,290
You're back, Yuan.

499
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,160
What's wrong, Yuan?

500
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,640
Did Xiong Fei

501
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,480
bully you?

502
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,400
Yuan.

503
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,530
Brother.

504
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,240
Sorry.

505
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,440
I knew everything.

506
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,010
At least Xiong Fei

507
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,010
is a good cook.

508
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,440
In the future,

509
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,850
I don't need to worry that
no one cooks for you.

510
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,960
The food cooked by you

511
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,050
is always the best.

512
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,610
You mustn't change the ranking.

513
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,880
I won't.

514
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,480
OK.

515
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,010
Go wash your hands.

516
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,960
Let's have dinner.

517
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,640
I made your favorite

518
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,050
sweet and sour fish.

519
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,400
After the sauce is poured,

520
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,880
it's ready for us to eat.

521
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,570
Isn't it pretty?

522
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,050
I've added sugar.

523
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,090
If you add more,

524
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,160
it will be overly sweet.

525
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,050
Yuan,

526
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,770
since when did you

527
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:41,610
crave such sweet food?

528
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,330
Awfully sweet.

529
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,290
Chicken or beef?

530
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:55,810
Beef.

531
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,570
Oolong tea or green tea?

532
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,370
Coffee.

533
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,640
Then you shall

534
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,530
drink Oolong tea with me.

535
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,240
Orange or apple?

536
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,960
Grape.

537
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,280
I'll take some oranges,

538
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,360
to supplement vitamin C.

539
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,610
Why do you ask me if you've already

540
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,240
made the choice?

541
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,570
Tonight,

542
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,200
shall we go to my place or your place?

543
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,130
Yuan won't be home.

544
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,840
What are you talking about?

545
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,800
I'm talking about cooking.

546
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,890
What are you thinking?

547
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Nothing.

548
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,450
I'm thinking of cooking, too.

549
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:34,010
Why do you laugh?

550
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,050
Stop laughing.

551
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,570
OK, I'll stop.

552
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,890
Real story.

553
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,760
Ding Dingding, you are
always beautiful

554
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,890
and radiant.

555
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,640
Ding Dingding's Fan Club.

556
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,320
What's this?

557
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,130
Look, look.

558
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,320
I have fans now.

559
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,130
How popular I am!

560
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,090
What are these?

561
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,760
Lipsticks.

562
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,130
There are so many.

563
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,160
We should give them out to everyone,

564
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,640
right?

565
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,410
Well...

566
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:29,930
Get out.

567
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,530
Why are you so stingy?

568
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,760
There are so many, you can...

569
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,720
Will you get out or not?

570
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,640
Quickly.

571
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,720
Don't come to my office again.

572
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,760
Get out of here.

573
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,930
You're too stingy.

574
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,410
Come on.

575
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,450
Help yourselves, you guys.

576
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,890
Everyone has a share.

577
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,680
Give them to your girlfriends,

578
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,720
sisters or anyone else.

579
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,640
Thanks. Thanks.

580
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
I only have one request.

581
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,280
Give me more materials.

582
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,610
Sure.

583
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,160
Dingding,

584
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,720
you're really promising.

585
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,570
Of course.

586
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:58,970
No hurry.

587
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,200
She's a great painter.

588
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,930
She's going to be popular

589
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,010
all over the country.

590
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,800
Exactly.

591
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,010
I love to hear what you say.

592
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:04,930
I'll give you an extra.

593
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:05,680
Thanks.

594
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:06,760
I want one more too.

595
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,010
I want one for my mom.

596
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:09,200
OK.

597
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:10,760
Help yourselves.

598
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:11,930
Thanks, Dingding.

599
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:12,720
Dapeng,

600
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,570
Leave some for me.

601
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,640
why don't you take one?

602
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,200
It's for women.

603
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,090
Why do I need it?

604
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,610
Leave one for me, you guys.

605
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,610
Give it to your wife when you get home.

606
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm sure she'll scold you less tonight.

607
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,200
Here.

608
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,450
I have an extra.

609
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,160
What do you know?

610
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,800
Beating and scolding show love.

611
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,840
Don't you know that?

612
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:46,360
Are you taking stock?

613
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,570
You scared me.

614
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,450
For me?

615
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,450
For you.

616
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,410
Lipstick.

617
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,640
Chamel?

618
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,490
I've never heard of the brand.

619
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,930
My roommate gave it to me.
It must be good.

620
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,360
Which teammate?

621
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,240
Do you have such a teammate?

622
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,200
What's wrong?

623
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,610
Xiong Fei quit the team.

624
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,050
I thought Luo Ben

625
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,610
forced him to do so.

626
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,680
Unexpectedly,

627
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,610
he volunteered to quit

628
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,930
because of a girl.

629
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,970
He looks dull.

630
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,130
I didn't expect him

631
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:23,840
to be so romantic.

632
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,130
Is that romantic?

633
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,160
It's just a relationship.

634
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,610
Does he need to pay such a heavy price?

635
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,320
So you mean women are

636
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,240
less important than rescue,

637
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,890
don't you?

638
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,130
You're doing it again.

639
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,800
I don't mean that.

640
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,930
Then what do you mean?

641
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,090
There's a world of difference.

642
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,010
How could you lump them together?

643
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,450
Why couldn't I?

644
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,530
Look,

645
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,320
you get mad again.

646
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,490
Go take stock yourself.

647
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,410
OK, then.

648
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,610
I'm gonna take stock.

649
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,680
Dessert is served.

650
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,240
You're able to do everything.

651
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,200
Try it.

652
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,970
Isn't it the most basic skill

653
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,240
of a boyfriend?

654
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,680
Are there any advanced skills?

655
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,890
Be patient.

656
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,840
You'll see them

657
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,930
gradually in the future.

658
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,490
I'm very patient.

659
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,570
So you are good

660
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,890
at pleasing girls.

661
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,280
In my life,

662
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,360
I only please two girls.

663
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,320
One is Luo Yuan;

664
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,570
the other

665
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,890
is you.

666
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,320
What's up?

667
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,800
Got a mission.

668
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,320
Two kids were lost

669
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
in mountains.

670
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,010
We're going to

671
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:31,890
help the police to find them.

672
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,570
I'll go with you.

673
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,490
It's going to be dangerous.

674
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:38,160
I'm a doctor. I can help.

675
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,530
OK.

676
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:45,010
According to the forecast,

677
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,970
it will rain in the area,

678
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,610
which will make the rescue

679
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,570
more difficult.

680
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,970
You'd better

681
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,970
be prepared.

682
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:55,160
Yes.

683
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,160
Yes.

684
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,610
Are you good?

685
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,720
We're good.

686
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,490
We're good.

687
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,840
That's great.

688
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,530
I blamed you wrongly for Xiong Fei.

689
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,010
I apologize.

690
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,610
Let's gather here.

691
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,360
Yesterday, my children were seen

692
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,280
going into the mountain at noon.

693
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,010
They haven't come home yet.

694
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,570
What clothes were they wearing

695
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:41,640
when they left?

696
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,450
Grandma said

697
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,240
Tingting wore a yellow coat

698
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,160
and black jeans.

699
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,640
Pengpeng wore a white pullover

700
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
and dark gray pants.

701
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,840
Don't you know that?

702
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,200
We just came back

703
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,640
from working in the town this morning.

704
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,090
We haven't even seen the kids.

705
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,530
I beg you.

706
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,970
Please find them.

707
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,970
I beg you!

708
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,530
Think again.

709
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,680
Where else could they go?

710
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,840
There are wild red bayberry trees
growing in the mountain behind.

711
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,090
Tingting often picked fruits there.

712
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,410
But when I came back,

713
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,410
I went there and looked for them.

714
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:13,840
There weren't there.

715
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,050
Don't worry.

716
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,680
We're planning a search.

717
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,760
We also asked for the help
of Light Chaser Rescue.

718
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,800
They are very experienced

719
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
in field search.

720
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,490
Once we get news,

721
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,970
we'll inform you immediately.

722
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,840
Thanks.

723
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,130
Thanks.

724
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:26,640
Lu,

725
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,800
get a fix on the two positions.

726
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,280
Yes.

727
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,970
Mr. Ren and I
will coordinate the operation.

728
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,450
Luo Ben commands the search.

729
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,760
Him?

730
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:36,640
Yes.

731
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,610
He's inexperienced in practice.

732
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,840
Dapeng should help him.

733
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,090
Yes.

734
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,130
I'll do my best.

735
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,800
(Qingshan)

736
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,410
In addition,

737
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:45,930
since Zhan Yan is there,

738
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,490
let her ask the family

739
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,930
for more information

740
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,530
to see if we can

741
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,680
find any other clues.

742
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:54,570
Yes.

743
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,890
All members

744
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,050
act in coordination with the police.

745
00:41:58,050 --> 00:41:58,680
Go.

746
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,970
- Yes.
- Yes.

747
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:00,890
Come on.

748
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:03,640
Let's go.

749
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,160
Wait.

750
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,200
Take this

751
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,840
for unexpected needs.

752
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,090
Wait for me.

753
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:16,320
Stay safe.

754
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,160
Report from Snail,

755
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,090
search on the eastern hillside is over.

756
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,280
No contact with the target.

757
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,280
Wait.

758
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
Tingting.

759
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,450
Tingting.

760
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,240
Prepare for rappel.

761
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,840
Yes.

762
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,090
Tingting!

763
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,160
