00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,010

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,850
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,120
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,950
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,470
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:35,320
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,270
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,500
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,470
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,150
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,850
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,170
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,400
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,970
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,980

20
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,750
 Help!

21
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,580
 Mingming!

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,930
 Dabao!

23
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,980
 Mingming. Mingming!

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,570
Li Jian!

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,760
 Mingming!

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,810
- Li Jian. 
 - Mingming!

27
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,840
Li Jian, are you okay?

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,510
Mingming!

29
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,230
Don't move. Don't move!

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,420
He...

31
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,630
What can we do now?

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,340
Give me your towel.

33
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,550
Be careful.

34
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,890
Mingming.

35
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,410
Hold my hand. Hold me tight.

36
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,030
Li Jian, don't move. Don't move.

37
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,810
- Let me go. 
 - Okay.

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,380
Give me your hand.

39
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,610
Be careful.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Come on. Stand up.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,990
Be careful.

42
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,690
Let's go. Come on.

43
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,410
Li Jian, give me your hand.

44
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,460
- Mingming, push him. 
 - Come on.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,950
Mingming.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,580
Hold him tight.

47
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,960
Go!

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,730
Come and sit here.

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,160
Are you okay?

50
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,880
I'm fine. It's just skin trauma.

51
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,660
Why did you ride so fast?

52
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,670
If it was not for Zhou Mingming's help, you would have died here today.

53
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,090
Thank you.

54
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,340
Sorry.

55
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,540
Mom, when did you come back?

56
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,430
I've told you many times.

57
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,590
And you just won't listen to me.

58
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,440
You can play around every day.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,880
But you even salvage corpses now?

60
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,260
Do you know how ominous it is?

61
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,310
You knew about this?

62
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,870
I heard the rescue work on the water is not safe.

63
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,560
What if anything happens to you?

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,490
You want me to see you die in front of me?

65
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,740
Mom, I learned to swim.

66
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,150
I'm still learning diving rescue.

67
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,660
But your swimming skill is not that good.

68
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,080
It doesn't mean you can save yourself at any time.

69
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,580
Mom, I know that.

70
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,480
Don't be angry.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,070
Look at you. You like comics, so I opened a comic department for you.

72
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,210
Have you made any achievements on it?

73
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,700
You are just passionate at the beginning.

74
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,130
Your KPI failed to reach the standard for a month.

75
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,130
Mom, there is only one employee in that department.

76
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,120
The KPI you made is too high.

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,480
- Ding Dingding works... 
 - Don't mention that Ding Dingding anymore.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,130
I've asked Qiqi to investigate her.

79
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,250
That Ding Dingding made you join the rescue team, right?

80
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,200
It's not her. I joined in myself.

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,498
Stop saying something nice about her.

82
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:46,090
From tomorrow, revoke the comic department.

83
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,870
Devote yourself to the company's own projects.

84
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,810
Before you make any achievements, you're not going anywhere.

85
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,290
Mom.

86
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,340
 Ding Dingding, good morning.

87
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,900
- Morning. 
 - Morning.

88
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,240
Ms. Ding, please follow me.

89
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,230
Why is she so rude?

90
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,300
Why?

91
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,640
Because comic books are not the main business of the company.

92
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,950
And your KPI hasn't reached the standard for a month.

93
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,750
The president thinks that this department doesn't need to exist anymore.

94
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,860
What about Zhou Mingming?

95
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,350
The president has other arrangements for Director Ming.

96
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,400
What about the serialization of Light Chaser Rescue?

97
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,990
From tomorrow, the copyright of all your comics belong to you.

98
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,500
You can do whatever you want.

99
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,700
But if so, my contract with the company has not expired.

100
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,980
It's a breach of contract.

101
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,310
The company has to pay me a large amount of compensation.

102
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,760
The compensation will be transferred to your account tomorrow.

103
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,500
Remember to check it.

104
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,050
Does Zhou Mingming know this?

105
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,410
Yes.

106
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,200
- Hello. 
 - Since you signed me, you need to be responsible for me.

107
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,220
How can you just break the contract?

108
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,910
I didn't want to fire you.

109
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,110
The president wants to fire you.

110
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,980
The president is your mom.

111
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,680
Can't you oppose it?

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,810
I did, but it's useless.

113
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,770
 Besides, you wanted to get some rest. Right?

114
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,570
Well, you can take a break.

115
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,750
After she calms down, we can discuss it in the long term.

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,300
What about my comic?

117
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,910
You are a mature author now.

118
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,630
Even if no one urges you, you need to update the comic on time. Understand?

119
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,430
Well, what's next?

120
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,500
What's our plan next?

121
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,760
Just take a break.

122
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,300
 After I gain freedom again, I'll sign you back.

123
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,580
But you need to draw me into a better character.

124
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,560
Okay. Keep your promise.

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,480
Of course.

126
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,650
Well, I'll keep an eye on you.

127
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,450
- Don't be lazy. 
 - I know. Bye-bye.

128
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,920

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,460
Observe the Bed No. 36 patient for one more day.

130
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,360
- He can be discharged if nothing goes wrong. 
 - Okay.

131
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,310
And the patient in Bed No. 40 is old.

132
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,050
The postoperative recovery is not very ideal.

133
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,220
Where is this patient?

134
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,050
What happened?

135
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:58,420
Who allowed her to get out of bed?

136
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,400
I don't know.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,790
She didn't come back after she left.

138
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,270
Did she leave on her own?

139
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,880
When?

140
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,490
About two hours ago.

141
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,510
- Find her. 
 - Okay.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,900
The patient left the ward at 6:00 in the morning.

143
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,480
She took the elevator downstairs at 6:05.

144
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,020
At 6:25, she left the hospital building and got in a taxi.

145
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,980
Can you see the car number clearly?

146
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,430
No.

147
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,000
There weren't many people.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,270
Why did she spend 20 minutes walking from the elevator to the gate?

149
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,870
That's right.

150
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,800
Show us the elevator's internal monitor.

151
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
Okay.

152
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,510
- Chu Weisheng. 
 - Yes, sir.

153
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,560
- Send the mission. 
 - Okay.

154
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 An old lady from Central Hospital is lost.

155
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
 Specific information has been released.

156
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,260
 - Please help find her.  
 - Come on.

157
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,870
Come over here. Please judge it.

158
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,440
How did you take care of the patient?

159
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,850
A lively person is gone?

160
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,110
You have to explain to me today.

161
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,400
If you have any questions, talk with me in the office.

162
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Please don't disturb the order of our hospital here, okay?

163
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,440
It's useless to say this to me.

164
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,900
Ask your leader to come here.

165
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,110
Let the leader talk with me.

166
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,550
- Be polite. 
 - Why am I not polite?

167
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,650
I'm Qin Huizhen's attending doctor.

168
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,280
It's you who lost my mother?

169
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,020
- Is that how you should talk? 
 - I'm telling the truth!

170
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,220
Let me tell you!  If anything happens to my mom,

171
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,800
you and your hospital should all be responsible.

172
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,700
You need to compensate me.

173
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,060
- You are her son? 
 - Of course.

174
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,320
Your mom has been living here for more than half a month, have you been here once?

175
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,500
I...

176
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,830
When she had an operation, when she needed you, where were you?

177
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,760
That's right.

178
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,120
If Dr. Zhan didn't tell you, would you know she was here?

179
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,130
- How dare you ask for compensation? 
 - You...

180
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,710
That's right. My mom lives in the same ward with Aunt Qin.

181
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,080
- I never heard she had such a son. 
 - It's none of your business.

182
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,610
Let me tell you!  What you should do now is to think about where your mom may go

183
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,400
and where she is, instead of causing chaos here.

184
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,530
Or I'll call the security guards.

185
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,110
Call the security guards?

186
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,220
- Just do it. 
  What are you doing!

187
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,470
- Security guards! 
 - Okay, enough.

188
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,830
Stop.

189
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,050
 It's all your fault.

190
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,860
I know about the situation.

191
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,200
I'm a lawyer.

192
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,200
In a situation like this, if you hire me, you may get a large sum of compensation.

193
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,800
Lawyer?

194
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,400
Okay. I want to sue them.

195
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Well, how about talking with me alone?

196
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,900
Let's go.

197
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,470
Okay, don't gather here.

198
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,000
Just wait, this won't end like this.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,100
Let's go. Don't gather here. Go.

200
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,800
So unreasonable.

201
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,200
Tell me about it.

202
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,200
They lost my mom.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you have a photo of your mom? Let's find her first.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Yes.

205
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,680
Here.

206
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,800
This is your mom?

207
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Let me tell you. They should be responsible for the search fee.

208
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,500
And the hospital should look for my mom.

209
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,700
There must be something wrong with that doctor.

210
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,920
She thinks my mom is old and easy to cheat,

211
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,300
so she wanted to persuade her to have an operation to earn money.

212
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,900
My mom treasures money the most. She wouldn't have an operation.

213
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,600
Then they kicked her out of there.

214
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,200
I know my mom well. She is healthy.

215
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,800
It sounds reasonable.

216
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,600
So you mean, the hospital is suspected of over-treatment?

217
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,500
That's right. Over-treatment. That's it.

218
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
If there is over-treatment, how much compensation can I get?

219
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,400
Nothing and you may lose all your money for that.

220
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,800
Let me tell you! The law stipulates children have the obligation to support sick parents.

221
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,200
And people like you, who abandon the elderly,

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,200
will be sentenced to not more than five years' imprisonment.

223
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,600
Don't try to scare me.

224
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,410
Scare you?

225
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,200
You think your mom won't sue you so the law can let you get away with it?

226
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,500
Your mom disappeared. The hospital will call the police and the police will deal with it.

227
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,900
You're suffering more than just a moral condemnation.

228
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,500
Don't intervene. It's none of your business.

229
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,900
I'm a lawyer. I have an obligation to provide legal aid to victims.

230
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,900
Sir, I hope you understand what I said.

231
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,700
If you do, please leave here now.

232
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Well done.

233
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,900
I got a notice from the Light Chaser Rescue team.

234
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,400
Luckily, I got there in time.

235
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,600
I guess he won't cause trouble for you anymore.

236
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,700
You hit him?

237
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,500
Of course not, I'm a lawyer.

238
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,400
I have many ways to deal with him except by force.

239
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,900
It seems it's good to have a lawyer boyfriend.

240
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,300
Of course.

241
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,100
Zhan Yan, the board knows about the disappearance of Qin Huizhen.

242
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,000
They are calling you to have a meeting.

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,900
This happened in the Department of General Surgery.

244
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,300
As Dr. Zhan's leader, I didn't manage her well.

245
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
It's my fault.

246
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:46,500
As the attending physician, Zhan Yan did not care about the patient in time to understand the patient's mood swings,

247
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,400
so that the patient left the hospital during treatment.

248
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,700
She is indeed to blame for that.

249
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,500
As the attending doctor, I have direct responsibility for this.

250
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,800
Enough.

251
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,300
We still don't know why she left here, where she is, and whether she is safe or not.

252
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,200
Most importantly, we need to find the patient.

253
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,600
Then we'll investigate who should be responsible for it.

254
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,570
We're the rescue team in Ningcheng District.

255
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:24,200
When we searched along the river, we saw her jump into the river.

256
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,100
When we rescued her, she was in a coma.

257
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,400
Then we sent her to the nearest clinic.

258
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,210
The police have confirmed it.

259
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,400
She is the lost patient from Central Hospital.

260
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't worry. I'll cooperate with the police and send her back.

261
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,600
If so, our mission is completed. Goodbye.

262
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,300
- Thank you.  
 - You're welcome.

263
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,300
Grandma Qin.

264
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,000
Mr. Luo, why are you here?

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Sit down.

266
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Grandma Qin, I haven't seen flowers in my law firm for many days.

267
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,290
You just escaped the hospital.

268
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,700
All the colleagues from the law firm are worried about you.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,900
Thank you for your caring. I...

270
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,200
Well, you just ran out like this.

271
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,920
Everyone is worried about you.

272
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,140
Your son couldn't find you in the hospital.

273
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,030
He is also worried.

274
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,900
He went to the hospital?

275
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,500
Yes.

276
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,380
He is worried about me?

277
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,000
He is worried about my money.

278
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Do you have other relatives? I'll help you to contact them.

279
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,100
Did he make trouble in the hospital?

280
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,880
He wanted the hospital to give him an explanation,

281
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,200
as well as some compensation.

282
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,100
I'll go back with you.

283
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,050

284
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,380
How's Grandma Qin?

285
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,080
She is in a poor health condition.

286
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,800
After this, many indicators failed to meet the surgical standards.

287
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,100
But I think what really made her sad is her son's attitude.

288
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,500
She is so ill now, but her son only cares about money.

289
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,840
I think Zhao Donglei is the most pathetic now.

290
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,000
He thinks money is the most important to him.

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But if he really loses his mother, he'll know he lost the most precious thing.

292
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,200
Actually, between families, whatever misunderstanding it is,

293
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,900
they should solve it as soon as possible.

294
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,000
Don't wait until it's too late to regret.

295
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,400

296
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,980
You need to pay more attention to Bed No. 15 and No. 16 patients.

297
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

298
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,000
Dr. Zhan, I heard you've found the patient.

299
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes.

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,300
Good.

301
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,200
Well, about what I said during the meeting, please don't mind.

302
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,880
I didn't mean to blame you.

303
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,060
Don't take it seriously.

304
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,800
You're not wrong, Director Cai.

305
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,200
Mom, let me restart the comic department.

306
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,700
Give me more time, and I'll make achievements.

307
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,600
We had a deal. From today, you'll have meetings with me.

308
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,500
Have meetings... she can go with you.

309
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,100
- Take away his phone. 
 - Okay.

310
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,900
Well, it's... Is it necessary, Mom? Mom.

311
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,100
Mom. Mom.

312
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,700
Give me my phone.

313
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,300
Li Aiqi.

314
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,800
President Liu, see? Do you have a general understanding of our clauses?

315
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,480
Revise this clause. This?

316
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,100
What's wrong with this clause? Please have a look.

317
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,720
Sorry about that. Look at this place...

318
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,900
- Thank you. 
 - Wishing to a good cooperation.

319
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,700
Okay, bye-bye.

320
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,900
Bye-bye.

321
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,300
Okay.

322
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,130
It's going well today.

323
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,900
This is our new plan. It's here.

324
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,600
It's been a month and you give me such a plan?

325
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Okay, we'll revise it now.

326
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,900
 Why didn't he answer my call? Did he not pay the phone bill?

327
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,900
Just wait.

328
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,500
Here.

329
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't let the president see it.

330
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,100
Li Aiqi, you're the smartest in the company.

331
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,300
I'll go to work.

332
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,560

333
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,760

334
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,900

335
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,000

336
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,300
You must be kidding. How could I like her?

337
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,140

338
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,100
 - Hello.  
 - Hello.

339
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,860
What did you draw?

340
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,000
It's none of your business. You're not my boss now.

341
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,450
Then why did you call me so many times?

342
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,500
Let me tell you. Many companies want to sign me now.

343
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,000
Figure it out yourself. Bye-bye.

344
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,400
You... Hello?

345
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,750
 Come out tomorrow morning.

346
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,530
 I'll teach you how to draw.

347
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,330
Whoever doesn't come out is a dog.

348
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,600
Hello.

349
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,020
 Where did you go? Why didn't you come to the company?

350
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,120
I have something to do.

351
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,720
Help me to hide it from my mom.

352
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,800
 The president fell in a faint during the meeting.

353
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,430
What?

354
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,970
Mom!

355
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,020
Mom, are you all right?

356
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,450
The president has high blood pressure.

357
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:26,100
What? Why so suddenly?

358
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,550
The president has been hiding this from you.

359
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,671
There is a problem with a movie the company invested in.

360
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,740
Now, hundreds of millions of funds are invested in the film.

361
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,590
There is something wrong with the company's cash flow.

362
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,090
Mom.

363
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,230
Mingming, you should grow up now.

364
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,540
 I won't come to find you.

365
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,730
 About your comics, find a reliable company to publish it for you.

366
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,100
Fine, Zhou Mingming. You stood me up?

367
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,190
I won't contact you anymore.

368
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,510
Okay. Thank you, boss.

369
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,780
- Here you are. 
 - Thank you, sister.

370
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,470
- Boss, give us some. 
 - Okay.

371
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,390
Here.

372
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,190
Thank you, boss.

373
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,190
Look at your smile.

374
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,990
You must feel happy now.

375
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,330
That's right.

376
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,770
You're with your loved one every day.

377
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,450
Yuan, I have no appetite.

378
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,320
She means that you can give this to Zhou Mingming,

379
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,600
so you won't be jealous of us.

380
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,990
Why should I give this to him?

381
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,930
There is nothing between us.

382
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,800
Fine.

383
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,680
 We've read your comics.

384
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,690
 You like Zhou Mingming, right?

385
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,840
How could I like him?

386
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,170
So funny. Does he deserve me?

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,950
She means, you need to ask your heart.

388
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,390
I...

389
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,930
 I'm her boss.

390
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,330
 She can be famous because of me.

391
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,310
 Let me tell you. I'll make her into a great cartoonist,

392
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,060
 and she'll be famous all over the world.

393
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:25,670
 At that time, it's useless even if you want to close the page.

394
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,090
 Because everyone will talk about her comic,

395
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,980
 and admire her success.

396
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,660
Okay, bye-bye.

397
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,700
Xiong Fei, you are not innocent anymore.

398
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,700
Ding Dingding?

399
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,380
Why are you here?

400
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,160
To interview a new company.

401
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,700
Really?

402
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,820
I thought you were here to get revenge on me because I stood you up.

403
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,330
Funny. Do you deserve me to waste my time on you?

404
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,690
Bringing food with you to an interview?

405
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,280
You are such a foodie.

406
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,990
Let me remind you. Not every boss is as tolerant as me.

407
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,760
- Remember this. 
 - Just go.

408
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,480
You're tolerant?

409
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,730
Such a pig.

410
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,330
Mr. Luo.

411
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,310
You're here to pick up your girlfriend?

412
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:53,047
- I've never seen him. 
 - Where is Zhan Yan?

413
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:54,480
That information is expensive.

414
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,430
I'll give you a red envelope later.

415
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,863
She's in the dressing room.

416
00:27:57,863 --> 00:27:59,250
Thanks.

417
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,010
You have good eyesight.

418
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,900
Dr. Zhan really has a boyfriend?

419
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,530
This is not about eyesight.

420
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,090
This is experience.

421
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:12,160
If you're so experienced, why haven't you been caught as Dr. Cai's girlfriend?

422
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,540
I... I like him,

423
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,220
but I don't have to be his girlfriend. Right?

424
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:24,220
Does Dr. Cai know how well you find excuses for yourself?

425
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,010
Dr. Cai.

426
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,690
Dr. Cai.

427
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,330
Mr. Luo.

428
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,490
You're here to see Dr. Zhan?

429
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,330
Dr. Cai.

430
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,390
Your keyring is special.

431
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,860
This?

432
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,420
It's from my ex-girlfriend.

433
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,120
Mr. Luo,

434
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,620
let me remind you, Dr. Zhan doesn't like roses.

435
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,550
Luo Ben, did you find Zhan Yan?

436
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,830
He was fine just now.

437
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,630
What happened?

438
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,520
Men are fickle.

439
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,700
You can only be with them temporarily, instead of being with them permanently.

440
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,770
Understand?

441
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,140
This one. Contact him later.

442
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,620
Yes. Check this question.

443
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,220
Zhan Yan.

444
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,690
You argued with your boyfriend?

445
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,430
No.

446
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,630
No?

447
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,511

448
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,990

449
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,680

450
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,940
Why didn't you answer my phone since you're home?

451
00:31:51,314 --> 00:31:53,300

452
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,600
You did it on purpose?

453
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:05,820
- I'll give you a chance to explain. 
 - I have nothing to explain.

454
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:12,230
But you, shouldn't you tell me something?

455
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,530
What do you want to know?

456
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,010
What's your relationship with Cai Yuxiao?

457
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,790
Colleague.

458
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,130
Just colleague?

459
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,960
- Senior? 
 - And?

460
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,960
Ex-boyfriend.

461
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,230
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

462
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,620
It happened in college.

463
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,370
There is no need to explain.

464
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,080
Do you want to hide it from me if I don't ask?

465
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,680
I didn't hide it from you. You didn't ask.

466
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,930
You can still be so righteous?

467
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,330
What about your ex-girlfriends?

468
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,660
I don't have one.

469
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,810
That's enough.

470
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,460
I'm really your first girlfriend?

471
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,720
Don't be like this. You've been single for more than 30 years.

472
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,810
Enough, come out!

473
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,660
I'm leaving.

474
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,440

475
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,300
Mr. Luo.

476
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,600
Morning.

477
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Dr. Cai, morning.

478
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,400
Dr. Zhan, morning.

479
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,700
Morning.

480
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,000
Dr. Cai,

481
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,900
your ex-girlfriend said that you bought that camel key ring for yourself.

482
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,500
And this one is from my girlfriend now.

483
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,500
Childish.

484
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,500
Bed No. 40 patient's family.

485
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
- You can go in now. 
 - Now?

486
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,800
You can't stay in ICU for more than five minutes.

487
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,600
Okay, I know.

488
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,100
Let's go.

489
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,400
Mom.

490
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,300
Mom, please cooperate with me.

491
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,600
Our money can't be cheated by someone else. Right?

492
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,200
And you can't take it into the grave.

493
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,900
Just give it to me.

494
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,400
Son, what are you doing?

495
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,900
Mom, leave your fingerprint here.

496
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,000
Just press.

497
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Son, if I die, all my money is yours.

498
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,600
Why are you so anxious?

499
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,500
Mom, you can't take it with you. Right?

500
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,600
- Give it to me. 
 - No.

501
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,800
- Give it to me, okay? 
 - No.

502
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,000
Come on, press.  Mom.

503
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,600
- No. 
 - Mom, just cooperate with me.

504
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,700
Just press.

505
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,400
What are you doing?

506
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,600
Get out.

507
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,200
This is a family issue. Don't intervene in it.

508
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm in charge of all things in the ward. Get out.

509
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,800
- Get out.
 - It hasn't ended yet.

510
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,700
Don't intervene, okay?

511
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,100
Sir, please get out.

512
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,600
We need to rescue her now.

513
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,200
Zhan Yan, let me tell you.

514
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
If anything happens to my mom,

515
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,900
I won't let you go with it.

516
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,300
Do you hear me?

517
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,900
Ding Dingding.

518
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,200
Well done.

519
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,500
Aren't you in charge of logistics and publicity?

520
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,800
Why are you doing this now?

521
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
Why can't I choose to make progress?

522
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,200
Don't look down on me.

523
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,700
After I'm well-trained, I'll do missions.

524
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,400
I wouldn't dare.

525
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,900
Let me show you my rescue mission with double ropes.

526
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh my god.

527
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This is so beautiful.

528
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,400
Where is this place?

529
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,000
The Shuang Long Cave.

530
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,400
There are many more beautiful caves.

531
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,600
How is it?

532
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,000
I want to go there.

533
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,300
Let me have a look.

534
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,500
But you can't go there until you're technically qualified.

535
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,000
Although it's beautiful, it's very dangerous.

536
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,900
Let me tell you. Many rescue experts can't get out.

537
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,500
Anything else? I want to have a look.

538
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,300
I'll find some for you.

539
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,600
How's this one?

540
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,400
 The cave is so beautiful.

541
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,400
Dr. Zhan.

542
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Put it on.

543
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,800
I...

544
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,000
I want to make a will.

545
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,300
Okay?

546
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,800
Okay.

547
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,900
Are you sure you'll donate all your possessions?

548
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,600
Yes.

549
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,000
Actually, you can donate some

550
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and leave some for him.

551
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,500
This will do no good for him.

552
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,200
Can we begin now?

553
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,900
Okay.

554
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Dr. Xu, please help us to record it.

555
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,900
Okay.

556
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,600
You shall begin now.

557
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,200
I'm Qin Huizhen.

558
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,600
My mind is very clear now.

559
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,800
Here is my will.

560
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,100
After I die,

561
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:41,600
I'll donate all my money to the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

562
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,800
This will be carried out by Lawyer Luo Ben.

563
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
Okay.

564
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,200
Let's leave now.

565
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Thank you.

566
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,100
Let's go.

567
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,100
Thank you for today.

568
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,300
I've been a lawyer all these years, I'm used to the warmth and coldness of the world.

569
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,800
I'm willing to be kind,

570
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,800
but I also suffered losses by doing so.

571
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,400
But still, I would help others.

572
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,700
It's just, I have my own principles and bottom line.

573
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,700
Does helping Grandma Qin betray your principle?

574
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
Yes.

575
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,500
You changed me.

576
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,200
I'm not that powerful.

577
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,300
When I first got to know you, I thought you were stubborn and cold,

578
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,600
and even a little mean.

579
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,500
I thought because you were a doctor,

580
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,400
you were used to seeing life and death,

581
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
that was why you were so indifferent.

582
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:28,200
But later, the longer I've been with you,

583
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,900
the more I can feel the gentle side of you.

584
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,300
Zhan Yan,

585
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,100
because of you, even though I can see into the evil side of people,

586
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,900
I will still believe in the beauty of human nature.

587
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,200
I'm not that good.

588
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I know.

589
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Helping Grandma Qin will cause a conflict.

590
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,000
But if she had someone else to help her, why would she find me?

591
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,100
Don't worry.

592
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,800
No matter what happens next, I'm with you.

593
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,800
This is the will Qin Huizhen made.

594
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,000
She entrusted me to donate all her money to the Light Chaser Rescue Team.

595
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,800
This is a copy.

596
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,100
Impossible.

597
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,800
I have the will.

598
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
You think I don't know the law?

599
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm her son.

600
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,800
I'm the first heir.

601
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,000
You still know you're her son?

602
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,500
What do you mean?

603
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,300
In all, I've informed you.

604
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,700
Please.

605
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,600
Okay.

606
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,900
Let me tell you. Give me the money as soon as possible.

607
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,100
I'll find a lawyer as well.

608
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,100
Good. Well done.

609
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,400
Being unreasonable?

610
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,800
I'll find someone who is reasonable.

611
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,800
Who is he?

612
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,800
An unfilial son wanting to get inheritance.

613
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,600
From a rich family?

614
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,300
A normal family.

615
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,600
A legal aid case again?

616
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,700
Let your subordinates deal with it.

617
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,800
Why do you waste energy on this?

618
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,600
It's no big deal for me.

619
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,800
Let me remind you.

620
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,200
It's not worth making trouble for such a case.

621
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,800
You should put your energy into big cases.

622
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,100
I know.

623
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll manage it well.

624
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:13,040

625
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,500
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

626
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,800
♫  Until luck came and crossed the stage  ♫

627
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:38,000
♫  At first, souls were confused and wandered  ♫

628
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,100
♫  Until people hugged each other  ♫

629
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:53,000
♫  I've been on the road  ♫

630
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,000
♫  Trying to connect laughter and tears  ♫

631
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
♫  I suddenly have faith  ♫

632
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:15,600
♫  I can walk by millions of shining household lights  ♫

633
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:24,400
♫  I hope I can admire flowers in the afterglow  ♫

634
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,600
♫  Shed tears and hope that you are well  ♫

635
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:39,300
♫  The good times I'm pursuing belong to the light  ♫

636
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:47,000
♫  It can light up the wounds that follow  ♫

637
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,700
♫  Catching the floating stars  ♫

00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,500
♫  Watching as the memories flash by  ♫

639
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,100
♫  Traveling through market scenes  ♫

♫  With a fiery gaze  ♫

641

♫  I can't fly  ♫

642
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,500
♫  But I can look up  ♫

643
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:17,100
