1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,850
♫  I'm a self-righteous foam  ♫

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,220
♫  I put out mountain fires  ♫

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,750
♫  and catch the sunset  ♫

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,550
♫  I leave the rhythms of life in my wake  ♫

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:35,720
♫  Happiness whispers in my ears  ♫

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,370
♫  Chasing the passion for the future  ♫

8
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Like a dream maker  ♫

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,570
♫  Reading the universe and stars  ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,620
♫  My existence in the river of time  ♫

11
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,570
♫  With the body temperature of a moment  ♫

12
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,170
♫  I'm trying to be the extension of light  ♫

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,870
♫  If the world grants me a frustrating opening  ♫

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,520
♫  I'll chase back time like a dark horse  ♫

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:22,250
♫  Even though I know the truth, I won't be afraid  ♫

16
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I won't miss the moon because of mediocrity  ♫

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,770
♫  I won't lose the light  ♫

18
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,020

19
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,080

20
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:43,599
I'll ask about the clothes.

21
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,219
Okay.

22
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,706
Let's come back here next time.

23
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,539
Who are you waiting for, Mr. Luo?

24
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:59,699
Didn't you send your assistant home?

25
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:01,939
She's not the one I should send.

26
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,599
While I should send someone right here.

27
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,499
Of course, I'll wait.

28
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,319
Then, you shouldn't send me home, either.

29
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,660
I'd better vanish right now.

30
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:21,340
Zhan Yan, quickly help me with the person who should send me home.

31
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,839
Who's she talking about?

32
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,519
Mr. Gao.

33
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:29,679
She's taking it seriously?

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,333
You've spent a lot today.

35
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,920
Sorry for that.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,979
Beauty and wine are always a good match.

37
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,499
But you didn't even order the wine.

38
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:46,340
How stingy.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,880
I would've ordered wine before. But not now.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,119
Now I'm with you.

41
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:55,479
And I'm afraid that beauty and wine may cause misunderstandings.

42
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,640
I'm not that petty!

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,920
I do hope you're petty.

44
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,480
It means that you care about me.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,279
Tell me.

46
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:08,439
Don't you have questions to ask me since you've seen me with Ariel?

47
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,420
My questions?

48
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,819
You've drank them up.

49
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:15,239
And you say you're not petty?

50
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,059
Mr. Jin, it's been a pleasure working with you.

51
00:03:38,059 --> 00:03:39,780
We've talked for a long time.

52
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,059
We'll treat you to dinner to show our appreciation.

53
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:44,859
Mr. Jin, you must enjoy yourself today!

54
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,519
I'm all yours.

55
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,040
Please.

56
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,260

57
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:34,040
Meiren Cave.

58
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,819
Cave exploration.

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680

60
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,200
Mr. Ming.

61
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,560
Bring him home safely.

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,500
I will.

63
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,420

64
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,980
 Dingding.

65
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,120
 I really...

66
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,039
Coming.

67
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,919
Yuan Yuan? I'll be gone these days. I can't stay with you.

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,859
I also need some water.

69
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,200
 Are you running away from home?

70
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,499
I'm not you.

71
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:38,140
I'm out for a break.

72
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,179
It's time.

73
00:06:46,179 --> 00:06:48,340
I'm leaving.

74
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,859
Bye.

75
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,230
It's really for a break.

76
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,399
Here, look.

77
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,640
Look.

78
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,599
Is it beautiful?

79
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,440
 It's too dangerous going there alone.

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,800
 I know what you're worried about.

81
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,839
 Take it easy. I'll be safe.

82
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,499
 And there are other tourists.

83
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,819
 - I'll go with you.  
 - With me?

84
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,220
No. Your brother would kill me.

85
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,900
I dare not.

86
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,480
I really can't.

87
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,800
Okay, then.

88
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,039
Get packed quickly. I'll be here waiting.

89
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,299
Hurry up.

90
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:46,340
You've got your ID card and other stuff?

91
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,739
- Don't forget it. 
 - Got it.

92
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:50,359
We're traveling to a beautiful place. Take some more photos.

93
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:52,140
Lucky in time.

94
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,959
Who is Ding Dingding?

95
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,120
I am.

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,200
She's my friend Luo Yuan. She's with me.

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,559
Okay. We're all here. Get on the bus.

98
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:03,220
- Let's go. 
 - Hold your stuff.

99
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,319
Hurry up.

100
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,579
Hold your stuff.

101
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,340
Hurry up. Hurry up.

102
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:16,039
 They seem unprofessional. Shall we go back?

103
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,180
Yuan Yuan, it is quite well-developed there.

104
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,433
There's no danger. They don't need to be professional. Take it easy.

105
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,619
Why are you dawdling?

106
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:28,100
We're coming. Let's go.

107
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:48,700
No mobile phones.

108
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:58,819
 I'm going to Meiren Cave with Dingding for a break.

109
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:02,020
 We'll be back in a few days. Don't worry.

110
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,920

111
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,100

112
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:16,180
Your brother must be concerned about you.

113
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,160
 What happened?

114
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,399
Why did Yuan Yuan suddenly go out with you?

115
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,019
Don't be angry.

116
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,879
I was in a bad mood. Yuan wants to be with me.

117
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,360
Rest assured. I'll take care of her.

118
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,700
If anything happens, you'll be responsible.

119
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,759
Nothing will happen. I promise to send her back safe and sound.

120
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,160
 Meiren Cave is divided into an outer cave and an inner cave.

121
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,380
 Stay in the outer cave.

122
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,520
 Don't go inside. Be safe.

123
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,259
No one's worrying about me.

124
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,550
Except you.

125
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,020

126
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,020

127
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,480

128
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,680

129
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,460
 Hey, guys. I'm Ding Dingding.

130
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,920
 Actually, the comic is based on my own experience.

131
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,460
 I was in the disaster area when the earthquake struck Fengxi.

132
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,480
 And that's where I met Light Chase Rescue Team...

133
00:11:33,119 --> 00:11:36,680
 and someone special to me.

134
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,960
 He's both warm-hearted and timid.

135
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,699
 He shipped supplies to the disaster area to help,

136
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,820
 and didn't expect that he would faint with fear at the sight of blood.

137
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,000
 When someone fell into the water,

138
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
 he didn't hesitate to jump in and save them.

139
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,360
 Sometimes I was so angry with him,

140
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:03,900
 while sometimes I was so touched by his kindness.

141
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,259
 Is he Zhou Mengmeng?

142
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,500
 Has Zhou Mengmeng confessed to you?

143
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,182
 Don't you cherish your life?

144
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:34,580
 I do. But I believe in you.

145
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,860

146
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,039
 Dingding, I'm sorry.

147
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,759
 I miss you so much.

148
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,379
Watch your steps.

149
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,400
Isn't it beautiful?

150
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,700
- What's your problem? 
 - Don't touch them.

151
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,940
I...

152
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,000
All right then.

153
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,120
Come on. Keep up. Hurry up.

154
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,420
- Let's take a selfie. 
 - Mind the steps.

155
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,660
Come on.

156
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,579
Mind the steps. Careful.

157
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:11,399
Come on. Keep up.

158
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,539
Come on.

159
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,620
Hey, you two.

160
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,800
Keep up.

161
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,919
Hurry.

162
00:14:40,859 --> 00:14:42,059
Look.

163
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:43,980
It's fantastic.

164
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,060
Great.

165
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,711
If it's this beautiful here, it's probably better inside.

166
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:49,999
Let's go inside.

167
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:51,519
Come on.

168
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,600

169
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,359
Guys, now we've reached the limit of the outer cave in the allowed area.

170
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:34,179
Further inside is the mysterious inner cave.

171
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:37,239
Only specialists have been there so far.

172
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:39,439
So there's no guarantee of safety.

173
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,766
If you'd like to go inside, go on with us.

174
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:43,220
If you don't, return the way you came.

175
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,839
Not explored yet.

176
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,500
I don't think we should go in. I'm not going inside, then.

177
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
It reads: No entry.

178
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,380
Are you going inside?

179
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,720
I am, definitely.

180
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,480
Me, too. We're already here. Walk a little further.

181
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,840
- What about you? 
 - I'll go inside.

182
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,720
Take it easy, Yuan. It's much better than the caves our team members entered.

183
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,239
Or you can go back with us. Wait for me outside.

184
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,039
I'll be back soon. All right?

185
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,437
- You're going with me? 
 - We're not going.

186
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,679
- You're so kind to me. 
 - You go on, then.

187
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,519
Okay. Return the way you came.

188
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,740
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

189
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,979
See you at the station at nine.

190
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,140
Okay. Bye.

191
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,279
- Bye. 
 - See you later.

192
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,239
- Shall we? 
 - Let's go.

193
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:26,999
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

194
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,720
Let's go.

195
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,720
It's so beautiful!

196
00:16:56,739 --> 00:16:59,799
- You didn't come with me for nothing, did you? 
 - You're right.

197
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,800
Lucky to be here.

198
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,540
The area is not open to the public yet.

199
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,259
We must be careful.

200
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:09,439
Okay.

201
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,779
Let's go.

202
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,959
- Mind your steps. 
 - Okay.

203
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,899
Take care. Mind your head.

204
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:00,940
Follow me, here.

205
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,760
Mind your head. Give your hand to me.

206
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,199
Walk carefully.

207
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,339
It's amazing.

208
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,080
It's getting more and more humid. Is it raining outside?

209
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,720
There's no rain these days.

210
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,760
The weather can be unpredictable here.

211
00:19:13,879 --> 00:19:16,440
We should stop here today. Let's go back.

212
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,760
What's the panic?

213
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,239
It's 7:00 now.

214
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:22,260
Leave yourself if you're afraid.

215
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,719
I will go further.

216
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,539
We'll leave you, then.

217
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,079
Take care.

218
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,119
You, too.

219
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,980
Why is there so much water?

220
00:19:52,699 --> 00:19:55,980
Bobcat! Xuelihong! Come here quickly!

221
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,179
What's up?

222
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,860
Look! There's so much water.

223
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,500
- It's no good! 
 - Let's get out!

224
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,180
Go.

225
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,280
- Be careful. 
 - Go.

226
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,320
Yuan Yuan.

227
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,280
Take care.

228
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,499
Okay. I got it.

229
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:42,260
We'll cooperate fully with the rescue.

230
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,719
See you there, Director Liu.

231
00:20:44,719 --> 00:20:47,960
Doctor Ruan, there're travelers missing in the Meiren Cave of Meishan.

232
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,560
Send a mission.

233
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Be quick. It's far from us.

234
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,380
Director Liu. Got it.

235
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,019
I'll be on my way.

236
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,999
Xiong Fei, haven't you found Luo Yuan?

237
00:21:01,999 --> 00:21:04,420
Not yet. I'm meeting up with the team.

238
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:19,980
Xiong Fei, is Dingding with Luo Yuan?

239
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,660
What?

240
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:42,180
Let's swim out of here before the water level rises.

241
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,120
Can you see your way in such darkness?

242
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,999
We can't take the risk.

243
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,939
We can never get out if we're lost.

244
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,802
It's all your fault.

245
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:56,499
All your fault.

246
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,899
It wouldn't have happened if we had gone out.

247
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,540
- What's it got to do with me? 
 - You...

248
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,699
I didn't force you. You wanted to come in.

249
00:22:01,699 --> 00:22:04,079
You are the team leader. Of course, it has something to do with you.

250
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,639
You must take us out.

251
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:06,839
Do I not want to go out?

252
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,179
- There is water everywhere! 
 - Stop it.

253
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,779
It's no use arguing.

254
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:15,920
No signals.

255
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,400
No phone calls.

256
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,159
Are we...

257
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,139
Are we just waiting here for death?

258
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,639
Other travelers will call the police since they can't find us.

259
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:27,220
The rescue team will surely come to our rescue.

260
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,299
Rescue team?

261
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:31,239
When they finally come here, we'll be...

262
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,779
How is it?

263
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:38,060
Are you okay?

264
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,560
Yes.

265
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,639
Save your breath.

266
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,040

267
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,719
It's strange.

268
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,779
The water level is rising.

269
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:04,620
How can we get out?

270
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,299
The entrance will be flooded soon.

271
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,679
Let's go, then. To find a safe place.

272
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,720
When the water's down, the rescue team will definitely find us.

273
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,800
That's the only way.

274
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,219
Let's go. Hurry up.

275
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:20,339
Wait for me there.

276
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:21,480
Be careful.

277
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,460
Come on.

278
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,019
Take care.

279
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:33,000
The entrance is about to be flooded.

280
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,739
Hurry.

281
00:23:36,459 --> 00:23:38,439
Watch your steps.

282
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,380
Be careful.

283
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,960
The top is so low.

284
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,499
Be careful.

285
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,500
 As of 5.05 BST,

286
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,259
 we have not yet found the four trapped travelers.

287
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,660
 A professional dive rescue team has been deployed.

288
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,166
 Members of Light Chaser Rescue Team,

289
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:41,620
 please join the rescue at the designated location with your equipment.

290
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:47,859
Here.

291
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:49,719
Here you are.

292
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Could you tell us about the rescue on site?

293
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,079
All is in place now.

294
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,340
Zhan Yan.

295
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,219
You're all here.

296
00:25:04,219 --> 00:25:06,979
Yuan Yuan is in Meiren cave with Ding Dingding.

297
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:11,800
Okay.

298
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,820
Monitor the weather changes in the region.

299
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,740
Report to me at once if there're any emergencies.

300
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,302
Where's the map?

301
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,459
Director Liu, look at the map. Here.

302
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:24,140
Director Liu.

303
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,879
- Director Liu. 
 - Hi. What's going on now?

304
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:28,744
Come here, all of you!

305
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,560
The travel route of Meiren Cave is longer than 10 km.

306
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,739
It's too easy to get lost.

307
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,299
The rain makes it even worse.

308
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:40,040
According to our divers, over 1,300 meters of low-lying land

309
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,059
is completely submerged in water.

310
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,660
So is the exit.

311
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,920
It's filled with water from here to here.

312
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,919
They're exhausted after diving for so long.

313
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:50,620
So we need your help.

314
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,179
What about the callers?

315
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:54,119
What can we know from them?

316
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,199
The callers were traveling together with the people inside.

317
00:25:57,199 --> 00:26:00,220
They drew their movements.

318
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,639
We predict that they should be here now. Here.

319
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:05,919
It's on the way to the entrance.

320
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,720
But it's submerged in water. We can only dive through.

321
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,439
We're already draining water.

322
00:26:10,439 --> 00:26:15,539
But according to the meteorological sector, showers are still expected in the region.

323
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,340
Too late for drainage. The water level is rising.

324
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,059
Immediate diving rescue is required.

325
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,240
Are there any other exits to the inner cave?

326
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,160
Caves like this usually have several exits.

327
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,259
That's right. We haven't found any.

328
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,299
I suggest sending two teams.

329
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:37,339
Send a diving team for rescue.

330
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:40,179
And I'll take the other team to find other exits.

331
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,120
I agree. Go now.

332
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,579
By the way, the divers we sent before found a place suitable for air cavities.

333
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,779
They've set the snorkels, cylinders and spare cylinders here.

334
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,320
The rest is up to you guys.

335
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,400
Okay.

336
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,499
Listen to me.

337
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:57,040
For group one, Zhan Yan takes three divers into the cave

338
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,259
with supplies and diving equipment.

339
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,999
Make sure you find the trapped travelers.

340
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:05,299
For group two, Luo Ben takes the team to search for other exits above the cave.

341
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,760
Other team members should also be ready anytime.

342
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,859
 Roger that!

343
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:46,099
Let me see.

344
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,860
You've got a fever.

345
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,420
Do you have antipyretics?

346
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,339
Yuan, have some hot water.

347
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,339
Take it slowly.

348
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,599
Don't be afraid. Someone will come to our rescue.

349
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,059
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have let you in.

350
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:37,280
I promised your brother to take care of you.

351
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,880
I'm so useless.

352
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,059
How troublesome.

353
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:41,420
What are you saying?

354
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,613
Stop the nonsense.

355
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,919
Keep it on.

356
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,140
Zhan Yan, I'll go with you.

357
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,459
- You're in group two. 
 - Ding Dingding is in there.

358
00:29:00,459 --> 00:29:02,140
I know. It's not the time for sentimentality.

359
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,839
You've got other tasks in group two.

360
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,860
But...

361
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,600
Zhou Mingming!

362
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,320
I understand your feelings.

363
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,999
But this is your first mission.

364
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,439
You must obey orders.

365
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:14,720
- But... 
 - No buts.

366
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,060
Take care of yourself.

367
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,580
Don't worry. I'll bring Luo Yuan back safe and sound.

368
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,019
Let's go!

369
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:30,599
Group two, come with me.

370
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,259
 Got it.

371
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,720
Does your flashlight still have power?

372
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,180
No.

373
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,800
What about you?

374
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:28,739
Look! The water's rising again.

375
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:31,779
Look.

376
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,519
What's the matter?

377
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:44,539
Do you need water?

378
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,779
- We don't have any. 
 - Wait a moment, Yuan.

379
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,320
Do you have any water?

380
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,140
I don't.

381
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,520
What about you?

382
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,320
I don't have enough for myself.

383
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,060
She's got a fever. Can you spare me a little? Please?

384
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:12,080
I'll buy it.

385
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,140
Five hundred. Is that enough?

386
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,519
- What about a thousand? 
 - What's the use of money when I'm dead?

387
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,340
The girl's ill! Give her some.

388
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,180
You can't take this.

389
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,199
Don't drink any water here.

390
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:47,380
No one knows if it's been polluted.

391
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,499
Out of my way.

392
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,019
Yuan, I want to go home.

393
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:22,579
If I can get out this time,

394
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:25,280
I'll be honest with Zhou Mingming.

395
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,860
I'll hide my feelings no more.

396
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,420
Are you scared?

397
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,579
I'm afraid of death, too.

398
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,940
I'm sorry.

399
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,339
Thank you.

400
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:03,180
Drink it, Yuan.

401
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,980
Thanks.

402
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,620
Take it slowly.

403
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:20,420
Feel better?

404
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,579
Don't worry, Yuan.

405
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,620
Your brother will come to our rescue.

406
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,819
He'll come to us when he hears you whistling.

407
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,720
Don't be afraid.

408
00:34:06,939 --> 00:34:08,940
We'll get in from here later.

409
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,599
Here are two sets of diving equipment.

410
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,839
When you find them, bring two of them out first.

411
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,179
Okay.

412
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,659
Let's go.

413
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,899
- Hello. 
 - Hey.

414
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:37,519
Where are you? When are you coming back?

415
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,339
I don't know. Ding Dingding's still in there.

416
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,079
Can you come back now?

417
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:45,500
 Mr. Jin wants to meet you to discuss the investment.

418
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,199
You know how important this investment is to the company.

419
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:51,240
I know. But I can't leave.

420
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:00,340
Mingming, the company can't afford to lose any client now.

421
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,640
I can't afford to lose Ding Dingding, either.

422
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:12,799
 Zhou Mingming, report back!

423
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:15,159
Zhou Mingming reporting, no message from the cave.

424
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:16,740
Got it.

425
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,360
The rain has finally stopped.

426
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,860
The clous have not yet lifted.

427
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,699
Not sure when it will rain again.

428
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,239
Such is the weather in the mountains.

429
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:59,480
Dude, how far is the sinkhole you said?

430
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,160
Just ahead.

431
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,300
A snake!

432
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,559
It's gone.

433
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:13,940
Are you okay?

434
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:16,680
I'm afraid of snakes.

435
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:20,160
- Wukong, distribute the ointment. 
 - Okay.

436
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,560
Rub your exposed skin with ointment to avoid poisonous insect bites.

437
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,959
Hit the grass as you go.

438
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:28,379
Snakes run away when they hear the sound.

439
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,499
Hold on.

440
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,700
Looks like we're on the right track.

441
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,040
Quick.

442
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,120
Come on. Take care.

443
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,739
Be careful.

444
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,379
This way.

445
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:44,260
Take care.

446
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:55,940
Here. Right ahead.

447
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,699
- Set up. 
  - Roger that.

448
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,060
Stay here for security. I'm going down.

449
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,559
It's done.

450
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:39,900
I'll go.

451
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,420
Xiong Fei.

452
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,559
Be safe.

453
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,217
Is there really another exit from the sinkhole?

454
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:16,319
The formation of sinkholes is linked to the erosion of underground rivers.

455
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,179
The exit from the underground river is probably here.

456
00:39:54,299 --> 00:39:57,080
Xiong Fei, come up.

457
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,039
Come on.

458
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:59,080
- Come on. 
 - Pull.

459
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,299
I'll help you.

460
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:05,939
One, two!

461
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,919
One and two!

462
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,640
How is it?

463
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,959
Director, look.

464
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,880
Group two, report back.

465
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,420
Roger that.

466
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,040
The first target position is reached.

467
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,980
No exit found.

468
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,080
 Keep searching.

469
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,519
Got it.

470
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,380
Keep searching.

471
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,599
 It's Yuan Yuan.

472
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,100
Look.

473
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,640
Yuan Yuan.

474
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,979
Sis.

475
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:46,659
We're saved.

476
00:42:50,100 --> 00:43:00,000

477
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,150
♫  At first, there was no sadness in the world  ♫

478

483
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:53,720
