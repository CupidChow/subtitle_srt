=Episode 8=

3
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,190
Ms. Zhang.

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,710
She is from our legal department.

5
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,750
Did you receive the Yuni brand contract?

7
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,920
That contract

8
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,750
was just delivered to President Qin's office.

9
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,430
It must have been signed by now.

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,270
Okay, thank you.

11
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,590
Ms. Jian!

12
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,260
(Party A (Signature): Jian Moran
Party B (Signature):)

13
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,230
The contract between FUY and Yuni is void.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,430
Huo Jinyan,

15
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,480
this matter is between Ms. Jian and me,

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,430
what does it have to do with you?

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,400
What's your standing here?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The news about FUY's data fabrication is out.

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:26,310
Do you think Ms. Jian

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,840
would still sign this contract with you?

21
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,950
The data fabrication was an individual act.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,950
I've already fired the involved employees.

23
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,400
Besides,

24
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,680
this contract doesn't mention it,

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,950
so it's valid.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,710
Behind FUY's data fabrication,

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,950
there's a large sum of money missing.

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,950
I heard

29
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,590
this money had flowed into a strange account.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,990
Bluffing, huh?

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,710
Where's the evidence?

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,920
Since I dare to say it,

33
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,280
I surely have evidence.

34
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,750
If I inform the media about these matters,

35
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,750
President Qin, you can

36
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,240
imagine the consequences.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
Fine,

38
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
I won't sign it.

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,840
Thank you for your generosity.

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
By the way,

41
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,710
although I haven't informed the media,

42
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
there should be a bunch of shareholders

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,030
on their way to FUY right now.

44
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,190
Who exactly are you?

45
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,750
President Qin.

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
It hasn't been signed yet.

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,360
Sorry, President Qin,

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,840
maybe next time we can cooperate.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,840
Ms. Jian, since you are

50
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,360
not interested in cooperating with FUY,

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,710
- maybe next time.
- Thank you.

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Investigate someone for me.

53
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,430
I'll send you the information.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,240
Ms. Jian.

55
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,520
Ji Jie, you've come at the right time.

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,800
About that batch of fabrics,

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,750
find a warehouse for storage now.

58
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,030
I was about to discuss this with you.

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,960
A warehouse just contacted us,

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
offering to rent at a low price to Yuni.

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,920
Low price?

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,240
What a coincidence.

63
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,680
Confirm it again,

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
and if there's no issue,
proceed with the contract.

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
Okay.

66
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,590
- Ms. Jian.
- Yes?

67
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,430
Do you need to draft a renewal

68
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,360
for the love contract?

69
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Contract?

70
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
Wasn't it for three months?

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
How much longer is left?

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,840
Only five days left?

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,480
You should draft a new contract,

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,830
and make all the unequal terms

75
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,270
apply to Huo Jinyan.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Ms. Jian,

77
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,750
you haven't really fallen for him, have you?

78
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
No, I haven't.

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,510
I still have to deal with the board meeting.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,390
Go on.

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,200
Sorry.

82
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,240
(Contract Love)
Mr. Jian, my fault.

83
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,000
If there's nothing else, I'll get busy.

84
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,270
Go ahead.

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,270
The three-month term is about to end.

86
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,190
What do you plan to do?

87
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,120
I haven't decided yet.

88
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,600
If you want to leave, you can.

89
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,390
But since FUY had issues,

90
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,270
I haven't fulfilled my promise to you.

91
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,630
However, I can make an exception

92
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,560
and renew for another six months,

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,600
and I'll find you
an even better endorsement deal.

94
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
I don't want to renew.

95
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,160
Why?

96
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,310
I don't want our relationship
to be just a contract.

97
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Then

98
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,790
what else could it be?

99
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,680
(What does he mean?)

100
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,360
(Does he want a)

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,700
(master-servant relationship?)

102
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,240
- Please.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
(No,)

104
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,190
(I can't let him win.)

105
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
My watch!

106
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,630
It's a limited edition worldwide!

107
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,830
My beloved watch.

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,630
You've been with me for so many years

109
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,270
and I couldn't take good care of you.

110
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,360
What do you want?

112
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,030
Look,

113
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,870
my watch is broken,

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,950
but I don't blame you.

115
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,560
Maybe,

116
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,950
you can do three months of housework
to make up for it.

117
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,040
Are you sure it was me who broke it?

118
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,470
Of...

119
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,720
Of course.

120
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,000
Could it be

121
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,310
you intentionally broke it to set me up?

123
