=Episode 4=

3
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,150
Where is it?

4
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,560
In the bag, in the bag.

5
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,910
It's not here.

6
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,150
I'll ask again, where is it?

7
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,230
In my pocket.

8
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,120
Why are you doing this?

9
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,280
My mother is sick,

10
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
and I need money,

11
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,950
so I wanted to steal and sell it.

12
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,070
This is the only copy.
I absolutely haven't leaked it.

13
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:38,990
Get lost.

14
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,710
Are you alright?

15
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,910
I'm fine.

16
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,760
How did you know I was here?

17
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,070
I have superpowers.

18
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,790
Ji Jie told me.

19
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,350
Thank you.

20
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,840
Trojan virus.

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,360
Oh no, it's a trap.

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
This USB drive has been infected
with a Trojan virus.

23
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,680
Once the invasion succeeds,

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,060
it's not just the interweaving technique

25
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,310
that will be leaked, but all of Yuni's
secret software as well.

26
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,080
No wonder we caught him so easily.

27
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,120
It turns out this was all part of their plan.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,120
Quick,

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,520
go get the tech team over here.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,360
Okay.

31
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,990
I'll do it.

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,150
Aren't you supposed to attend the banquet?

33
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,960
There's no time, and it's too far.

34
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,970
You go ahead.

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,910
Can you handle it?

36
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,030
Don't worry.

37
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,280
Sorry for being late.

38
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,030
The appreciation dinner is about to start.

39
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,870
Get ready.

40
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,920
Okay.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,910
Why didn't Huo Jinyan come with you?

42
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,360
There was something he had to deal with.

43
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,080
He probably didn't dare to come.

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,840
After all, nobody knows if he's really
your boyfriend.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,400
Mr. Zhang, are you implying something about me?

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,430
I wouldn't dare.

47
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,310
I wouldn't want you to upset my father
at the board meeting again.

48
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,430
By the way,

49
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,030
today, I brought someone.

50
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,430
You know this person.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,280
He's the matchmaker for you two.

52
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,310
Real or fake, you'll know right away.

53
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,000
(Could it be the kidnapper from that day?)

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:33,990
(Oh no.)

55
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,680
Mr. Zhang,

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,710
there are so many people here today,

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,400
let's talk privately if there's an issue.

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,200
No need.

59
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,910
With everyone here,

60
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,000
let's talk now.

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,000
Yuan has arrived.

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,960
You know him, right?

63
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
Ms. Jian, I'm sorry.

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,270
That day, we mistook you for someone else.

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,750
We were actually rehearsing a kidnapping scene

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,360
and hired an extra from the internet.

67
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,160
It was dark, and we made a mistake.

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,240
We're truly sorry.

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,070
That's not what you said earlier.

70
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,040
Alright, alright.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,310
Since it's a misunderstanding, just clear it up,

72
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,000
and let's not harm the good atmosphere.

73
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,950
You can go now.

74
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,430
Mr. Zhang,

75
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,480
do you have

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,360
other problems?

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,960
Alright, alright.

78
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,270
Today's appreciation dinner

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,830
is attended by all our investors,

80
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,190
which is very important
both for Jane's and Yuni.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
Regardless of any personal problems
you may have,

82
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,160
we cannot let outsiders see us as a joke.

83
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,270
(What's he doing with the wine?)

84
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,830
Today, I take this opportunity

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,630
to thank everyone for
your continuous contributions to the company,

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,000
accompanying its growth

87
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,480
all the way to today.

88
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,880
Here,

89
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,560
I raise my glass to all of you.

90
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,070
Thank you, everyone.

91
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,720
Sit down, please.

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,480
It was my fault just now, Ms. Jian.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,560
Please drink this and forget about it.

94
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
I accept your apology,

95
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,600
but there's no need for the drink.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,360
Ms. Jian, we work in the same company.

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,270
We have to face each other eventually.

98
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,270
If you don't drink this glass,

99
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,190
I'll feel uneasy.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,840
Moran,

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,310
everyone's watching.

102
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,240
Since Mr. Zhang is sincere,

103
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
just drink it.

104
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,000
Sorry, everyone,

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
for being late.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,190
I am Moran's fiancé,

107
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,000
Huo Jinyan.

108
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,800
Moran is not feeling well today,

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,160
so I'll drink this glass on her behalf.

110
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Good.

111
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,830
Huo Jinyan, right?

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,240
Come on, take a seat.

113
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,160
Today,

114
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,630
take this chance to get to know everyone.

115
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,830
I'm really sorry

116
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,000
for being late today.

117
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,390
I'll drink a penalty glass myself.

118
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,000
This glass

119
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,390
- is to everyone.
- Okay.

120
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Cheers.

121
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,040
Excuse me, everyone.

122
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
Okay.

123
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,830
I'll go check on him.

124
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Go ahead.

125
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,800
Let's continue, everyone.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
(I knew there's something wrong with the wine.)

127
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Are you okay?

128
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,070
- Let me take a look.
- I'm fine.

129
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,440
Get out.

130
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
Why are you burning up?

131
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,960
Is there something wrong with the wine?

132
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
Leave now.

133
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,270
I'm fine.

134
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,310
The water is too cold, I'll help you out.
