=Episode 5=

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Who told you to do that?

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,840
Did you ask me?

5
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,790
I got carried away

6
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,000
and just wanted to embarrass her.

7
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,680
About the kidnapper, I can...

8
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Kidnapper my foot!

9
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,990
Useless.

10
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,870
You can't even handle such a simple task.

11
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,760
What can you do right?

12
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,350
Come in!

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,310
Mr. Jian.

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,120
It's him again.

15
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,430
Him again!

16
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
(What)

17
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,590
(happened?)

18
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,030
(It was not a dream?)

19
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,310
You're awake.

20
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,910
About last night,

21
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,550
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,190
I'll take responsibility.

23
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
(Thankfully,)

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,190
(he doesn't remember.)

25
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
Sorry,

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,360
I feel a bit dizzy.

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
I shouldn't have...

28
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,710
(This is great.)

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,680
(I won the bet.)

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
Responsibility?

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,910
Then,

32
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,190
how will you take responsibility?

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,960
This time,

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
you were trying to help me,

35
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,310
so I won't hold it against you.

36
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,800
I think Uncle can believe me now.

37
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,870
I'll fulfill my promise and introduce you

38
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
to Qin Zhenghao as soon as possible.

39
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,710
Thank you.

40
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
You're welcome.

41
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,430
(What was that drug?)

42
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,520
(Why can't I remember the crucial part?)

43
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,310
I've already made it very clear.

44
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,510
Either leave now

45
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,510
or I'm calling the police.

46
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,600
Then call the police.

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,870
I know that

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,430
Qin Zhenghao is inside.

49
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,950
Tell him to come out and explain it to us.

50
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,190
Yeah, explain, explain.

51
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,360
We've worked in the company for so many years.

52
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,720
Why should we be fired just like that?

53
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,040
Yeah, why?

54
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
Tell him to come out.

55
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,880
Don't touch me.

56
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,390
Tell Qin to come out.

57
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Tell him to come out!

58
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
- Come out.
- Why?

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,500
I know Qin is inside.

60
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,040
Tell him to come out and talk to us.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,430
Don't touch me. Come out!

62
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,830
Come out now.

63
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,750
Tell him to come out.

64
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,390
Come out.

65
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,310
Tell him to come out.

66
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,880
Don't touch me.

67
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,920
Mr. Huo, Ms. Jian told me about you.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,440
Qin Zhenghao.

69
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,480
Huo Jinyan.

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,190
Let's talk in the office.

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,560
Mr. Qin, those people are...

72
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,430
They are being unreasonable.

73
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,040
It's normal for companies to upgrade

74
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,480
and automate, replacing manual labor
with machines.

75
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:07,910
This way.

76
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,480
President Huo, we just found out that

77
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,800
FUY's upgrade and transformation

78
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,190
were completed three months ago.

79
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,830
The workers being laid off has nothing to do

80
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,510
with this recent upgrade.

81
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,160
It seems FUY is quite complicated.

82
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,920
Contact those workers and conduct

83
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,120
a thorough investigation.

84
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,590
President Huo,

85
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,800
if FUY really has issues,

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,920
wouldn't Ms. Jian be in danger?

87
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,750
I suspect

88
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,560
this is a trap.

89
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,020
(Jane's Group)

90
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Moran,

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,240
it's raining, let me give you a ride.

92
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,790
No need.

93
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,750
Jinyan will pick me up.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,000
You might not get home until night.

95
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,190
Come on, I'll send you home.

96
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,670
Moran.

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,510
Have you been waiting?

98
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,000
Did I arrive late?

99
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
No, just in time.

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
Let's go.

101
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Why did you suddenly come to pick me up today?

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
Just happened to be passing by.

103
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,320
Ms. Jian,

104
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,000
Yuni's warehouse has a burst water pipe,

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,540
causing widespread water accumulation.

106
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,510
The fabrics are all soaked.

107
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,630
If we dry and repair them,

108
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,360
we might lose 50% of the value.

109
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
I'm heading there now.

110
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,320
Where are you going?

111
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,680
Something came up at the company.

112
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,360
No, I'm hungry.

113
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,950
Go make me some cookies.

114
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,000
Order takeout, I really have something urgent.

115
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,600
Contract clause 3.5,

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,000
Party A has the right to demand Party B
provide three meals a day.

117
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,360
You really think

118
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
I'd abide by such tyrannical terms?

119
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,560
Clause 10.10,

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,390
breach of contract leads to termination,

121
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,630
effective immediately and to be made public.

122
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Fine,

123
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,270
you wait.

124
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
Kyle,

125
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,000
purchase a batch of high-quality fabrics
from Mr. Lu and send them to Yuni.

126
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,630
Pay from my personal account.

127
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,440
Here,

128
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,590
eat.

129
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,760
Join me.

130
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,480
No, I really have something urgent.

131
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,960
Ms. Jian,

132
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,080
Mr. Lu suddenly changed his mind

133
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,120
and will supply Yuni with a batch
of high-quality fabrics in a few days.

134
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,480
We don't need to return the original fabrics.

135
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,910
Is the information accurate?

136
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm certain.

137
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
Can you join me now?

138
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
No, I'm not hungry.

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,320
Actually,

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
I can join you.

141
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,360
Aren't you going to eat?

142
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,750
Try it, it's really good.
