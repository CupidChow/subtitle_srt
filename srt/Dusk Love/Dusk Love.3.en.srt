=Episode 3=

3
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,120
Have some fruit.

4
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,070
Here.

5
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:00,430
Thank you. You can go.

6
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,590
(What a ridiculous contract.)

7
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,040
(It makes me a nanny.)

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,350
Could you pour me a glass of water, please?

9
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,870
Sure.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,840
Here.

11
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Thank you.

12
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,630
(No way.)

13
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,680
(I need to take revenge.)

14
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,400
Oh dear!

15
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,190
I'm so sorry.

16
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,750
I wasn't paying attention.

17
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,470
I'll get you a hairdryer.

18
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,520
It's okay, I'll do it myself.

19
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
- Let me help you.
- No need, I can manage.

20
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,870
Jian Moran!

21
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,580
(A Few Days Ago)

22
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,710
(What happened?)

23
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,150
(How did I get so drunk?)

24
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,680
(I almost screwed it up.)

25
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,680
(What is she)

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,870
(trying to do?)

27
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,800
(Just see how I'll handle you.)

28
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,750
You're awake.

29
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,320
Jinyan,

30
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,190
can you help me with the zipper?

31
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,870
About last night,

32
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
I'll take responsibility.

33
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,160
Actually, last night you didn't really...

34
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,430
As long as you agree to be my fiancé,

35
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
I'll make sure Qin Zhenghao invites you

36
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,950
to be the spokesman for his company.

37
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,430
If you don't believe me,

38
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,870
we can draft a contract,

39
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,870
for a duration of three months.

40
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,710
I don't need it.

41
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,030
Wait.

42
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
What?

43
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,430
You wanted me to be

44
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,480
your fiancé, right?

45
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,920
I'm baking cookies,

46
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,390
I need to take a look.

47
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,120
The contract,

48
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,630
I'll sign it.

49
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,310
- Hello?
- There's an incident.

50
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,120
Someone sneaked in and stole
the five-color interweaving technique.

51
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,200
What?

52
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,120
Did you find anything?

53
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,870
Ms. Jian, I've checked already.

54
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,750
Nothing in your office is missing.

55
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,910
I think

56
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,920
they were after your computer.

57
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,830
Pause here.

58
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,240
This looks like the uniform
from Songhua Electronics Factory.

59
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,620
(Yu City Songhua Electronics Factory)

60
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,000
You, stop!

61
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,230
Stop, don't run!

62
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't move!

63
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,390
Stop right there!

64
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Don't run!

65
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Don't do that!

66
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,830
Hand it over!

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,920
Give it to me!

68
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
I don't know what you're talking about.

69
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,400
Wasn't it you who stole the five-color
interweaving technique?

70
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,560
Just give it to me,

71
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,120
and I won't hold you responsible.

72
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,380
(Mini Theater)

73
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
This is the treaty you must adhere to.

74
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,070
If there are no issues, please sign.

75
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,980
(Contract Love)

76
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,270
Just these clauses? No problem.
