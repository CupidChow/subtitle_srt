00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,910
Ms. Jian,

4
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,390
Fanty told us

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Yuni could secretly collaborate with FUY.

6
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,400
What are you two talking about?

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,750
Yicheng, please have a seat.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,480
It's all because of that jerk Huo Jinyan.

9
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,760
Now many factories

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,350
have suspended their cooperation with Yuni.

11
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,560
If we can't find a suitable factory,

12
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,000
then the Yuni project

13
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,510
can't proceed any further.

14
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,950
Everyone's efforts would be in vain.

15
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,430
Don't worry.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,120
If you really can't find one,

17
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,480
I have a few suitable options
I can introduce to you.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,040
No need for now.

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,560
We'll try to negotiate first.

20
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
Get back to work.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,400
Yicheng, why are you here?

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,760
Nothing,

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
just wanted to ask if you're free tonight.

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,120
I'd like to invite you to dinner.

25
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,710
Just tell me the time.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Okay.

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,790
By the way, I'm planning a family gathering
this weekend.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,000
I hope you can come.

29
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,350
Sure.

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,430
Alright, I'll leave first then.

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,790
Okay.

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,150
Check if Yuni and Fanty

33
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,280
are secretly cooperating.

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,470
Why are you here?

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,840
I know where that money went.

36
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,860
(File Bag)

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,000
But I have a condition.

38
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,460
(File Bag)

39
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,310
No problem.

40
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,780
(Jane's Yuni Brand

41
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,190
Let's have dinner together.

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm having dinner with Jian Yicheng.

43
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,300
(Huo Jinyan)

44
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,820
(Huo Jinyan)

45
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,790
Why are you here?

46
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,950
To pick you up from work.

47
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,510
Jian Yicheng asked me out for dinner.

48
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,270
No, I don't want you to go.

49
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
Mr. Jian,

50
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,430
no cooperation
between Yuni and Fanty was found.

51
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,000
Got it.

52
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,870
Let me say it again,

53
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,270
I don't agree.

54
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,560
Jian Yicheng already suspects

55
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,600
Yuni and Fanty are secretly collaborating.

56
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,390
Shouldn't I continue the act?

57
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,840
Don't worry,

58
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,120
he won't find out anything.

59
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,160
Also, he's organized a party this weekend

60
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,470
and asked me to come.

61
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,870
I think he definitely knows something.

62
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,870
With me here,
he doesn't need to know anything.

63
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,710
Everyone,

64
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
on today's gathering,

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to announce
something very important.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
Moran,

67
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,070
from the first moment I saw you,

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,680
I fell for you.

69
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,360
Will you marry me?

70
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,150
Moran,

71
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,000
you've broken up with Huo Jinyan.

72
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,870
Let Yicheng accompany you to start over.

73
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,270
