3
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,760
Moran!

4
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,230
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

5
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,310
I wasn't like this before.

6
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,560
In high school,

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,280
I experienced a car accident with my father,

8
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,790
and only I survived.

9
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,430
Be careful!

10
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,590
Then, I lost my memory

11
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,710
and developed a fear of the dark.

12
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,640
The ground is cold.

13
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,920
I'll get you to bed.

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
No. Don't leave.

15
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,990
Don't go.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,840
I won't leave.

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,400
I'll stay with you.

18
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,150
President Huo,

19
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,680
after investigating, we found that

20
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,030
the profits across FUY's different factories
are quite similar,

21
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,100
and the signatures of different

22
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,360
factory heads are almost identical.

23
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,960
But realistically, this wouldn't be the case

24
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,190
as sales volumes should vary

25
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,080
due to differing costs

26
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,280
in different regions.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,870
Call the heads of the factories

28
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,280
under the guise of franchising.

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,550
Okay.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
(Qin Zhenghao,)

31
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,800
(what exactly is your scheme?)

32
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,840
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

33
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,910
I'll take responsibility.

34
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,240
(Huo Jinyan)
I have some matters to attend to

35
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,430
and will be home late.

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
Ms. Jian,

37
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,430
Mr. Lu said the fabrics will be shipped
within three days.

38
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,080
But our warehouse

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,240
is still under repair from the last storm.

40
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,000
Where will we store the fabrics
once they arrive?

41
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,430
Follow up

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,910
on the contract with FUY

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,280
and have the fabrics
directly shipped to their factory.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
Okay.

45
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,750
Hey, wait.

46
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,680
I...

47
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,310
have a friend

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,800
who keeps thinking about

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,280
a guy she met.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,030
Do you think she's sick?

51
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,840
Based on my analysis,

52
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Ms. Jian,

53
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,240
your "friend"

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,310
probably has fallen for him.

55
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,710
How could

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,030
my friend fall for him?

57
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,310
He's so overbearing.

58
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,680
I have two ways to help you confirm.

59
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,000
I hope they are not bad ideas.

60
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,230
Ms. Jian,

61
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,800
just tell me,

62
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,070
this "friend"

63
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,560
isn't actually you, right?

64
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,560
Are you going to say it or not?

65
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,830
I will, I will!

66
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,240
The first method is

67
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,190
to invite him
to watch a romantic movie together.

68
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,000
Romantic movie?

69
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,800
Do you have any recommendations?

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Yes,

71
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,070
I lent Wang a USB drive earlier

72
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,630
that's filled with romantic movies.

73
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,270
- I'll go get it for you now.
- Hurry, hurry.

74
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,110
- Okay.
- Get it.

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,680
(Not bad.)

76
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,070
President Huo, I called

77
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,720
several FUY factory heads,

78
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,120
but they all said the same thing,

79
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,750
as if they're hiding something.

80
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,750
I specifically looked into factories
in remote areas

81
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,000
and found they had already closed down,

82
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,190
but their data was still being reported.

83
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,240
Send someone to those factories immediately.

84
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,870
- Quickly.
- Okay.

85
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,070
Why are you back?

86
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,560
I have finished my work.

87
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,960
What's up?

88
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,870
Let's watch a movie together.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
(So sudden.)

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,640
Okay.

91
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,910
Okay.

92
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,200
This movie

93
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,160
seems a bit strange, right?

94
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
Yes,

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,720
it is strange.

96
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,950
How can the female lead dress like this?

97
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,880
A uniform

98
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,510
with black stockings?

99
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,510
Please.

100
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,950
Uniforms represent purity,

101
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,040
black stockings suggest seduction.

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
How can these be mixed?

103
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,270
And look at that.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,000
Bunny ears and tail?

105
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,100
It's just a mess of elements.

106
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
(Wink)

107
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,560
I want to see who the costume designer is.

108
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,060
(Wink)

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,390
(If the climax of the movie)

110
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
(makes your heart flutter,)

111
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,000
(and you want to do such things with the man,)

112
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,920
(it means you've fallen for him.)

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,390
The movie just now

114
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,800
was a mistake.

115
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,360
Why don't we do something

116
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,680
to relieve stress?

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Relieve

118
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,750
stress?

119

Wang.

You know what I mean.

121
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,940
(It's fine.)

122
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,240
