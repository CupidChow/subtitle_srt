00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,060
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,880
At that time,

4
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,310
it must have hurt a lot.

5
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,400
I don't remember.

6
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,680
I think

7
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,910
the hem

8
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,710
could be longer.

9
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
Like this,

10
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,870
see?

11
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,030
What do you think?

12
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,240
Well, you're right.

13
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,030
It does look better.

14
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
President Luo.

15
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,960
I know you are busy, Mr. Jian.

16
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,280
How come you have the leisure

17
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,470
to invite me for coffee today?

18
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,560
Since President Qin's gathering,

19
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
it feels like it's been a while
since we last met.

20
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,240
Is that so?

21
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,470
Qin Zhenghao has fled,

22
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,560
have you heard?

23
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,150
Yes.

24
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
Apparently, he's quite short on money now.

25
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,080
The money he scraped didn't end up in his hands,

26
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
and now he's being chased for debts everywhere.

27
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,360
Speaking of which,

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,560
you don't have anything to do with
that money, do you?

29
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,120
Don't worry, I won't spill the beans.

30
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,750
After all, I'm on your side.

31
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,360
Alright,

32
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,910
if you're on my side,

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
there's a favor I need from you.

34
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,150
What favor?

35
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,790
Here.

36
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,870
Try my newly baked cookies.

37
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
See if you like them.

38
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,350
Delicious.

39
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,160
Today is our 100th-day anniversary.

40
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,720
It would be too early

41
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,830
to go to bed after eating.

42
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,510
So, let's stay here until

43
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,800
the small hours before heading back to rest.

44
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
The

45
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,680
small hours?

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,950
That long?

47
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,910
Long?

48
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,470
Not really.

49
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,870
I'll go to the restroom.

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,360
With the conversation reaching this point,

51
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,190
if he's ready for that,

52
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,880
why should I not be?

53
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,350
Is this skirt

54
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,360
a bit too short?

55
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,590
Maybe

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
like this.

57
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,840
No, no.

58
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,950
Act naturally.

59
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,270
