00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,060
=Dusk Love=

2
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,060
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
Look.

4
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,120
It's nice.

5
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,790
But,

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
I think,

7
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,120
maybe it's a bit too flashy?

8
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,950
I'll go change into something else.

9
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
Confessions

10
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,120
should be made by men.

11
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,760
Let's get married.

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,640
How about this suit?

13
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
It's more formal.

14
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,430
You look good in everything.

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,280
Then, it's settled on this one.

16
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,590
Since that's the case,

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
I'll

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,310
choose this tie.

19
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Come on.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,450
Sorry,

21
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,030
there are requirements for document photos.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Let me whisper something to you.

23
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,680
What?

24
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,680
I didn't catch that.

25
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,910
Say it again.

26
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,270
Hello, Uncle.

27
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
Moran,

28
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
come to the office

29
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
right away.

30
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,030
Okay.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
Fanty's CEO, Jamison,

32
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,080
hasn't made a formal appearance
since returning home.

33
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,750
(Fanty Group Overview)
I've arranged a meeting for you two today.

34
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,680
This meeting is crucial,

35
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,710
make sure to seize the opportunity.

36
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,870
Understood.

37
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,470
That

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,870
is all?

39
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,430
Yes.

40
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,470
Do you have anything else?

41
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,400
(Could it be)

42
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
(Uncle doesn't know about the love contract?)

43
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,710
No,

44
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,670
I'll head there right away.

45
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,920
Ms. Jian,

46
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,430
this is the endorsement contract for Mr. Huo.

47
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,520
Got it.

48
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,900
(Endorsement Contract)

49
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,270
Yicheng,

50
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,870
what do you mean by this?

51
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,000
It seems you've seen the contract.

52
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
Huo Jinyan has done so much for you and Yuni.

53
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,310
It's only natural

54
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,190
for my dad and me to show our appreciation.

55
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,430
You don't need to worry about this.

56
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
Why shouldn't I?

57
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,320
By the way,

58
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,950
since this is a benefit contract,

59
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,480
there are certain hidden conditions.

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,950
Huo Jinyan must not conceal

61
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,830
anything about you two,

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,400
otherwise,

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,480
he will face legal consequences.

64
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,400
Do you think

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
he'll sign it?

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,190
President Jian, Mr. Huo is here.

67
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,760
President Jian.

68
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,950
You haven't gotten through yet?

69
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:53,790
No.

70
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,980
(Huo Jinyan)

71
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,380
(30 Minutes Ago)

72
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,360
What do you want from me?

73
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,480
Moran has been sent to discuss cooperation
with Fanty's CEO.

74
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,480
This doesn't seem

75
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
to have anything to do with me, right?

76
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,080
Is that so?

77
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,430
I've always had one question.

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,270
In her heart,

79
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,800
between you and Yuni,

80
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,480
who would she choose?

81
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,000
What are you trying to do?

82
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
Nothing much,

83
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,560
just preparing a little surprise for you.

84
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
No matter who she chooses,

85
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,360
it's a loss.

86
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,440
With me here,

87
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
I won't let her lose.

88
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,100
(Mini Theater)

89
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
President Huo,

90
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,270
someone from Jane's is here
to discuss cooperation.

91
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,600
Who's coming?

92
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,070
I heard it's Ms. Jian.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,520
Should we cancel it?

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
No need.

95
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,240
Someone will stop her.
