=Episode 23=

3
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:53,870
Everyone,

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,150
on today's gathering,

5
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,000
I want to announce
something very important.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,480
Moran,

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,880
from the first moment I saw you,

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,640
I fell for you.

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Will you marry me?

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,240
Moran,

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
you've broken up with Huo Jinyan.

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,790
Let Yicheng accompany you to start over.

13
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,230
Who said we broke up?

14
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,400
What's your relationship with her?

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,240
What are you doing here?

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Moran and I are legally married.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,880
Jian Yicheng,

18
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,190
I should ask you,

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,400
what right do you have
to propose to Moran?

20
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,400
Are you not aware of

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,150
what you've done?

22
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,430
Yicheng,

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,150
what's going on?

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
Tell me.

25
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,990
Don't forget,

26
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,870
I have evidence that you leaked

27
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,760
Yuni's design drafts to Aomy.

28
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,640
Are you threatening me?

29
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,710
It's just a recording.

30
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,000
Since you want to frame me,

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,430
you can fabricate such a thing easily.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,960
You won't admit it,

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,470
but someone will.

34
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,800
President Jian,

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,360
when FUY faced serious debt issues

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,750
and needed a large sum of money,

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Jian Yicheng approached me,

38
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,030
saying he could help me out
if I could bring down Yuni.

39
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,560
It turned out he led me into a dead end.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
Now I realize

41
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,960
all the funds went to you.

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,280
A dubious recording

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,080
and a discredited witness,

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
how can you prove these were my doing?

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
How to prove?

46
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,910
Go explain it to the police.

47
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,540
Jian Yicheng,

48
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,030
you're suspected of fraud.
Please come with us for investigation.

49
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,800
How could I adopt

50
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,000
such an ungrateful person like you?

51
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,470
You've disappointed me greatly.

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,310
Enough. Come with us.

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,080
Moran,

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
I am sorry.

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,590
From today on,

56
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,430
Jane's Group

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,470
is yours.

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,240
Uncle,

59
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,990
no matter what,

60
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,400
we will always be a family.

61
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,120
It's all over now.

62
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,470
What's wrong?

63
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,030
I just didn't expect

64
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,960
things to end this way.

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,240
Ms. Jian, the sample clothes sent by FUY
this time are of good quality

66
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,430
and meet the design requirements.

67
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,310
Prepare for the big show after checking.

68
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,350
Okay.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,200
Ms. Jian,

70
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,430
Aomy has publicly apologized for

71
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,480
plagiarizing Yuni's design.

72
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,510
It's already in the news.

73
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,070
Okay, I got it.

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Get back to work.

75
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,520
Hello?

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,920
Hello, Ms. Jian.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,120
This is Economic Investigation.

78
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,000
Jian Yicheng has confessed to his crimes.

79
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,220
(Yuni)

80
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,390
Are all the models ready with makeup?

81
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,630
- Yes.
- Have you checked all the clothes?

82
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,870
Yes.

83
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,510
Ms. Jian, model Lu is missing.

84
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,640
What?

85
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,800
Have you looked everywhere?

86
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
Yes, we found nothing.

87
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,310
Did you call her?

88
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,870
Yes, no answer.

89
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,830
Do we have a backup model?

90
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,950
That gown was tailored for Lu's figure.

91
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,680
Other models are too tall and can't wear it.

92
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,200
Ms. Jian,

93
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,240
your figure is quite similar to Lu's.

94
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Why don't you...

95
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
Me?

96
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,270
I definitely can't do that.

97
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,600
You can, there's no time.

98
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,630
I really can't.

99
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,470
