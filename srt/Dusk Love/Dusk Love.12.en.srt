=Episode 12=

3
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,190
(Huo Jinyan.)

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,470
(Why hasn't he returned my calls?)

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,430
(I have to go back.)

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,240
Sorry, our president is in a meeting.

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,320
You may have to wait a little longer.

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,640
Then, I'll visit another time.

9
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,600
Sorry for the inconvenience.

10
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,230
Thank you.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,120
This way, please.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
Don't sign it.

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Don't sign this contract.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
What's the matter?

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,840
It's just a standard endorsement contract.

16
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,880
What's the issue?

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
(It's not the same one.)

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,310
(Endorsement Contract)
Since this is a benefit contract,

19
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,000
there are certain hidden conditions.

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,680
Huo Jinyan must not conceal

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,520
anything about you two,

22
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,150
otherwise,

23
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,230
he will face legal consequences.

24
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,470
(Oh no, it's a trap.)

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,510
Moran,

26
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,000
how did your meeting with Jamison go?

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,960
Uncle,

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
I...

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
How about it?

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,040
Do you like the gift I sent you?

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
I've heard Jamison is very strict

32
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,430
and values reputation highly.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,840
Moran's unexplained absence

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,310
might make cooperation difficult.

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,710
And you let President Jian know that

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,560
Jane's heir questioned him for an outsider,

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,870
even risking the cooperation with Fanty

38
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,680
to get rid of me and Yuni with his hands.

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,150
Clever.

40
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,430
What

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,590
do you think President Jian

42
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,800
would say if he knew?

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,590
I didn't see that coming.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,150
I'm just using your own tactics against you.

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Doesn't matter.

46
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,590
Let my dad know about it.

47
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,470
It won't change the fact that the cooperation
has failed.

48
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,550
Don't worry.

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,590
I'm not you.

50
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,430
How about we make a bet?

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,200
On whether

52
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,590
Yuni will cooperate with Fanty or not.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,360
If I win,

54
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,190
you stay away from Moran.

55
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,000
If I lose,

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,150
(Directional Recording)
I'll give you the recorder.

57
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,750
Deal.

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,400
Moran,

59
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,910
do you think you're grown up enough

60
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,240
to make your own decisions?

61
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,870
I lied to you.

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,630
Although it started as a contract,

64
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,800
we're genuinely in love now and even got married.

65
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,590
Please, Uncle, don't make it difficult for him.

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,470
I've been worried

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,560
the whole time that our lies would be exposed.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,840
Now I realize

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,030
escaping solves nothing.

70
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,800
That's why I came to tell you everything.

71
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
Moran,

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,870
have you forgotten

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,030
how much you valued

74
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,360
the Yuni project before?

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,470
Now, you're willing to give up the cooperation

76
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,960
with Fanty for someone like this.

77
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't you think

78
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,590
this is rather childish of you?

79
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,310
I assure you,

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
within three days,

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,070
I will secure a deal with Fanty.

82
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,880
Ms. Jian,

83
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,190
I've heard that this Jamison is quite mysterious,

84
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,870
seldom appearing in public

85
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,920
but always manages to turn the tide
in times of crisis.

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,750
Jamison is a formidable character.

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,270
He's not that formidable.

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,750
It's not about you.

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,630
Try to get me

90
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,680
in touch with Fanty's representatives again.

91
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,600
I'll ask my friends abroad for information.

92
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,930
Yeah.

93
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,720
Aren't you a model for Fanty?

94
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,830
Do you know Jamison?

95
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,230
No.

96
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,110
Not at all.

97
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,470
You...

98
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,750
(You must get to know him.)

99
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,600
(Ji Jie's progressing too slowly.)

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,510
Three ways to please a man.

101
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,030
The first way.

102
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,950
(Ji Jie)
To capture a man's heart,

103
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,430
- Try this nourishing soup I made.
- you must first capture his stomach.

104
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,310
How is it? Tasty, right?

105
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,910
Have a try?

106
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,670
How is it?

107
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,150
Tasty, right?

108
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,110
The second way,

109
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
(Ji Jie)
do more household chores

110
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,920
to make a man reliant on you.

111
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,190
I've collected your dry clothes for you.

112
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,590
Okay.

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,070
The third way,

114
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,360
(Ji Jie)
give a man sexy sleepwear.

115
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
(Is Ji Jie's method reliable?)

116
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,360
(Never mind, just give it a try.)

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,800
(Jian Moran)
What does giving sleepwear imply?

118
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,950
(Ji Jie)
It implies inviting the man to bed.

119
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,120
Sleepwear?

120
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,580
Will...

121
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,390
Will he misunderstand?

122
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,390
What are you looking for?

123
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,390
You're so eager to meet Jamison?

124
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,310
It's not that. I am...

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,070
You're looking for this, right?

126
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,120
Ah yes, yes,

127
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,270
that's exactly what I came for.

128
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,270
Don't get the wrong idea.

129
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,600
You just said you wanted to...

130
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,680
No, no, I don't want to.

131
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,320
You were just eager,

132
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,720
and now you're not?

133
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
It's not that I don't want to, it's just...

134
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
Not so soon.

135
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Isn't it better to do it as soon as possible?

136
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm not ready yet.

137
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,680
(She has to get ready to meet Jamison?)

138
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,160
I'm not ready either.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,310
(Oh no, what do I do?)

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,310
(He might really have misunderstood me.)

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,840
Hello?

142
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,080

00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,320
