3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Goodbye.

4
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,470
Huo Jinyan.

5
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,150
I like you.

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,710
This isn't a whim,

7
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,150
nor is it a choice made after weighing
pros and cons.

8
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,560
Right now,

9
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,840
I'd do everything I can

10
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,680
just to embrace you.

11
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,840
I don't want to miss you.

12
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,510
Can you...

13
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,920
You shouldn't have said these things to me.

14
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,790
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,480
I won't

16
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,280
bother you anymore.

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,070
You shouldn't say these things

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
because confessions should be made by men.

19
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,790
Jian Moran,

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
I love you.

21
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,750
(What am I doing?)

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,680
(Wait.)

23
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,280
(We're already together.)

24
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,520
(Touching is justified.)

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,240
(Even kissing is legitimate.)

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
Oh no.

27
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,550
What's wrong?

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
The steak is burnt.

29
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,280
You scared me.

30
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
I thought you got burned.

31
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,430
You can just cook another piece.

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,240
This was the last piece.

33
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,710
Well...

34
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,910
President Huo,
Qin Zhenghao has disappeared.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,750
Ms. Jian, Qin Zhenghao of FUY has vanished.

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
- I...
- Well...

37
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,150
- You go first.
- You go first.

38
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,520
Go ahead.

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
Ji Jie needs me. I have to step out.

40
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,630
I also have to go to the company.

41
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,080
What's the current situation?

42
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,310
There have been rumors of Qin Zhenghao
fleeing with funds,

43
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,520
but FUY kept it under wraps

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,800
until today

45
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,590
when the board officially announced
his disappearance.

46
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,430
Have you found a replacement

47
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,280
for FUY's factory?

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,630
Not yet.

49
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,470
Ms. Jian,

50
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,310
do you think FUY

51
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,480
might go bankrupt?

52
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,680
That is unlikely.

53
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,920
FUY has the most complete production line
in East China.

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,510
Plenty are eyeing this piece of cake.

55
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,710
Now,

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,720
it's a good opportunity for capital competition.

57
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
It's about who has the capacity to take it over.

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,920
Any updates on Qin Zhenghao?

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,480
We just found out

60
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,430
he's preparing to flee with funds,

61
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,360
but the money never reached his account.

62
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,870
Investigate this money closely.

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
It's not as simple as it seems.

64
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,910
Okay.

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,200
Sit.

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:09,020
(Core Values: Responsibility, Collaboration,
Integrity, Pragmatism)

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,880
Guys,

68
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,830
how about it?

69
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,950
Your offer is less than 70% of the market value,

70
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,510
which is too low.

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,080
Low?

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
As far as I'm aware,

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,830
FUY is heavily indebted due to Qin Zhenghao,

74
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,240
on the brink of bankruptcy.

75
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,710
And?

76
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,630
As long as our factory is operational,

77
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,270
we can repay the debt in less than three years.

78
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,630
Do you think, with FUY's current reputation,

79
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,870
anyone would lend you money to repay
in three years?

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,800
If I were a collaborator of FUY,

81
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,040
I'd liquidate assets from the start.

82
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,430
Once assets are liquidated,
they'll be worthless.

83
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,240
However, Fanty's involvement now

84
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,800
changes the situation.

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
Guys,

86
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,160
please reconsider.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
Okay, I got it.

88
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,040
Ms. Jian, we just received news that

89
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,510
Fanty's CEO, Jamison, has acquired FUY.

90
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,560
Quick move.

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,830
Ms. Jian, you anticipated this?

92
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,240
Just had a hunch.

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,270
Someone who could quickly establish
a foothold in the market

94
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,720
wouldn't pass up such a big opportunity.

95
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
Ji Jie,

96
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,270
try to arrange a meeting with Jamison for me.

97
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,230
Understood.

98
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,700
(Huo Jinyan: I'm off work. I'll pick you up.)

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm off work.

100
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,710
I'll pick you up.

101
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,480
Let me carry them.

102
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,070
- Let's go.
- Hmm.

103
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,910
Moran,

104
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,750
it seems you've made your choice.

105
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,830
Listen to this recording.

106
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,320
I admit,

107
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,240
Huo Jinyan and I are faking it.

108
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,590
At the time,

109
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,480
Jian Yicheng knew about our contract

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,000
and used you to threaten me.

111
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,240
Plus, Yuni is really important to me,

112
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,630
so I had no choice but to agree.

113
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,390
What do you plan to do?

114
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,870
I won't give up on you.

115
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,310
I'll handle

116
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,270
the board.

117
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,310
Let's get married.

118
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,870
Marry me.

119
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,040
Our relationship may have started as a contract,

120
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,160
but our marriage will be real.

121
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,040
Even if it doesn't dispel all doubts,

122
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,920
it'll add a layer of credibility.

123
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,590
