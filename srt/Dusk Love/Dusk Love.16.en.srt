=Episode 16=

3
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,920
The designs are very good.

4
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,430
- The big show can start preparing now.
- Yes.

5
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:57,550
Ms. Jian,

6
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,920
I found the photo you asked me to look for.

7
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,640
But upon closer inspection,

8
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,840
I noticed your eyes look somewhat similar.

9
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,060
(8th Provincial High School Math Competition)

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,380
(Award Certificate: First Place)

11
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
Ji Jie,

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
before we signed the contract,

13
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
was it you who prepared

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,790
Huo Jinyan's information?

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
Yes.

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,870
I gathered it from the model agency.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
At that time,

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,070
did you find anything unusual?

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,950
That day...

20
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,510
Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,480
Please come with me.

22
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,600
It seems

23
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,870
it was all premeditated.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,480
The kidnapping incident

25
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,040
might not be so simple after all.

26
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,480
Find these people for me.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,960
Okay.

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,310
Initially,

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
I chose you

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,480
for your genuine acting.

31
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,350
I didn't expect

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,400
you'd dare to deceive me.

33
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,150
We are all professional stunt actors.

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,310
Then why did you actually fight

35
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,240
when I told you not to?

36
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,270
And

37
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,630
after you were injured,

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,560
you all ran off

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,400
quite nimbly.

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,080
Tell me everything that happened,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,920
or

42
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,710
return the money

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,190
you took from me.

44
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,710
Actually,

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,000
after you found us,

46
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,680
Mr. Huo quickly discovered the plot

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,710
and paid us a large sum

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,360
to make the act more convincing.

49
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
You are back.

50
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,590
Moran,

51
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,800
is something bothering you?

52
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,430
Nothing,

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,750
just a bit tired.

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,430
We're married now.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,590
Beyond trust, spouses should also

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,120
share and bear each other's

57
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,840
worries and unhappiness.

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,920
Okay,

59
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,990
then let me ask you,

60
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
have you ever lied to me?

61
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
I didn't tell you I like you before,

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
does that count?

63
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,520
(Deliberately changing the subject,)

64
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,910
(he's trying to cover up.)

65
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,870
Who would have thought

66
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,560
the CEO of Fanty

67
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,870
would disguise himself as a mere model

68
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,590
and stir up trouble behind the scenes?

69
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,190
I just wonder if Ms. Jian

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,920
knows your true identity.

71
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
Jamison.

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,830
What do you want?

73
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,720
Our company, Aomy,
wants to cooperate with Fanty.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,310
I wonder if you would give us the opportunity.

75
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,800
Consider my offer.

76
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,750
It's definitely

77
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,000
better than Jane's.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
Sorry,

79
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm not interested.

80
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,000
Sorry about that,

81
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,040
I drank a bit too much tonight.

82
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,240
Spare me your tricks.

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,750
They won't work on me.

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,920
He purposely got close to me,

85
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,750
but what's his motive?

86
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,830
In such cases,

87
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,510
it's usually for no good.

88
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,270
Ms. Jian, there's trouble.

89
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,720
Aomy's show has designs that clash with Yuni's.

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
What?

91
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,240
Come with me to talk to Luo Aoqi.

92
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
Hello.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
Ms. Jian,

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,670
I'm Luo Aoqi.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,870
Luo Aoqi?

96
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,600
What are you calling for?

97
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,190
Let's exchange contact information,

98
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,510
so you don't have to look everywhere for me
next time.

99
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,350
Jamison,

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,830
getting a taste of Fanty's tea is quite hard.

101
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,270
What are you doing here?

102
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,120
Isn't this Luo...

103
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,790
(Jamison?)

104
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,160
(Huo Jinyan, you are in trouble.)

105
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,910
Jamison,

106
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,920
I should thank you for Yuni's design drafts.

107
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,230
Moran,

108
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,920
why are you here?

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,640
Tell me,

110
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,120
who are you really?

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,720
Why does she call you Jamison?

112
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,270
