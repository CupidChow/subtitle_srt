00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,430
Moran,

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,870
even though we're already married,

5
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,710
both our relationship and marriage

6
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,560
started with lies.

7
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,590
This time,

8
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
I want to end all the lies

9
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,630
and set aside all external factors.

10
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,680
I hope

11
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,280
we can be like children,

12
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,150
treating each other with innocence,

13
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,430
and like parents,

14
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,400
loving each other instinctively.

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,240
Are you okay?

16
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,800
I hurt my ankle.

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Be

18
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,560
my boyfriend.

19
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,430
Moran,

20
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,750
am I late?

21
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,360
Just in time.

22
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,710
Let's go.

23
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Moran,

24
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,190
you are the girl

25
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,680
who I will love
from beginning to end.

26
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,470
When you were walking towards me just now,

27
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,360
I was thinking

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,520
I might never love you
the same way as I do today.

29
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,750
But I thought the same yesterday.

30
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,160
I am well aware that

31
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,000
one day we will grow old,

32
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,510
be abandoned by this world,

33
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,030
and even

34
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,040
forget our own lives.

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,640
I'm telling you,

36
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,510
if anything happens to her today,

37
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,870
I won't let you off.

38
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,270
But the moment I take your hand,

39
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,590
I know

40
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,270
you

41
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,190
are the love of my life.
