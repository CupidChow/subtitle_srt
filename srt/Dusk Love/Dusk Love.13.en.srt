3
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,600
Jamison, a lady has been waiting for you
all morning.

4
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,600
A lady? Who?

5
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,670
I'm not quite sure.

6
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,760
Jamison, this lady has been waiting for you
all morning.

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
Jamison,

8
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,510
I came uninvited, sorry about that.

9
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,320
Jamison.

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,760
Let me introduce you.

11
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,680
This is the person in charge of Yuni,

12
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,600
Jian Moran.

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
Ms. Jian.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,880
Nice to meet you.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,230
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,760
Why are you here?

17
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,120
As a model under Fanty,

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
it's normal for me to be here.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,230
Yes, yes.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,870
We'll be discussing business cooperation,

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,310
is that proper

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,560
for you to be here?

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,150
Jamison,

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,760
as an employee of Fanty,

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
I can be here, right?

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,040
Absolutely,

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,280
very much so.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,590
This boy, Huo,

29
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,590
is quite clever.

30
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,840
I plan to have him learn more.

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,120
Huo,

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,960
go make us two cups of coffee.

33
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,560
Ms. Jian, please have a seat.

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,590
Thank you.

35
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,560
We're grateful that your company

36
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,680
is willing to cooperate with Yuni.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,630
We're willing to share the five-color

38
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,710
interweaving technique.

39
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
And how should we handle the warehouse fees?

40
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,710
How about we charge you 20 million?

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,800
Is that fair?

42
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,310
20 million?

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,750
That price might just cover the costs.

44
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,080
The importance of the five-color
interweaving technique

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,310
is well-known in the industry.

46
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,080
Since you are willing to share it,

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,000
we should show some sincerity, right?

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Alright, then.

49
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,430
Let's look forward to a pleasant cooperation.

50
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,960
Thank you.

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,920
A pleasure to cooperate.

52
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,310
Goodbye, Jamison.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,520
Goodbye.

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,280
Goodbye, Huo.

55
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,400
Take care, Ms. Jian.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,840
President Huo,

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,840
how was my acting just now?

58
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,150
You should give me a raise.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
A raise?

60
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,800
You want Huo to give you a raise?

61
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,750
President Huo,

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,030
we found that Qin Zhenghao had close ties

63
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,000
with Jane's before the incident,

64
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,710
but we haven't figured out who specifically.

65
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,550
I think

66
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,630
the cooperation between Yuni and FUY
must be a trap.

67
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,430
Keep investigating

68
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,030
and inform me once you find something.

69
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,030
Okay.

70
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,150
President Huo,

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,710
there's something I've been wondering.

72
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,030
Shoot.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
Now that you and Ms. Jian are together,

74
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,750
why still hide your identity?

75
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,310
The time isn't right.

76
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,840
When the moment comes, I'll naturally tell her.

77
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,120
Mr. Jian, Yuni and Fanty have reached
a cooperation.

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,680
Go investigate Jamison

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,800
and Huo Jinyan right now,

80
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,240
immediately!

81
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,340
(The Art of War: Thirty-Six Stratagems)

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,630
Ms. Jian, you wanted to see me?

83
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,000
Sit.

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,640
Ji Jie,

85
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,040
I feel like Huo Jinyan

86
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,560
has been acting guilty around me recently.

87
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,160
Could it be about his ex-girlfriend?

88
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,720
I don't think so.

89
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,270
You never know.

90
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,360
When I was investigating him,

91
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,630
I found a photo of him with a girl,

92
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,750
and they looked quite close.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,870
What photo?

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,270
I'll check if I can still find it.

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,760
But

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,120
don't worry, Ms. Jian,

97
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,680
I have an idea for you.

98
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,790
Look.

99
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,950
No, I can't do that.

100
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,110
Just give it a try.

101
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,120
It'll work.

102
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,720
That's too much.

103
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
I...

104
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
Huo Jinyan,

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,120
can I borrow your hair dryer?

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,070
Help yourself.

107
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
Have you seen enough?

108
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,030
Bye.

109
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,680
How could you keep staring?

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,920
That was ridiculous.

111
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
Please,

112
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,720
you two are married.

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,390
What's wrong with that?

114
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,000
If Huo Jinyan knew what's on your mind,

115
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,160
he'd be scared off.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,840
Scared off?

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,310
Can he escape my grasp?

118
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,390
