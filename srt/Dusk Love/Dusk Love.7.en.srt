(drinking.)

5
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,960
(You can drink with him.)

6
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
(Not only can you discover your true feelings,)

7
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,520
(but you can also find out what he's thinking.)

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,730
(Kill two birds with one stone.)

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,430
(Once you're drunk,)

10
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,120
(I can get you to spill the beans.)

11
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,840
(What is she up to?)

12
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,990
Here.

13
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,070
Let's

14
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,710
relieve some stress.

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
Is there a problem?

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,870
No problem at all.

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
Let's relieve stress.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,870
Are you okay?

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,800
We can stop if you can't do it.

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,680
What are you saying?

21
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Let's keep drinking.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
Jian Moran,

23
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
you're drunk.

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,710
This handsome guy,

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,470
who

26
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,030
is he?

27
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,520
Huo Jinyan,

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,630
you really are

29
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,190
annoying.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
What?

31
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,030
Charming

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,870
and handsome.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
You...

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,590
Why are you so good-looking?

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Jian Moran,

36
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,030
are you for real?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,840
What do you think?

38
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,750
You think I'm playing house?

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,000
Jian Moran, you...

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,420
Shh.

41
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,170
One!

42
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,030
One, two!

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,120
One, two, three!

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,560
One, two, three, four!

45
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,710
Five!

46
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,160
How's the investigation going?

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,800
(Rui Sports)
After investigating, we found

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,430
their factories had gradually stopped operations

49
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,840
within the last three months.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Did you gather any evidence?

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,640
Yes, we did.

52
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,630
We also found some workers who were
laid off by FUY,

53
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,710
and they provided evidence of data fabrication.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,120
Leak this evidence to the media,

55
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,470
make sure this story is published tonight.

56
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,280
The fabrics will arrive tomorrow.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,910
Confirm the issues I've highlighted
with the legal department.

58
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,680
- Understood.
- If there are no problems,

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,310
the contract with FUY
must be mailed out tonight.

60
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,270
Okay.

61
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,030
Anything else?

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
Ms. Jian,

63
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,470
about the methods

64
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,630
I mentioned yesterday,
did your friend try them?

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,920
Was it effective?

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Now you mention it,

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,240
just take your stupid USB drive away.

68
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,070
Nothing happened yesterday?

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
My...

70
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
My friend,

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,800
she doesn't remember anything
after getting drunk.

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,800
It's okay.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,360
Your friend might not remember,

74
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,800
but that guy surely does.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,390
Just ask him and you'll know everything.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,400
Ms. Jian,

77
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,000
there was a problem with the legal department.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
The contract wasn't sent out.

79
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,510
You can't even handle such a small issue.

80
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,630
Am I running a charity here?

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,520
Alright.

82
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
You're back.

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,910
Yeah.

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,240
Last night,

85
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,040
I drank too much.

86
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,560
Did we

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
do something?

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,080
You want to know?

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,640
Come here,

90
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,750
I'll help you remember.

91
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,720
Jian Moran,

92
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,360
why are you so annoying?

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
What?

94
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,070
Charming

95
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,310
and handsome.

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,190
Jian Moran,

97
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,920
why are you so good-looking?

98
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,720
Are you

99
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,830
for real?

100
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,230
What else?

101
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,390
You think I'm playing house?

102
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,880
- Huo Jinyan.
- Shh.

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,150
That's it.

104
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
I was

105
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,710
like that,

106
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,600
and you

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,480
felt nothing?

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,430
(I can't believe I did that to him.)

109
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,070
(Could I actually like him?)

110
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,720
(No, no.)

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,920
(It must be the alcohol talking.)

112
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,830
Ms. Jian, look.

113
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,560
FUY factory's data fabrication.

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,120
Data fabrication?

115
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,180
(FUY Clothing Factory Exposed for Profit Fraud)

116
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,870
Where is our contract with FUY?

117
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,190
Has it been sent out?

118
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,680
It was sent out yesterday.

119
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,700
After we talked over the call,

120
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,930
I informed the legal officer to work overtime
to address the issue.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,680
The contract has now reached FUY.

122
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,800
What do they say?

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,070
Can't get in touch at the moment.

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,760
You stay here.

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,270
I'll head to FUY myself.

126
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,150
Hello?

127
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,680
- Have you received the contract from
- Ms. Jian.

128
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,520
Jane's Yuni brand?

129
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,040
- Here.
- Thank you.

131
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
Not this one.

132
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,830
Are there other contracts

133
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,870
from Jane's Yuni brand?

134
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,830
The contract you are saying

135
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,430
has been taken for signing
by the legal department.

136
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,270
Legal department?

137
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,910
Ms. Zhang.

138
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,430
- She is from our legal department.
- Yeah.

139
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,560
- Hello.
- Hello.

140
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,510
Did you receive the Yuni brand contract?

141
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,480
That contract

142
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,360
was just delivered to President Qin's office.

143
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,040
It must have been signed by now.
