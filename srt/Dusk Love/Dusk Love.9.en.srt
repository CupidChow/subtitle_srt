3
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,200
(Should I forcefully make him sign?)

4
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,270
Sign it.

5
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,070
I'll sign it.

6
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,630
No, no.

7
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,480
(Maybe I should act more demurely.)

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,680
Jinyan, Jinyan,

9
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,000
please sign.

10
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
Okay.

11
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,400
(Forget it, I'm going all in.)

12
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,630
Hello?

13
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,960
Moran,

14
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,560
I've discovered your secret.

15
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,040
Meet me tomorrow.

16
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:16,980
(Jane's Group)

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,840
Why are you here?

18
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,800
I

19
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,840
was just nearby.

20
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,470
Didn't your watch break?

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,960
I bought you a new one.

22
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,870
Let me put it on for you.

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,640
Okay.

24
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,870
Thank you.

25
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,470
What do you know?

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,280
You and Huo Jinyan aren't a real couple.

27
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,590
What do you mean?

28
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,840
Real couples don't need a contract

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,240
to bind their relationship.

30
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,470
Tell me,

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,920
what's going on?

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
Yes,

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,400
I admit,

34
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,870
Huo Jinyan and I are faking it.

35
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,560
Break up with him.

36
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,200
Impossible.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,520
Then do you want

38
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,750
this contract to surface
at the shareholders' meeting?

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
By then,

40
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,400
Yuni will no longer be yours.

41
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,080
Yuni is my parents' lifelong wish.

42
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,710
I won't let it go.

43
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,280
What about Huo Jinyan?

44
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,360
If my dad finds out you've been lying to him,

45
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,630
he won't let Huo Jinyan off.

46
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,550
Leave him alone.

47
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,910
It depends on you.

48
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,200
Fine,

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
alright.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,590
I'll break up with Huo Jinyan.

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Good.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,920
(It's empty.)

53
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,630
(It was a bluff.)

54
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,190
What about Huo Jinyan?

55
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,040
If my dad finds out you've been lying to him,

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,360
he won't let Huo Jinyan off.

57
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,260
(Contract Love)

58
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,480
The new watch I gave you,

59
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,670
doesn't it fit?

60
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,800
I'm used to the old one.

61
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,000
About the renewal you mentioned...

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,840
There's no need.

63
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,560
Anything else?

64
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,560
The company found me
a new endorsement in Paris.

65
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm leaving tonight.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,560
That's good.

67
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
I have an important video conference tonight,

68
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,960
so I won't see you off.

69
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,310
Huo Jinyan?

70
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,560
Huo Jinyan?

71
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
Have you come back?

72
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
(He really left.)

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,830
