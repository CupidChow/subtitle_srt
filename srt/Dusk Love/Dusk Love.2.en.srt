3
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,520
(I have told the lie)

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,840
(and deceived...)

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,760
(No, no.)

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,070
(I've invited him here.)

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,470
(But how should I tell him?)

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,000
(How do I make him willingly sign the contract?)

9
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,990
Ms. Jian,

10
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,840
there's trouble.

11
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,680
Phyte is canceling the cooperation.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,520
What?

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,680
- I'm on my way.
- I'm on my way.

14
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Well,

15
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,710
there's a problem with the design draft.

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,950
I need to go to my office.

17
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,510
It just so happens
my company is short of a model.

18
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm going to save the day.

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
You go first.

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,350
Your phone.

21
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,550
Thank you.

22
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,790
President Huo.

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,400
All the board members are here.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,310
This bet agreement was signed by you.

25
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,430
The target net profit is 1 billion.

26
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,120
Now, half the time has passed,

27
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,080
and not even a quarter has been completed.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
Jamison,

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,280
you might not be clear since you've just
returned home.

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,080
When Fanty first entered the Asian market,

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,630
everything went smoothly.

32
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,030
It was only later
that an unexpected event occurred.

33
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,710
Jane's Group developed the five-color
interweaving technique,

34
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,190
directly reducing their dyeing costs,

35
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,430
then took over part of the market,

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,590
causing our profits to decline.

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,400
In this world, there are no accidents,

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,800
only incompetence.

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,800
(Do you know him?)

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,680
Come in.

41
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,080
President Jian, Ms. Jian is here.

42
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,240
- Okay.
- Yicheng, you want to see me?

43
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,400
Take a seat.

44
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,400
Phyte suddenly canceled the cooperation.

45
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,120
Yes,

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,470
Yuni has just been established,

47
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,150
and canceling the cooperation now

48
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,190
is very disadvantageous for us.

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,560
If we could cooperate with FUY,

50
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,910
it should solve your urgent problem.

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,430
Just so happens,

52
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,150
President Qin is having a party soon.

53
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,750
You could go and meet him.

54
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,940
(Invitation)

55
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,270
Okay.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,120
Oh, you need a male companion for that.

57
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,190
Take your fiancé with you.

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,590
(Fiancé?)

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,870
(It seems I need to secure Huo Jinyan quickly.)

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
No problem.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,710
Then I'll leave first.

62
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,750
Okay.

63
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,910
Excuses are for losers.

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,120
What's in front of you is FUY's

65
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,630
report for this quarter.

66
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,543
(FUY Investigation Report)
FUY owns the largest production line

67
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:10,960
(FUY Investigation Report)
in East China.

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
As long as we can complete the acquisition
within 3 months,

69
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,270
we can exceed our annual performance targets.

70
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,920
FUY's asking price is three times
the market value.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,510
Our due diligence and estimates

72
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,190
are only half of their asking price.

73
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,360
How do we acquire it?

74
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,510
Yes, how do we acquire it?

75
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,310
I don't want explanations,

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,830
only results.

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
Give me the phone.

78
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,620
(Huo Jinyan)

79
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,070
Hello, the number you've dialed...

80
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,240
He hung up on me.

81
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160
Huo Jinyan, call me back, I have an emergency.

82
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,310
Go and find another person for me.

83
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,150
Okay.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,840
President Qin,

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,430
we've come with sincerity.

86
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,630
Our Yuni is willing to share the five-color

87
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,270
interweaving technique with FUY.

88
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,800
However, about the price,

89
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,920
could you reconsider?

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
Since you have asked,

91
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
let's settle on that.

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,830
Thank you so much.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
President Qin.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
Long time no see.

95
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,920
President Luo.

96
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,560
- President Qin.
- President Liu.

97
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,800
Do you know Ms. Jian?

98
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,790
Yes.

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,560
President Liu, I'll introduce someone to you.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
Excuse us.

101
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,360
I heard you are quite fortunate lately,

102
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,950
even got a fiancé.

103
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,830
Why isn't he here?

104
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,040
Didn't bring him along,

105
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,240
or is he just a figment of imagination?

106
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,040
He is delayed due to some matters.

107
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,600
I think you're meddling too much.

108
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,070
Is it me meddling too much,

109
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,070
or are you trying too hard to save face?

110
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,680
President Qin brought some male models.

111
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,480
If you don't have a male companion,

112
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,630
I could help you inquire.

113
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,160
(Where is the person Ji Jie got for me?)

114
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,950
But with your temperament,

115
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,680
I guess no one would be willing.

116
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,870
My male companion

117
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,800
has arrived.

118
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,870
What took you so long?

119
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,830
Won't you introduce us?

120
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
Am I late?

121
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,720
Just in time.

122
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,960
Hello,

123
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
I'm Moran's fiancé,

124
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,120
Huo Jinyan.

125
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
Have a drink.

126
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,190
You've had enough.

127
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,190
Everyone's watching.

128
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,160
Please.

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
Cheers.

130
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,000
Huo Jinyan,

131
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,910
be

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,750
my boyfriend.

133
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,950
You've drunk too much.

134
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,160
(I wonder if I've seen him somewhere before.)

135
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,590
You are home.

136
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,790
Be careful.

137
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,830
You can't run away now.

138
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,270
Don't leave.

139
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,750
Ms. Jian, you're drunk.

140
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,680
I'm going home.

141
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,680
(I'm sure I've seen this face before.)

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,240
(Mini Theater)
His name is Huo Jinyan, unmarried.

143
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,750
(Huo Jinyan's Personal Information)
Very suitable for your plan.

144
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,320
Is the price settled?

145
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,790
Ms. Jian,

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,910
can you not always talk about money?

147
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,960
If he has a strong sense of self-esteem,

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,030
it will ruin the plan.

149
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,840
I have a way though.

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
What way?

151
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,390
Let him be a hero.

152
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
I've checked his information.

153
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,150
He likes the "damsel in distress" type.

154
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,550
