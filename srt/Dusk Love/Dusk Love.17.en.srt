3
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,230
Moran,

4
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,670
why are you here?

5
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,590
Tell me,

6
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
who are you really?

7
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,880
Why does she call you Jamison?

8
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,040
What else are you hiding from me?

9
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:11,990
Moran,

10
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,190
I'm sorry,

11
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,040
I am Jamison.

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,070
But let me explain,

13
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,400
it's not what you think.

14
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,950
I should have realized.

15
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,200
No wonder Fanty

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,150
took interest in just-started Yuni.

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,640
It was all a deception.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
Moran, listen to me,

19
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,560
I had reasons for doing this.

20
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,680
Please believe me.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,120
I can explain.

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,920
You say it's not a deception,

23
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,280
but your actions
have been nothing but deceitful.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
Why did you go to such lengths

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,710
to get close to me?

26
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,310
It was because of my feelings for you.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Feelings?

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,200
Are feelings surrounded by lies genuine?

29
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,070
Huo Jinyan,

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,710
don't tell me you've even deceived yourself.

31
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,550
Moran, I...

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,280
The design draft has leaked

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,310
as you wished.

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,190
I won't deny what I've done,

35
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,590
but I absolutely won't admit
to what I haven't done.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Moran! Moran!

37
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Don't tell me you've even deceived yourself.

38
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
Moran.

39
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,910
The design draft has leaked

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,470
as you wished.

41
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,590
I won't deny what I've done,

42
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,840
but I absolutely won't admit
to what I haven't done.

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,750
Ms. Jian,

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,310
Yuni's design draft leak has been exposed
to the media.

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,470
Someone claims it was Fanty's doing.

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,430
Now Fanty's stock price is falling.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,800
It's that serious?

48
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,550
President Huo,

49
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,030
this is from Jane's,

50
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,000
concerning the subsidiary's suspension
of cooperation with Yuni.

51
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,030
You don't know

52
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,470
how much trouble I went through
to find this contract.

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,520
It was sent to FUY's reception,

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,470
and they couldn't even sort out a contract.

55
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
FUY?

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,190
Reception?

57
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,150
Have you received the contract

58
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,990
from Jane's Yuni brand?

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,310
- Here.
- Thank you.

60
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,060
(Contract)

61
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Not this one.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,870
At that time,
FUY and Jane's hadn't cooperated yet.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
There shouldn't be any documents exchanged
between them.

64
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,710
That document is suspicious.

65
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,750
What document?

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,680
Go to FUY

67
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,080
and investigate all documents exchanged
with Jane's,

68
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,310
especially those before Yuni was established.

69
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,550
Okay.

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,520
And,

71
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,560
arrange a meeting with Mr. Wang for me.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,200
Okay.

73
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Alright, Mr. Wang,

74
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,070
I'll have them come to you tonight.

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,880
Thank you.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,390
Uncle, you wanted to see me?

77
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,750
Have you found a new partner?

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,750
We've checked some factories,
each with its pros and cons.

79
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,360
Listen,

80
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,680
later, you and Yicheng visit a Mr. Wang.

81
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,000
He's opened a new factory

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
that might help solve Yuni's problem.

83
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,070
Got it.

84
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,830
Act accordingly when Mr. Wang arrives later.

85
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,360
- Okay.
- Step by step... Here he comes.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,480
Mr. Wang.

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,270
Thank you for trusting us.

88
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,830
We look forward to our cooperation.

89
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,040
Yes, Mr. Wang.

90
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,510
I heard you like red wine.

91
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,680
I've brought a bottle
I've cherished for many years.

92
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,750
We appreciate your attention to the contract.

93
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,590
Yes.

94
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,950
Look forward to our cooperation.

95
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,510
The two of you make a striking couple.

96
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,390
Many people say so.

97
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,670
Mr. Wang,

98
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,950
as far as I know,

99
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,430
they are just siblings.

100
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,710
Yes,

101
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
but

102
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,680
we are siblings without any blood relation.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,360
This is my business partner,

104
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,200
Mr. Huo.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,920
What brings you here?

106
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,720
Moran, I forgot to tell you,

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,070
I also have shares in Mr. Wang's company.

108
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,240
If you wanted to cooperate with Mr. Wang,

109
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,720
you could have told me.

110
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't need to.

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,480
The environment here is quite average.

112
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,510
Must have been arranged by Mr. Jian.

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,960
How about this?

114
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,800
Let's change locations

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,240
and continue discussing
the contract with Mr. Wang.

116
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,190
Mr. Huo, you need not worry.

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,190
Our cooperation is going smoothly.

118
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,710
Mr. Wang,

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,830
excuse me.

120
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
My apologies, Mr. Wang.

121
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,590
Please come this way.

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,040
