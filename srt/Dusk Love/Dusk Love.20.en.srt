=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,600
What's most important now is

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,030
Yuni's issue has already affected Fanty.

5
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,880
If things fail,

6
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,600
I don't want Huo Jinyan to be implicated.

7
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,200
So, who do you think
is the person behind this?

8
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,670
I hope

9
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,270
it's not him.

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,560
Knowing I was pretending,

11
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,310
why did you still go along with it?

12
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,590
If it's all an act,

13
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,310
wouldn't my participation

14
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,590
make it more convincing?

15
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,070
Whatever you do, I'll support you

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,480
and protect you to the best of my ability.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,310
But from today on,

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,120
I don't want to see you
with Jian Yicheng anymore,

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,120
or

20
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,280
I'll go mad.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,350
I did that to provoke their internal strife

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
and find evidence of their crimes.

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,790
Now, I have

24
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,480
a proof of Jian Yicheng

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,950
leaking Yuni's design drafts.

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,230
I can make it public at any time.

27
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,430
His actions don't stop there.

28
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,640
Qin Zhenghao's escape with funds

29
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,150
was also orchestrated by him.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,200
Qin Zhenghao?

31
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,950
Jian Yicheng discovered FUY's vulnerability

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,640
and planned to use Qin Zhenghao

33
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,590
and the vulnerability to eliminate Yuni.

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,310
He didn't expect Qin Zhenghao to fail.

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,240
At that time,

36
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,200
I was thankful to him for finding a factory.

37
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,520
It turns out
he was setting the stage even then.

38
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
Yes.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
What about you?

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,120
Why did you hide your identity?

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,920
Actually,

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,280
we knew each other in high school,

43
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,560
back when I was called Huo Mingxuan.

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,710
Sorry for your cookies.

45
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
It's okay.

46
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,590
I'll buy you another box tomorrow.

47
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,680
Sorry,

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,590
I couldn't find the cookies
you were holding yesterday,

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,960
but I made some myself,

50
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,190
and they are delicious.

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
It's good.

52
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,580

In the Cartesian coordinate system,

54
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,470
points with integer coordinates are called
lattice points.

55
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,360
If the function y equals x,

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,280
the line exactly passes through point k.

57
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,430
So, you should choose option C.

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,030
Huo Mingxuan,
how could you get them all wrong?

59
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,030
Oh my,

60
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,510
even the first question is wrong.

61
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,920
How could everything be wrong?

62
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,150
It's all wrong.

63
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,270
He even got the first one wrong.

64
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,150
Look.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,160
If there's anything you don't understand,

66
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
just ask me.

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,350
Okay.

69
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,310

70
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,230
What?

71
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,270
You like it?

72
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,710
I do,

73
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,800
but only the first place gets it.

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,680
Congratulations to Huo Mingxuan
for winning first place

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,520
in this math competition.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,630
Okay, let me see.

83

After school,

84
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,160
let me walk you home.

85
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
Okay.

Dad,

87
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,240
why did you come
to pick me up all of a sudden?

88
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,800
I had plans to go out with classmates.

89
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,750
My boss wants you
to keep away from Jian Moran.

90
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,560
- Don't run!
- Get him!

91
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,870

my precious daughter in so long.

92
