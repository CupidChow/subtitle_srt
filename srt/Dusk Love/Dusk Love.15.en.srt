00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,060
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,350
You went upstairs to change?

4
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,310
I just

5
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,200
messed up what I just wore.

6
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
Does it look good?

7
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Yes.

8
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,070
We can

9
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,990
start now.

10
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:40,790
Start what?

11
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,920
Didn't you say

12
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,710
we'd do it?

13
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,680
Aren't we doing it now?

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,710
Doing this?

15
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah.

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,230
You're really clueless.

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,150
Fine, stay here. I'm leaving.

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
Hello.

19
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,000
Your call really came at the right moment.

20
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,680
I didn't interrupt anything, did I?

21
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,960
What do you think?

22
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,430
You just ruined my moment.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,030
I just found out

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,800
the money Qin Zhenghao prepared

25
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,590
didn't go into his account

26
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,240
but to another account,

27
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,960
specifically, Jane's Group.

28
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Is this pose

29
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,190
appropriate?

30
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,310
That means

31
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,000
the person who supported Qin Zhenghao
in scamming Yuni

32
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,430
and the person now scamming Qin Zhenghao

33
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,360
is the same one.

34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,680
So, have you found out who it is?

35
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,670
Not yet.

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,190
Bring the report to me for signing tomorrow.

37
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,680
What report?

38
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,680
Your resigning report.

39
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,000
