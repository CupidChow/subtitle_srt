=Episode 18=

3
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,790
Let go of me.

4
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,270
Mr. Huo,

5
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,840
what are you doing?

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,040
Moran,

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,790
must we be so distant?

8
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:10,920
You know

9
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,640
what you've done.

10
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,790
But why didn't you clarify

11
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,870
your relationship with Jian Yicheng

12
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,000
to Mr. Wang just now?

13
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,920
I did.

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
There's no blood relation

15
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,480
between Jian Yicheng and me.

16
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,590
So, as of today,

17
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,400
you've fallen for that jerk Jian Yicheng,

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,350
- Right?
- Yes.

19
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,150
Mr. Huo,

20
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,000
please show some respect.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,070
You two have already parted ways.

22
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,730
Jian Yicheng,

23
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,950
this is a matter between Moran and me.

24
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,590
What does it have to do with you?

25
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,200
Step aside.

26
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,480
What if I don't?

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,310
Are you crazy?

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,350
Let me tell you,

29
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,560
from today onwards,

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,680
there's no relationship between us.

31
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,920
- Moran.
- Don't touch me.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
Moran,

33
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,240
I did hurt you.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,400
Please accept my apology.

35
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,120
I don't.

36
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,630
- Moran.
- Mr. Huo,

37
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,120
it's not appropriate for you
to be here at this time.

38
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,400
Moran and I are legally married.

39
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,870
On the contrary, Jian Yicheng,

40
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,710
don't you think you're the one out of place?

41
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,150
You...

42
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,430
Huo Jinyan.

43
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,240
This is a divorce agreement.

44
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,710
Sign it.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Jian Moran,

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
let me tell you,

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,630
I will never divorce you

48
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,870
in this lifetime.

49
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,590
Is that enough?

50
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,960
Alright, Mr. Huo.

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
Just leave.

52
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,800
The exit is over there.

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,310
I forgot to tell you,

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,030
I bought the house next to Moran's.

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,800
- Speak.
- President Huo, we've found it.

56
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,430
Perhaps things happened too suddenly,
and Qin Zhenghao

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,720
couldn't handle it in time.

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,040
We found some documents in his shredder

59
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,560
that could be pieced together.

60
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,670
Anything else?

61
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,870
The documents show that

62
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,600
since before Yuni's establishment,

63
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,070
both parties had been plotting

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,160
to exploit FUY's vulnerabilities

65
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,310
to take down Yuni.

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,240
The signatures on the documents
are all Jian Yicheng's.

67
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,720
The money from Qin Zhenghao's incident

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,630
also flowed into Jian Yicheng's account.

69
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,480
It was indeed him.

70
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,440
Got it.

71
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,920
(Jian Yicheng)
Moran, a lot has happened recently.

72
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,430
I guess you're exhausted.

73
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,870
How about relaxing at a bar?

74
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,750
(Jian Moran)
When?

75
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,690
(Jian Yicheng)
Tonight at eight, I'll pick you up.

76
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,310
(Jian Yicheng)
Moran, I miss the cookies you make,

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,390
the ones you always bake.

78
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,390
I made some cookies,
and they're delicious.

79
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,670
Okay.

80
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,030
Hello, Ji Jie,

81
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,270
prepare me some baked cookies.
