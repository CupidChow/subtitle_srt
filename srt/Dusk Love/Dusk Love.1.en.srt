3
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,310
Ms. Jian,

4
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,520
I've investigated him.

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,860
(Huo Jinyan's Personal Information)
Huo Jinyan, unmarried,

6
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,880
was a model.

7
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,110
He has a clean background,

8
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,590
is humble and modest,

9
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,370
with a gentle and obedient character,

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,400
making him easy to control.

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,680
The goal has entered the position.

12
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,910
Action.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
Help!

14
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,510
- Help!
- Stop!

15
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,480
- Don't run!
- Stop!

16
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,070
Help!

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,480
Stop right there!

18
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
Ah!

19
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,560
Young man, mind your own business.

20
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,550
Are you alright?

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,910
My ankle is injured.

22
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,400
(He took the bait.)

23
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,030
(This prey)

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
(is not bad.)

25
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,700
(Design Diagram)
(Three Days Ago)

26
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,470
(I, Jian Moran,)

27
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,960
(as the design director of the Yuni brand
under Jane's Group,)

28
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,120
(have always wanted to establish my own)

29
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
(clothing brand,)

30
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,800
(Yuni.)

31
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,960
(But I faced opposition from the board.)

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,800
Moran,

33
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,190
you know the company's current situation.

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,070
The Yuni project is too risky.

35
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,430
I want to emphasize again that...

36
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,000
(The disagreement continued,)

37
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,030
(and the meeting fell into a deadlock.)

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,840
Since you are determined to go your own way,

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,710
then I have nothing more to say.

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,030
(In order to establish Yuni,)

41
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,910
(I have to find someone to marry,)

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
(and now,)

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
(I have found my target.)

44
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,070
You saw the situation today.

45
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,390
Since your car accident and memory loss,

46
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,830
you have been staying abroad,

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,160
not very familiar with the company's situation.

48
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,190
You've worked hard during this time.

49
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,760
Why not take a break?

50
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Uncle,

51
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,800
I can't relax at this time.

52
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,480
Yuni is at a critical period of establishment.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,430
I cannot afford any negligence.

54
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,630
You do not have the convincing ability yet.

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,600
If you want to establish Yuni,

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I doubt the shareholders would agree.

57
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,480
But your father mentioned in his will

58
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,160
that once you get married,

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,680
you can take over the company.

60
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,680
So, I have an idea.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,390
Look, you are at the age

62
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,750
of considering marriage.

63
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,800
Could you consider personal matters now?

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,360
I always thought

65
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,480
Yicheng was pretty good.

66
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,040
Ever since I adopted him,

67
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,040
I watched him grow up,

68
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,950
and we know his character very well.

69
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,510
If the two of you could be together,

70
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
I would be particularly reassured.

71
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,160
Uncle,

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,040
I have a fiancé.

73
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,070
His name is Huo Jinyan.

74
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,310
I assure you,

75
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,830
once Yuni is established,

76
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,360
it will turn profitable within three months.

77
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,560
Bring him to meet me within a week.

78
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Okay.

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,310
Then Uncle, I'll leave first.

80
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,350
Moran.

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,950
Dad, everything is arranged.

82
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,760
What's wrong with Moran?

83
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,160
Do you know him?

84
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,030
Come in,

85
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,360
I'll apply medicine for you.

86
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
(Not shy at all.)

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,460
(Huo Jinyan's Personal Information)

88
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,630
(Oh no, he can't see this.)

89
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,950
I'll apply the medicine for you.

90
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,700
(Enema)

91
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,040
You'll apply this to me?

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Sorry, I picked the wrong one.

93
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,110
This one.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,750
(What a nice body.)

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
(He looks even better than
our company's models.)

96
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,640
What are you doing?

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,400
I...

98
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,630
You have a good physique,

99
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,080
why not

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,830
come to my company to be a model?

101
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,910
No, thank you.

102
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't move.

103
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,070
I remember your hand is also injured.

104
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,160
Let me bandage it for you.

105
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Come on.

106
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,190
(Since he's here already,)

107
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,630
(I should get him to bed tonight.)

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,460
(No, no.)

109
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,720
(Haste makes waste.)

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,510
(He looks somewhat handsome.)

111
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,720
(Can't let him escape tonight.)

112
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,390
Let's go to bed.

113
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,190
I mean,

114
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,800
well,

115
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,830
since it's inconvenient for you to move,

116
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,230
why not

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,070
sleep in my guest room?

118
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,200
Okay,

119
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,430
but when will you

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,430
cut this for me?

121
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,260
(Mini Theater)

122
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,110
Jamison,

123
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,510
there's news about
what you asked me to investigate.

124
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,510
At all costs,

125
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
find her.

126
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,960
Later, I'll lure him over,

127
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
but control yourselves.

128
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,630
Don't really start fighting.

129
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,000
Understand?

130
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,750
