3
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,840
I haven't been to a club in a long time.

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,750
Have a good time and relax here.

5
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,960
Yeah, it's lively here.

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,710
- I'm not quite used to it.
- Yeah?

7
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:10,070
Let's take a selfie together

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,910
to commemorate this.

9
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,070
Come on.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,840
Okay.

11
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,910
Let me see.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,870
(First time at a bar in so many years  Post)
(Luo Aoqi, it's your turn now.)

13
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,350
Moran,

14
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,480
did you bring the cookies I asked for?

15
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,550
They're here.

16
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,180
(Moran: First time at a bar in so many years)

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,840
I'll take a call.

18
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,960
Okay.

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,070
Jian Moran, where are you?

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,310
Who are you with?

21
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,760
It's none of your business.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,760
Come home now.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,840
I'll say it again,

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,840
we have nothing to do with each other.

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,350
Please stop bothering me.

26
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,910
Yicheng,

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,350
the cookies.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
Try if they still taste good.

29
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,280
Definitely.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,840
Delicious.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,080
Have a drink.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,200
Okay.

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
Huo Jinyan,

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
what are you doing here?

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
What did you do to her?

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,870
She's just drunk.

37
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,960
I'm telling you,

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,960
if anything happens to her today,

39
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,630
I won't let you off.

40
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,470
Where am I?

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,430
How come you're here?

42
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,430
If it weren't for me,

43
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,560
you'd be in Jian Yicheng's bed by now.

44
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,240
Why did you drink so much with him?

45
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,080
I've said it,

46
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,430
it's my business.

47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,190
It has nothing to do with you.

48
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,190
Nothing to do with me?

49
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,590
What are you, crazy?

50
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,840
I am crazy,

51
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,070
but it's all for you.

52
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,480
Wait here.

53
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,240
I'll be right back.

54
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,430
Room 308, Walton Hotel.

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,680
Was it you who told Huo Jinyan?

56
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,870
Yes, it was me.

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,000
I was afraid you couldn't turn back.

58
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,000
You're worried about yourself!

59
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Jian Yicheng,

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,270
don't be so full of yourself.

61
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
Jian Moran gives you a smile,

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,680
and you're all over her like a dog.

63
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
What's so good about her?

64
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,480
It's not your place to comment on what I do.

65
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,320
Got it?

66
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,790
Don't forget,

67
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,560
I have evidence that you leaked

68
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,510
Yuni's design drafts to Aomy.

69
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,390
Are you threatening me?

70
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,830
I'm not threatening you.

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,830
I just want to tell you that

72
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,720
the only person
who can help you in this world is me.

73
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,390
- I told you to wait in the room.
- Let's go.

74
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,430
Why did you come out?

75
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,510
Come on, let's go.

76
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,150
Moran.

77
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
Don't you have anything to say?

78
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,910
And you?

79
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,630
Why were you at the hotel?

80
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't you have anything to say?

81
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
That day,

82
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,920
in the lobby...

83
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
About Fanty leaking the design drafts,

84
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,470
send someone to clarify immediately.

85
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
We must minimize the loss.

86
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,560
Ms. Jian, you and Mr. Huo have already...

87
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,720
It's obviously not him.

88
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,160
The person behind the scenes

89
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,310
wants to pin the suspicion on Huo Jinyan.

90
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,680
We can only play along to draw the snake

91
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,800
out of its hole.

92
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,270
Only by letting the people behind
relax their guard

93
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,800
can we better take the initiative.

94
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,600
Why are you keeping it from Mr. Huo?

95
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,950
He's kept so much

96
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,360
from me.

97
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,360
I have to teach him a lesson.

98
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,950
Isn't this just displacing anger?

99
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,800
Do I?

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
I don't.

101
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,750
What's most important now is

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,310
Yuni's issue has already affected Fanty.

103
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,160
If things fail,

104
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,950
I don't want Huo Jinyan to be implicated.

105
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,360
So, who do you think
is the person behind this?

106
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,830
I hope

107
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,320
it's not him.

109

110

I know everything.

111
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
Moran,

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,630
