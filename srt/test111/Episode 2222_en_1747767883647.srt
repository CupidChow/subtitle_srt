1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,380
But you have to!

2
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,820
So, we must downtown it with her hand!

3
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes!

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,780
Ya'en, yi萬日打結 apparent.

5
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,380
Fine, what do you want?

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,440
Come on

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,300
feel free to get and act routines,

8
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,220
to make public mustachioed ideas honored and respected.

9
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,100
Good.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,100
You are a member of the gang.

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,100
So the police can't take the responsibility.

12
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,100
Do you understand?

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,100
Uncle Zhuang.

14
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,100
Our Shanhai Gang

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
is defeated by the official.

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,100
We are defeated by a son

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,100
who is famous all over the world.

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,100
Now, for a gang leader

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,100
who can't be appointed,

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,100
we should have a son

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,100
to take the responsibility for our father.

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Do you have the right to be a son

23
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,100
to take the responsibility for your father?

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Uncle Zhuang.

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Zhendong was born in the Shanhai Gang.

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,100
He grew up in the Shanhai Gang.

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,100
Today,

28
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,100
he can't give up the fight

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,100
and let me take the responsibility.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
I will send my father

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
to the heaven.

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
I will kowtow to you.

33
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Get up, Zhendong.

34
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,100
Get up.

35
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,100
Zhendong, you are filial.

36
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Why are you so rude?

37
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
You are just like your father.

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Do you know

39
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,100
you are so shameless?

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:03:05,100
.

41
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Please send Liu Zongxiu and Wu Dage to the road.

42
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Stop! Stop!

43
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,100
What are you doing?

44
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,100
The dead are the greatest.

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
Don't go too far.

46
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,100
Shan Dingzai,

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,100
move the road away.

48
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
After all the noise,

49
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,100
I thought it was Shanghai Gang.

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
It was Liu's grandfather who sent the troops.

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,100
Brother Xiong Wu is the leader of Shanhai Gang.

53
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,100
You're pretending to be a leader, aren't you?

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,100
The leader is gone.

55
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Who will take the responsibility?

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Are you blind?

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,100
I'm his son. Of course I'll take the responsibility.

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Sure.

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
That's your family business.

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
So I said,

61
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
is it Liu's grandfather who sent the troops?

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
If it's the leader of the gang,

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,100
whoever defends the gang,

64
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
whoever is the next leader,

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
a policeman defends the gang,

66
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
let all the people of Shanghai Gang

67
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,100
follow Liu Zhendong

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,100
to be the dog's legs for the foreigners?

69
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,100
Yes!

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
A'qi!

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
Say it again!

72
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
A'cao,

73
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
don't be so arrogant.

74
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Shoot! Shoot!

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Come here.

76
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,100
Come on.

77
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Si Chenyang,

78
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,100
you're not their dog's legs.

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,100
You're here to defend the gang.

80
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
You've made the whole city lose face.

81
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Well,

82
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
since Shanghai Gang didn't appoint the leader,

83
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,100
let's kill them.

84
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,100
The land will be taken over by us.

85
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Yes!

86
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Shut up!

87
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Say it again.

88
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Don't let Shanghai Gang know the truth.

89
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
Zhendong,

90
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,100
don't hurt him.

91
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
Come on. Shoot!

92
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,100
So many people are watching.

93
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,100
It's a bomb!

94
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,100
It's a tornado!

95
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,100
Liu Shi!

96
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Brother Xuanwu, please step aside.

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
Please let the mountain boy

98
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,100
and the brothers

99
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,100
go around.

100
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,100
No way.

101
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Guancai,

102
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
you must be tired.

103
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
Put it down.

104
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,100
Let's talk about the past first.

105
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Bullshit!

106
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Once the spirit is awakened,

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Guancai will be destroyed.

108
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Guys,

109
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
they're here to cause trouble.

110
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Let's kill them.

111
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,100
Yes!

112
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,100
Kill them!

113
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,100
Kill them!

114
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,100
Kill them!

115
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Brother Xuanwu,

116
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

117
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

118
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

119
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

120
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

121
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

122
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

123
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

124
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

125
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,100
Brother Xuanwu is back.

126
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,100
Personally?

127
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Let them step back for a few steps.

128
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,100
Step back,

129
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,100
you guys better move back for a few steps!

130
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,100
Gather the armed forces.

131
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
We're waiting.

132
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Waiting.

133
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Brother,

134
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
it's been a while since we last met.

135
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Tell me, what do you want to do today?

136
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
My brother has been dead for two years.

137
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,100
The Shanghai gang should be able to give an explanation.

138
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Jin Yajun is dead.

139
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,100
The suspect wanted by the police is me.

140
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,100
How about we find a place alone to solve this case?

141
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
You know I was framed.

142
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,100
If you want to find the murderer who killed your brother,

143
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
give me more time.

144
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Besides,

145
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
on the day your brother was sick,

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,100
the Shanghai gang didn't go to the party.

147
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,100
Xiong Wu took four leaders to the town.

148
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Everyone has been in the city for decades.

149
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
You don't even tell me the rules.

150
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,100
How can I get in the future?

151
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,100
I tell you,

152
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
if you really get in trouble today,

153
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,100
I can guarantee that the Shanghai gang will fight with the enemy.

154
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,100
You should know the result.

155
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
What?

156
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,100
You can't be the leader?

157
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
The most hated gang is the police and foreigners.

158
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,100
Someone must have ordered you to make trouble.

159
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
Since you can't be the leader,

160
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,100
just call him.

161
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,100
I will wait for him here.

162
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,100
I can be the leader of the mountain gang.

163
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,100
No one is behind it.

164
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,100
Put them down.

165
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
Boss Zhang,

166
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,100
I was supposed to go to the town.

167
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,100
I didn't expect them to get up.

168
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,100
They said we were here to make trouble.

169
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
That's a misunderstanding.

170
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,100
Okay, I'll thank you and the brothers of the mountain gang for Xiong Wu.

171
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
Hua Nan,

172
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
send Xiong Wu to the town.

173
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
Go.

174
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Boss, you're finally back.

175
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Liu Gao,

176
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
thank you.

177
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
Let's make it louder.

178
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Xiong Wu likes to have fun.

179
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Okay.

180
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Uncle.

181
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Go back.

182
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,100
Go on.

183
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Go.

184
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Go on.

185
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Go on.

186
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Brother Shun, give it to me.

187
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,100
Let me do it.

188
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,100
You'll get hurt if you push it.

189
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Xiong Wu will feel bad.

190
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Move.

191
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,100
Brother Xiong Wu,

192
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,100
have a good trip.

193
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
Sir.

194
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Don't move.

195
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,100
Don't move!

196
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Don't move!

197
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
Don't move!

198
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Don't move.

199
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Don't move!

200
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Don't move!

201
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
Don't move!

202
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Don't move!

203
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,100
Don't go!

204
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Don't move!

205
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Don't move!

206
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,100
The girl in the street has been exposed.

207
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
What did she do?

208
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:25,980
No

209
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Thank you, sir.

210
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Thank you.

211
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
Zhou, sir.

212
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Except Liu Zhendong,

213
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
no one else has a gun.

214
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Liu Zhendong.

215
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,100
On behalf of the police,

216
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,100
I'd like to express my condolences.

217
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
Please accept my condolences.

218
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Thank you, sir.

219
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,100
You are all Mr. Liu's close friends.

220
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
On behalf of the police,

221
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,100
I'd like to make a solemn promise

222
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
to solve the case as soon as possible.

223
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,100
The murderer will be deported to the forest.

224
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
The murderer will be deported to the forest.

225
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Pei Hu.

226
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
When I met Xiong Wu,

227
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,100
you were still a little kid.

228
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
We received a report that

229
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,100
the suspect was killed and the wanted criminal was arrested.

230
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
He was deported to the city.

231
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
We welcome you to provide clues

232
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
and help us catch the suspect.

233
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
We will reward you.

234
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
All right.

235
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,100
Dad, uncle.

236
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Be careful.

237
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,100
Brother, be careful.

238
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,100
I really want to stay with Xiong Wu.

239
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,100
Just lie down like this.

240
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,100
Back then, Xia Nanyang had no money and no ticket.

241
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,100
We brothers are in the bottom of the ship.

242
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,100
The space is as big as this.

243
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Xiong Wu,

244
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,100
you have been fighting for Shanghai Gang for decades.

245
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
All the brothers of Shanghai Gang

246
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
will never forget you.

247
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I will never forget you.

248
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Miss.

249
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Huanyan, are you going to hang it back at home?

250
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Let me help you.

251
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Burn it.

252
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Yes.

253
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
People are sick.

254
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
These are all withdrawn.

255
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
Burn it.

256
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Burn it.

257
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
You mean the weapon?

258
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
Xiong Wu is a stubborn person.

259
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
If you delay him, he will be angry.

260
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
I will beat you.

261
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
Take it off.

262
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Okay.

263
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Shanghai Gang

264
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,100
How are you these two years?

265
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,100
I'm fine.

266
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,100
Where did you go?

267
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
I went to travel around the world for the first year.

268
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,100
I lived in Qingmai for a year the next year.

269
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,100
What did you do for a living?

270
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
I sold chalk powder.

271
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,100
I lived a life of no return.

272
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I was very happy.

273
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,100
Very happy?

274
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,100
Have you ever thought about the person who misses you?

275
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
I have.

276
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Xiong Wu will definitely miss me.

277
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,100
It's been two years since he left.

278
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,100
The bullets of Shanghai Gang fell on his shoulder.

279
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
You know I'm not talking about Xiong Wu.

280
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
I know.

281
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Xiong Wu has left.

282
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,100
You are very sad.

283
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,100
But I also hope you can take care of yourself.

284
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Cheng Hui.

285
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
You only care about Shanghai Gang.

286
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Your brotherhood.

287
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Is that right?

288
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
I once died for you.

289
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Cheng Hui.

290
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,100
I only know one child.

291
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
If he had another accident,

292
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
how would I live?

293
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,100
If you can still remember the past,

294
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Cheng Hui,

295
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
take me and Zhendong away from Shicheng.

296
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Okay?

297
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Hong Yan.

298
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Xiong Wu is my life-and-death brother.

299
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
He left without a word.

300
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,100
I have to explain to him.

301
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I've had enough of this kind of life.

302
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Besides, Xiong Wu is dead.

303
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,100
Even if you can make it clear,

304
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
what can you do?

305
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Xiong Wu just left the army today.

306
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,100
Is that right?

307
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,100
Is that right for him?

308
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Are you two right for me?

309
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,100
I've been through a lot with that rough man.

310
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,100
I can't die because of me.

311
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,100
Hong Yan, don't be agitated.

312
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,100
If you have any clues about Xiong Wu's death,

313
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
you must tell me.

314
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
I don't know.

315
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I don't know anything.

316
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Take me away as soon as possible.

317
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Or I'll die for you.

318
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Mom.

319
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,100
Mom.

320
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Mom.

321
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm talking to your uncle about something important.

322
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
Don't come in.

323
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
I know.

324
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
But uncle has to leave now.

325
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,100
I got the news.

326
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
The police are here to arrest him.

327
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
You heard it.

328
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
I'm a suspect.

329
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,100
I have to go.

330
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Uncle, this way.

331
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Don't move.

332
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
Don't move.

333
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
Don't move.

334
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Don't move.

335
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
Don't move.

336
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,100
Don't move.

337
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,100
Don't move.

338
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
Uncle, come on.

339
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,100
You can only stay in the Shanghai Gang's territory.

340
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Don't run.

341
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Zheng Qi has already given a reward for you.

342
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
I got it.

343
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Go.

344
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
I'm the master of my life.
