14
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,600
Duan Yanqing, release them at once.

15
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,200
I'm the one you're looking for.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,300
Come, please.

17
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,800
Thank you for your hospitality.

18
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,300
Do accept this small gift.

19
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,000
- No need.
- I insist.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,600
Are you into paintings, mister?

21
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
My master is also into paintings.

22
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,400
These are her collection.

23
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Enjoy yourself.

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,200
I'll brew some tea.

25
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Thank you.

By the valley in Summer

29
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,800
the lychee...

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,700
What's the matter?

31
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,000
Why is there a missing word in each line?

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Unless, the owner of this house wants a game of wits?

33
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,700
In that case, I should fill the missing space quickly.

34
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,300
Don't you think?

35
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,700
What fragrant ink!

36
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,100
What's that?

37
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,600
This ink has a unique scent.

38
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,100
Smell it.

39
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,900
It is so fragrant.

40
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,200
If Young Master Duan wishes to write,

41
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,600
let me grind the ink for you then.

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,100
Sure.

43
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,300
On the flowing water in Spring the Camellia blossoms.

44
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,900

Blue dress and splendid beauty mark our encounter

46
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,700
as Camellia sways by the road in September.

47
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,600
- Yuyan. Yuyan?
- This fragrance... is poisonous.

48
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,200
That old man...

49
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Where am I?

50
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,900
Where's Yuyan?

51
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,000
I spent so much effort to lure Duan Senior.

52
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,700
But you got me Duan Junior instead.

53
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Duan Zhengchun went south from Xixia

54
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,400
then turned to the east suddenly.

55
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,900
How is it that Zhengchun's son

56
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,300
will remember the poem that he's supposed to know?

57
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,200
It's ancient history now.

58
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
Why won't you let it go?

59
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Please spare that young man.

60
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,200
You want me to spare the son of Dao Baifeng?

61
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
Sure.

62
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Let me cut him a thousand times first.

63
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,600
If he's still alive, then I'll set him free.

64
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I see. Madam Wang is my dad's ex-lover.

65
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,600
She was supposed to drug my dad and capture him.

66
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,200
But somehow, she got me, his son instead.

67
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,600
Aunt.

68
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,700
- Dismissed.
- Noted.

69
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,600
Greetings.

70
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,100
Young Master Murong?

71
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,000
What scheme did you cook up this time?

72
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,300
Aunt, I'm your blood relative.

73
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,400
I miss you. Can't I come and see you?

74
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,100
If something upsets you, Aunt, just tell me.

75
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,100
I will take care of it.

76
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,400
What makes you think that you can help me?

77
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
On the flowing water in Spring the Camellia blossoms.

78
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,400
By the valley in Summer the lychee flourishes.

79
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,200
Blue dress and splendid beauty mark our encounter

80
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,600
as Camellia sways by the road in September.

81
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,700
Why do you know this poem?

82
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,200
D-Did you go to the wooden lodge?

83
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,700
You don't need to know why, Aunt.

84
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,900
Coincidentally, I also know where the person you're looking for is.

85
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,500
If you trust me enough,

86
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,800
tell me everything about the trap you set up.

87
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I might have another idea.

88
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
We are a family.

89
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,800
Of course, I trust you.

90
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,400
More than a decade ago,

91
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,000
I invented a perfume in Mandarava Villa.

92
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
It is both a poison and a non-poison.

93
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,600
When someone smells it, he or she will lose consciousness.

94
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,200
I mixed this perfume inside the inkstick.

95
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,800
When that cheater sees those missing words on the poem by the wall,

96
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,200
he will grind the ink and fill in the blanks.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,800
I didn't expect to catch the wrong person.

98
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,690
It's all that kid's fault. He ruined my plan.

99
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,200
He ruined my plan.

100
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,500
I knew something was off with that inkstick.

101
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,200
My dad and I are similar.

102
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,200
If we saw that incomplete poem, we would want to finish it.

103
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,500
And that's why we fell for her trap.

104
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,700
But my dad was spared from this.

105
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,800
It's still something to be happy about.

106
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
Fret not, Aunt.

107
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,900
Remove the young man's clothes or jade trinket and send them to him.

108
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,800
He will then have to come here.

109
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,400
You're right. He cares a lot about his son.

110
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,600
If he knows I have kidnapped his son,

111
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,300
he will come to rescue him.

112
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,200
And then, all you have to do is spike his drink

113
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
and let him drink it.

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,500
He will be defenseless.

115
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,000
However, there is one huge problem.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,300
What is?

117
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,600
Duan Zhengchun is now held captive by someone.

118
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,300
He is in great jeopardy now.

119
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

120
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,400
Who captured him?

121
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Someone very powerful.

122
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,900
Even I can't defeat him.

123
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,800
Both of them are on bad terms, too.

124
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,500
You're saying...

125
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,400
that his captor is Duan Yanqing?

126
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,900
Exactly.

127
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,800
If Duan Yanqing captured him,

128
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,300
then will he still be alive?

129
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,100
The way I see it, after Duan Yanqing captured Prince Zhennan,

130
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,100
he will not kill the prince straight away.

131
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,100
He will try to make him claim the throne and then inherit that position.

132
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,700
That way, Prince Zhennan will be the Dali Emperor.

133
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,500
How so?

134
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,200
Duan Yanqing's father was a Dali Emperor.

135
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,900
However, he went missing when ministers revolted against the Emperor.

136
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,800
That's why Duan Zhengming is the emperor now.

137
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,600
And now, if Prince Zhennan ascends to the throne

138
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
and appoints Duan Yanqing as the crown prince,

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Duan Yanqing can naturally take the throne.

140
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,900
I don't want him to be the Dali Emperor anyway.

141
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,000
I want him to live with me forever in this villa.

142
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Of course.

143
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,100
Otherwise, Duan Yanqing will eliminate him too.

144
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,800
However, once he ascends to the throne, Prince Zhennan

145
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,900
will still have to rule for a while. Maybe a week or a fortnight.

146
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,100
Once the period is over, we can remove him.

147
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,000
Or else, Duan Yanqing won't say yes to him either.

148
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
Worry not, Aunt.

149
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,900
I will do my best to make your wish come true.

150
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,300
Fu'er, what do you want as a reward

151
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,500
for fulfilling my wish?

152
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,800
I don't need any reward.

153
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,600
But if you like, you can give me several thousand gold

154
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
or a few martial art texts from the Langhuan Jade Cave.

155
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
I won't say no to them.

156
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,600
Your effort deserves a monetary reward, naturally.

157
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,900
If you want to have a look at my martial art texts in Langhuan Jade Cave...

158
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,500
it's fine by me too.

159
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,200
That said, you need to tell me

160
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,600
how you will exactly capture Duan Yanqing and how you will rescue Duan Zhengming.

161
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,700
Don't worry, Aunt.

162
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,600
I saw with my own eyes that Prince Zhennan and his people

163
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
had their acupoints sealed and captured.

164
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,239
They focused so much on Prince Zhennan that they didn't notice my presence.

165
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,900
I took my horse and rushed here before them

166
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,200
so that I could strike preemptively.

167
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,000
Aunt, time is of the essence.

168
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Let's prepare the drug and send someone to lure Duan Yanqing here at the same time.

169
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,000
Stop!

170
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,600
Crown Prince Yanqing, you're next in line for Dali's throne.

171
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,000
Now that your throne was snatched away, why didn't you reclaim it?

172
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
None of your business.

173
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,600
If you want to be the Dali Emperor, you'll need my help.

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,900
I don't believe you'll help me.

175
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,800
Helping you to claim Dali's throne is actually beneficial for me, too.

176
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,200
First of all, Duan Yu is my sworn enemy.

177
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,000
On Shaoshi Mountain, he almost forced me to end my life.

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Now, I want to end his life.

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,600
Secondly, once you become the emperor,

180
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,200
I'll need a favor from you.

181
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
You're not strong enough to defeat Duan Yu.

182
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,600
How can you capture him?

183
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,100
When strength fails, wits will be your best bet.

184
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
Madam Wang here is my aunt.

185
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,600
She is holding Duan Yu captive

186
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
and wishes to use him as leverage to find someone you captured.

187
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,400
May I know who?

188
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,100
The father of Duan Yu, Duan Zhengchun.

189
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,200
He crossed my aunt back then, and now, she wants vengeance.

190
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,200
My aunt hopes that once you become the Dali Emperor,

191
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,300
you can hand Duan Zhengchun to her

192
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,000
and she shall decide his fate.

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That is easy.

194
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Young Master Murong,

195
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
you said that once I ascended to the throne,

196
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,900
you'd need a favor from me.

197
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,700
Do elaborate.

198
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,200
Now that you gave us your word,

199
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,800
I will not hide anything from you.

200
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
The Murong clan is the descendant of Yan's royal family.

201
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,400
Reviving our kingdom has always been our duty.

202
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,600
However, we're too weak to achieve anything.

203
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,200
Once you become the Dali Emperor,

204
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I kindly request 10,000 soldiers from you as well as sufficient resources

205
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,800
so that I can bring back the Yan nation.

206
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,400
I see.

207
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
The Dali Kingdom is not an affluent nation either.

208
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,200
10,000 men might be too much

209
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,700
but 5,000 will be expendable.

210
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,599
Should I revive the Yan nation,

211
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,000
I will forever be indebted to you, Your Highness.

212
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You are welcome.

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Where is Duan Yu?

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,800
Where is Duan Zhengchun now?

215
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,000
In front of you.

216
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,200
Duan.

217
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,700
Duan!

218
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,400
Qingluo?

219
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
Qingluo, they are villains.

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,700
Don't let them lay their hands on you.

221
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,200
Run!

222
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,000
You can't even fend for yourself.

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
They are villains

224
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,300
but you're not the embodiment of justice either.

225
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,800
Madam Wang,

226
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
once I have finished my business,

227
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Duan Zhengchun will be yours.

228
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Where is Duan Yu?

229
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,200
Bring him here.

230
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,700
- Yu'er!
- Yu'er!

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,500
Crown Prince Yanqing, feel free to check for yourself.

232
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,800
See if this is who you want.

233
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
He is.

234
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,900
A'Luo, why did you capture my son, Yu'er?

235
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,400
He didn't cross you.

236
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course, he did.

237
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,600
He seduced my cousin, Yuyan, and sullied her maidenhood.

238
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Aunt, he deserves death.

239
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
What?

240
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,200
- He...
- It's a girl?

241
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,300
She's called Yuyan?

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You heartless philanderer.

243
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,400
You ruined my life

244
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,800
and now, you even ruined your son's.

245
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,600
Yuyan...

246
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,400
Yuyan is your daughter!

247
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Yuyan is also my half-sister...

248
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
And you!

249
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,500
You animal!

250
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,000
Immoral pervert!

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,300
You even touched your own sister!

252
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
I want to slice you into a million pieces!

253
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,200
Yu'er!

254
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,700
What are you doing?

255
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,400
Don't you know he is my master?

256
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,000
If you kick him, you kick me.

257
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,900
You know what? If you touch him again,

258
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,200
I'll break your neck.

259
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Bring it on!

260
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,000
- Behave yourself in front of Madam Wang.
- Stop!

261
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
This Duan kid here is a shameless scoundrel.

262
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,100
He tricked you into calling him Master.

263
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,000
You might as well kill him today

264
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,700
to save your face in this pugilist world.

265
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,500
But, Big Brother, I lost the bet.

266
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,300
He is my master.

267
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm a man of my own word.

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,800
I can't...

269
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
It's not right to let my master die in front of me.

270
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
Isn't that right, Big Brother?

271
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Third Brother, stop right now.

272
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,400
Big Brother, I will not obey you today!

273
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,000
I have to rescue my master!

274
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,100
Master!

275
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,800
Fourth Brother, bury him.

276
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Okay.

277
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Obey me and you'll live.

278
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,300
Disobey me and you'll die.

279
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,800
Outside of Heavenly Dragon Monastery.

280
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,500
Under the bodhi tree.

281
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,000
Unkempt beggar.

282
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,900
Long-haired Guanyin.

283
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,800
You're the Guanyin?

284
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,700
Back then, the ministers revolted

285
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,600
and invaded the Imperial Palace.

286
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,300
Crown Prince Yanqing went missing amidst the chaos.

287
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,200
Do you still remember what happened next?

288
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
20 years ago,

289
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,400
father and I were set up by the disloyal ministers.

290
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,200
My bodyguard sacrificed himself to keep me safe.

291
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,300
My father told me

292
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,600
to seek help from Reverend Ku Rong in Heavenly Dragon Monastery

293
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,600
but I was never allowed in.

294
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,100
I gave you my heart,

295
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,800
but you never took it seriously.

296
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,300
One woman after another.

297
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,400
You forgot about our promises.

298
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,900
Save me.

299
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Save me, Guanyin.

300
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,400
If you did me wrong, I'll do you wrong too.

301
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,800
You're a prince and a general.

302
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,500
I will find myself the ugliest,

303
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,200
dirtiest, most disgusting man then.

304
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Are you Guanyin?

305
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,900
Back then, I thought Guanyin appeared before me

306
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,100
to enlighten me, to encourage me.

307
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,700
Even if I was set up by unscrupulous ministers,

308
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,000
I am still the destined ruler.

309
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,400
The hardship I faced was nothing.

310
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,800
You want me to spare your son?

311
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,400
He's carrying a small gold pendant

312
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,800
which indicates his birthday.

313
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,700
Check it.

314
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:47,800
23rd of November.

315
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,800
He is...

316
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
Karma.

317
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,500
Karma.

318
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,000
He is my son?

319
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I have a son?

320
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
I have a son

321
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,000
but you have none!

322
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
What's happening?

323
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,500
This is...

324
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,800
Young Master Murong.

325
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,000
The Dali Duan family is not well-versed with poison.

326
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,800
You should have fought me with One-finger Death Touch instead.

327
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
You are a powerful individual.

328
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
You're no ordinary person.

329
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,400
I got this Teary and Limpy Breeze from Xixia.

330
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,000
And you used to work under the First Class Hall of Xixia.

331
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
That's the

332
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
'fight fire with fire' technique for you.

333
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
You can't counter Teary and Limpy Breeze

334
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,600
with your internal force.

335
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,400
Fu'er, you poisoned me too?

336
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Forgive me, Aunt.

337
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,800
You will be the first to receive the antidote.

338
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,900
Your Highness, I might have poisoned you

339
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,700
but I do not wish to harm you.

340
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,200
Please allow me to ask for your forgiveness.

341
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,300
I have a favor to ask for.

342
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,700
Young Master Murong, what favor is so huge

343
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,000
that requires you to kneel in front of me?

344
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,600
You know my intention very well, Your Highness.

345
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,800
Yan cannot be rebuilt within a day.

346
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,900
Today, I'll help Your Highness to reclaim the Dali throne.

347
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
I also know that Your Highness has no heir.

348
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,400
I would kindly ask Your Majesty

349
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,700
to take me in as your adopted child.

350
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,400
Both of us can work together and achieve great things.

351
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,500
It's a win-win solution.

352
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,200
You really want me to adopt you as my child?

353
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,400
Yes.

354
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,200
The Grand Zhou Emperor, Guo Wei, had no heir either.

355
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,900
He adopted Chai Rong as his child.

356
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,600
Emperor Shizong, Chai's strategic maneuver

357
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
was the reason why the Later Han Dynasty thrived.

358
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,100
We can recreate this, Your Highness.

359
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:24,500
In that case, you need to change your surname to Duan.

360
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,200
No one will be able to inherit the name of Murong.

361
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Are you willing to do that?

362
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
I...

363
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
While I respect filial piety in all earnest,

364
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,000
a hero shall not dwell in pedantry.

365
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,700
If I ask you to adopt me,

366
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,400
then I shall serve the Duan family with utmost loyalty.

367
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,600
Wonderful.

368
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,600
I have wandered alone in this pugilist world with no wife nor offspring.

369
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,400
Who knew that I would get a son at this age?

370
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,700
You are young and talented.

371
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,200
Is there a more joyous thing

372
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,600
a man could ask for?

373
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Praised be, Guanyin.

374
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,200
Even my death

375
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,100
is not enough to repay the kindness you extended to me.

376
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,800
You are a venerable fighter.

377
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,400
I shall take your words for it.

378
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,800
Father, please accept my kowtow.

379
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,000
No can do!

380
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
This is a wrong move!

381
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,200
- Young Master!
- Yes, Third Brother Bao?

382
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,000
You are the descendant of Yan!

383
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,100
You cannot change your surname to Duan!

384
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,400
Reviving Yan is very challenging

385
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,800
but we shall give our all and do our best.

386
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Should the revival come true, it will be wonderful.

387
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,100
But even if it doesn't,

388
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,213
we will still be respected as honorable men.

389
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:04,832
By calling a wretched being like him father,

390
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:07,400
even if you become the emperor in the future,

391
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,000
you still can't hold your chin up.

392
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,400
Third Brother Bao, many are the things you cannot understand now.

393
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,000
I will explain to you in the future.

394
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,800
I beg to differ.

395
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,400
I might be dumb but I can

396
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,800
somehow guess your ulterior motive.

397
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,400
You wish to imitate Han Xin.
(TN: A great general during the early Han Dynasty)

398
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,600
You will endure the temporary humiliation

399
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,900
and change your surname to Duan.

400
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,800
Once the sovereignty is yours, you'll change the name of the nation to Yan.

401
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
And then, you'll try to conquer Song and Liao

402
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,400
to restore the land Yan used to own.

403
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,900
Young Master, you have a lofty ambition.

404
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,600
But by carrying your plan out,

405
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,000
you'll end up as an infidel and a traitor.

406
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,800
Do you not feel shame?

407
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,600
Everyone will look down on you!

408
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,600
You're exaggerating, Third Brother Bao.

409
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,400
I merely asked His Highness to adopt me.

410
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,200
Why am I an infidel and a traitor?

411
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
You ally with the Dali before betraying them.

412
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,800
That's infidelity.

413
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,400
You called Duan Yanqing your father.

414
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,300
You're pious to the Duan, but not to the Murong.

415
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,000
That's being a traitor.

416
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,600
You will change the name of the nation

417
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,600
and many Dali ministers will be killed.

418
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,900
That's cruelty. You...

419
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Third Brother!

420
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,200
Third Brother!

421
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Third Brother must be wondering

422
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,800
why you would wish harm upon him.

423
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,100
While it's true that Third Brother was known to talk back,

424
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,400
if whatever he said offended you, Young Master,

425
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,200
you could have just chastised him.

426
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Why would you kill him?

427
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,600
I sincerely requested His Highness to adopt me

428
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,800
but Third Brother came to sow discord among us.

429
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,700
It is unacceptable.

430
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,800
Third Brother Bao stuck with you through thick and thin for more than a decade.

431
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,600
Was he not as good as the Duan family?

432
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Calm down, Fourth Brother Feng.

433
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
I might ally myself with the Dali Duan family

434
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,900
but my heart is still dedicated to Yan.

435
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,800
Bao Butong twisted my noble intention

436
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,200
and so, I had to do this.

437
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,400
Young Master, does this mean

438
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
that none of us can dissuade you?

439
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,600
Yes.

440
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,000
The four of us might not be brothers by name

441
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,800
but we swear to live and die together.

442
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,500
So, Big Brother Deng, you want to avenge Third Brother Bao?

443
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,600
We are the servants of the Murong clan.

444
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,500
We dare not to cross you, Young Master.

445
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,400
However, as the saying goes,

446
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,100
unite if you see eye to eye, part if you do not.

447
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,200
From now onwards,

448
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,600
the three of us will not serve you anymore.

449
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,800
A gentleman knows to hold his tongue when a relationship falls apart.

450
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,900
Young Master, take care.

451
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,400
All of you promised my father

452
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,800
that you would do your best to support me.

453
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
If you leave me now,

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,900
it means you'll break the oath you swore.

455
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,400
We can let this slide if you never mention Master.

456
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
But now that you've done it...

457
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,400
You, who called someone else as your father,

458
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,800
who changed your name and betrayed Yan.

459
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Can you face your late father?

460
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:24,700
Back then, we swore to Master that we would help you to rebuild Yan,

461
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,600
to rebuild the Murong clan.

462
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,400
Not to help you to rebuild Dali,

463
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,000
to rebuild the Duan family.

464
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,700
Let's go.

465
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,200
Farewell.

466
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,200
As you can see, Father,

467
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
they were my servants and had followed me for many years.

468
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
To prove my loyalty to the Duan family,

469
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,200
I will kill one of them and discard the rest.

470
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,000
This shall be enough to reassure you of my fidelity.

471
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
Great.

472
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,600
Wonderful.

473
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,600
My first feat will be the killing of Duan Yu

474
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,200
so that Duan Zhengchun has no more heirs.

475
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,400
He will then pass his throne to you, Father.

476
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,400
- No!
- Wait.

477
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,600
My son, I admire your piousness.

478
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,600
But his uncle, his so-called father, took my throne away.

479
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,100
I should be the one killing him to vent my fury.

480
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,600
Of course.

481
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,200
By the way, Prince Zhennan.

482
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,600
Once you're back in Dali. How long will it take for you to be the emperor

483
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,600
and how long will you need to pass the throne to my father?

484
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,200
My brother has a rich internal force reservoir and is very healthy.

485
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,000
He will have to be the mperor for at least 30 years.

486
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,200
Once I take over, I will have to bring good results too.

487
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,400
So, that's another 30 years.

488
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,500
Nonsense! We can't wait this long!

489
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,800
I'll give you one month to take the throne.

490
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,600
And one more month to surrender the throne to Crown Prince Yanqing.

491
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,000
My throne is only for my son, Duan Yu.

492
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,600
I can give up the throne early.

493
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,400
But I won't give it to someone else.

494
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,000
Fine then.

495
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,400
I'll kill Duan Yu.

496
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,700
Pass down your throne to his soul.

497
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,000
Who do you think I am?

498
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
If you kill him,

499
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,700
do you think I'll gladly let you control me like a puppet?

500
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,500
He is an obstinate man.

501
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,600
If he takes his life here,

502
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
then our plan will be in shambles.

503
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,200
Spare Duan Yu for the moment.

504
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
Give me the antidote and we'll discuss it later.

505
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,600
Fu'er...

506
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,500
ignore this hideous man.

507
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,800
Come. Kill these four women for me.

508
00:34:14,573 --> 00:34:16,912
Prince Zhennan, my aunt wants me to kill her.

509
00:34:16,912 --> 00:34:18,953
What do you think?

510
00:34:18,953 --> 00:34:22,753
A'Luo, I can do as you ask.

511
00:34:22,753 --> 00:34:26,472
Do you and I really deserve a grudge that will last for millennia?

512
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:30,852
If you ask someone to kill my lovers, do you think I will still treat you kindly?

513
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:35,033
Fu'er, don't do anything.

514
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:37,273
Let me think.

515
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:38,773
Prince Zhennan!

516
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:41,973
As long as you promise to pass the throne to my father,

517
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:45,892
I will spare all your consorts.

518
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:49,852
If you don't, I'll kill her with my blade.

519
00:34:52,112 --> 00:34:53,532
I'll count to three.

520
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:55,592
If you remain headstrong,

521
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:59,493
I will show no mercy.

522
00:34:59,493 --> 00:35:01,193
One.

523
00:35:02,013 --> 00:35:03,893
Two.

524
00:35:07,493 --> 00:35:09,913
You won't concede?

525
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:29,373
Fu'er, didn't I tell you to stop?

526
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:32,093
I... I...

527
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:35,033
I just want to give him a little scare.

528
00:35:40,153 --> 00:35:44,753
Prince Zhennan, everyone says you're a sentimental person.

529
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:48,153
But you won't even say something to save your lover?

530
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,453
One.

531
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:54,093
Two.

532
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:04,493
Martial Sister.

533
00:36:12,473 --> 00:36:16,493
You can kill but you will never bend Prince Zhennan's will.

534
00:36:16,493 --> 00:36:21,033
Also, Murong Fu, I'm the wife of Zhong Wanchou.

535
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:23,473
I don't have anything to do with Prince Zhennan.

536
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:27,193
Don't you tarnish the reputation of the Zhong family in Wanjie Valley!

537
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:08,312
You useless woman.

538
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:11,673
You just have to remain so bitter

539
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:15,033
that now you brought forth the death of my three lovers.

540
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:20,233
Once I break free, I'll slice you into a million pieces.

541
00:37:21,453 --> 00:37:25,292
Murong Fu, what are you waiting for?

542
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:29,052
Pierce her body. Kill her now.

543
00:37:29,052 --> 00:37:30,833
Duan.

544
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:36,413
Did you forget what you...

545
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:39,713
used to tell me?

546
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:44,133
It's been so many years.

547
00:37:45,093 --> 00:37:47,993
We were apart

548
00:37:47,993 --> 00:37:51,113
and now, we can finally see each other.

549
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,393
You...

550
00:37:54,513 --> 00:37:58,373
Yet you say such harsh words to me.

551
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:03,973
Our daughter, Yuyan,

552
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:07,493
have you seen her?

553
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,753
Do you love me? Tell me.

554
00:38:12,753 --> 00:38:16,593
More than a decade ago, we severed ties.

555
00:38:16,593 --> 00:38:18,793
Nothing remains.

556
00:38:18,793 --> 00:38:21,413
Don't bring the past up again.

557
00:38:21,413 --> 00:38:25,753
Fu'er, give me the antidote.

558
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,693
I want to kill this heartless man.

559
00:38:33,013 --> 00:38:34,553
Aunt.

560
00:38:44,813 --> 00:38:46,633
Tell me.

561
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:49,813
Do you really hate me this much?

562
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:54,533
I hate every inch of your being.

563
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:10,093
Aunt!

564
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,013
A'Luo!

565
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:25,473
I said those harsh words so that he'd spare you!

566
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,593
Our reunion this time,

567
00:39:27,593 --> 00:39:31,253
you have no idea how happy I was.

568
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:34,173
Why would I hate you?

569
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:37,373
I am still the man

570
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:42,213
who gave you the thorn apple that day.

571
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,493
I know.

572
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:48,453
I'm still important to you.

573
00:39:49,793 --> 00:39:52,633
You've never abandoned me.

574
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:57,053
Do you remember you promised...

575
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:02,533
that you would live with me in the Limitless Mountain of Dali,

576
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:06,973
in the cave where my mom and I used to live?

577
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:13,013
And we would live together, forever

578
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:19,473
and... and ever.

579
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:25,533
Of course. I remember.

580
00:40:25,533 --> 00:40:28,112
We'll go tomorrow.

581
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:33,573
Tomorrow, we'll visit the jade sculpture of your mother.

582
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:43,153
Can you picture it?

583
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:47,053
Over that jade wall,

584
00:40:52,593 --> 00:40:56,733
we dance with our swords. Can you picture it?

585
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:16,713
Prince Zhennan, your lovers died for you.

586
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:21,272
Do you want to sacrifice your wife, too?

587
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:24,873
Madam.

588
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:30,792
You are the kindest, most generous woman in the world.

589
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:33,293
I did you wrong.

590
00:41:33,293 --> 00:41:37,133
I have led a sinful life.

591
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:40,273
If we can all die here,

592
00:41:40,273 --> 00:41:42,933
I'd say it's a great ending.

593
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:48,653
I'll count to three again.

594
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:51,332
If you still won't concede, I will kill her!

595
00:41:51,332 --> 00:41:53,253
Wait!

596
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:56,253
We need to discuss our plan.

597
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:58,773
Father, this is an important matter.

598
00:41:58,773 --> 00:42:03,132
If he won't concede the throne to you, all of our plans will be ruined!

599
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:04,853
One.

600
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:09,093
Two.

601
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,093
Hold on!

602
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:18,393
Don't you dare hurt my mother!

603
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:24,713
You were drugged and poisoned by the Teary and Limpy Breeze,

604
00:42:24,713 --> 00:42:26,753
and yet, you can still move?
