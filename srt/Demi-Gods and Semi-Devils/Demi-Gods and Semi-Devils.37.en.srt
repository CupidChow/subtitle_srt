Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ⚔️Martial Arts Team ⚔️@Viki.com

15
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,280
Little monk, where are you going?

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,860
It is inappropriate.

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,240
Inappropriate? What do you mean?

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,320
Madam, you're now a... a woman.

19
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,640
You're not a little girl anymore.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,300
Men and women ought to avoid unnecessary contact,

21
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,520
let alone a Buddhist monk like me.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,440
Stupid monk, you only know to spew nonsense.

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,900
I'm 96 years old. Why can't you carry me on your back?

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,680
Let me clean you up, Mr. Wu.

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,880
Little Monk! You're overly pedantic.

26
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,320
You lack flexibility.

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,400
You will never be able to learn any advanced techniques.

28
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,520
What advanced techniques, Martial Sister?

29
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,340
You seem to be having fun here.

30
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,140
Hurry up, Little Monk, carry me to the mountain peak.

31
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,520
- But I still have a question, Madam.
- Don't ask. Go now.

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,660
See you, Elder Wu.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,620
When should I flee if not now?

[Li Qiushui of the Carefree Sect]
Martial Sister,

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,270
your temper hasn't changed with your age.

36
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,840
You always force people to do what they don't want to.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,740
You only know how to throw a tantrum.

38
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,820
You can use a bit of politeness, you know.

39
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,000
Go now, Little Monk. This wench wishes to harm me.

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,600
But, Madam, what she said is right.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,320
Don't be fooled by her.

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,800
Stay away from this wench.

43
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,780
I will treat you nicely in the future.

44
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,420
Farewell.

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,080
Why are you so upset about our reunion and are so eager to leave?

47
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,460
Based on my calculation, the date of your rejuvenation is close.

48
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,380
I heard you've kept a few people by your side.

49
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,560
To prevent them from revolting while you're weakened,

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,100
So I came to Piaomiao Peak to protect you in the Lingjiu Palace.

51
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,300
However, I couldn't find you.

52
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,920
You counted to determine the date when my martial energy will dissipate.

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,080
How can I believe that you came bearing good intention?

54
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,720
Unfortunately, you couldn't predict that someone was carrying me to the peak.

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,310
You must be so annoyed when you didn't find me there, Li Qiushui.

56
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,360
You found me today but you're late.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,900
I can't defeat you, of course,

58
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,340
but you cannot steal my martial prowess either.

59
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,520
Martial Sister, what are you on about?

60
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,879
Even since we parted ways, I've missed you every day.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,399
There was a misunderstanding between us several years ago.

62
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,880
Every time we met,

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,660
you would start insulting me without giving me a chance to explain.

64
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,540
I don't want to anger you further so I didn't come to visit you.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,320
Li Qiushui.

66
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,660
Until now, why do you still want to twist everything to coddle me?

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,933
Look at this.

68
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,920
Seven Gems Ring?

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,020
Why do you have it?

70
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,900
He gave it to me.

71
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,180
No need to state the obvious.

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,780
Li Qiushui.

73
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,820
I order you to kneel before me and perhaps you will be spared.

74
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,740
How can it be?

75
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,060
Why would he give you the ring?

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,560
You must have stolen it or snatched it from him.

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,940
Did you bring harm to him

78
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,800
and steal the Seven Gems Ring?

79
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Li Qiushui! You dare to disobey the order of your leader?

80
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,720
Madam!

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Miss, both of you are clan mates.

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,020
Why would you hurt her? You...

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,540
Martial Sister, what did you do to him?

84
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,880
Tell me now.

85
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,700
Out of our shared history, I will not make you suffer too much.

86
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Miss, allow me to explain.

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,780
Mr. Wu Yazi was not killed by Tonglao.

88
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,640
I'm a Shaolin monk. We do not lie.

89
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,300
I don't to people, you have to believe me.

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,480
May I know your name, Reverend?

91
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,180
How did you come to know the name of my martial brother?

92
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,280
Amitabha.

93
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm no reverend.

94
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,860
I'm Xu Zhu, a monk from...

95
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,313
Little Monk!

96
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:16,733
Miss, I have never crossed you.

97
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,960
- Why would you...
- You are an experienced monk from Shaolin.

98
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,300
I heard the Shaolin Sect is powerful so I wanted to test you.

99
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,020
How disappointing.

100
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,753
Miss, I'm the most useless monk from the Shaolin Temple.

101
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:36,500
Do not tarnish the name of...

102
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,820
Little Monk!

103
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,213
You evil wench!

104
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:44,720
Martial Sister, I've missed you so, so much.

105
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,060
God has mercy and finally, I found you again.

106
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,700
Martial Sister, I remember all the kind deeds you did to me by heart.

107
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,733
You wench.

108
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,600
You are from the same sect!

109
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,560
How can you be this heartless?

110
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,040
You animal!

111
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,300
Animal?

112
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,160
Many years ago,

113
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,980
someone used a sword and made my face look like this.

114
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,840
Shaolin monk, don't I have the right to avenge myself?

115
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,893
I...

116
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:51,680
I... Did... Did Tonglao do this?

117
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,520
Ask her yourself.

118
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,500
Yes.

119
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,320
I ruined her face.

120
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,080
I was an accomplished martial artist when I was 26.

121
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,500
I could have grown old like any other normal person.

122
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,320
But this witch here,

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,500
she set me up

124
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,370
so that my martial progress went haywire.

125
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,460
Don't I have the right to avenge myself, too?

126
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,080
Miss, if what Tonglao said is true, then you started it first.

127
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,960
You cannot blame Tonglao.

128
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,310
I will gladly accept my fate if I die in your hands today.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,120
But this monk...

130
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,039
is a good friend of his.

131
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,280
If you lay your fingers on him, he will not forgive you.

132
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,820
Martial Sister, there's no need to lie to me.

133
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,660
If he were still alive,

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,280
explain why you have the Seven Gems Ring then?

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,800
I don't have any grudges with this little monk,

136
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,750
and I do not wish to get on Shaolin's bad side.

137
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,420
I will not harm him.

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,280
Martial Sister, I have two Nine Revolutions Bear Snake Pills.

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,440
Take them.

140
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,980
Or else, when someone sees your bleeding leg, they might think that we're fighting.

141
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,180
If you want to kill me, do it now.

142
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,760
You want me to take this Tendon Tearing Bone Corrosion Pill while you humiliate me?

143
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,700
Dream on.

144
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,920
Why do you always misconstrue my kindness, Martial Sister?

145
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,520
Your leg is bleeding profusely.

146
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,040
Your health is in jeopardy.

147
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,560
Martial Sister, take them, please.

148
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,000
Little Monk, hit my skull with all your might and kill me.

149
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,340
I can't, Madam.

150
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,620
You're tired, Little Monk. You need to lie down a bit.

151
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,180
Martial Sister, now one of your legs is long and the other is short.

152
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,160
If he sees you, it'll be indecent.

153
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,320
A beauty like you became a half-crooked monstrosity.

154
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,860
What a shame.

155
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,853
Oh well.

156
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,790
I guess I just have to do everything myself...

157
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,700
and end your life.

158
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,580
You're ruthless.

159
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,860
What should we do next?

160
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,020
She has close ties to the Xixia Kingdom.

161
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,700
If she deploys the entire First Class Hall of Xixia to search for me...

162
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,800
If you have nothing to lose, you have nothing to fear.

163
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,580
Little Monk, let's head to the west.

164
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,130
Little Monk, what are you looking for?

165
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,240
Madam, we can't proceed any further.

166
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,421
Didn't you say that the Xixia Kingdom is your martial sister's territory?

167
00:11:55,421 --> 00:11:57,240
If we go further west, we'll arrive at the Xixia Kingdom.

168
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,873
But...

169
00:11:58,873 --> 00:12:00,680
I don't know where else we can go either.

170
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,880
We are already in Xixia.

171
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,500
Xixia is her territory.

172
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,760
She can have everything she wants here.

173
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,820
She may send people to look for us around but she'll never know that I'm hiding in her nest.

174
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,420
Little Monk, I learned this from you.

175
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,960
The most illogical move turns out the be the most useful one.

176
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,260
Madam, did something hit you on the head?

177
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,240
I... Even though your junior is not here, but her...

178
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,780
her underlings are here.

179
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,440
If they found our trace, then we would...

180
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,940
Come here.

181
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,740
Stupid monk.

182
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,340
If there's no one here, then it's not risky anymore. Right?

183
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,540
If I ask you to take a risk, it means I also have a reward.

184
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,620
I won't ask you to work in vain.

185
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,780
Now, I'll teach you Three Palm techniques and Three Capture tactics.

186
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,580
Together, they are called the Tianshan Plum Hand.

187
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,460
Madam, you are still wounded.

188
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,300
You should rest more.

189
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,720
Have some water.

190
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,580
You think my techniques are heretical and so you don't want to learn them?

191
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,780
-Yes.
-Yes?

192
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,900
I mean no.

193
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,780
Yes or no?

194
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,000
No. Don't misinterpret, Madam.

195
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,680
Have some water.

196
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,440
You are the appointed successor of the Carefree Sect.

197
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,420
Tianshan Plum Hand is one of its advanced techniques. Why can't you learn it?

198
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,260
I already told you, Madam.

199
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm a Shaolin disciple. I cannot learn techniques from another sect.

200
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,541
- Also, I have absolutely nothing to do with the Carefree Sect.
- Sacrilege!

201
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:55,420
Your internal force is from the Carefree Sect. Nothing to do with the Carefree Sect?

202
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,340
Nonsense!

203
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,700
I always prioritize myself.

204
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,020
I teach you martial arts because I need

205
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,540
you to fight against the enemies.

206
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,660
If you don't want to learn this technique and want to die in Xixia, be my guest.

207
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,600
But don't drag me with you.

208
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,373
All right.

209
00:14:23,373 --> 00:14:25,340
I'll learn it.

210
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,060
Good.

211
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,420
I'll teach you the chant.

212
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,370
Carry me and recite the chant at the same time.

213
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,660
The moon and the sun rotate, and a cycle was born.

214
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,320
The cloud rises and the rain falls, like the balance of Yin and Yang.

215
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,080
Got it? Recite now!

216
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,800
The moon...

217
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,640
And... ?

218
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,100
The moon and the sun rotate, and a cycle was born.

219
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,700
The cloud rises and the rain falls, like the balance of Yin and Yang.

220
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,520
Wow!

221
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,520
What a huge and grand temple!

222
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:32,080
- Very... good...
- Little Monk, try yelling louder.

223
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,980
Why?

224
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,300
Because if you do, the guards of the imperial palace will come and take us away.

225
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,400
Don't bite more than you can chew.

226
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,020
This is the imperial palace?

227
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,360
Within a radius of 2,000 li, there's only one spot she won't look at.

228
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,360
And that's her home.

229
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,100
She lives in the imperial palace?

230
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,680
That wench is the Xixia Imperial Consort Dowager.

231
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,100
All right, calm down.

232
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,420
Carry me. I'll tell you to go somewhere safe.

233
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,119
Go. Over there. It'll be even safer.

234
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,852
Okay.

235
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,261
- Go down.
- All right.

236
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,940
This is the third level of the freezer.

237
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,760
She might be powerful but she'll never find us here.

238
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,580
Madam, have you been here before?

239
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,140
I came here more than once to visit that wench.

240
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,280
What are you thinking about?

241
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,700
Madam, we're in a freezer.

242
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,280
There's no animal, no fresh blood for you.

243
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,580
How are you supposed to train?

244
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,100
There must be a lot of livestock in the imperial kitchen.

245
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,300
But they do not possess any mystic energy.

246
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,180
I don't like them.

247
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,380
Should we head to the imperial garden and hunt down some peacocks or red-crowned cranes?

248
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,180
I'll drink blood and you'll eat meat.

249
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,380
I bid you farewell then.

250
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,980
Where are you going?

251
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,600
Back to Shaolin.

252
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,693
Madam, can you wait until I stand upright before you seal my acupoints next time?

253
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:47,460
You're standing quite nicely there, aren't you?

254
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,240
You shall not leave.

255
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,680
I will only set you free once I master my technique and kill that witch.

256
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,580
Now that you cannot use any of your Shaolin techniques,

257
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,000
you can only listen to me as I pass every Carefree technique to you.

258
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,640
I'll be very proud when you have unrivaled power.

259
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,200
Nothing lasts forever. Joy or sorrow, what will be, will be.

260
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,253
Madam, the fame and glory you'll get are all predestined.

261
00:19:10,253 --> 00:19:13,320
When the time comes, they will leave.

262
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,180
So why do you covet fame and glory?

263
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,520
Stupid monk. You're spewing nonsense again.

264
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,660
You are weak so you get bullied everywhere.

265
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,220
I've sealed all your acupoints now.

266
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,700
Even if I humiliate or hit you, you can do nothing but endure it.

267
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,240
It's part of my training.

268
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,060
Fine then.

269
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,680
It's like me who is hiding here because I haven't mastered my technique yet.

270
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,820
I can only watch as that wench does what she likes out there.

271
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,060
Our world is just like that.

272
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,420
The strong will bully and the weak will be bullied.

273
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,320
Understood, Little Monk?

274
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,300
If you want a peaceful and happy life, you need to be the world's best.

275
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,020
Mortals who obsess will get greedy at everything.

276
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,280
Such is desire.

277
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,080
Wise men who seek truth will accept the way things are and adapt to fate.

278
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,060
All who have a form are suffering. Who shall know true peace?

279
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,400
As the Buddhist texts go, to desire is to suffer, to relinquish is to enrapture.

280
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'll kill you with one hit and let's see if what you said holds true.

281
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,900
That'd be my emancipation.

282
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,040
Stupid monk.

283
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,140
Little Monk, it's past 1:00 p.m. now.

284
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,200
I have feasted.

285
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,100
This is for you.

286
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,720
Amitabha.

287
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,140
Repent. Repent.

288
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,220
This is for your own good.

289
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,900
Swallow it.

290
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,940
Little Monk, one of the Buddhist precepts, the denunciation of meat and blood.

291
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,260
That's down the drain, isn't it?

292
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,200
Since you have already broke one, let's break another precept.

293
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,820
Just so you know, I will never let go of anyone

294
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,200
who crosses me.

295
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,280
I just want you to never be a monk.

296
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,841
You! You are...

297
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,440
As the Buddhist texts go, to desire is to suffer, to relinquish is to enrapture.

298
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,000
You want to follow the Buddhist codes of conduct.

299
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,840
That's to want.

300
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,000
If you can't get it, you feel unfulfilled.

301
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,840
You should accept things the way they are and adapt to them.

302
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,600
Observe the rules if you can but don't sweat it if you can't.

303
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,060
That's to relinquish.

304
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,100
Understood?

305
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,820
You can speak now.

306
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,420
To not worry amidst hardship is the root of all wisdom.

307
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,980
When you wish to quit your journey,

308
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,660
think of the cycle of reincarnation.

309
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,760
Are you done?

310
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,220
You broke the code, you drank the blood. No need to recite the Buddhist text.

311
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,400
You forced me to!

312
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,280
It wasn't my intention. It doesn't count!

313
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,400
If no one forced you, you would never ever break the code?

314
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,540
I am disciplined. I will never break the Buddhist codes!

315
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,740
Let's see how long you can last.

316
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,660
Madam, you will master your technique soon.

317
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,780
You don't need me anymore.

318
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,660
I bid you farewell.

319
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,180
Madam, you don't want me to leave.

320
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,040
But can you at least let me go out

321
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,180
to find some rice or vegetables to fill my belly?

322
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,100
I am starving.

323
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,813
You're starving?

324
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,360
Fine.

325
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,260
Go find something to eat.

326
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,860
- Really?
- Go ahead.

327
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,300
Thanks, Madam.

328
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,260
Madam, didn't we agree that

329
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,260
you'd seal my acupoints when I stand upright?

330
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,800
I think you're standing quite nicely there.

331
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,273
Come.

332
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,300
Braised pork.

333
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,700
Steamed chicken.

334
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,520
Sweet and sour carp.

335
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,240
They are delicious. Eat them.

336
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,620
Eat. You'll die if you don't.

337
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,020
Will you eat or not?

338
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,221
- No.
- Really?

339
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:27,160
I'd rather die than eat them.

340
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,400
Fine.

341
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,360
If you won't eat, I'll eat them.

342
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,400
It smells divine.

343
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,973
Madam.

344
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,153
Madam.

345
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,940
Madam, people at birth are naturally kind.

346
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,560
Their natures are similar but their habits set them apart.

347
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,240
Have mercy, Madam.

348
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,360
Please let me out.

349
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,800
Amitabha.

350
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,520
Kind brother, who are you?

351
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,290
I made a mistake.

352
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,140
I made a huge mistake.

353
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,180
Why do you think so?

354
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,460
Kind brother. Kind brother!

355
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,060
Kind brother!

356
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:49,180
Don't leave. Don't leave!

357
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,140
Little Monk, how are you feeling?

358
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:43,280
Little Monk, so isn't abstinence one of the Buddhist codes of conduct?

359
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:49,360
Did you violate the code yourself or did I force you this time?

360
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,201
You're a hypocritical, dirty-minded monk. Tell me then.

361
00:32:57,201 --> 00:33:00,500
Tell me then. Who won this time? You or me?

362
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,133
I...

363
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,860
Dear Buddha, I, Xu Zhu, have committed grave sins.

364
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,310
I ruined everyone including myself.

365
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,720
I don't deserve to live.

366
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,850
What are you doing?

367
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:26,640
You want to die?

368
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,280
If every monk kills himself upon breaking a code,

369
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,880
then there would be no monk in this world.

370
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,180
Don't pull this trick on me. Ask yourself.

371
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,510
Do you not miss that girl at all?

372
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,753
Madam, who was she?

373
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,080
She's 17 years old,

374
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,460
an elegant but unmarried lady.

375
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,040
You two were made for each other.

376
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Do you miss her?

377
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,352
Madam, I'm hungry.

378
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,040
Dear Buddha, I shoulder heavy sins.

379
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,680
First, I joined another sect.

380
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,760
Then, I killed someone.

381
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,980
Now, I broke the lust precept.

382
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,340
I cannot call myself a monk anymore.

383
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm just too hungry.

384
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,440
Follow your instinct.

385
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,340
That's how you should do it.

386
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,780
If you stop your sanctimonious act, then I will only treat you better.

387
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,980
Kind brother,

388
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,540
is this real?

389
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,000
Am I dreaming?

390
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,600
It's so real.

391
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,480
Kind brother,

392
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,900
who are you?

393
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,660
I'm...

394
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,760
Don't tell me.

395
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,860
I'm afraid that if you tell me,

396
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,440
I will wake from this dream.

397
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,380
You're my lover in my dream.

398
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,060
Can I call you Mr. Dreamy?

399
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,880
You are my lover in my dream, too.

400
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,880
I'll call you Mrs. Dreamy.

401
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,400
I want to stay in this dream forever.

402
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,780
I don't want to wake up.

403
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,780
Your Highness, the Song sent an emissary to make peace.

404
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,380
They agreed to double their offerings to us

405
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,980
in exchange for our military withdrawal.

406
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,540
I asked you to consult His Majesty about our military withdrawal.

407
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,660
What's his answer?

408
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,580
His Majesty said that we had a resounding victory and the morale was high.

409
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,560
Our enemy had no general left so we should seize this opportunity

410
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,440
to show the Song what we're made of.

411
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,240
If we could conquer more cities and expand our land,

412
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,540
it would be a tremendous feat.

413
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,020
This is not right.

414
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,580
If we attack,

415
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,440
it will mean we've completely disregarded the Peace Accord.

416
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,340
We will be no different from traitors.

417
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:31,120
Our previous victory was due to a surprise tactic.

418
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,400
If we draw arms properly, even if we win,

419
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,160
it will cost us an arm and a leg.

420
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,040
What good will it do to our nation, to our people?

421
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,760
But, Your Highness, if we withdraw now, how will the others regard you?

422
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,720
His Majesty always hopes that you can achieve something great.

423
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,670
- If you...
- I will deal with the consequences myself.

424
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,040
Withdraw now.

425
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,373
I...

426
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,893
Madam.

427
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,900
Was that girl a servant in the palace?

428
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,853
Madam.

429
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,540
Madam, can you kindly tell me, please?

430
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,020
You want to see her?

431
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,280
That's easy.

432
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,800
You two can even be together if you want.

433
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,600
If you grant me this favor, Madam, I won't know how to thank you.

434
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,720
No need to thank me.

435
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,680
It's just that my technique is close to completion.

436
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
These few days are crucial.

437
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,700
If you want to see her,

438
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,920
you'll have to wait until I'm done.

439
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,941
Okay. As you wish, Madam.

440
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,040
Once I master my technique,

441
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,580
I will settle the score with Li Qiushui straight away.

442
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,520
She was never on my level.

443
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,200
However, I was gravely wounded by her.

444
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,560
If I die in her hands

445
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,580
and can't bring you to meet that girl,

446
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
call it fate then.

447
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,040
Unless...

448
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,000
Unless what?

449
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,840
Unless you can help me.

450
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,620
That's easy.

451
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,440
Madam, I'm weak.

452
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,700
How can I help you?

453
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,200
When I fight that wench,

454
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,020
life and death can happen in a blink of an eye.

455
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,600
I'll teach you Six Solar Palms of Tianshan now.

456
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,880
In the pivotal moment of our duel, you just have to tap her shoulder.

457
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,900
With your internal force, she will definitely die.

458
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,693
Madam, by right,

459
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:27,960
as a junior, I should help you.

460
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,570
But if you're using me to kill someone,

461
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:34,540
then I'll bear more sins.

462
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:37,000
If you don't help me,

463
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,020
then you shall never meet that girl again.

464
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,713
Think twice.

465
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,060
Madam, killing someone so that you can be happy is wrong.

466
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,500
If I can't meet that girl anymore,

467
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,720
I'd just gladly accept this as the continuation of my previous love life.

468
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,920
If we're not meant to be together,

469
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,150
then I can't force it either.

470
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,940
Then, get the hell out!

471
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,840
As far as you can.

472
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,200
Take care, Madam.

473
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,020
Madam, what did you throw at me?

474
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,480
It's itchy.

475
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,940
It is the Mortality Talisman.

476
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,680
Once I put it in your body, there's no way to dispel it.

477
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,980
Elder Wu and his cronies staged an uprising against Piaomiao Peak

478
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,560
because they wanted to get rid of their Mortality Talisman.

479
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,960
That's why they went to Lingjiu Palace to find a way to dispel it.

480
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,380
Itchy. Itchy.

481
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,120
Itchy. So itchy.

482
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,360
Mortality. Do you know what it means, Little monk?

483
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,580
Yes.

484
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:07,400
It means I'll live a life worse than death.

485
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,300
Before you left, you told me to take care of myself.

486
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,940
You are a good kid and you once saved me, too.

487
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,040
I am fair and square.

488
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,840
I can reward or punish.

489
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,540
Planting the talisman inside you is a punishment.

490
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,240
Getting rid of it will be your reward.

491
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,760
Madam, I'll tell you this now.

492
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,800
Even if you use the talisman as leverage to ask me to commit atrocities,

493
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,600
I will remain unfazed.

494
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,580
You are resilient.

495
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,980
When I activate the Mortality Talisman,

496
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,580
it'll be increasingly painful and itchy as each day passes.

497
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,520
I send my people to patrol every cave and island every year

498
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,760
to give them the medicine

499
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,800
so that the Mortality Talisman will be suppressed for that year.

500
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:57,860
Then, I'm just being enslaved by you like them?

♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

526
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,850
Dead?

00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,900

528
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,230
I have gone through lots of grievances under your hand.

529
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:37,360

530
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:46,560
What do you want to do?
