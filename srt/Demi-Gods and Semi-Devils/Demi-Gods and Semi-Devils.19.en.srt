13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
Senior, it's empty in Bodhi Temple.

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
There are no scriptures here.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,780
Why did Master ask us to guard here,

16
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,279
and he said we have to avoid the enemy from robbing?

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,679
This is the secret of Bodhi Temple.

18
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,440
Don't say too much.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,639
Are you sure, Senior?

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,759
From what I see, you don't know much about it either. Right?

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,119
How would I not know?

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,140
Life is like a dream.

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,060
What does that mean?

24
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,540
Junior Zhi Qing.

25
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,279
You don't talk so much normally.

26
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,700
Why are you so talkative today?

27
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,680
Forget about it then.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,560
I am going to the back to ease myself.

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,979
Zhi Qing, what are you doing?

30
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,580
Master.

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,980

Where did he hide? Come on!  Let's go over to that side.

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,739
What has happened?

40
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,639
This villian Qiao Feng has caused trouble again.

41
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,880
It's Zhi Zhan and Martial Uncle Zhi Yuan.

42
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,859
Oh no. Qiao Feng has stolen the scripture.

43
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,259
Hurry up. Report to the abbot now.

44
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:37,200
Yes.

45
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,380
They've blamed me again.

46
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,780
Greetings to Abbot.

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,160
Was it done by Qiao Feng?

48
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,079
How did he know about the secret of this scripture?

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,319
It wasn't Qiao Feng.

50
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,879
It's... It's Zhi Qing.

51
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,419
Come here. Come here.

52
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,700
Tell us.

53
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,020
Why did you frame the other apprentices?

54
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
Why are you pulling me?

55
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,399
You knocked the five of us down and stole the scripture.

56
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,979
Abbot, he deceived us into coming here and stole the scripture.

57
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:46,620
I have been by Abbot's side this whole time.

58
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,919
How is it possible for me to steal the scripture?

59
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,479
Zhi Qing fabricated the order of Master

60
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,400
and deceived us into coming here.

61
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,039
Then, he tricked us for the secret of the temple.

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,850
It was me who spilled out the words accidentally.

63
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,020
Next, he attacked us from behind

64
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,010
as he took a tinkle and then stole the scripture.

65
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,599
Did you see clearly it was Zhi Qing?

66
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,279
Abbot, we have no grudge against Zhi Qing.

67
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,380
We wouldn't frame him.

68
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,000
There must be something else to this story.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,759
Zhi Qing has been with me this whole time and never left.

70
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,279
Certainly. I did witness Zhi Qing accompany Senior.

71
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,399
How could he come here to steal the scripture?

72
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,240
Zhi Zhan.

73
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:40,500
Did you find anything peculiar while fighting with him?

74
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,999
I forgot about this.

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,719
He didn't use the martial arts of our temple while fighting.

76
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,739
Can you tell the clan of the skill he used?

77
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:52,880
His martial art was very vicious.

78
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
It's definitely not from Shaolin.

79
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,480
Martial Uncles, having said that,

80
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,020
Martial Uncle Zhi Qing had asked me the whereabouts of Bodhi Temple.

81
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,380
I felt it was a little weird at the time.

82
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,679
He entered the temple before me.

83
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,039
He should know where it is.

84
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,819
But when I recall now, he probably wasn't this Martial Uncle Zhi Qing.

85
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,919
Today, an invincible enemy came to the temple.

86
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,299
He tricked us and caused confusion amongst us.

87
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:51,420
Now, we can only investigate as fast as we can

88
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,680
and stay calm at the same time so as to not disturb the other monks.

89
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,979
I'm afraid the trouble has become hard to deal with.

90
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,740
The scripture that reposed in the temple

91
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,920
is Mahayana Sutra which was penned by the senior prestigious monk.

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,459
If the disciple of the Buddha possesses it and studies it, they will have benefitted from it.

93
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:23,179
If laymen possess it and do not respect it, it's quite a serious sin.

94
00:08:23,179 --> 00:08:27,659
Every junior, do return to your place to rest;

95
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:31,300
and for those who are on duty, do proceed.

96
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,080
Yes.

97
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,220
Amitabha.

98
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,340
It's our sin. It's our sin.

99
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,839
This... Qiao Feng is over there.

100
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,200
Report to Abbot right now.  I'll keep an eye on him.

101
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,670
Okay.

102
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,060
Qiao Feng!

103
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,240
Faster!

104
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,820
Hurry!

105
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,760
I wonder who you are, Senior.

106
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,780
Thank you in advance.

107
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
Qiao...

108
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,580
Over there! Hurry up!

109
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,000
Faster!

110
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,199
Hurry up!

111
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,980
Qiao Feng!

112
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,400
- Pull him up.
- Yes.

113
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,560
He's fine.

114
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,059
Qiao Feng is already a hard problem.

115
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,639
I wonder what the identity of the two men in black is.

116
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,799
They broke into Shaolin Temple in the night. What's their intention?

117
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,980
According to Zhi Zhan,

118
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,140
the two of them seem from different sides.

119
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,699
The awful Qiao Feng not only has stolen Yijin Jing and hurt many of our apprentices.

120
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,479
He's so unpredictable. It's frightening.

121
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,620
No.

122
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,540
That's not the case.

123
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,300
Do you feel any discomfort?

124
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,539
Abbot, I'm all right.

125
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,060
I wasn't beaten by Mr. Qiao,

126
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,600
it was the man in black instead.

127
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,079
I wanted to stop Mr. Qiao.

128
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,559
That time, there was a palm power blustered over

129
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,639
and it was Mr. Qiao who saved me.

130
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,440
I reckon Mr. Qiao didn't mean to harm anyone.

131
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,799
Because he doesn't look like that kind of person.

132
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,439
What kind of person?

133
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,039
The one who killed his foster parents or the one who beat Junior Xuan Ku,

134
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,119
or the one who hurt people to steal the scripture?

135
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,439
If he doesn't know the man in black, why did that person help him?

136
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:59,739
If Mr. Qiao intended to harm people,

137
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:03,359
perhaps Xu Zhu and the other seniors and juniors

138
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,780
wouldn't have come back alive.

139
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,460
Even if that is so,

140
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,960
we had witnessed

141
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,099
he hurt Junior Xuan Ku and covered up for the thief of the scripture.

142
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:18,159
But Master said that "A leopard can't change its spots."

143
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,659
Mr. Qiao was a respectful hero who was upright and frank back then.

144
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:28,359
If Mr. Qiao did intend to harm Reverend Xuan Ku,

145
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:33,360
why did he seek trouble for himself to call all reverends over?

146
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,479
Qiao Feng is a Khitan whose nature is cruel.

147
00:15:36,479 --> 00:15:38,799
Did he need a reason to commit all these?

148
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,540
I...

149
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,360
This matter is highly suspicious.

150
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,740
But if it was really done by Qiao Feng,

151
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,219
it's necessary to announce to the pugilistic world and alert them to be careful

152
00:15:57,219 --> 00:16:00,399
as he's too vicious.

153
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

154
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,140
Don't die.

155
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,519
I have countless questions in my mind to ask you.

156
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,880
You can't just die like that.

157
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,000
It's a woman.

158
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,910
Regardless of whether it's a guy or a lady, good or bad,

159
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,590
I can't let her die.

160
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,880
Miss A'Zhu?

161
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,899
Chief Qiao.

162
00:17:09,899 --> 00:17:11,560
Come.

163
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,860
Miss A'Zhu.

164
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,759
You were hurt by the palm power of Abbot Xuan Ci.

165
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,839
You're severely injured. It's very dangerous.

166
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,799
I'll bring you to the town for treatment right now.

167
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,080
I have the medicine.

168
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,640
This one?

169
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,619
Miss A'Zhu, it's crucial to save you now.

170
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,420
I don't mean to offend you.

171
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,959
Finally, we're almost home.

172
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,599
I've sent a message through a pigeon for the servants to fetch you.

173
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,839
This way-worn journey really made you suffer.

174
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,220
I'm fine.

175
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,579
But I wonder whether cousin is safe.

176
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:59,479
She's going to see her lover Murong Fu.

177
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,759
Am I going to stand aside and watch them being affectionate?

178
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:10,179
Am I so great that I can keep my poker face and speak politely?

179
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,860
Young Master Duan.

180
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,019
I was thinking that it's my honor to meet with Young Master Murong as he's so well-known.

181
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,180
Young Master.

182
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,460
Who wants to see me so eagerly?

183
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,560
Cousin.

184
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,040
He's the Young Master Murong that Miss Wang always thinks of.

185
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,959
He's truly good-looking and charming.

186
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,720
Miss Wang has got it right.

187
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,940
Young Master has already come back.

188
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,279
When did you come back?

189
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,240
I was just one step ahead of you.

190
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,500
I specially came to fetch you after receiving A'Bi's message.

191
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,379
But why did aunt allow you to come out for so long?

192
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,700
Of course not.

193
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,759
Miss Wang went out without telling Madam Wang.

194
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,259
Once she heard that you were insulted,

195
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,999
she followed us to search for you instantly.

196
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,159
She was worried that you'd be harmed.

197
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,040
A'Bi.

198
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,319
Well. I'll stop now.

199
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,439
By the way, Cousin,

200
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,119
what's the situation in Shaolin Temple?

201
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,599
Did the monks trouble you?

202
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,439
The issue of Shaolin has already ended.

203
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,039
Abbot Xuan Ci has proved

204
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,220
that the death of Reverend Xuan Bei has nothing to do with me.

205
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,720
You're tired after traveling, right?

206
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,939
Let's find an inn to get some rest and eat something first.

207
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,580
Let's go.

208
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,459
Illness can be cured, but not life.

209
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,660
This lady is in grave danger now.

210
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,020
Her situation is very critical.

211
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,840
Physician, can she really not be treated?

212
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,679
I'm not capable of curing her.

213
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,420
I'll leave then.

214
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,660
Thank you.

215
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,719
Miss A'Zhu.

216
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,839
Chief Qiao.

217
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,980
Are you feeling better now?

218
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,119
I'm better now.

219
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,440
Chief Qiao, thank you so much.

220
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,120
If it wasn't for you, I would have died earlier.

221
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,059
Besides, just call me A'Zhu.

222
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,580
I'm also not... Chief Qiao anymore.

223
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,920
Don't call me Chief Qiao either.

224
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,559
May I call you Brother Qiao?

225
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,240
Sure.

226
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,599
Right,

227
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,279
why did you go to Shaolin Temple?

228
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,160
I...

229
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,480
If I tell you, don't laugh at me.

230
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,899
Just tell, I won't laugh at you.

231
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,639
I heard that my young master had gone to Shaolin Temple.

232
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,860
So, I went to search for him.

233
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,220
But once I entered the gate of Shaolin Temple,

234
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,299
the monk called Zhi Qing

235
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,619
insisted that women aren't allowed to enter the temple.

236
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:12,119
I was so angry.

237
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,279
Then, I argued with him.

238
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,460
He said that women couldn't go in,

239
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,159
and women...

240
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,039
Anyway, he looked down on women.

241
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,520
I truly couldn't stand it.

242
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,000
So, I purposely went in

243
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,799
and disguised as him

244
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,460
just to see how he would deal with me.

245
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,279
You should go in

246
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,519
and show your face to the monks.

247
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,700
After I've recovered, I'll disguise myself as a guy

248
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,580
and then change back into a lady's costume

249
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,939
and parade into the Mahavira Hall and sit at the center.

250
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:47,519
My anger will only be relieved

251
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,919
if the monks get agitated.

252
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,540
Miss A'Zhu.

253
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,020
Sorry.

254
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,199
Why did I fall asleep while talking?

255
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,639
You haven't recovered yet, get some rest.

256
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,460
I'm not tired.

257
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,559
But you've stayed up for a night.

258
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,200
Perhaps you could return to rest.

259
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,779
Sure. Then, I'll come later.

260
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,720
Please enjoy yourself, Young Master. The dishes are almost ready.

261
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,800
Thank you.

262
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,300
Miss Wang.

263
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,960
- Cousin.
- Have a seat.

264
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,620
This is Young Master Duan, right?

265
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,140
I'm Duan Yu.

266
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,899
I heard Cousin say you're kind and treated her especially well.

267
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,279
Not really.

268
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,759
It's not just especially well, but extremely well.

269
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,759
I've traveled in the pugilistic world for years,

270
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,679
I've never seen such a thick-skinned one like him.

271
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,239
He was just tagging along wherever we went.

272
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:46,940
I couldn't talk freely.

273
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,399
Third Brother,

274
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,619
Young Master Duan was worried as we're all women,

275
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,339
and it's not safe to travel alone.

276
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,879
That's why he stayed with us all the way.

277
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,839
That's right. The journey was really dangerous.

278
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,759
We were almost captured by a Xixia warrior mid-way.

279
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,119
If it wasn't Young Master Duan who saved us,

280
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,680
I wouldn't have been able to get back safely.

281
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,999
If that's the case, I would like to express my gratitude to you on my cousin's behalf.

282
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,239
Young Master Duan, you're from Dali. Right?

283
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,180
I wonder if you are married?

284
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,799
No. Only my parents are at home.

285
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,079
As the saying goes, "Never travel far as the parents are still alive."

286
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,740
You seem to be a scholar,

287
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,359
how could you stay outside for long and let your parents worry?

288
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:32,759
Besides, my cousin has already gathered with us.

289
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,599
We'll return to Swallow's Nest soon.

290
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,240
You don't have to worry anymore.

291
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,300
Perhaps you want to visit Swallow's Nest?

292
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,959
Based on the code of ethics of the Murong family,

293
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,020
we should invite you for a stay.

294
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,239
However, I was harmed several times recently.

295
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,239
Those who seek revenge keep coming.

296
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,420
It's bad that you might get hurt

297
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,479
if you go back with us.

298
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:01,360
Therefore...

299
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,240
If so,

300
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,560
- Young Master Murong...
- Young Master Duan.

301
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,379
Cousin, come here. I have something to tell you.

302
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,880
Cousin.

303
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,580
What do you want to tell me?

304
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,140
What you've said just now was quite harsh.

305
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,879
When I was at the dyehouse,

306
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,759
it was Young Master Duan who saved me from danger.

307
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,980
Otherwise, I might not have been able to meet you here.

308
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,160
Why do you make it difficult for him?

309
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,460
You're so protective over him yet you said you had no feelings for him?

310
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,560
I've clarified at the dyehouse, I have no affection for him.

311
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,319
If so, why were you so protective over him that day?

312
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,620
Cousin.

313
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,239
I knew it was you that day.

314
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,319
I don't necessarily feel I've wronged you

315
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,060
to kowtow when you see me.

316
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,879
If once I were the emperor of the mainland,

317
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,299
would you kowtow once you met me?

318
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,579
When did you discover it?

319
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:05,319
That day, Li Yanzong

320
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,919
used seventeen different kinds of martial arts from seventeen clans when he appeared,

321
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:11,260
it's obvious that he didn't want his identity exposed.

322
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,199
So, I didn't think too much of it.

323
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,839
But he intended to disgrace Young Master Duan instead of killing him.

324
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,980
I was suspicious about it.

325
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,619
Hence, I realized that his facial expression was incompatible with his emotion.

326
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,519
Probably some methods were used to cover up his real countenance.

327
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,940
You shouldn't have guessed it was me though.

328
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,479
I started to doubt it when "kowtow" and "emperor" were mentioned.

329
00:29:36,479 --> 00:29:39,519
I purposely praised Chief Qiao

330
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,559
and said that Young Master Duan's martial art skill

331
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,240
might surpass his.

332
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,340
That was a test for you.

333
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,479
Afterward, you didn't kill us

334
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,559
but left us the antidote of Teary and Limpy Breeze.

335
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,620
This proved my doubt.

336
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,800
You really are smart.

337
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,920
But there's one thing I don't understand.

338
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,339
Since you've come, why did you hide your whereabouts

339
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:12,940
and purposely disguise as the Xixia warrior?

340
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,900
I bumped into Third Brother Bao that day.

341
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,239
I wanted to check out the situation of the Beggars' Sect.

342
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,539
But while I was on the way, I spotted the Xixia warrior poison people secretly.

343
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:28,560
And I heard a general mention that they wanted to capture a young lady who knows martial arts.

344
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,340
I guessed it must have been you.

345
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,219
So, I killed the young warrior and disguised as him to mix into them.

346
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:36,500
I planned to show up to save you.

347
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,340
But your clothes were not properly dressed

348
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,200
and you stayed close with that brat

349
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,780
saying that you wanted to help him get revenge.

350
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,840
I shouldn't tell you these things.

351
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,439
I'm a descendant of the Murong family.

352
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,340
I should prioritize the mission of restoring the kingdom

353
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,300
rather than these trivial matters.

354
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Cousin.

355
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,660
I'm very happy about what you've done.

356
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,800
Since young, you've always protected me like a child.

357
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,439
But I didn't know that you're very concerned about me.

358
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,279
Yuyan...

359
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,039
No worries, Cousin.

360
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,080
Since you're concerned about me,

361
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,080
I won't displease you.

362
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,559
Young Master Duan.

363
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,879
Miss Wang.

364
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,039
I'll never forget your grace for saving me.

365
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,260
But I'm returning to Swallow's Nest with Cousin now.

366
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,759
It's improper for a man and a lady

367
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,939
without family relations to travel together again.

368
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:14,040
Let's bid farewell to each other.

369
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,040
If there's a chance in the future,

370
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,039
I'll definitely repay your grace.

371
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,740
Miss Wang...

372
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,460
Never mind.

373
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,980
I intended...

374
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,560
I should have returned home earlier.

375
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,160
Well, Miss Wang...

376
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,020
Farewell.

377
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,560
Here's the food.

378
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,580
Enjoy yourselves.

379
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm leaving.

380
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,960
Take care.

381
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,280
- Brother Qiao.
- You're awake?

382
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,879
Brother Qiao, what's the time now?

383
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,520
Why did I sleep for so long?

384
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,300
You're weak now.

385
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,258
I'll help you sit up to take some food.

386
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,120
Here.

387
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,739
Here.

388
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,060
Brother Qiao.

389
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,539
My injury is severe, even magical medicine from Mr. Tan can't cure me. Am I right?

390
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,079
You're fine. You'll get better after some rest.

391
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:14,340
Stop hiding it from me. I already know.

392
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,239
Just rest well to recover.

393
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,440
I'll find a way to cure you.

394
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,560
Here.

395
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,900
What's wrong?

396
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,700
Brother Qiao.

397
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,880
Am I going to die?

398
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,260
Stop thinking all that nonsense.

399
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,500
It's just a small injury.

400
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,879
You'll be fine.

401
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,520
Are you lying to me again?

402
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,120
I was once the chief of Beggar's Sect.

403
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,320
My words do count.

404
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,020
You're the famous hero in the pugilistic world

405
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,660
and are on par with my young master.

406
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,840
You wouldn't lie to me.

407
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,080
Brother Qiao.

408
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,560
May I ask you a favor?

409
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,920
Yes.

410
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,920
Could you not leave tonight?

411
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,140
Stay here with me.

412
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,980
I'll stay here even if you didn't ask.

413
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,440
Stop crying.

414
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,960
Eat more.

415
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,040
Miss Wang, Young Master Duan hasn't left yet.

416
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,080
I saw him staring here sadly from the yard.

417
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,780
I feel... that he's quite pitiful.

418
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,720
I know how it feels when liking someone.

419
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,079
Since I can't respond to him,

420
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,400
I shouldn't let him misunderstand me.

421
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,059
Besides, I don't wish to displease Cousin.

422
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:47,679
You're truly sincere to Young Master.

423
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,179
Previously, Mother always said that no good man exists in the world.

424
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:54,559
I know nothing about other men

425
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,399
as I always stay in Mandarava Villa.

426
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,999
I only know that Cousin is definitely not a flirtatious guy.

427
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,900
I only wish that his wish could be granted

428
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,339
and not be troubled with the matters of restoring the kingdom every day.

429
00:38:10,339 --> 00:38:17,799
Honestly, I don't care for the restoration of the kingdom as long as he's happy.

430
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,119
Restoration has been the ambition of Young Master since young.

431
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,599
He would definitely strive for it.

432
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,000
Back then, I was a frog in the shallow well

433
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,119
who only thought that Cousin was the only hero in the world.

434
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:36,819
But I just realized that there are many more since I've gone out.

435
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,820
Putting other things aside,

436
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,560
Chief Qiao's martial arts arebetter than Cousin.

437
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,239
Also, Young Master Duan's Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves

438
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,939
and Six Pulse Excalibur can't be underestimated as well.

439
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,879
Although Cousin is strong,

440
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,040
however, how could he win against all the heroes of the world?

441
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,579
Restoring Yan isn't an easy task.

442
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,420
Brother Qiao, I can't sleep.

443
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,540
Back then, when I couldn't fall asleep,

444
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,340
my mother would sit by the bed

445
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,700
and sing me songs.

446
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,660
I would fall asleep while she was singing.

447
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,599
Where can I find your mother now?

448
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,220
I don't know where my parents are.

449
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:42,080
Nor whether they're alive.

450
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,800
Brother Qiao, please sing me a song.

451
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,600
Me?

452
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,600
I can't sing.

453
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,100
How about storytelling?

454
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,400
All right.

455
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,300
Once upon a time, there was an old man walking in the mountain.

456
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:10,359
Later, he saw a wolf who was tied up in the bag.

457
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:12,079
Later, that wolf...

458
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:13,999
This is the story of The Wolf of Mount Zhong.

459
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:15,620
I don't want to listen to it.

460
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,880
Other stories, please.

461
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,980
Then... I'll tell you a story about a village kid.

462
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,179
Once upon a time, in the mountains, there was a poor family.

463
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,959
With only one child.

464
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,059
One day, the father got sick.

465
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:40,700
The mother then sold some chickens

466
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,240
and a basket of eggs from the house and got four taels

467
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,599
to seek a physician for the father.

468
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,539
Physician, my husband's sickness is getting serious.

469
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:56,559
Can you please come and take a look?

470
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,240
Your house is at least 20 li far from the town.

471
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,360
It's not only tiring

472
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,680
but also affecting my business for the day.

473
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,700
Find another physician.

474
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,460
Physician, you're the most skillful physician here.

475
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,459
Please take a look.

476
00:41:16,459 --> 00:41:19,939
For the sake of me and my son, please.

477
00:41:19,939 --> 00:41:22,820
I beg of you. I beg of you.

478
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,479
I've told you, I'm not going. I mean it.

479
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:27,720
I might be stuck with misfortune

480
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,080
if I treat you poor people there.

481
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,000
Besides,

482
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:38,479
these four taels aren't enough for the treatment.

483
00:41:38,479 --> 00:41:41,300
It's the only money we have.

484
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,700
Please save him as he is a precious life.

485
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,660
Let go of me.

486
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,739
- I beg of you.
- I said let go of me.

487
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,000
Mother!

488
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,040
Mother! Mother!

489
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,739
My robe was just newly sewn.

490
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:55,399
- It worths two maces.
- Mother.

491
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,039
- Pay me. Pay me.
- Mother.

492
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,319
You little brat. How dare you!

493
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,279
Feng'er! Feng'er!

494
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,240
Feng'er!

495
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,360
My son.

496
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,160
Feng'er!

497
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,559
This physician was too vicious.

498
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,480
What happens next?

499
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,280
On the way home, they passed by a smithery.

500
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,800
That kid saw some sharp knives on the table.

501
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,599
He then stole one and hid it.

502
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,079
When they had reached home,

503
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,319
the mother wanted to take out the money

504
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:43,180
yet it had disappeared.

505
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,879
Was it being stolen by a thief?

506
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,940
Maybe yes.

507
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,600
Maybe the money just dropped accidentally

508
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,680
when the physician pushed her.

509
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,199
The mother then wanted to ask the child.

510
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,919
She then saw the child was sharpening the knife on a stone.

♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

533
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,640
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

534
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,280
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

535
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:20,980
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

536
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,100
[Jucan Manor]

537
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,370
So it was Mr. and Mrs. Tan.

538

539
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,130
Greetings.

540
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,600

It's Qiao Feng.
