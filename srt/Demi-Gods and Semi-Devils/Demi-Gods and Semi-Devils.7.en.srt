Is anyone here?

18
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,980
Help!

Someone come here!

20
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,020
Help!

21
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,380
Coming.

22
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,460
Why are you playing tantrums here?

23
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,739
Why are you hugging him?

24
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:18,220
- Mother.
- Let go of him!

Sister Wan, don't be rude.

26
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,920
You're a nun, aren't you embarrassed?

27
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,520
Young lady, what nonsense are you talking about?

28
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,959
What's your relationship with him?

29
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,619
We are engaged, which means I'm his wife.

30
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,680
Is it true?

31
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,500
Or is it not?

32
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,759
Mother...  I...

33
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,799
You didn't learn even half of your father's martial arts,

34
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,279
but you learned his dissolute behavior.

35
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,020
Watch how I'm going to break your leg.

36
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,900
Mother.

37
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,600
This girl is really pretty.

38
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,680
She's just a little wild.

39
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,040
She needs to be guided.

40
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,719
What does my wildness have got to do with you?

41
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,020
If you don't let go of him,

42
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,940
I'll take action against you!

43
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,159
I would like to see what action you're going to take.

44
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:08,519
- You...
- Sister Wan.

45
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,479
No!

46
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,640
Do you know who she is?

47
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,720
Mother, please don't be mad.

48
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,919
Is she... Is she your mother?

49
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:23,959
I called her mother, didn't you hear that?

50
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,720
Mother, this is Miss Mu, Mu Wanqing.

51
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,639
I've encountered danger these few days.

52
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,899
Fortunately, Miss Mu saved my life a few times.

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Hello, Aunt.

54
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,760
Greetings Yu Xu San Ren.

55
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,820
Mother.

56
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,940
Fourth Brother Zhu has been trying to bring me back.

57
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,239
I don't want to go back.

58
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,359
I just want to stay with you here.

59
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,619
Yu Xu San Ren, the four evils are gathered at Dali.

60
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,159
I heard that they are coming after the prince.

61
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,620
I'm afraid that this place is not safe.

62
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,159
Please return to the residence with Young Master

63
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,720
and wait until we get rid of the four of them.

64
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,800
What's the purpose of going back?

65
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
If I can't fight the four evils,

66
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,880
it's all right to die.

67
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,000
Why shall I go back and be troubled?

68
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,340
Mother, if you're unwilling to go back,

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,879
I'll stay here with you.

70
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,460
All right?

71
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,859
Brother Zhu, go back and tell my uncle and father

72
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:35,199
that my mother and I will stay here and fight the four evils.

73
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,360
Yes.

74
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,039
Don't you feel embarrassed?

75
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,219
What are the abilities that enable you to fight the four evils with me?

76
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:44,300
Mother.

77
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,600
I can help you defend the enemy.

78
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,320
Thank you, Miss Wu.

79
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,300
Run!

80
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,780
It's my second brother!

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,559
Both of you stay here.

82
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,480
I'll go take a look.

83
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
I'll go too.

84
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,819
Sister Wan, didn't you hear what mother said?

85
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:08,959
She told us to wait here.

86
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,879
Furthermore, you have injuries.

87
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Don't go.

88
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,060
Are you worried about me?

89
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,479
We are engaged.

90
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,860
Of course, I care about you.

91
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,699
Also, even if you're not injured,

92
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,619
I'm here. I can't let you take any risks.

93
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,319
Third brother!

94
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,580
Yu Xu San Ren.

95
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,639
What happened?

96
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,999
We were ordered to go after the four evils.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,220
When I was fighting with that guy,

98
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,919
Second Madam Ye made a sneak attack unexpectedly.

99
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,319
She hit me on my back but I think I'm fine.

100
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,580
Get up.

101
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,959
Si Gui, how is your injury?

102
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,239
I'm not skillful enough. I'm truly sorry.

103
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:59,280
Sorry for making you worried, Your Highness.

104
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,079
The enemies had left probably because they thought there was an ambush here.

105
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,420
Why do you still call me Your Highness?

106
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,359
Anyway, go in and bandage your wound.

107
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:10,399
Yu Xu San Ren,

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,720
the four evils are approaching.

109
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,319
It's very dangerous. Please go back now, Madam.

110
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,840
I've decided not to go back anymore for the rest of my life.

111
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,659
In that case, we shall guard outside Yu Xu Temple.

112
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,180
Second Brother, report immediately

113
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,879
that we will protect Yu Xu San Ren and Young Master

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,060
at Yu Xu Temple with our lives.

115
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,500
Yes.

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,120
Hold on.

117
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:39,699
I can't let everyone take this risk with me.

118
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,440
From today onwards, we will return to Dali together.

119
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,200
Yes.

120
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,160
Grand Martial Uncle, the road here is rugged.

121
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,340
I'll support you.

122
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,680
Xu Zhu, when did you join Shaolin?

123
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,160
Grand Martial Uncle, I've been an orphan since young.

124
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,799
Thankfully, the abbot found me in the mountain and brought me back to the temple.

125
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,900
I grew up in the temple.

126
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
I see.

127
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,779
Have you ever gone out?

128
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:16,200
Grand Martial Uncle,

129
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,800
other than going down the mountain to buy supplies,

130
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,480
this is my first time going out.

131
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,240
Grand Martial Uncle,

132
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,859
the abbot always says that there is always someone

133
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,400
who is better than us.

134
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,679
That day, I saw that when Master Qiao struck out,

135
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,700
even Young Master Murong was no match for him.

136
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,199
So, in the martial arts world,

137
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,879
is there anyone greater than Master Qiao?

138
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,279
Of course.

139
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,559
Each age brings forth talented people.

140
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,440
Even though Master Qiao's Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms is impressive,

141
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,439
but in terms of extensiveness,

142
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,200
my Shaolin is equally great.

143
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,639
The Murong Clan, Dali's Duan family,

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,320
as well as the Western region and northern Xinjiang.

145
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,420
There are strange sects everywhere.

146
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,599
If I didn't witness these with my own eyes,

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I wouldn't dare to think of it.

148
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,800
Why?

149
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,200
Are you interested to learn martial arts?

150
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,200
I know about myself. I'm not talented.

151
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
I won't be able to learn these advanced skills.

152
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,500
I'm just envious of their skillful abilities.

153
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,800
They are capable of doing things that normal people cannot.

154
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,200
For instance, when fighting the Liao Army,

155
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Master Qiao and the seniors had contributed greatly.

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,200
However, one's martial arts is not the only standard

157
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
to determine his or her ability.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,900
Take the farmers as an example.

159
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,000
Without them,

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,600
how can we have fruits and vegetables to eat every day?

161
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Although you are weak in martial arts,

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but you have a positive mind.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
The fact that you're able to see other people's strengths

164
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,100
is already much greater than many other people.

165
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't belittle yourself.

166
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,500
Yes.

[Zhennan; Save the country]

168

[Save the country, General Duan]

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,300
Prince Zhennan,

the great general who protects the country.

171
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,800
It's so festive.

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,400
You'll meet your father-in-law shortly.

173
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,400
Father!

174
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,300
Mother is back.

175
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,200
Father, Mother is back.

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,600
Madam.

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,700
Mother.

178
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,000
Yu'er, you're really mischievous.

179
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
You left home for so long

180
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
and caused your uncle to be injured.

181
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm going to break your legs.

182
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
Come!

183
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Bring Si Gui inside and treat him.

184
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Thank you, Your Highness.

185
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,200
Father, if I hadn't made this trip,

186
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
I couldn't have brought Mother back.

187
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Hence, can this atone for my mistake?

188
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,200
Even if I don't punish you,

189
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,400
your uncle won't let you go.

190
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,700
Madam, are you still mad at me?

191
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
When we get home,

192
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,800
I'll make up for my mistakes.

193
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I don't want to go home.

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,600
I want to enter the palace.

195
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Let's go to the palace first

196
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,200
and meet uncle and aunt. Then we can see what to do next.

197
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,800
Furthermore, Mother, considering the fact that I left home without my father knowing,

198
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,000
I think Father won't plead for mercy for me.

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Please say something good about me.

200
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
You little kid.

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
You get more immature as you grow older.

202
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,800
You need to be disciplined by your uncle.

203
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
No way. If the son is beaten,

204
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,800
the mother will feel the pain in her heart.

205
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,200
Let's not do this, shall we?

206
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,400
Also, my mother is so good-looking,

207
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,000
just like Buddhas in Guanyin paintings.

208
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,800
- How could you let me suffer?
- Yes.

209
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,100
How dare you tease your mother.

210
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,500
In fact, Miss Mu is the prettiest lady in the world.

211
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,400
Who is this young lady?

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,200
Father.

213
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,400
Father, this is Miss Mu, Mu Wanqing.

214
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
Father.

215
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Your Highness.

216
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
The emperor and empress are waiting at the mansion.

217
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,100
Your Highness, please make a move to the mansion now.

218
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,599
Sounds good.

219
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,300
Madam, come home with me.

220
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,050
Let's go.

221
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,020
[Dali]

222
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,260
[General Duan]

223
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,320
Welcome back, Princess Consort.

224
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,890
[Prince Zhennan Manor]

225
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,700
Sister Wan, please sit here for a while.

226
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,400
I'll come out and accompany you after greeting my uncle and aunt.

227
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,720
[National pillar]

228
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
Young lady, please have some tea.

229
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,600
Why don't both of you sit?

230
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,800
It's not appropriate for officials like us to sit.

231
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000
Please help yourself, Miss Mu.

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There are so many strange rules.

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,200
When is Duan Yu coming out?

234
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,500
Miss Mu, please calm down.

235
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,800
The young prince will be back soon.

236
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,700
Young prince? Who?

237
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,200
Our young master is the son of Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom.

238
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,300
Isn't he the young prince?

239
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
Here's an imperial order.

240
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,440
- Zhu Danchen, Gu Ducheng, and Mu Wanqing are to present themselves at the palace.
- Yes.

241
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,100
You didn't use Miss to address me.

242
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
How dare you call me so informally?

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,400
Duan.

244
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,000
Your Majesty.

245
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,600
You have merits for escorting and protecting them.

246
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,700
Please rise.

247
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,400
Miss Mu, you're indeed a lady of character.

249
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
[Duan Zhengming, Emperor of Dali Kingdom]
So you're the emperor?

250
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,700
Yes. I am the emperor of the Dali Kingdom.

251
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,800
So, have you visited Dali city?

252
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
I was brought to meet you once I got here.

253
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
I don't have time for a trip.

254
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
All right.

255
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,400
Yu'er.

256
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,800
Tomorrow, take Miss Mu to Dali city for a trip,

257
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,200
let her witness the scenery in the Dali Kingdom.

258
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Okay. Thank you, Uncle.

259
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,500
Come with us then.

260
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,800
Empress, this young lady wants us to go with her.

261
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,700
Shall we go with her? Or not?

262
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,000
So you're the empress?

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,800
You're so pretty.

264
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,800
Yu'er,

265
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
Miss Mu is naive and sincere.

266
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,800
Interesting.

267
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,300
You called him Yu'er?

268
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,600
So you're his uncle that he always talks about.

269
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
Yes, I'm his uncle.

270
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,500
He was very afraid that you would be angry with him

271
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,800
for running away without informing you.

272
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,000
I beg you. Please don't beat him, okay?

273
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,400
Originally, I wanted to give him fifty floggings as punishment.

274
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,100
However, since Miss Mu has appealed,

275
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,900
he'll be exempted.

276
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,500
Yu'er, why haven't you thanked Miss Mu?

277
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Miss Mu, thank you for helping to appeal my case.

278
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,200
Since they won't beat you, I'm relieved now.

279
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,800
You don't have to thank me.

280
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,400
I thought the emperor was stern and frightening.

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
But after meeting you today,

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
I feel that you're quite good.

283
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,400
Empress, do you have any reward for her?

284
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
This is for you.

285
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,300
This is beautiful.

286
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,400
If I see something beautiful in the city,

287
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,500
I'll buy one for you too.

288
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,400
My disciple! My disciple!

289
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Come out now! Where are you?

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,600
Your master is here.

291
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,000
Why are you trespassing the prince's mansion?

292
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm here to find my disciple.

293
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
Ask him to come out and meet me.

294
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,200
Why would your disciple be in Prince Zhennan's mansion?

295
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Leave this place now.

296
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Fourth brother!

297
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,200
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

298
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,500
My disciple!

299
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,000
Come out and meet me now!

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Where are you?

301
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,800
Who are you?

302
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,300
Where's my disciple?

303
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
My fourth brother was right.

304
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
You're really here.

305
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,500
Let's go!

306
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,400
I'm Duan Zhengchun.

307
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,600
Duan Yu is my son.

308
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,100
When did he become your disciple?

309
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,200
Father.

310
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
He insisted that I become his disciple.

311
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,600
I told him that I had a master

312
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,800
but he didn't believe it.

313
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,500
Where did you get a master?

314
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,600
Ask that man to come

315
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,800
and fight for three moves with me.

316
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
Do you believe that I'll strangle him

317
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
and bring you back to Nanhai Sect

318
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,500
and continue my legacy?

319
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
Okay.

320
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,400
If it's three moves only,

321
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,500
my master doesn't need to fight.

322
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,800
I can handle it.

323
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Yu'er.

324
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Father.

325
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,400
Let's make things clear first.

326
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,800
What happens if you're unable to defeat me in three rounds?

327
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,400
I will call you my master.

328
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,879
Yu'er.

329
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't do nonsense.

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,900
Don't care about this uncultured commoner.

331
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,000
Guards, take this offensive madman down.

332
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,600
Yes!

333
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
Hold on, everyone.

334
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,400
Let me receive three attacks from him first.

335
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Third Master Yue,

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,700
let's make things clear first.

337
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,000
If you're unable to defeat me in three attacks,

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
you have to call me your master.

339
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,700
After that, you can't reject my orders.

340
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,400
You must do whatever I tell you to do.

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Do you agree?

342
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,600
Since you said that,

343
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,700
I agree! Of course!

344
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,200
If you lose, I'll be your master!

345
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You don't know martial arts. Why are you flaunting your superiority?

346
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Sister Wan, relax.

347
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,600
I have my own way.

348
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
In this case, you start first.

349
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,700
Indeed, I knew you were a good disciple.

350
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,400
Then I won't use internal force,

351
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,600
it won't be seen as bullying you.

352
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
When did you learn such strange martial arts?

353
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,400
- Did you lie to me before?
- No.

354
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,600
I only learned it recently.

355
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,200
I really didn't know it before this.

356
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,800
Well. How dare you teach Yu'er

357
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,600
such martial arts without me knowing?

358
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,600
Third Master Yue,

359
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
you couldn't defeat him in three moves.

360
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,500
Kowtow and call him your master now.

361
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I won't.

362
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,600
He wasn't serious just now.

363
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,400
That doesn't count.

364
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,600
Don't you feel ashamed?

365
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,800
You said that you're a bastard

366
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,500
if you don't call him your master.

367
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,700
So do you want to be a bastard or call him your master?

368
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,200
I won't do anything.

369
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
I want a rematch.

370
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,100
Yu'er, it's impossible for the Duan family of Dali

371
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,400
to retreat when encountering a strong enemy.

372
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Uncle, I'm a bit out of sorts.

373
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm worried that I can't beat him.

374
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
If you do not know how to fight,

375
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
you should make use of your footwork

376
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
to act on his acupoints.

377
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,000
Fight him again!

378
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,800
Your uncle taught you well.

379
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,300
All right.

380
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,200
Yu'er, slow down your steps by half,

381
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
move forward boldly,

382
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,000
and act on the acupoint on his chest.

383
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,400
Uncle, I can't do it!

384
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,600
Go fight according to your uncle's advice.

385
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,900
Go!

386
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Yu'er has already fought for over sixty moves.

387
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
He is such a good son,

388
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
are you still not satisfied?

389
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Mother.

390
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,700
There is no need for Yu'er to fight anymore.

391
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,600
Yu'er has already won.

392
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,300
Feng Huang, don't worry.

393
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,800
I assure you that he will not die.

394
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
- You...
- Mother.

395
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,200
Don't worry,

396
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
I should be able to make it.

397
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,300
My son.

398
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Duan, are you all right?

399
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,600
Third Master Yue, I think that you are destined to be a bastard.

400
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,200
You must make Duan Yu your master.

401
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,800
I am not that predictable!

402
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,400
In no way, I, Second Master Yue, am going to be called a bastard.

403
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,000
I will be his disciple, fine!

404
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,500
Master, your disciple Second Master Yue kowtows to you now.

405
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,200
- Let go of him!
- Stop running.

406
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
- Son.
- Mother.

407
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
I won!

408
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Master, here's my first present to you.

409
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,300
These Four Evils are really horrible!

410
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,800
Danchen. Ducheng. Please arrange for a proper burial for this man

411
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
and provide generous compensation to his family.

412
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,700
Yes.

413
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,400
Duan, your disciple is so ridiculous!

414
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,700
The next time I meet him, I will definitely teach him a lesson!

415
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,000
I got lucky this time

416
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,700
all thanks to the help from my father.

417
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,300
If I bump into him next time,

418
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,400
I'm afraid that he will dig out my heart!

419
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,300
How would I be able to teach him a lesson?

420
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Yu'er, come over here.

421
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,600
Uncle.

422
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,000
Kneel down.

423
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,600
Why do you make him kneel?

424
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,100
Kneel down!

425
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,400
Let me ask you.

426
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,500
Where did you learn your footwork from?

427
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,400
Uncle, I learned it randomly in a cave.

428
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
A cave?

429
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,700
Yes. When I was out,

430
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,600
I got into a conflict with the disciples of Limitless Mountain.

431
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,900
They chased after me, and I fell into the valley of Limitless Mountain.

432
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,400
I hid in a cave while looking for a way out.

433
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,600
I found a scroll with diagrams of footwork by accident.

434
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,300
A while ago, I was addicted to Yijing.

435
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,400
The footwork on the scroll seemed to be the opposite of Yijing.

436
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,800
Therefore, I picked it up.

437
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Our son, Yu'er, is so brilliant.

438
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,400
Get up.

439
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,200
The footwork you did

440
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,200
indeed originated from Fuxi sixty-four hexagrams.

441
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
The moves are swift and fast, very clever indeed.

442
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,300
In my opinion,

443
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,600
it contains excellent knowledge about internal strength.

444
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,800
Yu'er, show me a few more steps.

445
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,600
Yes.

446
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,800
Great. Great.

447
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,200
Yu'er, your footwork is indeed second to none.

448
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,800
You should really seize this good opportunity.

449
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,600
Okay.

450
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,000
Thank you, Uncle.

451
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,800
It is rare for your family to get together,

452
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,600
you should have a few drinks with your parents.

453
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,600
Yes, I will.

454
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,700
Empress, let's go back to the palace.

455
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,000
Get the carriages ready to return to the palace.

456
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,100
Have a safe trip, Your Majesty.

457
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,400
Have a safe trip, Uncle and Aunt.

458
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:12,200
Mother, I raise a toast to you.

459
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
Congratulations on your reunion with your father.

460
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Let's celebrate the joy of us getting together.

461
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
I don't drink.

462
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,000
Well, Miss Mu, why don't you raise a toast to my mother?

463
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Aunt, here's a toast to you.

464
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,200
Mother.

465
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,900
Miss Mu, my son is very mischievous.

466
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,700
He doesn't listen to his parents.

467
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,600
I would really appreciate it

468
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,100
if you could instill some discipline in him.

469
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,100
If he does not listen to me, I will spank him.

470
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,500
Right, that should be the way.

471
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,700
Mother.

472
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,800
Come here.

473
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,100
Are you Dao Baifeng? Is that you?

474
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,600
My surname is strange.

475
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,800
How did you know?

476
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
You are Dao Baifeng.

477
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,800
You are a Baiyi woman.

478
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,200
You used to fight with a whip. Is that correct?

479
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,700
Yu'er treats you really well.

480
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,600
In such a short time,

481
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,200
you even know my maiden name.

482
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,900
I can't disobey my master's order.

483
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,340
I am sorry.

484
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,840
Sister Wan.

485
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,060
Duan.

486
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,200
Yu'er.

487
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,119
- Duan.
- Yu'er.

488
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,240
Yu'er.

489
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,660
Mother.

490
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,759
Duan, I did not mean it.

491
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,420
Duan, are you all right?

492
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,679
- Give me the antidote!
- Antidote.

493
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,799
Right, the antidote!

494
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,919
The red one is to be taken orally. The white one is to be applied to the wound.

495
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,239
We won't be able to save him if we are slow. Hurry up!

496
00:30:34,239 --> 00:30:36,699
Duan.

497
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,640
Duan, I did not mean it. I just want to kill Dao Baifeng.

498
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,720
I did not mean to hurt you.

499
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,139
- Don't kill my mother.
- Take this.

500
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:48,879
Duan, are you all right?

501
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,660
Duan. Duan.

502
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,879
Son.

503
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,839
- Mother.
- Duan.

504
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,340
Son.

505
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,320
- Duan.
- Someone, please help!

506
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,220
Ask the imperial doctor to come!

507
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,220
How is he?

508
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,579
Your Highness, the young prince's pulse is stable and strong.

509
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:17,259
He should be fine. He will fully recover after a few days' rest.

510
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,980
Thank you.

511
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,159
Danchen,

512
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,279
please help to send the doctor off.

513
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,560
Yes. This way, please.

514
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,059
Feng Huang, is Yu'er all right?

515
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,159
Bring this message to Xiuluo Knife, Qin Hongmian.

516
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,200
If she wants me dead,

517
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,980
she should act above board.

518
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,039
Such despicable actions would only end up making her a laughing stock.

519
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,940
Feng Huang, you...

520
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,260
Xiuluo Knife, Qin Hongmian.

521
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,339
Who is that?

522
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:10,799
Well, then, who instructed you to kill me?

523
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,999
My master.

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,919
My master wants me to kill two persons.

525
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,600
You are the first one.

526
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,999
She said, your name is Dao Baifeng.

527
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:21,180
You are a Baiyi woman, who is very beautiful.

528
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,420
You have a red mark on your arm.

529
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,939
In the past, you used a whip as a weapon.

530
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:31,939
I saw that you use a fly-whisk and you are a Taoist nun.

531
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:35,360
Therefore, I never realized that you were the person that my master wanted dead.

532
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,140
It never crossed my mind that you would be Duan Yu's mother.

533
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,400
Is the second person whom your master instructed you to kill

534
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,039
Pretty Yaksha, Gan Baobao?

535
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,400
No.

536
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,020
Gan Baobao is my martial aunt.

537
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,680
It's she who wrote a letter to inform us

538
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,599
that these two women ruined my master's life.

539
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:01,779
There is no way that I won't take revenge.

540
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,580
Well, that's it.

541
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,440
Is the second person named Wang and lives in Suzhou?

542
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,800
Yes.

543
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,300
How did you know about this?

544
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,399
My master and I first went to Suzhou

545
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,639
to look for the wicked woman named Wang.

546
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,800
Little did we expect that she had many followers.

547
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,119
Not only were we not able to meet her,

548
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,920
but we were also chased all the way to Dali.

549
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,780
Let Miss Mu go.

550
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,340
Make sure you teach Yu'er well.

551
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,179
I'll get going.

552
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:46,740
Feng Huang,

553
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,159
that was the past. Let bygones be bygones.

554
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,920
Let bygones be bygones?

555
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,820
It is only you who doesn't take this to heart,

556
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,120
but everyone else does!

557
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,020
I hurt your wife.

558
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,899
I don't think you will forgive me.

559
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:52,839
Whatever you want to do with me, it's up to you.

560
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,560
Just do it!

561
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,000
You really resemble her.

562
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,740
You really do.

563
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,240
I should have observed this.

564
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,200
Your look. Your temper.

565
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,680
Resemblance?

566
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,120
What resemblance?

567
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

568
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,460
Wuluo Qingyan Palm?

569
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,159
How did you know this?

570
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,200
Your master taught you this, right?

571
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,020
She did not.

572
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,579
My master said, she will never teach this to an outsider.

573
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:43,520
She will take it to her grave.

574
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,239
Did she really say so?

575
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,280
Yes. Every time after practicing this,

576
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,140
she would scold me angrily.

577
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,540
How did you know this?

578
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,300
And it seems that you are more skilled than my master.

579
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,839
I taught your master this Wuluo Qingyan Palm.

580
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,700
Then... you are the master of my master?

581
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,640
No.

582
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,599
You're eighteen years old this year,

583
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,880
with a birth date in September. Correct?

584
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,820
Yes.

585
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,679
How did you know about this? Who are you?

586
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,060
I...

587
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,520
I have done your master wrong.

588
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,060
Did your master ever tell you her name?

589
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,300
Never.

590
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,039
I only know that she is called The Lady in the Remote Valley.

591
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,680
I have absolutely no idea about her last name and first name.

592
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,920
The Lady in the Remote Valley?

593
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,939
The Lady in the Remote Valley?

594
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,819
What is wrong with this name?

595
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:16,100
The Lady in the Remote Valley...

596
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,559
A fair lady of unrivaled beauty lived in a remote valley away from society.

597
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:24,079
She is told to be of a good lineage,

598
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,939
but had fallen to the grassroots, and on no one could she rely on.

599
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:27,419
She was married to a philanderer.

600
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:29,219
He cast her aside and took another beauty as his other wife.

601
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,079
Her husband only attended to the smiles of his new company,

602
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,620
never did he care whether she would cry.

603
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,799
The Lady in the Remote Valley.

604
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,519
This is such a sad and desperate name.

605
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,239
It seems that the heart-breaker is really heartless.

606
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,299
Then, did your master ever tell you who your parents are?

607
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,359
Never.

608
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,900
She only told me that I was an orphan abandoned by my parents.

609
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,500
She adopted me and raised me up.

610
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,380
So, do you hate them?

611
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,980
I do.

612
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,580
I... Well...

613
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,520
You...

614
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,220
What is the matter with you?

615
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,139
Why are you... Is it because I hurt Duan?

616
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:26,380
I... I did not mean it.

617
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,280
You can't disobey your master's order.

618
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,080
You shouldn't be involved in the affairs of the older generation.

619
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,200
Please do not be rude to my wife in the future.

620
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,480
If your master asks,

621
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,379
I will explain to her.

622
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:43,460
However, my master said that she would not see any men.

623
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,599
She said all men are heartless.

624
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,820
She will not see you.

625
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,060
Hongmian, Hongmian.

626
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,160
Why do you torture yourself like this?

627
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,639
Hongmian?

628
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,139
Hongmian again.

629
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,399
Who is she?

630
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,220
Your master's real name is Qin Hongmian,

631
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,480
and her nickname Xiuluo Knife.

632
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,959
No wonder your wife

633
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,060
kept asking about the relationship between myself and Xiuluo Knife, Qin Hongmian.

634
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,860
So my master's name is Qin Hongmian.

635
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,619
This is such a nice name.

636
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:20,399
I wonder why didn't she tell me.

637
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:27,160
Wan'er, I injured your arm just now.

638
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,920
Does it still hurt?

639
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,799
I feel much better now.

640
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,080
That's great.

641
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,020
Well, Uncle, shall we check on Duan?

642
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,559
The poisonous arrow of mine... I...

643
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,100
Wan'er, whatever wishes you may have in the future,

644
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,519
just tell me.

645
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,399
As long as it is within my means,

646
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,960
I will definitely make your wish come true.

647
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,680
Really?

648
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,239
- Anything?
- Of course.

649
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,260
Actually, Duan and I are engaged.

650
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,479
You know about that.

651
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,459
So, please give us your blessing.

652
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,059
Why? You don't agree, do you?

653
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:19,820
You said that you would have my wishes fulfilled.

654
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:24,680
Duan also told me that he will never betray me.

655
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,079
If he betrays me,

656
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,699
I will kill him first, then I will kill myself.

657
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:31,919
- In front of my master...
- What a sin!

658
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,879
You can't be married to Yu'er for sure!

659
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,380
Why?

660
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,120
I will go ask him now!

661
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,580
Because...

662
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,460
Because Yu'er is your biological brother!

663
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,300
I don't believe it.

664
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,839
- I don't believe it!
- Wan'er,

665
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,439
your master is actually your biological mother.

666
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,020
And I...

667
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,260
I am your biological father.

668
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,980
I don't believe it.

669
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,320
- Wan'er, come out!
- Master.

670
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,540
[Xiuluo Knife, Qin Hongmian]
Hongmian?

671
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,560
Hongmian, all these years, I jhave missed you so much.

672
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,559
Wan'er, you shouldn't stay in this heartless man's house,

673
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,979
not even for a single moment.

674
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:44,420
Come out!

675
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,860
Master!

676
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,659
Master, he lied to me.

677
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:53,759
He told me that you are my mother

678
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:55,740
and he is my father.

679
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,220
Your mother already passed away.

680
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,899
Your father has also passed away.

681
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,320
Let's go!

682
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,800
Hongmian!

683
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,380
To die under Xiuluo Knife,

684
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,130
I would have no regrets.

685
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,340
Hongmian, let me take another look at you.

686
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,479
Why don't you stay here?

687
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:34,279
We can live together.

688
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,340
Did you mean what you said?

689
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,640
Can you really let go of Dao Baifeng?

690
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,760
For the sake of our poor daughter,

691
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,840
you need to listen to me from now on.

692
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,000
Don't ever come back here.

693
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,090
Don't ever think of Dao Baifeng.

694
00:42:55,090 --> 00:43:00,080
It's not that I don't want to, but I'm Prince Zhennan of Dali.
