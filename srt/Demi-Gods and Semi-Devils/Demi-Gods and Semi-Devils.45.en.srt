15
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,640
Mother, I'm fine.

16
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,859
Xuan Ci broke the vows of celibacy, has the same sin as Xu Zhu.

17
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,619
As the abbot, we shall double his punishment.

18
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,220
Disciplinary monks.

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,800
Punish Xuan Ci with 200 lashes.

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,600
This involves the Shaolin Temple's reputation.

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,639
There shall be no bias and favoritism.

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,959
- Abbot!
- Father.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,760
Abbot!

24
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,140
I can't ruin the good reputation...

25
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,480
the Shaolin Temple has been holding for the past thousands of years.

26
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,100
Yes.

27
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,860
Disciplinary monks. Carry out the punishment.

28
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,900
Carry out the punishment.

29
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,780
Father.

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,179
Martial Brother, apply your internal force to protect yourself.

31
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,480
Reverend Xuan Ji.

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,240
The Shaolin Temple values the Buddhist precepts they have undertaken.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,860
The abbot is receiving punishment as well.

34
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,020
You have my utmost respect.

35
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,759
But Abbot Xuan Ci is no longer a young man.

36
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,780
If he refuses to apply his internal force to protect himself,

37
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,420
I'm afraid that he won't be able to handle the 200 lashes.

38
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,900
Mother.

39
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm asking for a favor.

40
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,359
As of now, he has received 80 lashes.

41
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,479
We shall carry on with the punishment next time.

42
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,319
Exactly. We shall help him, too.

43
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,799
Forget it. He is old. Let him off.

44
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,439
Let him off.

45
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,020
Hit...

46
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,880
Stop hitting him.

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,740
Many thanks for everyone's kindness.

48
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,759
But we can't violate the Buddhist precepts.

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,579
- Father.
- Disciplinary monks. Go on.

50
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,060
Mother.

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,039
Martial Brother, apply your internal force to protect yourself.

52
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,260
Father!

53
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,100
Stop!

54
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,040
It's all my fault. I seduced him.

55
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,639
I'll receive the remaining lashes. Please.

56
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
Stop hitting him. Stop hitting him.

57
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,680
Fool.

58
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,540
Fool.

59
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,520
You are not a Buddhist nun.

60
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,640
You didn't take the vow of celibacy.

61
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,640
How can it be your fault?

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,700
Xu Zhu.

63
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,600
Father. You... bring your mother...

64
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
bring your mother to the side.

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,740
Father.

66
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,620
Go!

67
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,720
Disciplinary monks.

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,700
Carry out the punishment!

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,140
The father and son duo of the Xiao family are known to be peerless.

70
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,780
You fear no one.

71
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,759
But it won't be easy for you to kill me today.

72
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,560
Why don't we make a deal?

73
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,180
As long as you agree to this deal,

74
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,120
I'll allow you to come forward and kill me.

75
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,220
I'll fold my hands and not resist.

76
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,439
Brother Xiao, I spread the rumor and caused such a mess.

77
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,299
Does Brother Xiao know why I did do such a vicious and wicked thing?

78
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:34,079
You were always a despicable man.

79
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,659
You do all sorts of evils and rejoice in other people's misfortune.

80
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,679
Do you need a reason behind your wicked doing?

81
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,060
Brother Xiao, I put in the utmost effort to create chaos

82
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,730
and make them fight against each other.

83
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:48,379
Logically speaking, there must be a significant reason behind this.

84
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,839
So, what's the reason behind this?

85
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,479
The Murong clan is a small family.

86
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,299
We are not strong enough to restore the country.

87
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:01,179
Only when the world is in chaos and all countries are at war,

88
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,359
can we take the opportunity to achieve our goal.

89
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,500
You spread false news to sow discord,

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,220
intending to cast a bone between the Song and the Liao,

91
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,959
and make them fight against each other.

92
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,039
Exactly.

93
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,259
If a war breaks out between the Song and the Liao,

94
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,959
the Yan Nation will be able to take advantage of the situation.

95
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,670
Hero Xiao has been installed as the Great Prince of the South Palace of the Liao Kingdom and has acquired a military decree.

96
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,499
If he directs his army southward, he will achieve glorious deeds in wars.

97
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:27,879
You want Feng'er to help you in restoring the Yan Nation?

98
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:29,400
Exactly.

99
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,880
The punishment is complete.

100
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,340
Father.

101
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,860
Father.

102
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Father.

103
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,794
For the past 20 years,

104
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:14,887
I have been missing both of you dearly.

105
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,680
Father.

106
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,980
I know that I made an unforgivable mistake.

107
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,340
But I had no one to confess to.

108
00:08:33,819 --> 00:08:35,839
I feel better now.

109
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,700
- I've finally been relieved from this.
- Father.

110
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,620
I've finally been freed.

111
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,140
One's time on earth,

112
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,600
there are love and lust,

113
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,400
worries and sufferings.

114
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,480
To free oneself is the only way to happiness.

115
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,980
Father.

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,399
Martial Brother.

117
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,179
- Abbot.
- Martial Brother.

118
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:28,980
Father.

119
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,300
How could you leave me like this?

120

Amitabha.

121
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,540
Mother.

122
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,300
You...

123
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,840
Mother.

124
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,040
Mother.

125
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,140
Mother... Our family only got to reunite today.

126
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,820
Mother.

127
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,959
Mother, we have only just reunited as a family.

128
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,640
Mother.

129
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,540
Mother.

130
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,300
Mother!

131
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,739
If Brother Xiao agrees to my proposal, you can kill me right away.

132
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,820
I will not resist.

133
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,660
Feng'er, what he said makes sense.

134
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
What do you think?

135
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,300
I must avenge my mother's death.

136
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,079
But Mr. Murong described this as a business.

137
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,960
My father and I will not descend to doing unethical things like this.

138
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,660
I, Xiao Feng,

139
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,279
will never fall into your trap and become your murder weapon.

140
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,680
You're a man of the country, and you shall work for the country.

141
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,839
As a minister of the Liao Kingdom,

142
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,780
even if you have no intention to avenge your parents' death, you should serve the country.

143
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,500
How can you disregard your duty and let the Liao Kingdom down?

144
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,679
I'm loyal to the Liao Kingdom, and my goal is to protect the land and safety of its people.

145
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,819
I don't kill the innocents for my personal glory and wealth.

146
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:30,680
How can the Murong clan take this opportunity to rebuild the Yan Nation?

147
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,180
That's ridiculous.

148
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,220
Besides, have you seen the situation at the borders,

149
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,800
the devastating scene of the Song and the Liao butchering each other?

150
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,540
Families from both the Song and the Liao were separated and their homes were broken.

151
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,639
With great difficulty, the two countries managed to maintain a truce for 10 years.

152
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,260
If they are to wage another war,

153
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,420
how many more innocent people will die?

154
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,999
Excellent.

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,820
Master Xiao is a kind man,

156
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,300
and he puts the wellness of the people before anything else.

157
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,560
He truly has a kind heart.

[Depository of Buddhist Scriptures]

159
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,060
How long have you been hiding here?

160
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,180
I can't remember clearly.

161
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,239
When the old Master Xiao came here for the first time,
[Sweeper Monk, Shaolin Temple]

162
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:40,540
I had already been here for more than 10 years

163
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,799
Later, the old Master Murong arrived here, too.

164
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,039
A few years ago, Bo Luoxing, the monk from Tianzhu, came to steal scriptures too.

165
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:54,380
People came and went, turning the Scripture-Depository Pavilion into a complete mess.

166
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,620
Why have I never seen you before?

167
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,160
You were completely focused on the martial art manuals and you allowed no distractions.

168
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
Naturally, you didn't notice my presence.

169
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,700
I remember the first night you were here,

170
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,460
you borrowed the "Invincible Finger Manuals."

171
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,319
Since that night, Master had entered the demonic path.

172
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,260
What a waste.

173
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,520
How did you know about that?

174
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,059
The second time you came to the pavilion, you took the "Prajna Palm Manuals."

175
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:29,100
At that time, Master was straying further and further away,

176
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,540
and I couldn't bear seeing that.

177
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,059
Therefore, I placed a copy of "Dharma Lotus Sutra" near your usual browsing spot,

178
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:39,860
hoping that you would read that book and get enlightened by it.

179
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,900
Unfortunately, Master paid no heed to orthodox Buddhist doctrine,

180
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,859
and picked up a copy of "Devil Staff Technique Manuals," and left the pavilion joyfully.

181
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,980
You lost yourself in the sea of suffering.

182
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,500
I wondered when you would return to the right path.

183
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,800
Master Murong is a descendent of the Xianbei.

184
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,540
But you have resided in Jiangnan for many years.

185
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,980
I assumed Master would have been influenced

186
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,740
by the literature and the culture of the south.

187
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,139
I didn't expect Master to disregard the teachings of my forefather.

188
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:17,659
You picked up a copy of "Flower-pinching Finger Manuals," as if you found a precious treasure.

189
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:21,079
Both of the masters are very capable men.

190
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,180
Yet, you were reckless and foolish.

191
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,419
This will do more harm than good for others and yourself.

192
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,259
What Master Xiao learned was to restrain the existing Shaolin martial arts.

193
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:43,180
Yet, Master Murong learned all 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin,

194
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,200
and even made duplicate copies.

195
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,920
Such a greedy man.

196
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,790
I assume, during the past years, Master Murong mastered

197
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,240
all the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

198
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,099
Perhaps, you have passed it down to your son as well.

199
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,799
Yes.

200
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,959
Your son is still young and lacks skills.

201
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,080
So, I reckon you have imparted it to this monk from Tianzhu,

202
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,640
Master Jiu Mozhi, you were wrong.

203
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,139
You got the sequence in reverse and a great catastrophe is looming.

204
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,999
What do you mean by the "sequence is reversed and a great catastrophe is looming"?

205
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:27,839
This old monk is trying to scare us.

206
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,060
I'm not trying to scare you.

207
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,079
Advisor, please return the "Yijin Jing" to me.

208
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,240
What "Yijin Jing"?

209
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,559
Your words are getting more and more confusing.

210
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,199
A Buddhist disciple practices martial arts not to fight with others.

211
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:50,739
Instead, we do that to strengthen our bodies, protect the law, and guard against demons.

212
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:53,880
If we don't use the Buddhist doctrine as the foundation of our training,

213
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,980
we will surely injure ourselves when we are practicing martial arts.

214
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,939
The more we practice, the worse the injury gets.

215
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,580
The Shaolin Temple was built thousands of years ago.

216
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,719
All of the manuals of the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin,

217
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:15,780
our disciples can read them as they like.

218
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,480
Do you know why only Grand Master of Dharma alone

219
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,719
mastered all the secret arts?

220
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,300
This is your temple's business.

221
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
Why would an outsider know of it?

222
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,020
Our temple has 72 Secret Arts.

223
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,900
They are all extremely vicious.

224
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,359
Hence, they need to be neutralized with corresponding Dharma.

225
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,359
Only with a high level of Dharma, and an ever-flourishing merciful heart,

226
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,980
only then you can train your skills to a higher level.

227
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,620
However, senior monks who are able to reach such a state

228
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,479
do not care to research these vicious techniques that are used to kill.

229
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:57,159
In the Shaolin Sect, we call it the "hindrance of martial arts."

230
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,319
It is similar to the "hindrance of awareness" of other sects.

231
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,759
Within the temple, there are those with inadequate Dharma

232
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,420
but insist on learning superior martial arts.

233
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,439
But once they start training, they either lose their sanity or suffer incurable internal injuries.

234
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:18,300
Reverend Xuan Cheng from our sect

235
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,919
has extraordinary skills in martial arts.

236
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,979
Overnight, all his tendons and veins snapped.

237
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,839
He turned into a complete wreck.

238
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,980
This was how that happened.

239
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,440
I guess the Shaolin Temple has no other man.

240
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,639
They sent this old monk here not only to sweep,

241
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,839
but to also speak nonsense and try to delude us with rumors.

242
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,960
Do you think I, Jiu Mozhi, am a three-year-old who knows nothing?

243
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,359
You said that it's impossible to master all of the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

244
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,980
Then, how did I master them all?

245
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,960
My tendons and veins didn't snap,

246
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,740
and I didn't turn out to be a wreck.

247
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,440
You must have practiced the Minor Formless Skill of the Carefree Sect.

248
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,419
If you take that as the foundation, you can practice our sect's 72 Secret Arts, too.

249
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:29,399
However, you won't be able to duplicate the details perfectly.

250
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,539
If Maha Cakra Vajra only studied the methods of using the 72 Secret Arts,

251
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,980
it will not hurt your vital organs so soon.

252
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,880
But right now, your Chengqi acupoint is of vermillion color,

253
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,060
your Wenxiang acupoint is revealing a faint purple cloud.

254
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,159
It shows that Maha Cakra Vajra tried to practice our sect's Yijin Jing

255
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,060
after you practiced the 72 Secret Arts.

256
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,100
Mr. Xiao, have you been feeling dull pain

257
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,580
at your Liangmen acupoint and Taiyi acupoint at your abdomen of late?

258
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,299
How have you been dealing

259
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:10,840
with the numbness at your Guanyuan acupoint?

260
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,620
Divine Monk is wise.

261
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,260
The numbness at the Guanyuan acupoint

262
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,479
was merely the size of a little finger 10 years ago.

263
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,120
Now, it's grown into the size of a bowl.

264
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,199
Divine Monk knows the cause of my father's illness.

265
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,720
Please save him.

266
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,180
Mr. Xiao is a man with great kindness.

267
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,020
You refuse to resolve your personal grievance by hurting the people of the Song and the Liao.

268
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,340
Such benevolence and righteousness.

269
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,720
No matter what request you have, this old monk will certainly help you out.

270
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,400
Thank you, Divine Monk.

271
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,519
The old Mr. Xiao was injured

272
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,140
when he tried to practice the Shaolin Sect's martial arts.

273
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,340
If he wants to cure it,

274
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,300
he has to look for a solution from the Dharma.

275
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,159
The old Mr. Murong doesn't fear death.

276
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,700
I assume you don't need my advice.

277
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,479
But on Yangbai, Lianquan, Fengfu,

278
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:24,899
the pain that feels like being stabbed by thousands of needles on these three acupoints,

279
00:21:24,899 --> 00:21:28,320
do you know how to relieve it?

280
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,220
Father.

281
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,560
Just as the mountain keeps lush and water lasts flowing,

282
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,479
we will bid our farewell for now.

283
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,039
If you want to take revenge upon my father and me,

284
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,639
we will welcome you at the Swallow's Nest of the Murong clan.

285
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,120
I won't let you off so easily.

286
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,739
Then, let's see what Brother Xiao has to show us.

287
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,799
Amitabha.

288
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,119
This is a sacred place.

289
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,039
Misters shall not act rashly.

290
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,999
I am an uncouth commoner with no etiquette.

291
00:22:41,999 --> 00:22:43,199
I'm sorry to have upset you.

292
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,879
I implore Divine Monk to help my father with his illness.

293
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,759
I have mentioned this before.

294
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,759
The only way to cure the old Mr. Xiao

295
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,840
is to seek solutions from Dharma.

296
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,340
Let me ask the old Mr. Xiao a question.

297
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,180
If you had the ability to heal injuries,

298
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,959
would you heal the internal injuries

299
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,400
suffered by the old Mr. Murong?

300
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,839
This old thief killed my wife and ruined my life.

301
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,399
I want to tear him limb from limb.

302
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,660
Why would I save him?

303
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,580
Is witnessing the old Mr. Murong dying a miserable death

304
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,820
the only way to resolve your grudge?

305
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,999
Precisely.

306
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,079
For the past 30 years, this blood feud

307
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,660
was the only thing on my mind.

308
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,840
I can handle this.

309
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,500
Father.

310
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,400
Father.

311
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,399
Father.

312
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,660
What a bald donkey.

313
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,560
Father!

314
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,160
No!

315
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,439
Now, the old Mr. Murong is dead.

316
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,420
This must have resolved old Mr. Xiao's grievances.

317
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,940
Father.

318
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,560
My enemy is dead.

319
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,340
Where should I go now?

320
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,600
Should I go back to the Liao Kingdom?

321
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,260
Or should I go back to the Yanmen Pass and live in seclusion?

322
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,480
Or should I bring Feng'er to travel across the martial arts world?

323
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,099
Why?

324
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,379
Why am I doing this?

325
00:25:55,379 --> 00:26:00,919
Mr. Xiao, you shall go wherever you want to.

326
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:05,839
I... I have nowhere to go.

327
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,359
I killed old Mr. Murong.

328
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,239
You didn't get to take revenge upon him yourself.

329
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,919
You must have some regrets, right?

330
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,880
No.

331
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,320
Even if you didn't kill him,

332
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,059
I wouldn't kill him either.

333
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:30,039
But Hero Murong will now seek revenge against me.

334
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:32,880
What should I do?

335
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,779
Divine Monk did that for me.

336
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,739
If Hero Murong wants to avenge his father's death,

337
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,379
he should come after me.

338
00:26:41,379 --> 00:26:44,040
He can kill me.

339
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,840
Feng'er.

340
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,500
You should return to the Liao Kingdom.

341
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,380
We are done with our job here.

342
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,380
I will miss nothing...

343
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,539
from this martial arts world.

344
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,859
If Young Hero Murong kills you,

345
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:08,019
your son will definitely avenge your death by killing Hero Murong.

346
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,779
The revenge and hatred will never come to an end.

347
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,820
Why not let me bear all the guilt in the world?

348
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,720
Stop!

349
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,079
What a fine skill.

350
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,620
The Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms is indeed the best skill in the world.

351
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,260
It's time for me to go.

352
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,060
Don't go.

353
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,940
Let go of my father.

354
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,480
Father.

355
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,699
I brought them for a run to help with their blood circulation.

356
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,459
What can you do for the deceased's blood circulation?

357
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:08,339
They are suffering from major internal injuries.

358
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:13,639
I put them into the Death-feigning State before I can save them.

359
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,760
Is my father still alive?

360
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,320
What are you doing?

361
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,839
They were killed,

362
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,339
then they were revived.

363
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:48,280
They shouldn't be holding any grudges anymore.

364
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,419
If they have really died,

365
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,959
they wouldn't care about restoring the Yan Nation

366
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,060
and avenging their wife's death anymore.

367
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,879
I've wasted 30 years in the Shaolin Temple

368
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,340
and I failed to learn how to be merciful.

369
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,719
Please take me as your disciple.

370
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,659
Don't you want to avenge your wife's death anymore?

371
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,739
I've killed hundreds of people.

372
00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:18,760
If the family of all the men I killed

373
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,299
intend to demand vengeance,

374
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:25,859
I'm afraid that I can't atone for my sins even if I die a hundred deaths.

375
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:27,560
Great.

376
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,880
And you?

377
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,680
The life of a peasant is dust,

378
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,180
the life of a monarch is also dust.

379
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,659
To restore the Yan Nation is just emptiness,

380
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:41,600
not restoring the Yan Nation is also emptiness.

381
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,979
You have achieved enlightenment.

382
00:32:46,979 --> 00:32:50,119
Great. Great.

383
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,380
Please take me as your disciple and enlighten me further.

384
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,219
If you want to become a monk,

385
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:04,659
you have to request a tonsure from the reverend of the Shaolin Temple.

386
00:33:04,659 --> 00:33:08,180
I have a few words for you.

387
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,359
To perceive the mind of the Buddha, the king of emptiness is subtle, mysterious, and difficult.

388
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,939
Without shape, without any distinguishing characteristics, still, it has the strength of a great spirit.

389
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:18,679
The mind is, and so is Buddha.

390
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,780
The Buddha is, so the mind is.

391
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,839
Every moment possessing Buddha's mind

392
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,919
Buddha's mind thinking "Buddha."

393
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,999
If you want to quickly reach this point,

394
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,620
discipline your mind and control yourself.

395
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,719
This mind-illumination is the real Buddha,

396
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,860
this clear understanding is the real mind.

397
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,919
Apart from the mind, no Buddha,

398
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,220
Apart from Buddha, no mind.

399
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,439
"No Buddha" is unfathomable,

400
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,240
there is no adequate way to express it.

401
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,699
You're awake. Do you remember my name?

402
00:33:58,699 --> 00:34:00,340
Sister Ling'er?

403
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,599
Where are your embroidered shoes?

404
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,119
You remember that too.

405
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,639
I took care of you when you were injured,

406
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,100
and you really made me worry.

407
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,279
- Sister Ling'er.
- Take a seat.

408
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:24,918
Sister Ling'er, how did you come here by yourself?

409
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:28,259
After I left the Wanjie Valley, you never visited me anymore.

410
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:29,899
I was really upset.

411
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:31,538
I went to the Royal Residence of Zhennan,

412
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:33,899
and found out that you were captured by an evil monk.

413
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,419
I was worried. Hence, I went to search for you.

414
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:39,640
Then, I ran into Brother Qiao Feng who was carrying you down the mountain.

415
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,579
Sister Ling'er, you came here all by yourself.

416
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:47,979
You are a young lady. You must have had a tough time.

417
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,400
It doesn't matter as long as I found you.

418
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,979
Then, where did Brother Qiao go?

419
00:34:57,979 --> 00:35:00,119
He made me stay and take care of you.

420
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,220
Then, he went to the Shaolin Temple.

421
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,579
Miss Ling'er.

422
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,639
Regarding my father and your mother, has your mother told you about it?

423
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,280
What is it about?

424
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,660
It seems like you still have no idea about it.

425
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,500
About what?

426
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,680
You are my...

427
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,800
That?

428
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,940
When I left the stone house,

429
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,279
so many people were there.

430
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,299
I was both shy and scared.

431
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,760
Hence, I closed my eyes hurriedly.

432
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,939
But I heard your father loud and clear.

433
00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:39,639
What my father said...

434
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,999
No. Sister Zhong Ling.

435
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,759
It won't work if you don't know the reason behind this.

436
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,060
Is Sister Mu objecting to this?

437
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,500
I dare not fight with her.

438
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,899
She's too fierce. It's not that I refuse to let her win.

439
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,179
No.

440
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:58,559
Sister Mu is also my...

441
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,620
Yes. Forget about Sister Mu.

442
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,540
Who is Miss Wang?

443
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,319
Why did you keep calling her name when you were unconscious?

444
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,799
I... Did I keep on calling Miss Wang's name?

445
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,839
Yes.

446
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,399
You kept calling Miss Wang's name when you were unconscious.

447
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,439
If you like Miss Wang so much, she can take care of you.

448
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,480
I'll leave you alone.

449
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,139
It won't help even if I miss her.

450
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,139
I have no place in her heart.

451
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,659
She only cares about her cousin.

452
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:29,199
She always ignores me.

453
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,619
Miss, this yard looks good.

454
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,559
The wind is too strong.

455
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,039
We shall take a rest here.

456
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,260
I'm sorry to have dragged you into this.

457
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,719
Miss, please don't be sorry.

458
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,840
Wait a minute.

459
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,780
Anyone there?

460
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,459
Is there anyone inside the house?

461
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:55,280
Chief Zhuang.

462
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,539
Miss, the men from the Beggars' Sect followed us here.

463
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:00,919
You are injured. Let's not confront them.

464
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,439
- We'll take shelter in this house.
- Sure.

465
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,640
Miss. Here.

466
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,879
Miss, there's a threshold here.

467
00:37:12,879 --> 00:37:14,160
Be careful.

468
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,580
Here.

469
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,040
Let's take cover there.

470
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,299
There's a bed here. Have a seat.

471
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,400
Brother Zhuang,

472
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,919
the bowl is warm.

473
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,000
Someone was here right before us.

474
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,600
Chief Zhuang, there is business we haven't settled.

475
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,199
How could you run away like that?

476
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,399
Brothers of the Beggars' Sect are still trapped within the Shaoshi Mountain.

477
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,519
How are you planning to save them?

478
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,679
Please give us an instruction.

479
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,340
Do you still take me as the chief of the sect?

480
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,840
You want to bring me there to vent your anger by killing me.

481
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,300
Let me tell you.

482
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,919
I won't go with you.

483
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,699
You took the Old Freak of Xingxiu as your master.

484
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,679
You have also embarrassed the Beggars' Sect in front of the heroes of the martial arts world.

485
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,559
You don't get to decide where to go.

486
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,679
Exactly.

487
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,119
Even when Chief Qiao was driven into the corner,

488
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,119
he didn't betray his brothers.

489
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,159
You killed our brothers, and we won't let you slip off so easily.

490
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,980
We shouldn't waste our time talking to him.

491
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,639
The elders worked together to capture Quan Guanqing.

492
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,420
Let's bring him back first.

493
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,219
The elders will decide whether to kill or punish him.

494
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,899
Are you able to do that?

495
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:27,580
Attack!

496
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,519
You... How dare you harm a disciple of the sect?

497
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,540
Kill him, too.

498
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,999
Are you hungry? Let's see if we can find some food here.

499
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:33,680
I'll listen to you.

500
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,679
Let's go.

501
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,560
We need to take care of the bodies.

502
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,339
Miss Ling'er, they are cruel and merciless. They won't hesitate to hurt anyone.

503
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:44,340
Let's sneak out through the back door.

504
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,400
Brother Duan, are you all right?

505
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,839
Divine Monk, please allow me to meet my father one last time.

506
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,859
Mr. Xiao, your father has become a monk of our temple.

507
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,800
From now on, he will devote himself to Buddha.

508
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,040
My father is an old man.

509
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,520
If he refuses to see me today,

510
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,099
I'm afraid that we will never meet again.

511
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,959
He wants me to tell you that he has had his share of the mortal world.

512
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,999
He has been freed.

513
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,580
He hopes that Mr. Xiao will not miss him.

514
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,599
Mr. Xiao is a minister of the Liao Kingdom.

515
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,399
You wish for the Song and the Liao to stay peaceful forever.

516
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,319
If the Liao Emperor has the intention to invade the Song,

517
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,119
I hope that Mr. Xiao can be merciful

518
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,720
and take care of the millions of lives in both countries.

519
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,220
Amitabha.

520
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,580
Thank you, Divine Monk.

521
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:25,360
[Zen Buddhism]

522
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,770
[Zen Buddhism]

523
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,170
[Zen Buddhism]

524
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,600
Big Brother,

525
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,739
you're here to find old Mr. Xiao. Right?

526
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,680
He has had his share of the mortal world

527
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,459
and is now a monk here.

528
00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:35,299
I've brought Ding Chunqiu to the Discipline Hall.

529
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,699
They will give him the antidote once a year

530
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:41,399
to reduce the pain the Mortality Talisman brought him.

531
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,920
Ding Chunqiu will spend the rest of his life in the Shaolin Temple.

532
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,299
I grew up in the Shaolin Temple.

533
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:56,300
I want to stay here forever.

534
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,020
But my Grand Martial Uncle kicked me out.

00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,680

549
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:23,050
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

550
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,960
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

560
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,610
Brother Duan, are you okay?

561
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,330
Brother Zhuang.

562
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,040
Miss A'Zi.

563
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,230
Who are these two people?

564
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,220
It is a man with a young girl.

565
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,290
This man has been injured.

566
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,860
This young girl's eyes are quite bright, she keeps looking at you.

567
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,890
What, bright?

568
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,230
Are her eyes really pretty?

569
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,710
She has some dust all over her,

570
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:49,500
but her eyes are quite lively.

571
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,520
Brother Zhuang, why don't you ball her eyes out

572
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,760
and put them in my eye sockets?
