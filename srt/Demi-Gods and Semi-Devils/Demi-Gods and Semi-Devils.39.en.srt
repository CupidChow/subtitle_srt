[Episode 39]

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I practiced martial arts my whole life.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,620
I even got a successor.

16
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,320
You wouldn't even promise my last request?

17
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,520
Martial Aunt, I can't.

18
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,600
Do you want to meet the girl in your dream?

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,520
Promise me then.

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Become the master of Lingjiu Palace.

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,880
Good.

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,000
Great.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,220
Xu Zhu, give that painting to me.

24
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,300
Let me rip it to shreds.

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,360
If I have no lingering memories,

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,719
I'd be able to show you the path to that girl in your dream.

27
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:24,480
Bring it here.

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
Yes.

29
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,320
It's not her.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,040
It's not her.

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,499
- Madam.
- It's not her!

32
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,220
Martial Aunt.

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,640
Martial Aunt.

34
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,679
- Martial Aunt!
- Master!
- Master!

35
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,860
- Master!
- Master!

36
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,260
In the end, you still died before me.

37
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,040
Senior Martial Sister?

38
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,560
Were you the victor

39
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,900
or was I the victor?

40
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,180
Don't take out your swords. Sheathe them.

41
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,940
Sheathe them. Sheathe them!

42
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,339
Your master was fighting with all her strength just now and ended up losing.

43
00:04:00,339 --> 00:04:05,320
How dare weaklings like you fight me?

44
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,780
Younger Martial Aunt, why are you alive?

45
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,600
Little Monk, quick.

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,840
Show me that painting.

47
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,900
Why did Senior Sister die while she laughed and cried?

48
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,419
Sure.

49
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,780
Younger Martial Aunt.

50
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,939
This lady in the painting looks a bit similar to you.

51
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,200
It's her?

52
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,460
It's her?

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,820
It's her?

54
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,240
Younger Martial Aunt, what's wrong with you?

55
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,000
This is my younger sister.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,620
She looks similar to me

57
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,260
but she has a mole under his right eye

58
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,140
and I don't have it.

59
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:30,999
Senior Sister said Senior Brother drew a painting of her so he could always look at her.

60
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,840
I didn't believe her.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
But...

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,080
But I didn't expect it to be my younger sister.

63
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,760
When she first saw this painting,

64
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,600
she only said I was the one on this painting

65
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,560
but she didn't realize the mole.

66
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,980
Until that moment before her death,

67
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,360
she realized the one on the painting was my younger sister instead.

68
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,840
That was why she said "It's not her" three times.

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,760
I understand now.

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,700
Both of you were in love with Master

71
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,199
but he had someone else in his heart.

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,039
Younger Martial Aunt, is your younger sister still alive?

73
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,479
Master wanted me to use this painting to learn new skills.

74
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,119
Is she living in Dali's Wuliang Mountain?

75
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,680
No.

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,200
The person he wanted you to look for was me.

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,800
Your master and I lived in the cave at the bank of Sword Lake

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,500
at Dali's Wuliang Mountain.

79
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,020
We lived a happy life that was better than the gods.

80
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,460
I even gave birth to a cute daughter for him.

81
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,420
So beautiful.

82
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,440
Senior Brother, you carved this jade statue to look like me.

83
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,640
Isn't it happier for you to have fun with me

84
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,820
instead of looking at this jade statue every day?

85
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,560
Senior Brother?

86
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,040
Senior Brother?

87
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,700
Senior Brother!

88
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,020
What are you trying to do?

89
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,000
What am I trying to do?

90
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,100
You are always looking at this statue

91
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,880
while ignoring me, a living person.

92
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,639
If I don't destroy it, do you think I'll allow it to destroy our lives?

93
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,800
Fine.

94
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,180
If you can't leave this statue,

95
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,579
just fall in love with this statue and elope with it.

96
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,619
Senior Brother, you are smart

97
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,840
but you are also infatuated.

98
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,480
Why would you fall in love with the jade statue you carved

99
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,379
instead of your senior sister who speaks, laughs, moves, and loves you?

100
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:20,300
You accepted that jade statue as my little sister, didn't you?

101
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,519
I was jealous of the jade statue.

102
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,380
I went out to find many handsome young men

103
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,160
and flirted with them in front of you.

104
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,420
You got angry and left because of that.

105
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,200
You won't come back anymore.

106
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,140
Senior Brother.

107
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,720
You didn't have to be sad.

108
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Those handsome young men...

109
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,940
had all been killed by me

110
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,280
and thrown to the bottom of the valley.

111
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,660
You said the person in the painting was me.

112
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,980
That was why you asked your disciple

113
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,840
to bring the painting and find me at Wuliang Mountain.

114
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,480
Perhaps you didn't even know

115
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,240
who the person was that you really loved.

116
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,540
Why would you keep staring at the jade statue?

117
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,080
I finally understand now.

118
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,640
Buddha says...

119
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,600
it's impossible to escape

120
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,000
from the three poisons. Greed, Hatred, and Ignorance.

121
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,400
Master, Martial Aunt, and Younger Martial Aunt

122
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,220
excelled in martial arts.

123
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,619
However, all three of you were caught within these three poisons.

124
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,840
Their pain and worry in their hearts

125
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,960
are no different...

126
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,740
than a mere mortal.

127
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,180
Greed.

128
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,580
Hatred.

129
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,180
Ignorance.

130
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,660
Yes.

131
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,079
Greed is wanting everything.

132
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,900
Hatred is having different emotions.

133
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,380
What is ignorance

134
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,660
if it's not being caught in love

135
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,440
and being trapped...

136
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,260
inside it?

137
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,280
I've been fighting withmy senior sister for our whole lives

138
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,620
but we were in fact just two pitiful souls.

139
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,360
We were lied to by this scum.

140
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,020
Miss A'Zi, you are afraid of the cold. You shouldn't catch a cold.

141
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,940
You should wear more layers.

142
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,279
This is a weakness caused by my previous injuries.

143
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,120
How would you know?

144
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,340
I heard it from the doctor.

145
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:33,719
He said your body is weak and is afraid of the cold.

146
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,180
I see.

147
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,660
Here. Have some water.

148
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,320
Miss A'Zi, you are an active person.

149
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,959
I'm sure you must be bored by staying at this Beggars' Sect Branch every day.

150
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,619
Why don't I bring you out for a walk when you get better?

151
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:57,839
Besides that, the hill behind here has various poisonous insects.

152
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,580
I'm sure you'll be happy if you see them.

153
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,000
I can't see them. How would I be happy?

154
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,339
It's my fault for making you angry.

155
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,580
Miss, I will accompany you to do anything you want in the future.

156
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,439
Take me to the streets then.

157
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,259
Although I can't see anything, it's still good to hear the bustling noise.

158
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,120
Sure.

159
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,500
Let me take you to rest first.

160
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,480
Be careful.

161
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,720
Be careful.

162
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,499
Well then, rest early, Miss.

163
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:58,840
I'll take you to the streets tomorrow.

164
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,500
That's not right.

165
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,740
It was suspicious enough

166
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,159
when he said he was just passing by and rescued me from Master.

167
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:27,099
It's strange that he knew so much about my condition

168
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,180
including the fact that I love poisonous insects.

169
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,239
Perhaps he is an enemy who is trying to get revenge while I'm blind but failed?

170
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,919
But he doesn't feel like an enemy since he listened to me and was so hardworking.

171
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,040
Rather, it felt like...

172
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,640
Rather, it felt like...

173
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,780
My name is You Tanzhi.

174
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,780
I'm not Ugly Metal Iron Clown.

175
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,780
No! That's impossible!

176
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,960
Ugly Metal Iron Clown wasn't so good at martial arts.

177
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,780
Besides, he was poisoned to death by my ice silkworm. I saw it myself.

178
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,340
How would he appear here?

179
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,700
No way.

180
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,640
Regardless of who he is,

181
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,680
I can't stay here anymore.

182
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,140
I need to find a way to inform Brother-in-Law.

183
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,740
He will definitely come and rescue me.

184
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,619
Miss, the town is busy today.

185
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:41,379
Look! This is a vendor that makes sugar figures.

186
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,440
There's a gift vendor here.

187
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,599
There's also rouge, gouache, and perfume that girls like.

188
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,780
I can't see anyway.

189
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,279
Why do I need them for?

190
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,500
Sugar-coated haws!

191
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,619
It's my fault. Don't be mad at me.

192
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:59,959
Fragrant and sweet sugar-coated haws!

193
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,140
Brother Zhuang, is there a sugar-coated haws seller?

194
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,900
Yes. He's in front.

195
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,519
- Buy one for me then.
- Sure.

196
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,460
- Delicious sugar-coated haws!
- Oh, right.

197
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,840
Miss A'Zi, your vision is bad right now.

198
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,060
Why don't you stay here? Here.

199
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,700
Careful.

200
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,659
This is a stall. Wait here for me to return.

201
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:24,519
Sure. I'll wait for you.

202
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,980
What should I write?

203
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,980
What should I write so Brother-in-Law knows I'm in danger?

204
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,240
Got it.

205
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,340
Miss A'Zi!

206
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,320
Miss A'Zi.

207
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,440
Why did you come here, Miss Zi?

208
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,959
I think the sun is too big. It's hot.

209
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:09,739
I bought you the sugar-coated haws. Here.

210
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,300
I'm feeling dizzy. I'm so dizzy.

211
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,540
Miss A'Zi, what's wrong?

212
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,940
- I'm feeling dizzy.
- Miss A'Zi.

213
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,239
Miss, are you all right?

214
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,500
I'll take you back.

215
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,940
Miss.

216
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,870
[<-- Duan]

217
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,480
Brother Zhuang.

218
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,079
- Brother Zhuang, are you here?
- Miss A'Zi.

219
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,159
- Miss A'Zi.
- What is this place, Brother Zhuang?

220
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,000
You are back in your room.

221
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,940
You fainted just now so I brought you back.

222
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,400
How is it? Are you feeling better?

223
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:56,499
I just felt dizzy and wanted to lean on the wall to rest.

224
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:59,420
But I can't see a thing.

225
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,020
Luckily, you got there in time.

226
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,600
Miss A'Zi, let me teach you an inner energy mantra.

227
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,079
It can help you to recuperate.

228
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,700
Follow me.

229
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,660
Why should I learn that? Don't waste your strength.

230
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,140
It's not a waste of my strength.

231
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,900
This inner energy mantra is amazing.

232
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,620
It'll definitely be beneficial for you.

233
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,800
Since you are blind, I'll guide you while holding you.

234
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,300
Is that fine?

235
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,779
Miss A'Zi, let's begin.

236
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,160
My scriptures!

237
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,160
Brother Zhuang!

238
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,940
Return to me my scriptures!

239
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,940
This is Shaolin Temple's "Yijin Jing."

240
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,980
How is it yours?

241
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,239
Since it is now in my hands, that means it is fated to be mine.

242
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:37,820
Farewell.

243
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,680
Stop!

244
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,380
Miss A'Zi is alone in her room.

245
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,860
She is blind, too.

246
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,400
What if she's in danger?

247
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,820
Kneel!

248
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,039
The whole Lingjiu Palace is under our control.

249
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:04,760
All of you shouldn't struggle anymore.

250
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,700
Don't think that we wouldn't kill all of you

251
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,060
if you won't tell us where the antidote for the Mortality Talisman is.

252
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,739
- Don't expect Tonglao to rescue you as well.
- Kneel!

253
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:14,420
Kneel!

254
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,759
- Li Qiushui,
-Kneel!

255
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,680
tore Tonglao's body into eight pieces and threw them down the valley.

256
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,519
I simply picked up one of the pieces.

257
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,780
Take a look and see

258
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,880
if it's real or fake.

259
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,360
- Madam!
- Madam!

260
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,340
Madam!

261
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,760
Madam!

262
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,879
- It's the Mortality Talisman!
- It's the Mortality Talisman!

263
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,040
The Mortality Talisman is in effect!

264
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,399
What should we do?

265
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,759
It's the Mortality Talisman! The Mortality Talisman is going to kill us!

266
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,399
Brother! Calm down, don't panic.

267
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,599
Let me seal your acupoint.

268
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,119
We'll think of a way to treat it, all right? Brother!

269
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,819
Miss Wang, you are an expert in the world's martial arts. Do you have a way to save him?

270
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:19,200
This guy has gone mad without using any martial arts moves.

271
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,400
I have no way to save him even if I wanted to.

272
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,620
Tonglao is dead.

273
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,380
As long as you give me the antidote of the Mortality Talisman,

274
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,439
rest assured that no one will trouble you.

275
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,860
It's not that I won't say it.

276
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,700
In fact... In fact, no one knows where it is.

277
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,380
Master was always secretive.

278
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,580
How would she let slaves like us know?

279
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,599
I think all of you can't wait to die. You darn servants!

280
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,140
I'll hit you to death!

281
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,720
Brother!

282
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,600
Who is it?

283
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,800
Who dares to stop me?

284
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,300
A pine cone? Tonglao?

285
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Tong... Tonglao!

286
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,000
- Tonglao?
- Where?

287
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,200
- Tonglao is here! She's still alive!
- Where?

288
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,900
Master.

289
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,000
- Brother Murong.
- Where is Tonglao?

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,900
- Master!
- Where is she?

291
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
Who is he?

292
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Quick! Bring the disciples from the eight branches to fight them.

293
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Yes!

294
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Thank you for rescuing us.

295
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,300
Brother, are you okay?

296
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Younger brother. Younger brother!

297
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,800
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

298
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
Who beat you up?

299
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,800
Tell me! I'll avenge you!

300
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,200
It's all right as long as you've recovered.

301
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Little... Monk.

302
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Tong... Tonglao.

303
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,200
She...

304
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,600
Where...

305
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Where is she?

306
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,600
Everything's fine.

307
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,400
Senior Tonglao wasn't torn into eight pieces.

308
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm not a little monk anymore.

309
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,900
Who are you?

310
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,400
Elder Wu, did Tonglao die or not?

311
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,600
Everyone! My name is Xu Zhu.

312
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,800
Tonglao did indeed pass away..

313
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,100
I know all of you used to be her subordinates.

314
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,000
You had some grudges with her.

315
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,400
However, she has passed away.

316
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,600
She's no longer here.

317
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,800
I hope all of you can come with me

318
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,600
to pay your respects to Madam Tonglao

319
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
and bow to her in front of her grave.

320
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,200
Let's wipe all your personal grudges away, all right?

321
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Brat! Who are you?

322
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
How dare you ask us to bow to that old bandit woman's grave?

323
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,500
Exactly!

324
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,400
How did that old bandit woman die?

325
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
Was she killed by her Junior Sister, Li Qiushui?

326
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:01,100
Madam Tonglao was killed by Senior Li Qiushui.

327
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,900
Madam Tonglao was an expert in martial arts

328
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,400
but she couldn't escape her fate of dying as well.

329
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Little Monk, when Tonglao died, were you with her?

330
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,600
Yes.

331
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,400
I was by her side for the last few months.

332
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,600
What about the mantra to overcome the Mortality Talisman?

333
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
Mantra?

334
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,500
Mr. Wu.

335
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,400
What are you doing?

336
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,300
You're tickling me.

337
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
My painting.

338
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,300
Who is in the painting?

339
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,500
Isn't this Miss Wang?

340
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,800
- He's carrying a painting.
- It's a lady.

341
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
Miss Wang!

342
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
Who is this?

343
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,100
That Little Monk is carrying a painting of a lady!

344
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,900
Cousin?

345
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,100
Little Monk, what did Tonglao say to you before she died?

346
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,400
Why do you want to know that?

347
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,300
Don't mind me! Just tell me!

348
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,200
What did she say?

349
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,800
All right.

350
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Before Tonglao's death, she was...

351
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,100
It's not her.

352
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,400
"It's not her."

353
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,300
- It's not her.
- "It's not her."

354
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,200
It's not her!

355
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,300
- That's all?
- That's all.

356
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,200
What do you mean?

357
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,000
What else did Tonglao say before her death? This old bandit woman.

358
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Senior, I'm warning you.

359
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,900
Madam Tonglao has passed away.

360
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,000
You need to respect her.

361
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,200
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

362
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,600
You won't forgive me? I think you have gotten tired of living.

363
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,000
I'll show you the might of Island Owner Yun today!

364
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,900
Get hold of him!

365
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,500
- It's Zhuo Bufan!
- Zhuo Bufan is here!

366
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,200
- Zhuo Bufan is here?
- Zhuo Bufan?

367
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,100
Little Brother, before Tonglao's death, what else did she say

368
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,700
besides "It's not her" and laughing loudly?

369
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,800
She said...

370
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,700
Do you want to meet the girl in your dream?

371
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
If I have no lingering memories,

372
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,600
I'd be able to show you the path to that girl in your dream.

373
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
Little Brother,

374
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,900
what did Tonglao say to you?

375
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,400
Tell me.

376
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,500
I won't trouble you.

377
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,400
I will even give you a huge reward.

378
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Mr. Zhuo, I can't say.

379
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,500
I can't tell you that.

380
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,400
Why not?

381
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,600
Mr. Zhuo, what she said was only related to myself alone.

382
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,900
It was not related to anyone of you here.

383
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,700
So, I can't tell all of you that.

384
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,000
Great!

385
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
What an amazing martial arts technique!

386
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,000
This Zhou's Sword Technique is the ultimate technique

387
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,600
of the Yizihui Sword Sect in Jiangyang, Fujian.

388
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,400
This Mr. Zhuo must be an expert of Yizihui Sword Sect.

389
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Miss, you have great vision.

390
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,300
You recognized my technique and sect.

391
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,100
Little Brother, tell me Tonglao's dying words alone.

392
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,600
I will teach you my sword techniques.

393
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,800
Zhuo Bufan!

394
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,600
What do you mean?

395
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,000
You are trying to learn the secrets of the Mortality Talisman to control us?

396
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,400
Exactly!

397
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,800
Kid, what did Tonglao say to you?

398
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Tell me honestly.

399
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,600
Otherwise, you'll have to suffer

400
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,400
from being shredded by our swords.

401
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,700
Little Brother, you don't have to be afraid.

402
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,800
You just have to tell me Tonglao's last words.

403
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,000
If another person finds out,

404
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I will not teach you my sword techniques.

405
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,100
Mr. Zhuo, I really can't tell you that.

406
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,000
I won't tell you even if you beat me to death.

407
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Besides, your sword technique is really amazing, Mr. Zhuo.

408
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,100
But I don't want to learn it.

409
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,500
Kid, you have guts!

410
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:55,020
There's no use in learning his sword technique. Am I right, everyone?

411
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
Everyone, that's not what I meant.

412
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,900
I was a disciple of Shaolin Temple.

413
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,300
I can't learn the techniques of other sects.

414
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,600
I've already learned two techniques from other sects.

415
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,300
I shouldn't learn others' techniques anymore.

416
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,800
All of you... I...

417
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,600
All of you...

418
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,400
I...

419
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,000
- That's not what I meant.
- Little Brother.

420
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,200
I understand everything about your troubles.

421
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,100
Sorry to trouble you. I'll do it myself.

422
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,200
A handsome man and a beautiful lady.

423
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,400
A match made in heaven.

424
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,600
Unfortunately, someone is coming in between.

425
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It's not easy to make your wish come true.

426
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,000
How about this. I'll handle this alone

427
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and arrange this girl as your wife.

428
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Tonight, you'll spend your wedding night here

429
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
at Lingjiu Palace.

430
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,500
Miss Wang, be careful!

431
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,800
Young Master Duan!

432
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,300
- Young Master Duan!
- Young Master Duan.

433
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,400
Young Master Duan!

434
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
Are you all right?

435
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,400
Young Master Duan.

436
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Miss Wang, I'm going to die.

437
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,800
I wish you well with Young Master Murong.

438
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,000
I... I...

439
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
Young Master.

440
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,600
Don't say that.

441
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,800
You'll be fine.

442
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,000
Because of me, you did...

443
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,300
Miss Wang.

444
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Are you crying for me?

445
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,800
Miss Wang, I will live my life like this willingly

446
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,600
even if I'll be pierced again and again by his sword.

447
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,200
Young Master Duan.

448
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,000
Young Master Duan.

449
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,100
I'm going to die soon.

450
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Miss Wang.

451
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,200
You won't die.

452
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,000
Miss Wang, you don't have to be so sad.

453
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Young Master Duan's injury will be healed in three to four days.

454
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Are you telling the truth?

455
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,100
He won't die. He will recover in three to four days. He doesn't even need any medicine.

456
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,700
Brat, you're digging your own grave!

457
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,200
He's amazing.

458
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,800
You can't even defeat Zhuo Bufan.

459
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,400
Right?

460
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
He was hiding his skills.

461
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
He is so strong.

462
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Everyone!

463
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
This person was close to Tonglao.

464
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,400
We can't let him escape.

465
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Let's attack together.

466
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
Capture him first and deal with him later.

467
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
All right.

468
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Kill him!

469
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,500
Kill him!

470
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,200
What are you doing?

471
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Oh no. I hit them too hard.

472
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,000
Mister, I'm sorry.

473
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm returning your sword to you.

474
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,600
I'm hunting hawks every day

475
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,300
but I didn't expect to be blinded by a hawk today.

476
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,800
Little Brother, you have great skills indeed.

477
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,400
Senior.

478
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,400
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

479
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,200
We'll meet again in the future.

480
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
Hold it!

481
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,700
What kind of place do you think Lingjiu Palace is?

482
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,600
Do you think you can come and leave as you please?

483
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,900
Four Servants of Madam Tonglao greet Master Xu Zhu.

484
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,400
We are late to welcome you.

485
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,600
Please forgive us, Master.

486
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,700
Spare the formalities. Stand up.

487
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,299
Stand up. That's all right.

488
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:54,640
Thank you, Master.

489
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,299
Master, we are quadruplets.

490
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,700
Madam Tonglao named me Mei Jian.

491
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,600
The three of them are Lan Jian,

492
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,700
Zhu Jian, and Ju Jian.

493
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,700
We met the disciples of other branches

494
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,400
and found out about the situation.

495
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,200
I've already shut the gate.

496
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,800
How should we punish these men who dare to cause chaos here?

497
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,900
Please instruct us, Master.

498
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,200
Mortality Talisman!

499
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,300
The Mortality Talisman is in effect again!

500
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,000
What should we do?

501
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,800
It's so painful!

502
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
Look.

503
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,500
The Mortality Talisman came out!

504
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
He forced it out.

505
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,900
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

506
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,100
I'm fine!

507
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,200
He's fine!

508
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,100
Benefactor, you've saved my life.

509
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,000
In the future, I'll give everything to obey your orders!

510
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,600
Please stand up.

511
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Thank you, Benefactor.

512
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,600
- Benefactor!
- Benefactor!

513
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,400
Please help us!

514
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,500
Save us!

515
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,600
Save us!

516
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,700
Help us!

517
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,500
- Master!
- Master.

518
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,700
Master, be careful.

519
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
- Benefactor.
- Remove it for us.

520
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,700
Everyone! Listen to me, everyone.

521
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,500
I know how to remove the Mortality Talisman.

522
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Just tell me which acupoint it has been planted on.

523
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,000
I will remove it for every one of you. All right?

524
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,800
- Yes!
- Mine's over here!

525
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,500
All right.

526
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,400
Everyone. Listen to me!

527
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,900
Be quiet!

528
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,300
You are too noisy.

529
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,800
Mr. Xu Zhu doesn't know where to start from.

530
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Yes.

531
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,300
Mr. Xu Zhu.

532
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,400
Speak over here. Come.

533
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
Everyone, I'm not talented.

534
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,500
Thanks to Madam Tonglao,

535
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,600
I learned the way to remove the Mortality Talisman.

536
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,000
As long as I know which acupoint it is planted on,

537
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,800
I will be able to cure you.

538
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,600
If you don't know which acupoint it is planted on,

539
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,300
I'm still lacking in the ways of recognizing acupoints.

540
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,800
However, as long as you don't panic and give me some time,

541
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,200
I will definitely find a way until I cure every one of you.

542
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,000
Great!

543
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,000
Go and help!

544
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
All of you, hurry!

00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,400
♫ In this life, no matter who is laughing at me ♫

547
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,800
♫ I will not go mad or be unreasonable ♫

548
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,200
♫ I have crossed seas and mountains of hardships ♫

549
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,300
♫ Everything has it's earnings ♫

550
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,600
♫ All the things that happened in the past are as clear as ink ♫

551
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,300
♫ I wait for it to run dry and then start to tint ♫

552
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,800
♫ All worldly desires are like mountains and valleys ♫

553
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,500
♫ Borrowing rain's tears as the water rushes out  ♫

554
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,400
♫ If you come across me in this life,
who cares if it's life or death in the end ♫

555
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:06,000
♫ I might as well become a river ♫

556
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,600
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

557
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,800
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

558
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,000
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

559
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,200
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful ♫

560
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,000
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

561
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:35,600
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

562
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,800
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

563
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,200
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful ♫

564
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,800
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

565
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,200
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

566
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,400
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

567
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,800
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful ♫

568
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,200
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

569
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:19,000
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

570
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,400
Qiao Feng, Brother Qiao is my sworn brother.

571
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,400
He is a real hero, and his martial arts are incomparable.

572
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,300
It is only a pity that he isn't here.

573
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,100
Otherwise, the three of us could become sworn brothers

574
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,800
and figure everything out together. How great would that be.

575
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,400
Young Master Duan wants to become sworn brothers with me?

576
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,800
You think of me highly.

577
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,800
Then let's become sworn brothers first.

578
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
And then when we find Brother Qiao,

579
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
we can do the ceremony once more! What do you think?
