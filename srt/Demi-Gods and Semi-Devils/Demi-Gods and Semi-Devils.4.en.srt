[Episode 4]

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,100
So, Chief Wang was the one

14
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,200
who told you to use the secret letter to exercise control over Qiao Feng.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
This matter is of utmost importance.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,700
My dear, I had no choice but to tell you

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,000
about this secret since we encountered each other.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Old Chief has emphasized the importance of this secret to me.

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
This concerns the Beggars' Sect and the fate of the entire pugilist world.

20
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,200
He told me that I mustn't let anyone else know about it.

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,000
This Qiao Feng is the disciple of Chief Wang.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,800
And he's the successor to the Beggars' Sect, chosen by Chief Wang himself.

23
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,400
What exactly is inside the secret letter?

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Why are we being so careful about it?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Regarding that, I don't know about it either.

26
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
He's passing the chief position to him

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,500
while giving you the secret letter.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm sure there's more to it than meets the eye.

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,000
Aren't you curious about it?

30
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,900
I'm a man of my words.

31
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,400
Since I've promised to help Old Chief out,

32
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,000
I will never open the secret letter unless I have to.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,300
By the way, you women have a loose tongue

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,400
and often ruin one's secret.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,100
My dear, please keep this a secret between us.

36
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,300
Please don't tell anyone else about it.

37
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,600
Fine.

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
The Shennong Sect is over there.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Later, we'll sneak by them and run away after we snatch Zhong Ling. Okay?

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,800
Your Black Rose is swift.

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
They won't be able to catch up with you.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
What about you then?

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
They forced me to take the Heartbreak Grass.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,300
They said I would die of its poison within seven days.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,700
I need to grab the antidote before I leave.

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,900
So that's the case.

47
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,800
Why did you come back and report this to me

48
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
instead of looking for the antidote?

49
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,600
Initially, I thought Black Rose was swift enough

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,100
that I won't take up much time when I report this situation to you.

51
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,600
Say, are you just a kind person or are you dumb?

52
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,800
I'm afraid I'm a kind dummy.

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,600
How do we acquire your antidote?

54
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,000
Initially, I wanted to use the antidote for the lightning ferret

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,200
to exchange for the antidote for the Heartbreak Grass.

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,400
But now, they're unable to get the antidote for the lightning ferret.

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm afraid it would be hard for me

58
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,000
to acquire the antidote for the Heartbreak Grass.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Miss, do you have any solutions to this?

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's force them to give it to us.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We'll take both Zhong Ling and the antidote.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,430
- Miss Mu, are we really going to do this the hard way?
- Yes.

63
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,800
Won't it be dangerous?

64
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Do you have another solution then?

65
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Who's there? Why are you here?

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,800
Where's Sikong Xuan? Ask him to come out.

67
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,200
Yes, Madam.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I didn't know that the sacred envoys of Lingjiu Palace were coming.

69
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,100
Sorry for the offense. Please pardon me.

70
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,200
Since you've recognized us,

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,800
you better ask Sikong Xuan to come out quickly.

72
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,700
Yes, yes.

73
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,900
What does he mean by a sacred envoy of Lingjiu Palace?

74
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,800
I guess he mistook us for someone else

75
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,900
because of our disguise.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,400
What kind of place is Lingjiu Palace?

77
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
Why are they so afraid of them?

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
Zhong Ling once told me that Sikong Xuan

79
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,200
came under the order of Lingjiu Palace's Tianshan Tonglao,

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,000
to attack Sword Lake Palace on Limitless Mountain.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,800
Since they mistook us for them,

82
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,400
why don't we use this to our advantage?

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
All right.

84
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,400
Chief! Chief!

85
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,300
Chief, the sacred envoys of Lingjiu Palace are here!

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
The sacred envoys came back to us?

87
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Did they say anything?

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
They only told you to come out and meet them.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,200
Tonglao loves to speak in reverse.

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,500
The more gentle the

91
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
sacred envoys of Lingjiu Palace are,

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,200
the more serious the matter is.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,800
This is bad.

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm sure they're blaming me for doing a bad job.

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,200
This won't do. Let's go.

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,600
Let's welcome the sacred envoys.

97
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Everyone, follow me.

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's welcome the sacred envoys together!

99
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,600
I, Sikong Xuan,

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,000
greet the sacred envoys.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,200
Long live Tonglao.

102
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Speak up.

103
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,000
Where's Zhong Ling that little girl? Bring her out to meet me.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Bring her here.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Yes, Chief.

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's go!

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
Hurry!

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Release her immediately.

109
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,300
Release her.

110
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,800
- Yes, Chief.
- Hurry.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,200
Zhong Ling, come here.

112
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
Who are you?

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Behave yourself in front of the sacred envoys.

114
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,900
Just do what they tell you.

115
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Behave yourself!

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,500
Sikong Xuan, bring me the antidote for the Heartbreak Grass.

117
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,700
Take out the antidote.

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,400
Go now.

119
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,519
Sacred envoy, thank you for accepting our contribution.

120
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,359
This antidote needs to be taken three times.

121
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,999
Take one dosage each day.

122
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,300
Take one mace of it for each dosage.

123
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,800
Old man, what will happen to Brother Duan

124
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
if you give her the antidote?

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,300
You promised Brother Duan that you'd give him the antidote.

126
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,200
Shut up.

127
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,800
Zhong Ling, your Brother Duan won't die yet.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
Sacred envoys,

129
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
my brothers and I

130
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,400
were bitten by her poisonous ferret.

131
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,700
We're seriously injured.

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,800
Sacred envoys, please show mercy.

133
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,300
Sister, you should give them

134
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,000
some of Tonglao's elixirs.

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,100
Just give them some!

136
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Your poison will be neutralized once you consume them.

137
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Tonglao is mighty and powerful.

138
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Sacred envoys, thank you for the antidotes.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,200
I've failed to conquer Sword Lake Palace last time.

140
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,000
This time, I will surely atone for my mistake.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Sacred envoys, please speak up for me in front of Tonglao.

142
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,500
Understood.

143
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,300
You guys should return now.

144
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,400
In my opinion, you guys don't need to attack Sword Lake Palace anymore.

145
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,000
All of you better retreat.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
Retreat immediately.

147
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,800
It is my fault. I deserve to die.

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
I deserve to die for it!

149
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,700
Let's go!

150
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,600
- Farewell, sacred envoys.
- Farewell, sacred envoys.

151
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,400
- Log live Tianshan Tonglao.
- Long live Tianshan Tonglao.

152
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,700
Sister Mu! Thank you for rescuing me together with your sister.

153
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,400
I need to wait here for Brother Duan.

154
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,600
Sister, can you share some of the antidotes

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,300
for the Heartbreak Grass with me?

156
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,500
You don't need to wait anymore.

157
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,600
That Duan guy will never come for you.

158
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,200
That won't happen! Brother Duan said he would save me.

159
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,500
Even if my father doesn't come to save me,

160
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,000
Brother Duan will come and save me.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
All men are liars.

162
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Can you believe in his words?

163
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
Brother Duan would  never lie to me.

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,600
Miss Zhong, your Brother Duan didn't lie to you!

165
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,300
I knew you wouldn't lie to me.

166
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,000
Behave yourselves.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
Sister Mu, why are you guys together?

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,000
And why did both of you come and save me together?

169
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,000
Miss Zhong, we can talk on the road.

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,100
We shouldn't let Sikong Xuan catch us.

171
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Da Yuan,

172
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
the more I think about it,

173
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,300
the more I feel uneasy about it.

174
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,200
Chief Wang actually handed this task to you.

175
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,400
And he said that if something happens within the sect,

176
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
he told you to seek the help of Shaolin

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,000
instead of resolving it within the sect itself.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
What does that mean?

179
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,200
That means this matter is serious enough

180
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
that no one within the Beggars' Sect

181
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
is able to resolve it.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Say, Qiao Feng is courageous and heroic.

183
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,600
What kind of terrible deed

184
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,400
will he be capable of?

185
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
My dear, stop thinking about it.

186
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,800
It hasn't happened yet.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,600
There's no use in overthinking it.

188
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,400
This matter is very peculiar.

189
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,600
You just agreed to it without making careful considerations.

190
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
What if you become implicated because of this?

191
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,700
Since Chief Wang has entrusted this task to you,

192
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,000
in my opinion,

193
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,800
why don't you open the letter and read its content

194
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,400
so that you can prepare yourself for it in the future?

195
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,300
My dear, I know you're worried about me,

196
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,900
but, as martial artists, we keep our words.

197
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,700
Even if something were to happen and I were to be implicated,

198
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,700
it is one of my responsibilities and I deserve the consequences.

199
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,439
You're too honest.

200
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,859
When it comes to your ranks and experiences,

201
00:11:41,859 --> 00:11:43,519
you're as good as Qiao Feng.

202
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,039
If you become the chief of Beggars' Sect,

203
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,479
I'll be the wife of a chief.

204
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,799
It'll be a great honor.

205
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,599
There's no need for us to be worried over small matters like these.

206
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,319
My martial arts and magnanimity are way below Qiao Feng's.

207
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,039
I'm utterly convinced that he should be the chief instead of me.

208
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,520
Don't ever mention this again in the future.

209
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,120
Rest now.

210
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,779
So that's the case.

211
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,780
Sister Mu, thank you for saving Brother Duan.

212
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,819
I really don't know how to repay you for that.

213
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,979
I was the one who wanted to save him. It has nothing to do with you.

214
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,739
Duan Yu, you don't need Zhong Ling to tell you about my name.

215
00:12:28,739 --> 00:12:30,559
I'll tell you myself.

216
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,360
My name is Mu Wanqing.

217
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,059
A beautiful scene of water and trees, with eyes as clear as water.

218
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:39,299
You have a great surname and name.

219
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,919
Better than being you. You're like a piece of wood.

220
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,660
You have a bad reputation.

221
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,919
Brother Duan, you're really kind to me.

222
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,120
It's a pity that your ferret is missing.

223
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,740
It's fine. I'll find it myself once those evil people are gone.

224
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,879
You can accompany me to find it then, okay?

225
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,779
Sure. I'll accompany you if you come and look for me.

226
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:59,479
You're not allowed to go.

227
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,399
She can go and find her own ferret by herself.

228
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,000
Why are you joining her?

229
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,879
- But, I...
- Zhong Ling, let me ask you something.

230
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,719
Is your birthday on the fifth of February?

231
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,899
Yes.

232
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:11,380
Sister Mu, how did you know about that?

233
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,780
Duan Yu, you still dare to say that you didn't lie to me?

234
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,060
We should hurry.

235
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,619
You two are really stubborn.

236
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,639
You two actually followed me all the way here.

237
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,319
You've got pretty good patience, I suppose.

238
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,399
You wretch!  You'll never be able to escape us no matter where you go!

239
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,820
Miss Mu!

240
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,800
Be careful!

241
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,400
Brother Duan, let's go!

242
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,799
Zhong Ling! Miss Mu is being attacked!

243
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,299
We can't just leave her alone!

244
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,140
Dummy! Even if we stay here, we'll be unable to help Sister Mu!

245
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,000
No, I won't leave!

246
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,899
Zhong Ling, you can scram if you want to! You're not allowed to take him with you!

247
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,399
I'll shoot your eyes if you try to drag him away!

248
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,179
Miss Mu, behind you! Someone's behind you! Look out!

249
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,780
Miss Mu!

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,799
Miss Zhong, you should return first.

251
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,659
Miss Mu is being attacked right now.

252
00:15:11,659 --> 00:15:13,580
We need to save her.

253
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,359
Miss Zhong, I would've been dead long ago

254
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,959
if it weren't for Miss Mu.

255
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,359
Now, it makes no difference even if I were to die earlier.

256
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,800
- You want to save her even if you'll die?
- Yes.

257
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,280
- Are you sure?
- Yes

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,459
I know Miss Mu is fierce,

259
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,719
but she has saved me on numerous occasions.

260
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,159
She even helped me to save you.

261
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,179
From this, we can see that she's a kind-hearted person on the inside, even if she's cold on the outside.

262
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:38,559
I'm sure she's a good person.

263
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,840
Even if a stranger were in trouble, I'll try to save them,

264
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,459
not to mention my benefactor.

265
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:45,999
This time, I can't leave Miss Mu by herself.

266
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,559
For me, can you not go?

267
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,199
Miss Zhong, since I'm here to save you,

268
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,580
of course I need to save her as well.

269
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,319
Brother Duan, take care then.

270
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,739
You have no way to escape! Who's there?

271
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,800
- Miss Mu, quickly run!
- Let go of me!

272
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,380
Miss Mu, just run!

273
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,399
Why did you come back?

274
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,859
Miss, I'm still alive because of you.

275
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:48,239
Now that you're in trouble, of course I can't just leave you alone!

276
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,080
Miss Mu!

277
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,340
They're over there! After them!

278
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,299
Hold me tightly!

279
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,640
Miss Mu.

280
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,440
Miss Mu!

281
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
Release the arrows! Kill those two wretches!

282
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,519
Miss Mu, they're here! Quickly run!

283
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:58,959
Just stay over there!

284
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,020
Wait for us! We'll rip you two apart!

285
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,460
- Release the arrows!
- Let's go!

286
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
Kill them!

287
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,800
Miss Mu! Miss Mu!

288
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,119
Miss Mu!

289
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,659
What should we do? Miss Mu!

290
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:26,879
The Healing Elixir. I have the Healing Elixir with me.

291
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:29,579
Miss Mu, are you okay?

292
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,079
Miss Mu. Miss Mu!

293
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,179
The Healing Elixir! The Healing Elixir!

294
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,559
This... Is this a rouge or the Healing Elixir?

295
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,999
This is the only thing she has. I need to give it a try.

296
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,159
Miss Mu, saving your life is more important.

297
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,840
Sorry for the offense.

298
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,999
I've long heard about the Prince of Chu recruiting for soldiers. I'm sure he did it for a reason.

299
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,899
But the imperial court thought that it was a fluke.

300
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,700
Look at our current situation.

301
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,559
Our fates depend on each other.

302
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,479
Even if Song wasn't planning on invading our nation,

303
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,260
we should've been prepared for the others.

304
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,039
If we had stationed our soldiers in this city,

305
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,039
the Liao Army would've never been able to invade our nation.

306
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,720
What should we do now?

307
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,759
Our number one priority is to notify the imperial court

308
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,461
and ask them to transfer the soldiers here in order to deal with them.

309
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,680
I've asked someone to send a letter to Commander-in-Chief Han

310
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,399
and asked him to guard Yanmen Pass.

311
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,519
I've asked the imperial court to send us some reinforcements as well.

312
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,700
As for the Beggars' Sect,

313
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,199
I've sent a letter to the four elders

314
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,080
and told my disciples to prepare themselves.

315
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,659
They will assist us when we need help.

316
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,259
I've told our comrades in the pugilist world to come to the border of Liao

317
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:09,479
as soon as possible in order to defend against our enemies.

318
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,720
Yes, Sir!

319
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,039
Hurry!

320
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
All right!

321
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,460
Don't come up!

322
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,100
I... I killed someone.

323
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,759
This... This is...

324
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,499
Someone is trying to climb up. Is that right?

325
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,060
I made a mistake

326
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,140
and I killed someone by accident.

327
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,119
I'm sure he has a family.

328
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,019
I'm sure they'll be heartbroken when they hear about this news.

329
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:39,239
How is that fair to them?

330
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,859
You have a family as well, am I right?

331
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,239
I do have parents.

332
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,119
But I don't have a wife or any children.

333
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:49,500
If they climb up the hill,

334
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,999
they will surely kill us, am I right?

335
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,140
Most probably. Most probably.

336
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,719
So, you would rather let others kill you than kill others?

337
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,279
Miss Mu!

338
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,959
I would never kill anyone if it was only for my sake.

339
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,739
It's just that I don't want them to hurt you.

340
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,479
- Why?
- Because...

341
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,239
Because you saved me. That's why I must save you.

342
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,840
That's it.

343
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,039
Let me ask you a question.

344
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,519
You need to be honest with me.

345
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,079
If you lie to me, I will shoot an arrow through your heart.

346
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,180
- Did you remove my veil when I was unconscious?
- No, I didn't.

347
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,299
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

348
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,159
Back then, I only wanted to treat the wound on your back.

349
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,920
That's why it never crossed my mind.

350
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,380
My wound?

351
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,279
You...

352
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,839
You actually treated my wound?

353
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,719
Yes.

354
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,659
Miss, your rouge is really effective.

355
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,920
I didn't expect it to be the Healing Elixir.

356
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,119
Scum!

357
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,219
How dare you touch my skin and look at my bare back?

358
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:22,760
You!

359
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,240
Miss Mu.

360
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,640
Miss Mu? Miss Mu.

361
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,559
Did you hear about it?

362
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,959
The people of Liao are trying to invade us again.

363
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,539
That's right. They've reached Yanmen Pass in just a short while.

364
00:24:56,539 --> 00:24:58,879
Chief Qiao of the Beggars' Sect and numerous heroes have headed over there

365
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,159
to help our soldiers out.

366
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,639
Reverend Xuan Ji was training outside.

367
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,479
He went there as soon as he heard about it.

368
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,760
Reverend Xuan Bei is going to head there with his disciples as well.

369
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,319
Have you guys understood the sutra that I've explained today?

370
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,439
Yes, Reverend.

371
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,299
When it comes to the Vajra, you should focus on the irresistible force.

372
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:19,960
Just like this great tree.

373
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,139
You must be Xu Zhu, the disciple of Hui Lun.

374
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,360
Amitabha.

375
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,819
Grand Martial Uncle, I, Xu Zhu,

376
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,199
wish to join you on your journey to Yanmen Pass.

377
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,919
There are plenty of disciples in Shaolin Temple.

378
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,159
There's no place for a floor sweeper like you.

379
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,659
He's right. We aren't going there to chant sutras and ask for food.

380
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:50,159
It's useless for you to go when you're not good at martial arts.

381
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,679
I will do whatever I can.

382
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,319
Even if it is helping out with moving things around,

383
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,759
chopping firewood, or even cooking. It's all fine.

384
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,360
Grand Martial Uncle, although I'm not good at martial arts, I have great strength.

385
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,319
I'm sure I can help you out somehow.

386
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,199
Amitabha.

387
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,439
All sentient beings have a Buddha nature within.

388
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,099
Even the grasses and trees have a Buddha nature within.

389
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:12,079
As the saying goes, all beings are equal.

390
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,659
Since all beings are equal,

391
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:20,559
there's no difference between you and me.

392
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,139
Understood, Reverend.

393
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:25,279
Reflect on your mistakes.

394
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,880
Yes, Reverend.

395
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,279
Why do you want to head to Yanmen Pass?

396
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,319
My master often told me that the heavens care for all living beings.

397
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,559
I heard that the Liao Army is invading our nation.

398
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,159
I'm sure the people will suffer because of this.

399
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,779
In the past, Gautama Buddha sacrificed himself to feed the tigers.

400
00:26:43,779 --> 00:26:45,379
I'm a disciple of his teaching.

401
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:47,940
I should do the same as well.

402
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,079
Even if I might not be able to do anything much,

403
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,020
it's better than doing nothing.

404
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,479
What a pity. What a pity.

405
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,559
Your heart is pure and sincere,

406
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,659
and you have an open mind.

407
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:14,179
You're a man of irreproachable conduct.

408
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,719
Yet, you're unrealistic and ignorant.

409
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,659
You lack the talent to be a martial artist.

410
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:24,819
And you haven't experienced anything in life and of the world.

411
00:27:24,819 --> 00:27:27,999
Therefore, it's hard for you to reach a breakthrough point in Buddhism.

412
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,279
Let's just take Yanmen Pass for example.

413
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,500
The people we're able to save are only a small part of the entire city.

414
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,679
Most of the living beings in the world are in pain and suffering.

415
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,599
Even if you want to sacrifice yourself for the noble good,

416
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,099
there's no need for you to do so at this moment.

417
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,840
I understand now.

418
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,819
Young Master, lately, the Great Prince of the South Palace has stationed his troops outside of Yanmen Pass.

419
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,180
Seems like he's going to act soon.

420
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,719
Young Master, now, Song's hate for Liao is increasing.

421
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,039
The people are saying that one Liao is equal to four Song.

422
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,479
Now that Liao has invaded our borders,

423
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,119
we should assist them in order to show the might of the Murong family.

424
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:29,879
Maybe, we could even attract some martial artists to our side.

425
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:31,559
Brother Deng has a point.

426
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,679
Those beggars have been fighting against the Liao Army

427
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,159
just because they have reliable intel.

428
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,479
They've made a name for themselves in the pugilist world.

429
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,620
This time, we'll show the beggars our might

430
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,159
so that the pugilist world knows that our young master is better than that Qiao fellow.

431
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,559
That isn't right at all.

432
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,359
We're just here for a temporary stay.

433
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,959
No matter if it's Liao or Song,

434
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,559
who wins and who loses has nothing to do with us.

435
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:00,519
The more chaotic the situation is, the better for us.

436
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,719
Why don't we just enjoy their performance as the beggars duke it out with the Liao Army?

437
00:29:04,719 --> 00:29:07,039
We can wait for our opportunity to profit from the battle itself.

438
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,540
That is the best solution for us.

439
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,279
Third Brother has a point as well.

440
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,879
Why don't we head to Yanmen Pass for now?

441
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:16,759
We can decide what to do after we assess the situation.

442
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,360
Yes, Young Master!

443
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,730
[Third Master Yue, Nanhai Crocodile]

444
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,239
Who is that?

445
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,320
He has tremendous powers.

446
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,560
He's extremely powerful.

447
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,639
I'm sure I won't be able to survive today.

448
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,799
You can run away if you're afraid of him. Just ignore me.

449
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,599
Miss Mu, you've underestimated me.

450
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,639
Although I have a bad reputation,

451
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,619
I'm not a person like that.

452
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:09,979
I was just kidding when I said you have a bad reputation.

453
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:11,959
There's no need for you to die together with me.

454
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,540
If you can survive this,

455
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:20,540
it'll be great if you can think of me when you're alive.

456
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,539
Miss Mu, that man is extremely powerful.

457
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:47,560
He's going to come for us soon. Let's run.

458
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,060
It's too late.

459
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,430
Just run. Don't stay here.

460
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,950
Enough!

461
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:06,639
You guys won't be able to escape from me!

462
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:07,919
Sir, who exactly are you?

463
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,559
I'm the Nanhai Crocodile!

464
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,459
I'm number...

465
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:13,839
You don't need to care about my power ranking!

466
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,859
I'm sure you guys know about me and my evil deeds, am I right?

467
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,479
Stay behind me.

468
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,799
Will he hurt you?

469
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,959
You think you can defend against the Nanhai Crocodile

470
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,320
with skills like yours?

471
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,060
Miss Mu, rest here.

472
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,560
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

473
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,359
So, Sir, you're the famous Nanhai Crocodile.

474
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,940
I've heard a lot about you. Everyone knows about you.

475
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:46,059
Lately, I've seen many heroes and martial artists.

476
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:49,499
But, Sir, you're the strongest of them all.

477
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:51,159
I tried to hit you with over 10 pebbles,

478
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,759
but I couldn't hit you at all.

479
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,199
Sir, you're the best of the best. You're a top martial artist indeed.

480
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,079
Little boy!

481
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,159
You have great taste.

482
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,059
I won't kill you today. Scram now.

483
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,440
All right.

484
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,199
If you're letting me off, can you please let Miss Mu off as well?

485
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,860
Just scram!

486
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,639
Let me ask you this!

487
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,279
Did you kill the Little Devil, Sun Sanba?

488
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,320
- No.
- That's right.

489
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,499
Do you know that he was my beloved disciple?

490
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:33,279
I didn't know that before I killed him.

491
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,599
Now, I know.

492
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,879
Are you afraid of me then?

493
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,420
No.

494
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,219
The Nanhai Crocodile is famous in the pugilist world.

495
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:42,459
I'm sure you won't try to hurt an injured woman.

496
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:45,440
Nonsense! I heard that you were a great martial artist yourself!

497
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,799
How could you be injured?

498
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,479
I was fighting against four of them at once.

499
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,200
I'm sure it would be fine if you were in my shoes.

500
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,040
But I'm just a woman.

501
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,839
That's why I was injured.

502
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,199
They're shameless.

503
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,519
The four of them ganged up on you?

504
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,719
How could they do so?

505
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,420
Am I right?

506
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,100
That's right.

507
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,300
Look, a hero like you...

508
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,340
What did you say just now?

509
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,720
- I said, a...
- Say that again?

510
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,800
I mean, a...

511
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,380
A villain.

512
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,199
- A villain?
- That's right!

513
00:33:32,199 --> 00:33:33,959
I'm a villain!

514
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,879
Can't you see that I'm a villain?

515
00:33:36,879 --> 00:33:38,519
I thought you were smart?

516
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,079
Why are you so dumb?

517
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,339
You're extremely dumb.

518
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,760
I should've killed you!

519
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,999
That's right. You... You're the evilest villain of them all.

520
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,839
So, how could an evil villain like you do nothing about it

521
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,479
when the four of them are ganging up on her?

522
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,480
- Precisely.
- That's right.

523
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,119
You weren't there back then.

524
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,399
If you were there,

525
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,060
I'm sure you'd have broken their bones.

526
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,540
That's impossible!

527
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,839
Me? It's impossible for me to break their bones.

528
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,879
I would surely snap all of their necks,

529
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,120
one by one!

530
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
You don't believe me?

531
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,300
I believe you!

532
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,459
Why don't I snap your neck first? Do you want to give it a try?

533
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:34,679
I don't think I need to give this a try.

534
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,279
That's more like it!

535
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,698
Look. You're the evilest villain

536
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:44,479
out of all the villains.

537
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,198
How could they call you Second Young Master Yue?

538
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,538
I think they should call you Big Boss Yue instead.

539
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,079
Forget about that!

540
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,199
I love my nickname better.

541
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,920
Although I am the evilest villain of them all,

542
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,040
but I do still follow the villains' code of ethics.

543
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,920
Come.

544
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,899
Tell me.

545
00:35:15,899 --> 00:35:17,479
She's just a woman.

546
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,879
It's impossible for me to hurt her.

547
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,000
And she's injured as well.

548
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,219
So, I won't kill her today, all right?

549
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:26,220
That's great to hear.

550
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,099
I'll wait until a day where there are lots of people and then I'll kill her.

551
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,820
Sure.

552
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,160
Wait!

553
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,679
I heard that you've been wearing this veil all along.

554
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,040
No one has seen your face before.

555
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,079
If someone does see your face,

556
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,639
it's either you'll kill him or marry him.

557
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,080
Is that true?

558
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,980
Scram!

559
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,999
- So what if it's true?
- Let me ask you then.

560
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:34,199
Did you kill Sun Sanba because he saw your face?

561
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,520
Don't you know the personality of your own disciple?

562
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,559
I wouldn't be able to kill him

563
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,720
if he had one-tenth of your power.

564
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,839
You have a point! Damn it.

565
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,719
Sun Sanba is dead now.

566
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,319
I've trained him for 10 years, you know?

567
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,139
My 10 years' worth of effort has gone down the drain!

568
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,519
This won't do!

569
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,399
I need to avenge him.

570
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,039
Did he see your face then?

571
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,259
- Tell me!
- Of course not!

572
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,880
Great. I want to see your face right now!

573
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,179
I want to see if you're a hideous monster or a fairy!

574
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,119
Wait a minute.

575
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,759
As one of the evilest villain out there,

576
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,579
how could you commit such despicable deeds?

577
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,080
But of course! I'm a villain!

578
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,079
Remove your veil immediately! Don't make me do it myself!

579
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,339
You! Must I show my face to you?

580
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:29,999
Cut the crap!

581
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,060
Sure, I won't kill you.

582
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:35,240
I will break your legs first.

583
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,799
After that, I'll break your limbs!

584
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,700
Is that okay with you?

585
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,199
Damn it!

586
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,679
How dare you attack me first?

587
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,219
Fine. I'll unveil you first.

588
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,800
- After that, I'll undress you!
- That's not right!

589
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,919
No! That's not right!

590
00:38:05,919 --> 00:38:10,479
Second Young Master Yue, you can't just bully an injured woman.

591
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:13,119
Who told her to strike first? Why can't I retaliate against her?

592
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:15,319
Can't I retaliate when she was the one who struck me first?

593
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,979
That's right. Of course not.

594
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,359
Because... Because you follow the villains' code of ethics, right?

595
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,320
You said so yourself. You'll never kill anyone who cannot defend themselves.

596
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,119
Am I right?

597
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,879
That's right!

598
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,560
- So, is your rule subject to any changes then?
- No!

599
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,059
What will happen if you do change your rule?

600
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:36,220
Then I'll be the son of a bastard!

601
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,039
That's great!

602
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,919
Miss Mu.

603
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,940
You see, you didn't hit Miss Mu,

604
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,719
but Miss Mu hit you with a poison dart.

605
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,359
She isn't retaliating against you. As the saying goes, he who strikes first gains the advantage.

606
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,959
But if you did hit Miss Mu,

607
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,119
with her injuries, she won't be able to defend herself.

608
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:54,719
So, Miss Mu has the strength to prepare for a sneak attack,

609
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,499
but she can't defend herself.

610
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:59,219
If you did kill Miss Mu, that means you'll break your own rule.

611
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:00,899
And that means you'll be the son of a bastard.

612
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:03,800
How dare you say that I'm the son of a bastard?

613
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,599
Look!  If you break your own rule,

614
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:08,439
you'll be the son of a bastard.

615
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,519
But if you don't break your own rule, you won't be the son of a bastard.

616
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,919
So, whether you are the son of a bastard all falls on

617
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,160
whether or not you will break your rule.

618
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,999
I'm a bastard...

619
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,719
Say that again?

620
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,059
I thought you were pretty smart?

621
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,799
I said, if you change your rule, you'll be the son of a bastard.

622
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:27,639
But if you don't break your own rule, you won't be the son of a bastard.

623
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,139
So, whether or not you are the son of a bastard or not

624
00:39:29,139 --> 00:39:32,500
falls on whether you break your own rule.

625
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,579
Do you believe that I'll kill you right now?

626
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,039
I have no means to defend myself.

627
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,420
Kill me then.

628
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,920
I'm sure you didn't expect this.

629
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,360
I won't kill you.

630
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,319
Hurry. Remove your veil immediately.

631
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,120
If you want to see my face,

632
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,680
you need to ask for my husband's permission first.

633
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,800
I once swore

634
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,799
that if I don't kill the first man who has seen my face, who has seen my face,

635
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:54,900
I have to marry him.

636
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,200
This man has seen my face...

637
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,200
and I couldn't bear to kill him.

638
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,360
I have no choice but to marry him.

639
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,600
Miss Mu.

640
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,159
That's great! I don't need to kill you now!

641
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:16,679
I'll kill your husband instead!

642
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,240
That way, I can avenge my disciple!

643
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,840
This is great!

644
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,839
This is great!

645
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,360
You are so similar to me! Your body is so similar to mine!

646
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,199
What are you doing? You're being ridiculous.

647
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,779
You're a great martial artist while I'm just a weak man.

648
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:43,419
You look like...

649
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,759
Anyway, we aren't similar at all.

650
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,119
You have long limbs.

651
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,279
Your waist isn't too bad either.

652
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,220
And your skull. Touch it yourself.

653
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,239
It's just like mine!

654
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,959
This Sun Sanba died at the right time.

655
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,939
Listen!  We from Nanhai can only accept one disciple at a time.

656
00:41:59,939 --> 00:42:01,860
So, he deserved to die.

657
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,779
If I found you before he died, I would've killed him as well.

658
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:07,699
Come. Kowtow to me three times.

659
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:10,319
Come. Become my disciple.

660
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,639
You'll be my disciple from now on.

661
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,420
I... I... I... Why should I become your disciple?

662
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,479
It's because you look like me!

663
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,960
Hurry up! Kowtow to me!

664
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,619
Just do it three times! I'll be your master by then!

665
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:23,499
This is utterly ridiculous. You!

666
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,999
Who's there? Come out!

667
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,799
Why are you old hags here today?

668
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,339
Are you here to celebrate that I got myself a new disciple?

669
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:39,839
We're here to capture this wretch.

670
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,299
We'll avenge our brothers and sisters!

671
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:42,659
Try it if you dare!

672
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,599
She's the wife of my disciple now.

673
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,820
Touch her if you dare!

674
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,520
All of you better scram now!

675
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,159
I...

676
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,319
I really cannot become your disciple.

677
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,679
I already have a master.

678
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,480
Nonsense!

00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,720
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

699
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,130
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

700
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,230
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

701
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:02,690
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

702
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,190
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

703
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:20,680
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

704
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,260
Who's there?
