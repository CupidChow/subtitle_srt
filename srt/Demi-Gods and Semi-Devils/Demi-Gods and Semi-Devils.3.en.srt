13
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,119
What the hell.

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,319
How come was Jin Xi'er killed?

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,139
Oh, no. My husband is here.

16
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:40,540
He gets suspicious very easily.

17
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,559
Young Master, find a place to hide for a bit.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,160
Follow me.

19
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
Young Master Duan, stay here. Do not make any sound.

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,660
My husband has a short temper. If anything happens, you might lose your life, and I'll not be able to save you.

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,279
Do you hear me?

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
Madam!

23
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,960
Madam.

24
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,380
I haven't done anything and I might lose my life?

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,279
Jin Xi'er is dead?

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,159
What happened?

27
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,739
Grandmaster sent Jin Xi'er and me to Beizhuang to receive the guests.

28
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,159
We were told that there would be a total of four guests.

29
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,339
At noon, one of them arrived earlier.

30
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,000
The man introduced himself as someone with the surname Yue.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,450
Grandmaster told us that if we meet anyone with the surname Yue,

32
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,919
we shall address him as the Third Master.

33
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,579
All of a sudden, the man said he was Second Young Master Yue.
[Zhong Wanchou: Wanjie Valley Master]

34
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:43,019
With bare hands, he snapped Jin Xi'er's neck.

35
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,420
Such an unreasonable and arrogant man.

36
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,599
When did Third Young Master Yue, the Nanhai Crocodile, become Second Young Master Yue?

37
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,879
Third Young Master Yue has always been hot-tempered.

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,039
He is also a mad man.

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,380
Lai Fu'er.

40
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,919
Madam.

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,059
You must have been terrified too. Go get some rest.

42
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:01,560
Yes.

43
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,499
Jin Xi'er had loyally served us for many years.

44
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:11,359
And now, she was killed by your friends.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,299
I told you not to invite them here, and you insisted.

46
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:16,039
Despite all the sweet talk,

47
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,279
I think you don't care about me at all!

48
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:22,479
How is that possible?

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,959
I invited them here because of you.

50
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,319
If you care about me, you should listen to me.

51
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,999
Tell them to leave.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,299
That Third Young Master Yue killed her for no reason. He is so wicked and evil.

53
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,040
Could it be that there are three more guys who are as wicked as him?

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,879
This Duan is humiliating me too much.

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,059
If I don't take revenge on him, I, Zhong Wanchou, what dignity will I have left?

56
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,359
So, your name is Zhong Wanchou.
(T/N: "wanchou" means tens of thousands of grudges/enemies)

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,079
That's not a nice name.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,860
As the saying goes, better make friends than enemies.

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,279
It's already bad to hold a grudge, not to mention tens of thousands of grudges.

60
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:01,659
With your appearance, you are very fortunate

61
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,719
to have married a pretty woman like Aunt.

62
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,700
You should change your name to Zhong Wanxing.
(T/N: "wanxing" means tens of thousands of fortunes)

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,439
You actually hate me.

64
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,330
If you really want to retaliate against him,

65
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,610
why don't you go find him and fight him one-on-one yourself?

66
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,159
You hired someone to do it.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,439
How does that prove your capability?

68
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,018
Even if you defeat him, do you think it's a fair match?

69
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:24,979
Do you know how many subordinates he has?

70
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,360
I want to fight him one-on-one.

71
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,499
But he's avoiding me. What can I do?

72
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,540
A'Bao.

73
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,720
My dear A'Bao, I'm sorry.

74
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,620
I shouldn't have yelled at you like that.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,900
A'Bao, I didn't manage to control my anger.

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,639
It's my fault.

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,079
You will never forget what happened in the past.

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,140
My life is meaningless.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,760
Why don't you just kill me?

80
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,800
Not only can we end this, but you can also vent your anger.

81
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,779
After I die, you can find another pretty wife.

82
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:17,359
A'Bao, you shouldn't say this.

83
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,959
It's my fault.

84
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,660
Who's there?

85
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,240
Who are you? Why are you hiding in my wife's room?

86
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,219
Let him go. He's here to bring us news.

87
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,279
News?

88
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,700
Brat, looking at how dandified you are,

89
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,839
you must not be a good man.

90
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:45,080
Tell me.

91
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,860
Why are you hiding in my wife's room?

92
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,159
Duan is my last name.

93
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,359
Do it now if you want to kill me.

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,819
Why are you mumbling all this nonsense?

95
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,500
Your last name is also Duan?

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,320
Another Duan.

97
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,120
Lord Zhong, although Duan is my last name,

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,710
I had never met your wife before.

99
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:16,420
You don't have to be upset.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,239
Really?

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,840
Yes. I haven't been here for more than an hour.

102
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,639
Yes.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,639
It's been more than 10 years since A'Bao left the valley.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,579
Ten years ago, you were probably only eight or nine years old.

105
00:06:37,579 --> 00:06:40,620
Of course, you wouldn't... wouldn't...

106
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,779
What are you trying to say? You're being so rude.

107
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,720
That's absurd.

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,019
You're right. I deserve to be scolded.

109
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,340
Young Master Duan, who's your father?

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,479
If I tell another lie, it'll look as if I really am guilty.

111
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,400
I am here to ask for help.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,919
I shouldn't have deceived you.

113
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,439
My name is Duan Yu. I hail from Dali.

114
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,939
My father's name is Zhengchun.

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,479
Duan Zhengchun?

116
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,280
Precisely.

117
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,639
You're saying that your father is called Duan Zhengchun?

118
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,559
You...

119
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,839
You're the son of Duan Zhengchun, that swindler!

120
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,540
How dare you insult my dad?

121
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,799
Why not?

122
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,759
Duan Zhengchun. You swindler!

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,319
Swindler!

124
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,800
Lord Zhong, if there's a feud between you and my dad,

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,039
you should scold him to his face.

126
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,919
- A real man doesn't talk behind another's back.
- I...

127
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,479
My father is in Dali Kingdom right now.

128
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,159
If you want to find him, it's so easy.

129
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,890
Why did you put up a board in front of the door that says anyone

130
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,650
with the surname Duan cannot come in and will be killed immediately?

131
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,120
You...

132
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,439
I...

133
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,159
I'm afraid that I might lose to your father.

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,199
I...

135
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,919
I'm afraid that...

136
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,580
I'm afraid that your father will find out...

137
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,879
Find out... that A'Bao lives here.

138
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,199
I'm a coward. A coward.

139
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
A coward.

140
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,738
Lord Zhong, what will happen if my father finds out that your wife lives here?

141
00:08:38,738 --> 00:08:40,760
Will he come...

142
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,200
- Young Master Duan.
- Aunt.

143
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,360
How is your father doing? Is he well?

144
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,019
My father is in good shape. He is doing well.

145
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,399
Glad to hear that.

146
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,560
He is in good shape.

147
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,079
He is doing well.

148
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
That's good.

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Aunt, although Lord Zhong has a short temper,

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,050
he truly respects and loves you.

151
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:16,079
You have a happy marriage.

152
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,080
So, please don't be upset by what I said.

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,820
You are too young to know

154
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,400
what a happy marriage looks like.

155
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,719
Aunt, I was being rude just now.

156
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,999
Please convey my apologies to Lord Zhong.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,599
Young Master Duan, you're being too kind.

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,679
My husband is a paranoid man.

159
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,059
I hope you don't mind.

160
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,120
Here.

161
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,199
Let's drink.

162
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,639
- Look at this.
- Let's drink.

163
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,319
Look at them.

164
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,500
They have such low alcohol tolerance.

165
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,519
Chief, you are a good drinker.

166
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,559
[Wife of Deputy Chief, Kang Min]
Men of the Beggars' Sect. You must drink.

167
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,439
Fill up the cups.

168
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,300
Fill them up.

169
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,860
Fill up the cups.

170
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,239
- Come on. Let's drink.
- Let's go there to drink.

171
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,940
Stop chatting.

172
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,119
Drink up.

173
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,439
Who is she?

174
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,999
She is the wife of Deputy Chief Ma.

175
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,700
She looks really pretty.

176
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,020
Let's go.

177
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,720
Here. Fill it up!

178
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,820
Bottom's up!

179
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,319
- Hi, Madam.
- Here.

180
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:04,020
Drink up!

181
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Hello, Madam.

182
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,839
- Madam Ma.
- This is good wine.

183
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,559
You have been working hard.

184
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,200
Today, we shall have fun.

185
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,679
Come on. Drink!

186
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,780
Chief, I'll pour you some wine.

187
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,999
Sister-in-Law, that's not necessary.

188
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,820
This is a small bottle, and it's not satisfying drinking from it.

189
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,519
Here!

190
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,399
Let's drink from the jar.

191
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,799
Hurry up!

192
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
Here. Drink some more!

193
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,120
Bottom's up!

194
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,080
Nice!

195
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,199
My wife is here.

196
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,160
I'll go get her.

197
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,039
- Madam!
- Here.

198
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,799
Madam, why are you here?

199
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,279
It's the succession ceremony today.

200
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,879
I'm afraid you don't have enough food and wine.

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,239
So, I brought two jars of wine here.

202
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,479
I've also made some side dishes.

203
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,860
Have a taste.

204
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,260
Madam.

205
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,319
Here. Drink more!

206
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:24,600
Brat, what are you looking at?

207
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,159
What are you looking at?

208
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,239
Madam!

209
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,159
Madam, here.

210
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,619
Drink up. Here!

211
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,400
We're out of wine!

212
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,100
Bring me more!

213
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,119
Young Master Duan,

214
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,799
how many mistresses does your father have?

215
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,239
None.

216
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,260
My mother doesn't allow it.

217
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,759
Is your father afraid of your mother?

218
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,720
I don't think he's afraid of her.

219
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,480
I think it's mostly respect and love.

220
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,780
It's just like the relationship between Lord Zhong and you.

221
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,360
- Where are you going?
- Run.

222
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,840
Stand still.

223
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:21,560
A'Bao, in the end, you are still leaving me.

224
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,199
Keep drinking.

225
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:17,020
We're out of alcohol.

226
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,780
Sit down.

227
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,319
I didn't mean to hurt you.

228
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,999
Why didn't you dodge?

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,479
Since you're leaving me, I might as well die.

230
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,039
Who told you I'm leaving?

231
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,039
Didn't I explain it on the note?

232
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,300
I was going to save Ling'er.

233
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,500
Zhong Wanchou, why don't you believe me?

234
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,580
Sure. Zhong Wanchou, if that's the case,

235
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,900
then I, Gan Baobao, might as well die here.

236
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,719
A'Bao, so you are saying

237
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,439
that you weren't planning to run away with him.

238
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,959
Young Master Duan and I are going to save Ling'er.

239
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,340
I wanted to blitz the Shennong Sect.

240
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,519
Does it hurt?

241
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,220
I'm all right.

242
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,779
A'Bao, since you are so worried about me,

243
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:14,819
even if I die now, I'll die with no regrets.

244
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,000
That's enough.

245
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,960
I'll not save Ling'er.

246
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,939
Young Master Duan, tell Sikong Xuan

247
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:29,939
that my husband, Zhong Wanchou, used to be the well-known Horse Deity.

248
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,479
I am Gan Baobao, also known as Pretty Yaksha.

249
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,439
If he dares hurt my daughter,

250
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,559
we will show him no mercy.

251
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,140
Yes. No mercy.

252
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,479
Yes.

253
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,080
I'll relay the message immediately.

254
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,479
Young Master Duan, don't leave just yet.

255
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,180
Have a seat.

256
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,680
Hold the sword.

257
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,399
When Young Master Duan returns to Dali,

258
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,439
be sure to pass this to your father.

259
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,099
Tell him to save our daughter.

260
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,439
It's a long journey from here to Dali.

261
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,959
I'll find you a fit horse. Wait for me here.

262
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,760
Thanks, Aunt.

263
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,619
Remember to tell him to save our daughter.

264
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,358
Do you hear me?

265
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,759
Yes.

266
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
Take this with you.

267
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,360
Let's go.

268
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,159
The fifth day of the month, Gengshen Year, 1:00 - 3:00 a.m. Female.

269
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,900
Gengshen Year?

270
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,580
Isn't that 16 years ago?

271
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,440
Is this Zhong Ling's date of birth?

272
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,859
Gan Baobao wants me to give Zhong Ling's date of birth to my father.

273
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:06,080
- What is it for?
- Young Master Duan!

274
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,340
I'm Lai Fu'er. By the order of Madam, I'm here to help you borrow a horse.

275
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,600
That's great. Thanks.

276
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,400
This way, please.

277
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,941
Madam, listen to me.

278
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:48,679
That day, Branch Leader Qiao went to the border of Liao to save the Song army.

279
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,839
He defeated the Liao army,

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,759
and cut off Yelv Bulu's head.

281
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,340
Don't you think he is a hero?

282
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,079
Besides, that day, he also competed with Murong Fu.

283
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,680
It only took him a few moves to win the match.

284
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,799
An eye for an eye,

285
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,180
and a tooth for a tooth.

286
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,399
This doesn't apply to Branch Leader Qiao at all.

287
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,919
This may come off as arrogant.

288
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,879
But if we are to talk about martial arts skills,

289
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,759
even the old chief of the Beggars' Sect

290
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,119
may be no match for him.

291
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,159
Not only is Branch Leader Qiao an upright person,

292
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,799
but he is also righteous and generous.

293
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,079
Tell me, to have such a man in the Beggars' Sect,

294
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:30,560
what reputation do we have to worry about?

295
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,639
For the Beggars' Sect, his presence is a fortune.

296
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,440
It's a fortune.

297
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,800
Madam, help me out.

298
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,679
Young Master Duan, this horse is named Black Rose. It has strong legs.

299
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,559
The lady here is our young lady's friend.

300
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,119
Knowing that Young Master is going to save our young lady,

301
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,679
she lent us her horse.

302
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,279
She has really done us a big favor.

303
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,880
Thank you.

304
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,459
Judging from how fast this horse runs, I'll definitely be able to arrive to Dali by tomorrow evening.

305
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,999
Thief!

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
Stop right there.

307
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,000
Do you think you can fool my master by disguising as a man?

308
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,700
After her.

309
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,819
Why did the two men say that I'm disguising myself as a man?

310
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:23,301
They are after Black Rose's owner.

311
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,879
But they only recognized the horse and not the owner.

312
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
They are too careless.

313
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,279
Oh, no.

314
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,919
I was able to escape because of how fast this horse runs.

315
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,039
But the horse's owner has no idea about this yet.

316
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,160
No. I have to inform her.

317
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,599
Black Rose.

318
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,879
Someone wants to hurt your young lady.

319
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,000
We have to inform her and remind her to be careful.

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,480
Hurry up!

321
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,359
Brat. Where do you think you're going?

322
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,199
I'm looking for the owner of this house.

323
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,760
Why are you being so rude?

324
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,799
This brat is riding that woman's black horse.

325
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,399
He must be the woman's lover.

326
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,499
Let's bring him in and we'll capture the rest of them later.

327
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,060
Bring him in.

328
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,240
Go.

329
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,279
Little Wench, why aren't you fighting back?

330
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,119
[Mu Wanqing]
You've lived for so many years.

331
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,279
Even if you want to die, you don't need to be in such a hurry, right?

332
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Go!

333
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,919
No.

334
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,999
How dare you commit murder?

335
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,799
Although Dali is a small country, we have laws too.

336
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,360
What can you do if I really want to kill you?

337
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,319
You're being unreasonable.

338
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,040
That's absurd.

339
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,500
Miss, we don't know each other.

340
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,079
I'm only here to meet the owner of this place.

341
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,879
She was very kind to lend me her horse.

342
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,599
I'm here to bring her news.

343
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,139
Shouldn't you be on a rescue mission? Why are you here?

344
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:20,019
When I was on my way there on Black Rose's back, I got ambushed.

345
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,679
They thought I was you.

346
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,519
So, I'm here to warn you, hoping that you can avoid it.

347
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,140
Why are you trying to please me?

348
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,440
Miss, we don't know each other.

349
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,759
Why do I need to please you?

350
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:40,919
So, you are standing up against injustice and trying to warn me about it.

351
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,460
Miss, Black Rose is by the gate.

352
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,999
I'll try to buy you some time.

353
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,959
If you manage to escape, get on the horse and leave right away.

354
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:50,061
The horse runs very fast. They won't be able to catch up with you.

355
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,399
- How about you?
- There's no grievance between us.

356
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,020
I suppose they will not kill an innocent man.

357
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,119
He...

358
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,479
If you can reason with them,

359
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,439
why would so many of them attack me alone?

360
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:06,179
Won't you regret if you die because of me?

361
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,020
No regrets.

362
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,319
You're so weak.

363
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,239
Why are you trying to be a hero?

364
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,120
Forget it.

365
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:21,159
If I manage to escape, tell me your wishes, and I'll fulfill them for you.

366
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,319
Your friend, Miss Zhong, is locked up at Sword Lake Palace of Limitless Mountain

367
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,800
by the Shennong Sect.

368
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,259
Her mother gave me this box.

369
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:35,660
She told me to bring this to my father, and tell my father to save her daughter.

370
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,980
Miss, if you really manage to free yourself from this,

371
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,839
please take care of this for me.

372
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,120
I'll be very grateful.

373
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,799
Zhong Ling is a beautiful girl.

374
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,760
Do you like her?

375
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,320
No. Miss Zhong is young. She is an innocent and naive girl.

376
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,839
How can I have those intentions towards her?

377
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,360
My father lives in Dali.

378
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,340
You only need to...

379
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,799
Don't let her escape. Go after her!

380
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,959
Go!

381
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,860
After her.

382
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,719
I didn't expect Miss Mu to be so skilled.

383
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,860
They haven't caught up to us. So, can you let me down now?

384
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,860
Miss Mu, please let me down.

385
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,200
You tied me up...

386
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,999
Don't talk unless I give you my permission.

387
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,700
Why?

388
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,639
I told you to keep quiet.

389
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,319
Why do you keep hitting me?

390
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,280
Let me down. I don't want to stay with you anymore.

391
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,820
I...

392
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,720
You...

393
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,200
How can you be like this?

394
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,159
You have no right to speak in front of me.

395
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,399
You're being so unreasonable.

396
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
I was trying to help you.

397
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,080
Will you listen to me now?

398
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,700
Why don't you reply?

399
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,380
If you want to act like a deaf person,

400
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,479
I'll make you a deaf person.

401
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,800
Do you still want your ear?

402
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,319
Are you really going to cut off my ear?

403
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,240
If you hurt my ear, can you heal it?

404
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,199
I revived a person I killed,

405
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,300
and you think I can't heal you? Do you want to give it a try?

406
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,879
I believe you.

407
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,440
There's no need to try.

408
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,160
Now that you're awake, let's go.

409
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,060
Miss, one moment. I want to relieve myself.

410
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,119
Please untie me.

411
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,740
We're leaving now. There's no time for that.

412
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,239
All right. If you don't untie me, that's fine too.

413
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,919
I don't have any choices.

414
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,239
I don't want to dirty you.

415
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,119
You smell so good.

416
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,159
If I can't hold it any longer and stink up the place, the mood would be ruined.

417
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,940
Thanks, Miss.

418
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,600
This...

419
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,160
Horse...

420
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,719
Let's go.

421
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
What's wrong?

422
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
You...

423
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Let's go.

424
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,259
Do you want to come down yourself or do you want Black Rose to kick you off?

425
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,999
I didn't want to kill you originally,

426
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,299
but not only did you try to run away, but you also stole my Black Rose.

427
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,320
Is that what a real man does?

428
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,580
I'm not your slave. I can leave whenever I want.

429
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,319
How could you call it "running away."

430
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,679
Besides, you lent me Black Rose.

431
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,359
I haven't returned it to you yet. So, that's not stealing either.

432
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,279
If you want to kill me, do it.

433
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,719
How dare you.

434
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,199
Do you think I won't?

435
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,759
I have done nothing wrong to you.

436
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,660
Why should I feel scared?

437
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,620
Go away.

438
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,719
I'll leave your head intact for now.

439
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,739
I'll go get it whenever I like.

440
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,920
You...

441
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,260
I'm leaving.

442
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,100
Goodbye, Miss.

443
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,879
She has a strange character.

444
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,699
I wonder if she has experienced any unfortunate events before.

445
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:08,359
Perhaps, she has an ugly face and is ashamed to show it.

446
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,920
I feel sorry for her.

447
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,560
This...

448
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,400
Boss.

449
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,199
I'll be right there.

450
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,879
Please serve me some food.

451
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,319
There's no meat and fish today.

452
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,639
Please make do with some greens and tofu.

453
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,160
Sure. That's good.

454
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,839
The world is my house.

455
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,199
The house is my clothes. I'm a man.

456
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,300
It doesn't matter if my butt is showing.

457
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,719
You shouldn't have tried to be the hero.

458
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,399
You deserve it.

459
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
Why am I following him?

460
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,860
Black Rose wants to follow him.

461
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,700
Not me.

462
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,919
It's late now.

463
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,079
He's having his meal, and I'm not. Off you go.

464
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,420
Sir, please enjoy the food.

465
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,300
Thanks.

466
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,959
Madam, there's a food stall here. Let's see if we can get any food.

467
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:32,119
Boss, bring me some wine and rice.

468
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,380
Serve me some beef, too.

469
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,400
Brother Gan, Sister-in-Law Gan.

470
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,090
I wish you a happy marriage.

471
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,200
May you live happily ever after,

472
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,570
give birth to a cute child, and lead a life of happiness and prosperity.

473
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,400
Who's there?

474
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,079
They are dead.

475
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,400
Boss, I haven't paid the bill.

476
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,199
Thanks for saving me.

477
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,440
If it weren't for you,

478
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,620
I might have already lost my head.

479
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,060
But... this...

480
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,159
You two,

481
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,719
even though you brought this upon yourselves.

482
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,759
I wasn't the one who killed you,

483
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,860
but you died because of me.

484
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,679
They are dead.

485
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,760
Do we have to erect a stele for them?

486
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,160
Fool.

487
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,519
Sir. Madam. I wish that you can marry each other again in your next life.

488
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,959
But you shouldn't be as vicious and selfish anymore.

489
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,760
Being considerate to others will bring happiness to yourself, too.

490
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,599
Remember that.

491
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,920
Miss Mu.

492
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,220
Miss Mu. Miss Mu!

493
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,860
Miss.

494
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,230
Miss!

495
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,579
You're a kind person, so please keep helping me.

496
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,319
Please save Zhong Ling, too.

497
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,238
Zhong Ling is my friend.

498
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,158
Of course, I will save her.

499
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,279
But I hate it when someone pleads with me.

500
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,639
Now that you're pleading with me, I won't save her anymore.

501
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,339
All right. I won't plead with you anymore.

502
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:35,760
I won't do it anymore.

503
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,399
But you've already done it.

504
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,119
I take back my words.

505
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,980
You're a man. How can you take back your words so easily?

506
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,339
All right. I'm not a man.

507
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:48,499
I'm a wretch you just saved.

508
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,479
You're so nice to Zhong Ling.

509
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,858
You were willing to sacrifice yourself yesterday and try to act tough.

510
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:58,599
Now, you'd rather be called a wretch just to save her.

511
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,639
I just will do the opposite of what you want me to do.

512
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,079
Why would you do that?

513
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,399
Because my master told me that there's no good man in the world.

514
00:35:05,399 --> 00:35:06,879
You insist on saving Zhong Ling.

515
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
You must have some other motive.

516
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,479
Miss, that's not true.

517
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:17,599
For example... I am sure your father is a good man.

518
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,879
My father is not a good man.

519
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,680
That's what my master told me.

520
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,259
Miss. Miss, wait for me.

521
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:25,800
Miss!

522
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,900
Miss, wait for me.

523
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:38,440
Are you Gan Guanghao and Ge Guangpei from the Limitless Sword Sect?

524
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,359
Madam, we are not.

525
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:45,379
A young man and a young woman walking together.

526
00:35:45,379 --> 00:35:47,479
I'm sure you are eloping.

527
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,659
How dare you deny it? Remove your face veil.

528
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,860
Miss Mu!

529
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,039
Madams, I should have built a grave for you.

530
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,419
But I have no shovel.

531
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:35,199
I'm sorry you have to make do with this. I'm sorry.

532
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,500
Miss Mu, you shouldn't have hurt them.

533
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,259
You only had to remove your face veil and show them your face.

534
00:36:42,259 --> 00:36:44,240
That would have settled them down.

535
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,400
Shut up!

536
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,040
Do I need you to teach me what to do?

537
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,000
They shouldn't have said that we were elo...

538
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,399
elo... elo...eloping

539
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,639
Yes.

540
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,639
They shouldn't have said that.

541
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,919
But you shouldn't have killed them either.

542
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,400
Look at this. Your poisoned arrows are deadly.

543
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,799
They kill whoever touches them.

544
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,679
Miss, I advise you to never use it again

545
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,860
unless it is really necessary.

546
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,040
This...

547
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,159
You're a man.

548
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,619
It's not decent to run around with your butt showing.

549
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:25,980
Put this on.

550
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,100
Weren't you acting all tough and macho?

551
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,599
You look like a little girl

552
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,180
after you put on this cape.

553
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,239
Put on this hat too.

554
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,640
Now, no one will think we are a man and a woman.

555
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,600
I'll wear it too.

556
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,439
Look at you.

557
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,479
You are probably younger than me.

558
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,319
Why are you so ruthless when you kill?

559
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:19,520
- Are you disagreeing with me?
- I don't mean that. I dare not.

560
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,719
You don't mean it, or you dare not?

561
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,559
I don't mean it. I dare not.

562
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,539
I don't mean it. No. I dare not disagree with you.

563
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,539
Miss, are you hurt?

564
00:38:38,539 --> 00:38:40,199
Can anyone hurt me?

565
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,199
They are no match for me.

566
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,959
You don't really care about me.

567
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,479
There's no good man in the world.

568
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,359
You only want me to save Zhong Ling as soon as possible. Am I right?

569
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,499
This... If you think it's right, it's right.

570
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,019
Then... the Limitless Sword Sect's Sword Lake Palace...

571
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,100
is there.

572
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,039
Exactly.

573
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,640
Let's go.

574
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,020
Hold tight.

575
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,779
You can't even ride a horse properly. How can you save her?

576
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:22,739
Grab tight. I won't save you if you fall.

577
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,979
Black Rose...Thanks to you,

578
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:32,040
Miss Zhong can be saved.

579
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,879
You keep talking about Zhong Ling.

580
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,800
You really care for her.

581
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,220
Does the date of birth inside the golden box belong to Zhong Ling?

582
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,399
Did Madam Zhong betroth Zhong Ling to you?

583
00:39:47,399 --> 00:39:49,599
No. I swear.

584
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,599
If I am lying, you can kill me with your poisoned arrows.

585
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,059
Duan? Duan is your last name? Duan Yu is your name?

586
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:59,619
Exactly. Yu, for reputation.

587
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,679
Yu, for reputation. Do you have a good reputation?

588
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,460
Why don't I think so?

589
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,280
Chief, why are you looking for me?

590
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,260
Stop addressing me as the chief.

591
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,679
Qiao Feng is the chief of the Beggars' Sect now.

592
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,859
The Beggars' Sect will depend on him from now on.

593
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,239
You are the elder of the sect.

594
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,079
You should help him.

595
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,679
- Of course.
- Da Yuan.

596
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,240
You are a wise, loyal, and righteous man.

597
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,399
I am going to entrust you with an important task.

598
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,279
Not only does this involve the Beggars' Sect,

599
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,880
but...

600
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,699
but it also...involves the fate of the entire pugilist world.

601
00:40:58,699 --> 00:40:59,879
I'm ready to serve.

602
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,839
As long as it's within my capability,

603
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,920
I will surely fulfill the task.

604
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,500
That's good.

605
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,320
I wrote this letter.

606
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,359
My health is not as good as before.

607
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,520
If anything happens,

608
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,479
please watch Qiao Feng's on my behalf.

609
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,479
If you notice anything suspicious,

610
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,160
you can inform Abbot Xuan Ci and Reverend Zhi Guang.

611
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,039
This will be the proof.

612
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,300
Keep a watch on Qiao Feng.

613
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,900
This... I don't quite understand.

614
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,820
What happened to Qiao Feng is not that simple.

615
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,640
It's not that I doubt him,

616
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
but...

617
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,519
You only have to remember how important this letter is.

618
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,839
You cannot open this letter unless the time is critical.

619
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,219
Don't mention it in front of others either. Do you understand?

620
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:25,040
Yes.

646
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,310
I heard early on that Prince Chu was looking for soldiers. There must be a reason behind this.

647
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,090
The top priority right now is

648
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,730
to tell the royal court to send out soldiers to counterattack this matter.

649
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,310
Whether it is Liao or Song,

650
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,820
why does it matter who wins to us?

651
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,360
The messier the situation is, the better it is for us.

652
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,130
We can sit back and reap the benefits. This is the best of plans.

653
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:55,090
Why don't we still watch how everything unfolds and then make a decision.
