- What do you need, Brother Qiao?

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,579
We've been best friends for so many years.

15
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:42,999
I've never thought that we'd be enemies after this.

16
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:47,219
Actually, I've long heard about your family background.

17
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:51,359
But I refused to believe it.

18
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,519
But it turned out to be true.

19
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,759
If this was not a matter of our kingdom's enemies,

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,619
I would rather die than become your enemy.

21
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,459
After we turn into enemies, a fight is sure to come.

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,159
I have another favor to ask from you.

23
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,839
If it won't affect the country,

24
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,860
please go ahead and tell me.

Don't worry, Brother Qiao.

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,039
I will beg Divine Physician Xue to treat her.

30

Xiao Juan, it's my fault for not being able to protect you on time. Do not blame me.

That person killed his father, his mother, and his teacher.

60
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,100
I said something rude just now.

I hope that you won't blame me for it.

62
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,759
What did you say?

63
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,739
Just now, I said that Qiao Feng entered Shaolin alone and left.

64
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,259
Not only did he not suffer any injuries after murdering Reverend Xuan Ku,

65
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,839
he even kidnapped a monk from Shaolin.

66
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,920
What's your point?

67
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,039
Qiao Feng is a master of martial arts.

68
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,639
He's a rare talent.

69
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,719
Now, I realized that he could come and go as he pleased because it was impossible to stop him.

70
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,260
Divine Physician Xue, do you want to have a taste of Shaolin's martial arts?

71
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,860
- Brother.
- Brother.

72
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,080
Fine. If we don't attack, others will think that Shaolin Sect has no one left.

That's why I didn't think about the consequences.

I'm almost fully recovered now.

142

But the most important thing now is to find out my real identity.

143
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,939
Then I have to go to Yanmen Pass to look at the writings on the cliff.

144
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,899
I wonder how Miss A'Zhu is right now.

If I have a chance,

150
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,419
I'll definitely repay him for his kindness.

Divine Physician Xue.

156
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:49,399
Divine Physician Xue, I feel a bit stuffy in my chest.

157
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,299
And I feel weak.

158
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,920
You were too seriously injured.

159
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,719
You have not recovered your strength yet.

160
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,319
Although I've given you medication and acupuncture treatment

161
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,919
to treat the injuries that your internal organs suffered,

162
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,039
but the human body is not a machine.

163
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,719
Even if you cure your illness, it doesn't mean you will come out the exact same as you were before.

164
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,800
You need to be patient with your recovery.

165
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,140
I understand.

166
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,020
But I can't breathe very well.

167

But I managed to keep her condition stable.

173
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,280
Pass down this message to everyone.

174
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,780
Don't disturb her for the next two days.

If you need to ask her any questions,

177
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,700
you can do that after she has recovered.

- Okay.
- Go on now.

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,660
Young Miss, I am not staying here!

180
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,720
Come in.

181
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,499
A'Zhu, what are you...

182
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:04,580
Young Master, I'm here today to bid my farewell.

183
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,439
Are you blaming me for not saving you that day?

184
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,420
I don't blame you.

185
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,359
I have been an orphan since young.

186
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,199
It was all thanks to your father who kindly took me in.

187
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,359
I won't be able to repay your family

188
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,660
even if I'm crushed to death.

189
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,820
It's not that I didn't want to save you.

190
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,580
But back then, I couldn't let others think that I was colluding with Qiao Feng because of you.

191
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,659
And I couldn't go against the whole pugilist world because of you.

192
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,280
I'm sorry.

193
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:36,520
There's no need to apologize to me.

194
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,239
I know that you have a great cause.

195
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,760
You can't sacrifice so much for me.

196
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,320
I can't ask that from you.

197
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,959
And I don't want you to do that.

198
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,920
But Brother Qiao risked his life for me.

199
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,619
I have to repay him for his kindness.

200
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,959
Young Master, when your father was still alive,

201
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:01,719
he said that if one day,

202
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:04,279
A'Bi and I met someone we loved,

203
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,419
he'd marry us off as if we were his daughters.

204
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:09,400
Now....

205
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,520
Now, I've found someone I love.

206
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,559
I don't care what he feels about me,

207
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,999
as long as I can accompany him and make him laugh every now and then,

208
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:24,480
it'll be enough for me.

209
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,319
Are you talking about Qiao Feng?

210
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,599
After this, I won't be able to accompany you anymore.

211
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,459
I know that you have the great ambition to revive the country

212
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:44,039
and the outstanding skills to do that.

213
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,399
But if you want to conquer people's hearts,

214
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,239
you'll have to give them yours too.

215
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,360
That is the right way.

216
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,359
The path of reviving the country is full of obstacles.

217
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:56,279
Besides having manpower,

218
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,319
more importantly, you need luck.

219
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,360
If you feel that it's hard for you,

220
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,920
you don't have to force yourself.

221
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,039
This is your father's ambition.

222
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,299
If you are willing, you can let it go and live the life you want.

223
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,680
I will now...

224
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,720
bid my farewell to you.

225
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,120
Young Master, I'm leaving.

226
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,759
Please allow me to repay the Murong Clan

227
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,120
in the future for raising me.

228
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,240
I come from the south today.

229
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,359
If the writings on the cliff state that I'm indeed a Khitan,

230
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,640
then, after leaving Yanmen Pass,

231
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,039
I'll forever become the people from the North of the Wall.

232
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,480
And I will not come back.

233
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,199
Even the wild geese have more freedom than me to travel

234
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,280
from south to north every year.

235
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,639
But the writings on the cliff have been destroyed.

236
00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:58,639
If Reverend Zhi Guang was telling the truth,

237
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,320
then this is where my father jumped off from the cliff.

238
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,780
I traveled all the way here

239
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,439
to find out about my family background.

240
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,479
But I got nothing out of it.

241
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,639
Why? Why?

242
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,920
Reverend Zhi Guang and Zhao Qiansun

243
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,919
said that there are writings on the cliff.

244
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,279
But who destroyed the writings?

245
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,839
I have to find them and ask them.

246
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,640
What was engraved on the cliff?

247
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,979
- Brother Qiao.
- A'Zhu.

248
00:30:09,979 --> 00:30:12,220
I finally found you!

249
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,540
A'Zhu!

250
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,679
Brother Qiao, I've been waiting here for a long time.

251
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,559
I was worried that you couldn't make it here.

252
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,319
Thank the heavens that you are here now in one piece.

253
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,919
Why are you here?

254
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,660
I...

255
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,080
I thought that you would definitely come to Yanmen Pass

256
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,679
to look at the writings on the cliff.

257
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,820
So, I came here to wait for you as soon as I recovered.

258
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,780
You've recovered?

259
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,800
Divine Physician Xue healed you?

260
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,020
Luckily, Elder Bai was willing to exchange his martial arts technique with him.

261
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,220
Or else, that Divine Physician Xue wouldn't have saved me.

262
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,860
Brother Qiao, who was that man in black?

263
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,000
I don't know either.

264
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,420
You don't know either?

265
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,639
Why would he risk himself to save you from danger then?

266
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,960
Now, who should I seek revenge on and who should I repay?

267
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,219
Am I a Hu or a Han?

268
00:31:24,219 --> 00:31:28,519
Am I doing the right thing or the wrong thing now?

269
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,720
I don't even know anymore.

270
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:36,199
Brother Qiao, I think there's no need to think too much about it.

271
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:39,039
The truth will eventually come to light.

272
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,139
As long as we have a clear conscience and can face the heavens and those on Earth with no qualms, it'll be enough.

273
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:47,619
I'm upset because I don't have a clear conscience.

274
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,599
That day in Xingzi Forest,

275
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,699
I vowed not to kill any Hans.

276
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:00,780
- But...
- Those people from Heroes' Gathering Manor

277
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,140
indiscriminately surrounded and attacked you.

278
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,679
You were just defending yourself.

279
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,280
You couldn't possibly let them cut you into pieces without reason, right?

280
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,359
That's absurd, right?

281
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,360
Let's go.

282
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,199
By the way, how did you escape?

283
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,719
Did Elder Bai save you?

284
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,719
Brother Qiao, do you still remember the time I dressed up as a monk in Shaolin Temple?

285
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:33,199
Even their own seniors and juniors couldn't recognize me.

286
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,239
Not even you.

287
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,279
Your naughty trick.

288
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,679
Who did you dress up as this time?

289
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,559
Divine Physician Xue.

290
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,160
Him?

291
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,239
He treated me every day.

292
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,839
We talked the most.

293
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,160
I can mimic his expressions and figure the best.

294
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,020
I attacked his pressure points

295
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,199
and tied up his hands and legs.

296
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,119
Then, I wore his clothes

297
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,999
and put wrinkles on my face like his.

298
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,079
I looked almost 70% like him.

299
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,119
But Divine Physician Xue has a black and white beard.

300
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,359
It's not easy to make that.

301
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,860
If it's not easy to make, use the real one.

302
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,039
Use the real one?

303
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,820
Yes.

304
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,119
Really?

305
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,639
Yes.

306
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,439
I took a penknife from his trunk

307
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,460
and cut off his beard.

308
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,880
Then, I glued them onto my face strand by strand.

309
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,460
He must be so furious.

310
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,079
But what can I do?

311
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,039
He didn't save me out of kindness.

312
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,319
So, I didn't repay his kindness with hate, did I?

313
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,959
Moreover, after I shaved off his beard,

314
00:33:37,959 --> 00:33:39,879
he looked at least 10 years younger.

315
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,080
He looked more handsome than before.

316
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,019
Don't tell me that you had dressed up as me before.

317
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,039
Brother Qiao, I did dress up as you

318
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,699
to save your friends in Beggars' Sect from the First Class Hall of Xixia.

319
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:16,219
You dressed up as me to save my friends?

320
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,479
Why did you do that?

321
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,919
You saved A'Bi and me.

322
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,500
We were very grateful to you.

323
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,238
But I heard how they treated you.

324
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,579
So, I thought that if I dressed up like you to send the cure to them,

325
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,040
they might feel compassionate towards you.

326
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,120
I never knew that not only were they ungrateful,

327
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,779
they even attacked you in the Heroes' Gathering Manor that day.

328
00:34:38,299 --> 00:34:42,138
So, you also dressed up as me to kill my parents,

329
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:44,959
infiltrate Shaolin Temple, and kill my master.

330
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:48,019
Brother Qiao, wh-what are you talking about?

331
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,539
I didn't kill your master.

332
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:50,759
I didn't kill your parents either.

333
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,659
- I...
- My master was gravely injured.

334
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,119
And I was accused of being the culprit right away.

335
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,299
In this world, who else can mimic me as well as you do, except for you?

336
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,580
No. I didn't kill your master. And I wouldn't kill your...

337
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,380
Who are you working for? Tell me now!

338
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,959
Brother Qiao! Think about it carefully.

339
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:11,520
Your master was so powerful. How would I be able to kill him?

340
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,860
Moreover, even if I were powerful enough,

341
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,479
why didn't I kill those villains for you

342
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,520
when we were in the Heroes' Gathering Manor that day?

343
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,220
That's true.

344
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,300
You are not the one who killed my master.

345
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,239
I'm sorry. I've been restless and confused in the past few days.

346
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,839
Please forgive me.

347
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,639
Brother Qiao, there's no need to apologize to me.

348
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,439
You saved my life.

349
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,939
No matter what, I won't blame you.

350
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:07,200
Don't take this to heart.

351
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,179
Who did you learn this Art of Disguise from?

352
00:36:12,179 --> 00:36:14,920
Does your master have any other disciples?

353
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,479
You don't need a master for this Art of Disguise.

354
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,540
I liked to disguise myself as others since young.

355
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,419
The more I do it, the better I get.

356
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,279
That's strange.

357
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,999
There's another person in this world who looks exactly like me.

358
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:33,399
Even my master mistook him for me.

359
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,599
Brother Qiao, although it's not easy to find that person,

360
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:39,019
at least we have some clues to guide us.

361
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:42,220
I believe that you'll be able to find that person.

362
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,940
I have to find Reverend Zhi Guang.

363
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,999
I want to ask him what was engraved on this cliff.

364
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,020
With Reverend Zhi Guang's personality,

365
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,839
I don't think he'll tell you.

366
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,280
Zhao Qiansun would rather die than give in.

367
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,079
But I have a way to make him talk.

368
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,280
Go! Hurry up!

369
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,839
Speed up!

370
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,079
If Commander finds out that we arrested

371
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,079
the people of Khitan without his order...

372
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,639
The Khitan killed my family.

373
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:25,339
If I don't avenge them, can I call myself a man?

374
00:37:25,339 --> 00:37:27,159
They always capture our citizens, too.

375
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,039
It's not too much for an eye for an eye.

376
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,799
If they can burn, kill and pillage us, why can't we do the same?

377
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:35,239
If Commander finds out about it, I'm sure he won't blame us.

378
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,539
I can't believe those soldiers of the Song Dynasty.

379
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:44,400
How can they bully those innocent people?

380
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,140
Who is it?

381
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,160
Run.

382
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,400
Wait for me.

383
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,480
Get up.

384
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,519
Look. Our benefactor is a Khitan, too.

385
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,680
He's a Khitan, too.

386
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,760
Yes.

387
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,220
Let's go home.

388
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,499
I want to go home.

389
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,840
Brother Qiao!

390
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:16,280
Brother Qiao, there are good people in Han.

391
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,599
And there are good people in Khitan.

392
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,799
You are the one who saved my life.

393
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,079
No matter if you are a Han or a Khitan,

394
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,099
it has no difference to me.

395
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,139
I wasn't planning to save you.

396
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,319
I was just feeling competitive at the time.

397
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,300
So, you don't owe me anymore.

398
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,000
You can leave.

399
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,879
I have been an orphan since young.

400
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,599
I was left on the street.

401
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,039
The late master of the Murong Clan saved me.

402
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,159
He brought me back to Swallow's Nest.

403
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,339
From then on, I became the maid of the Murong Clan.

404
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:59,639
Although I am Young Master Murong's maid, he doesn't own me.

405
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:02,979
Young Master Murong has never treated us as maids either.

406
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:06,220
He even bought some maids to serve us.

407
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,879
Master Murong and his wife

408
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,479
once said that if we are to leave Swallow's Nest one day,

409
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:19,419
the Murong Clan will send us off in joy.

410
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,960
Brother Qiao, I've already bid farewell to Young Master Murong.

411
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,339
From now on, I'll follow you and be your maid.

412
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:33,280
I am a man from Khitan.

413
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,159
I don't deserve you.

414
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,879
You are used to the comfortable lifestyle in Jiangnan.

415
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,979
What good will it do for you to wander around and suffer with me?

416
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:47,519
Brother Qiao, are you rejecting me because I'm a lowly servant?

417
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,899
If you don't allow me to go with you, I'll jump down from here.

418
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:53,260
I'll do it.

419
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,179
General Han who guards the Yanmen Pass is strict and impartial.

420
00:42:21,179 --> 00:42:25,180
By right, his soldiers

421
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:29,180
won't be allowed to treat the citizens of Khitan like that.

422
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,719
Those soldiers must be seeking personal revenge.

423
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,140
I coincidently saved those people of Khitan today.

424
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,359
The wolf head tattoo on their bodies proved that I am a Khitan.

425
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,680
From now onward, I will not be ashamed of being a Khitan.

426
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,740
And I will not be proud of being a Song.

427
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,920
I will fight only for the people in need.

428
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:59,560
And my only mission is to avenge my parents.

429

A licentious and immoral man.

456
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,270
A wanton and shameless woman...

457
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,140
is cheating on her husband and meeting up with her lover.

458
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,270
You are Qiao Feng?
