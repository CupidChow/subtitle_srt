[Episode 22]

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,300
From now on, I shall not be ashamed of the Khitans.

14
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,000
I shall not be proud of the Song Dynasty either.

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,200
I shall only worry about the well-being of the people.

16
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,400
I shall take my parents' grievances as my own.

17
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,800
I must find out who killed my parents.

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Who is the leader?

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,100
The leader is certainly still alive.

20
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,000
Otherwise, they wouldn't be still keeping his identity a secret.

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,800
If the leader is capable of leading the other heroes,

22
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,900
he must be a skilled and reputable martial artist.

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,300
From the letter, it seemed that he shared a special bond with Chief Wang.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,400
He addressed Chief Wang as his elder brother.

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,800
He must be younger than Chief Wang.

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
It won't be difficult to find a man with these traits

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,900
in the martial arts world.

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,200
The people who have read this letter

29
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,000
are Reverend Zhi Guang, Kang Min, Elder Xu,

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,400
and Shan Zheng the Stern Faced Judge.

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,700
Zhao Qiansun must have already informed his junior Mrs. Tan about this.

32
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,800
And Mrs. Tan probably wouldn't hide this from her husband either.

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,000
Shan Zheng wasn't involved in the battle that killed my parents.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Moreover, I have killed both his sons.

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,300
So, there's no need to find him.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,800
Reverend Zhi Guang and Zhao Qiansun were the accomplices.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,800
I must revenge my parents' death.

38
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,700
The leader is the main culprit.

39
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,300
I have to find him.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,800
A'Zhu,

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,300
let's go find Elder Xu of the Beggars' Sect.

42
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,400
Guests, this way.

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,600
What would you like to eat?

44
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Bring me 20 catty of wine.

45
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Sure.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Is it for drinking or a shower?

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,800
20 catty of wine for this table.

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Brother Qiao, we're going to find Elder Xu.

49
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,600
But if we continue our journey like this for two more days,

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,400
we will be found out.

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,600
It's fun to fight our way through,

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,400
but if Elder Xu gets informed and flees the place,

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,800
we won't be able to find him.

54
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,000
That's fun?

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,600
We will fight our way through.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,300
The number of enemies will increase, and the journey will get more and more dangerous.

57
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,800
I...

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,500
Enjoy your food.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,900
As long as there is Brother Qiao around, I don't think there will be any danger.

60
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,700
I only worry that they will take flight before we arrive,

61
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
and it'll be troublesome for us.

62
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,600
Do you have any ideas?

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,600
If they can't recognize us,

64
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,400
things will be way easier.

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,100
I only wonder if the famous Hero Qiao

66
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,400
is willing to put up with it,

67
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
so we can take a detour into the quiet mountains

68
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,900
and avoid the traveling crowd.

69
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,400
It would be best if we can keep a low profile.

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,200
But taking a detour will wear you out.

71
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,800
I am not afraid of being tired

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,300
as long as I can stay with Brother Qiao.

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
Sure.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,300
Here. Let's drink.

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,800
Here.

76
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,800
Brother Qiao, during the journey,

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
we will surely run into many strangers.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,600
When they see you talking and drinking in such a bold manner,

79
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
they would immediately know who you are.

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,200
All right. I'll talk less.

81
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,700
I won't drink either.

82
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,600
[Weihui City]

83
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
[Noodles]

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Have you heard about this?

85
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
I heard that Elder Xu was killed brutally.

86
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,800
His ribs were all broken, both front and back.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,600
The culprit must be Qiao Feng, the wicked thief.

88
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
The funeral will be held at Weihui the day after tomorrow.

89
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
The elders and the brothers of the sect will all be there.

90
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,000
I have some errands to run these few days and I can't make it.

91
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,200
Do you know where Elder Xu is going to be buried?

92
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,600
After I'm done with my errands, I'll pay him my respect.

93
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Elder Xu's spirit tablet will be installed at the Fei Garden,

94
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,000
20 miles west of Weihui city.

95
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,900
Thanks.

96
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,999
Elder Xu is dead.

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,800
We lost another person who knew the identity of the leader.

98
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,000
But there is something very weird about this.

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,500
Why has he died right as we get here?

100
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,200
This is too much of a coincidence.

101
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,410
[Noodles]

102
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,200
What do you mean you don't? Hurry up.

103
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
What's wrong?

104
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
Hurry up!

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Or I'll tear down your stall!

106
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Mrs. Tan?

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
Why is she here?

108
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,600
She must be here to pay homage to Elder Xu.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,700
Brother Qiao, isn't that Zhao Qiansun?

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,800
Those two are sneaking around.

111
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,000
Something fishy is going on.

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,800
Are they having an affair?

113
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
They definitely know who the leader is.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
If we can get ahold of their secrets,

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,700
we'll be able to blackmail them into telling us the truth.

116
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,100
A'Zhu, find an inn and wait for me there. I'll be right back.

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,800
Be careful.

118
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Senior, we are no longer young.

119
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,500
It's too late to regret what we did when we were little.

120
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,600
There's no use bringing up the past.

121
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,800
Xiao Juan, my life has been ruined.

122
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,100
It's too late to regret it now.

123
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,400
I asked you out, only to wish

124
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,400
that you can sing for me the songs you used to sing.

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,500
You are such a fool.

126
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,400
My husband traveled to Weihui

127
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
and was very upset when he saw you.

128
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,200
Besides, he gets suspicious easily.

129
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,000
I advise you to stay away from me in the future.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,400
What are you afraid of?

131
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,700
At this moment, he is taking a good rest at the Rugui Inn.

132
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,200
He won't be here.

133
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
Moreover, we have nothing to hide.

134
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We're just catching up with each other.

135
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,000
Those songs I used to sing...

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Xiao Juan, after today's meeting,

137
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,200
we don't know when we will meet again.

138
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm afraid that I will die soon.

139
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,000
Even if you want to sing for me in the future,

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,700
I might not be around anymore.

141
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,300
Senior, please don't say that.

142
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,400
If you really want to listen to me sing,

143
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
I'll hum a song for you quietly.

144
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,300
Who's there?

145
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,200
A licentious and immoral man

146
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,500
is seducing a married woman.

147
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,200
A wanton and shameless woman

148
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,200
is cheating on her husband and meeting up with her lover.

149
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you Qiao Feng?

150
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,600
At the Fei Garden of Weihui city,

151
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,900
many heroes are paying their respects to Elder Xu.

152
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Should I invite them here to listen to you sing, too?

153
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,700
Qiao Feng, you...

154
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,200
Chief Qiao,

155
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
I haven't done anything against you.

156
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,400
If you can spare us some mercy,

157
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
we'll repay your kindness in the future.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,900
There's no need for that.

159
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
I just have a question for you.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,500
If you can answer my question,

161
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,300
we'll go our separate ways after this.

162
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,200
No one will ever find out what happened today.

163
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,900
As long as I know the answer, I will tell you.

164
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,300
You know what my question is.

165
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,200
Who wrote the letter to Chief Wang?

166
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
Xiao Juan, you can't reveal it.

167
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can't reveal it no matter what.

168
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,800
The worst that can happen to us is death.

169
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,800
I owe the leader a debt of kindness.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,000
I won't reveal his identity even if I have to die for that.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
You'd rather die than reveal his name.

172
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,700
You won't mind

173
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,500
even if your Xiao Juan's reputation is going to be completely ruined?

174
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,000
If Mr. Tan ever finds out about what happened today,

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,200
I'll just cut my own throat in front of him.

176
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,800
You're not indebted to the leader.

177
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Mrs. Tan, tell me who he is,

178
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,700
to save your and Mr. Tan's face,

179
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,600
also your senior's life.

180
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,600
Sure. I'll tell you who he is.

181
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Xiao Juan, you can't. You can't reveal his identity.

182
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,200
Please, I beg you! Please don't.

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I've never begged you in my life.

184
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
This is the only time I've begged you.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,400
You have to promise me.

186
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,000
I beg you.

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,600
Chief Qiao, you get to choose

188
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,400
between benevolence and malevolence.

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,800
Both of us have nothing to hide

190
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
and we can swear to it.

191
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm sorry,

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't give you the answer you want.

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,400
Thank you!  Thank you, Xiao Juan.

194
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Okay. Since this is something you have decided on....

195
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,000
No!

196
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,800
Both of you should stay here for now.

197
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,800
Who are you?

198
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Did my wife send you here?

199
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,100
How can I help you?

200
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,700
Your wife has been captured, and is in a dire situation.

201
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
My wife is a skillful martial artist.

202
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,200
How can she get caught so easily?

203
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
It was Qiao Feng.

204
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,400
Qiao Feng?

205
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,999
Where is she?

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,600
It is very easy to keep your wife alive.

207
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,200
It's also very easy for you to choose to have your wife dead.

208
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Tell me what you want.

209
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,600
Qiao Feng only has one question for you.

210
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,200
If Mr. Tan can answer him honestly,

211
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,800
he will release your wife immediately.

212
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,400
He won't hurt her at all.

213
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,000
But if you refuse to give him an answer,

214
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,099
Mrs. Tan will be buried together with Zhao Qiansun.

215
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
You are Qiao Feng.

216
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,200
Yes, I am.

217
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Why did you put my wife and Zhao Qiansun together?

218
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,600
It has nothing to do with me

219
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,000
who your wife wants to be with.

220
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Do you want to know who she is flirting with

221
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,000
and singing for right now?

222
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Where is she? Bring me there.

223
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,300
I only want to know who the leader is?

224
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,200
This man killed your father.

225
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
I'll never reveal his name.

226
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,200
If you take revenge on him,

227
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,500
what I say will cost him his life.

228
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,080
Then that means you are harming your own life.

229
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
What kind of person do you think I am?

230
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,300
I'm not a coward who fears death

231
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
and I won't betray my friend.

232
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,200
So, you're willing to sacrifice your wife as well?

233
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,600
The names of Mr. Tan and Mrs. Tan will be ruined.

234
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,300
Are you not afraid of living your life with shame?

235
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,600
I am an upright man.

236
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,400
I have never betrayed my friends.

237
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,200
So, how can my name be ruined?

238
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
And how can I be the laughing stock of others?

239
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
You are an upright man,

240
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,800
but Mrs. Tan and Zhao Qiansun are not like you.

241
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,500
Take a look yourself.

242
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,800
You...

243
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,200
You're a brute of a man.

244
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,600
A vicious man.

245
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
I didn't kill them.

246
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,400
Then, who did?

247
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
I can easily kill you.

248
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,800
- There's no reason for me to lie.
- You want to know who killed your father.

249
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,400
I told you I didn't kill them.

250
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,300
Tell me who killed my father,

251
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,000
and I'll avenge your wife's death.

252
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,100
I may not be as skilled a martial artist as you,

253
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,000
but I won't fall into your trap.

254
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Brother Qiao, how did it go?

255
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
They are all dead.

256
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,700
Mrs. Tan and Zhao Qiansun?

257
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Mr. Tan, too.

258
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,400
Zhao Qiansun was the accomplice in your father's murder.

259
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,000
It doesn't matter that he died.

260
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But... Mr. and Mrs. Tan...

261
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,900
I didn't kill them.

262
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
But this is no coincidence.

263
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,200
There are only three people left in this world

264
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
who know the name of the main culprit.

265
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,100
We can't let them get ahead of us again.

266
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,400
We need to hasten our pace.

267
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Kang Min loathes you,

268
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,000
so I guess she won't reveal it.

269
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
A real man doesn't interrogate a widow.

270
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,800
Reverend Zhi Guang's temple is at Jiangnan.

271
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,000
The quickest way now is to get to the Shan residence,

272
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
in Tai'an, Shandong.

273
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,200
I'll go get the bill.

274
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,100
A'Zhu.

275
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You have worked hard for the past few days.

276
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,200
I don't even know how to thank you.

277
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,300
Brother Qiao, you never have to thank me.

278
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,800
Fire! Help! Fire!

279
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Go get water!

280
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,300
Help!

281
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Help!

282
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
Help!

283
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,500
Master Shan is a good person.

284
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,400
He has done so many good deeds for the past tens of years.

285
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,200
His house was set on fire

286
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,800
and none of his 30 family members managed to escape.

287
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,200
This must be the doing of his enemy.

288
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,800
They blocked the gate to stop the people from escaping.

289
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,500
Even a five-year-old in the Shan family knows martial arts.

290
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,600
Yes.

291
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
It doesn't make sense for them to get trapped inside.

292
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,000
I heard that Master Shan, Second Master Shan, and Fifth Master Shan

293
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,400
were all killed by a man named Qiao Feng.

294
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Could Qiao Feng be the one who set the fire, too?

295
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,000
You're right. It must be Qiao Feng.

296
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He must have brought along his men to the villa

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,600
and killed every member of the Shan family.

298
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
He's too vicious.

299
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,200
The wicked man is too cruel and vicious.

300
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
He killed not only Shan Zheng and his son,

301
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,100
but also the other members of his family.

302
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,800
He even burned down the house.

303
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,200
If I were him, I would do the same, too.

304
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,500
Why?

305
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
This is how you exterminate a man.

306
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,200
Brother Shan has a good relationship with the man who wrote the letters.

307
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
He can recognize his handwriting.

308
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,300
I have known this person for many years.

309
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,600
I'm still keeping many letters written by him.

310
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,600
You heard it when we were at Xingzi Forest that night.

311
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,400
Shan Zheng said he still held a few letters from the leader.

312
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,300
He only had to compare the handwriting in the letters.

313
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,600
I got it.

314
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Even if Shan Zheng is dead,

315
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,000
he knew that you'd visit this residence for the letters

316
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,300
and find out who the leader is.

317
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,900
He burned the Shan residence to the ground and now you won't be able to find anything here.

318
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,500
Let's go.

319
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
Let's go.

320
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,239
I've been wondering this whole time.

321
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,999
The wicked man is a scheming and intelligent person.

322
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,259
He gets ahead of me every time.

323
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,919
His skills in martial arts are as good as mine.

324
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,959
It won't be difficult for him to kill me.

325
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,360
But why is he so afraid of me knowing his real identity?

326
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,259
Brother Qiao, you are too humble.

327
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:18,279
It doesn't matter how good the wicked man is,

328
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,059
but I believe, deep down, he's terrified.

329
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,359
He worries that you will take revenge on him if you find out the truth.

330
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,080
Otherwise, he wouldn't have to kill the old couple of the Qiao family,

331
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,119
Reverend Xuan Ku, Zhao Qiansun, Mrs. Tan, Stern Faced Judge, and his family.

332
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,279
You're right.

333
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,219
If he is too scared to harm me,

334
00:23:34,219 --> 00:23:35,819
he's definitely afraid of going near you, too.

335
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,399
But he is a sly man.

336
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,039
I'm deemed a hero by many others.

337
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,679
Yet he is playing me

338
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,159
and I am unable to fight back.

339
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,719
Brother Qiao, that is only because you're an upright man and you despise scheming minds.

340
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,600
He can't beat you.

341
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,679
Whenever I'm sad,

342
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,879
you can always make me feel better.

343
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,839
Thanks.

344
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,020
I mean it.

345
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,120
Good day.

346
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,119
I wonder why the seniors asked me

347
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,740
to come here by myself?

348
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,679
My surname is Du.

349
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,279
Today, my four brothers and I

350
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,919
dare to invite Hero Qiao here to inquire about something.

351
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,679
Please go ahead.

352
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,359
About the death of Reverend Xuan Ku,

353
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,040
Mr. and Mrs. Tan, Zhao Qiansun, Elder Xu of the Beggars' Sect, and Shan Zheng,

354
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,719
what do you think?

355
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,860
I didn't kill them.

356
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,440
They refused to tell me who the leader is.

357
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,539
I did coerce them into telling me the truth,

358
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:34,319
but they would rather die than betray their friend.

359
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,140
I truly respected them for their tenacity.

360
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,239
As for who killed them,

361
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,840
I intend to investigate the matter, too.

362
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,399
Hero Qiao, although my brothers and I refuse to believe your one-sided statement,

363
00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:55,019
but we don't have any evidence that proves that you're the killer either.

364
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,919
How about this?

365
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,519
We should settle this with a palm strike.

366
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,559
If Hero Qiao wins,

367
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,159
we will get out of your way.

368
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,820
You're taking it too seriously.

369
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,439
Five of you are skillful and experienced men.

370
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:14,240
I can tell that if five of you are going to fight me at once,

371
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,239
you'd kill me in an instant.

372
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,420
If you want to give me a lesson,

373
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,380
I don't have very good martial arts,

374
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,879
please spare me some mercy.

375
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,499
If the well-known Chief Qiao is lacking in martial arts,

376
00:26:29,499 --> 00:26:32,199
there will be no one in this world who is actually good at it.

377
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,839
Hero Qiao, you shall go first.

378
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,819
Everyone knows how powerful the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms are.

379
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,119
Chief Wang told me about it before he passed away.

380
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,919
The Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms is well known for its endless power.

381
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,220
After trying it myself today, it's true.

382
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,659
My utmost respect for you.

383
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:21,140
The strike that killed Reverend Xuan Ku was merciless.

384
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,400
Perhaps, it really wasn't from Qiao Feng.

385
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,659
It's a rare opportunity to be able to learn from the Best Palm in the world.

386
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,960
I hope Hero Qiao doesn't hesitate to enlighten us.

387
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,999
Qiao Feng of the North is said to be the best martial artist in the world.

388
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,219
We've witnessed your strength, and you sure live up to your name.

389
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:23,280
We're impressed.

390
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,319
Seniors, I am humbled.

391
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,659
I will never forget today's lesson.

392
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,340
Judging from how Qiao Feng controls his strength and force,

393
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,399
the murderer who killed Mr. and Mrs. Tan is probably someone else.

394
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,100
I investigated Elder Xu's death.

395
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,459
Qiao Feng is probably not involved in Elder Xu's death, either.

396
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,119
Qiao Sanhuai and his wife had all of their ribs broken.

397
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,679
An excellent martial artist killed them with powerful palm strikes.

398
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,959
It looks like the murderer deliberately showed off his skills in martial arts

399
00:29:07,959 --> 00:29:10,199
and tried to frame Qiao Feng.

400
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,759
If it wasn't deliberate,

401
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,919
he wouldn't have used such a powerful move

402
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,699
to kill two unarmed country farmers.

403
00:29:16,699 --> 00:29:19,159
But Qiao Feng is indeed a good martial artist.

404
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,939
He is definitely capable of killing the whole Shan family on his own.

405
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:27,439
If he had the intention to cover up his moves and skills,

406
00:29:27,439 --> 00:29:30,420
it wouldn't be difficult for him either.

407
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,319
We came all the way here.

408
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,399
Although we don't think we're able to stop Hero Qiao,

409
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:44,719
we wish to tell you a fact.

410
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,179
The leader Hero Qiao has been looking for has said that because of him

411
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:51,879
many good friends in the martial arts world have lost their lives.

412
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,320
He feels remorseful himself.

413
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,520
The leader has also said

414
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,239
that what happened at the Yanmen Pass was his fault.

415
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,959
He should have atoned for his sins by killing himself.

416
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,159
If Hero Qiao wants to take revenge on him,

417
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,439
he will be happy to accept the punishment

418
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,400
and will not run away from you.

419
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,239
I wonder what you said

420
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,320
came from the leader himself,

421
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,279
or was a message relayed by others.

422
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,239
It's true.

423
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,159
This is exactly what the leader means.

424
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,660
So, who is the leader?

425
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,999
My name is somewhat known in the martial arts world.

426
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,999
My four brothers are somebody, too.

427
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,799
The five of us never lie.

428
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,519
For now, we still can't reveal his name.

429
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,319
If Hero Qiao is eager to find out his name,

430
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,119
it will definitely come to light later.

431
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,479
My skills are no match for Hero Qiao's.

432
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,239
But despite my incompetence,

433
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,919
I wish to exchange a palm strike with you.

434
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,480
There will be no winner.

435
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,879
I only want you to know that the five of us

436
00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:02,980
take our words very seriously.

437
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:09,539
Hero Qiao, please show me your magnificent palm strike.

438
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,279
Why isn't he exerting any force?

439
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,699
What he's doing is basically suicide.

440
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,119
Oh, no.

441
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,159
This forceless strike is a bait.

442
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,319
When I retract my force, he will take the opportunity to attack

443
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,760
and I'll be killed by his strike.

444
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,540
My life will end here.

445
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,199
Why did I let him go alone?

446
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,679
He is an upright man.

447
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,519
With me by his side,

448
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,400
I can help him in avoiding the plots others have against him.

449
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,099
However, if he runs into those wicked men,

450
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,520
my presence will burden him.

451
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,800
What I say now won't matter anymore.

452
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,260
Brother Qiao. Brother Qiao.

453
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,119
Amitabha.

454
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,039
My master, Reverend Zhi Guang,

455
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,499
sent me here to invite Hero Qiao and Miss A''Zhu to our temple.

456
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:43,159
How do you know my name?

457
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,459
My master told me that I'd be able to find Hero Qiao and Miss A'Zhu at Qinggai Inn.

458
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,519
He told me to invite you to the mountain.

459
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,299
- I presume you are Miss A'Zhu, right?
- Yes, I am.

460
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,779
- Where is Hero Qiao?
- I'm here.

461
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,920
Brother Qiao.

462
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,399
We only arrived here not long ago.

463
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,919
How did your master know about this?

464
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,319
My master is powerful.

465
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,399
He only had to move his fingers to find out about your arrival.

466
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,820
If that's the case, we will need little master's help

467
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,699
to inform your master that we will be right there.

468
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:24,260
Yes.

469
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,640
Brother Qiao, let's talk inside the room.

470
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,219
What do you think we should do now?

471
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,479
Hopefully, when we meet Reverend Zhi Guang later,

472
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,660
he will tell me who the leader and the wicked man are.

473
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,180
What if Reverend Zhi Guang refuses to reveal their names?

474
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,799
Then, I won't force him.

475
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,239
Although Reverend Zhi Guang was involved in the battle that killed my parents,

476
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,840
he later changed into a benevolent man and left for a place far away.

477
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,640
He collected bark and went to many places

478
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,519
to save people who were suffering from malaria caused by miasma.

479
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,799
He too fell terribly ill because of that.

480
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,319
He has done many kind deeds to save the people.

481
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,820
The grievances between us should just end here.

482
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,040
You separate the good from the bad, and are also an upright and honest man.

483
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,140
I have followed the right man.

484
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,979
Brother Qiao, who asked you out just now? Is everything all right?

485
00:34:39,979 --> 00:34:43,498
A few exceptional martial artists wanted to compare notes of martial arts with me.

486
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,300
Are you hurt?

487
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,839
Thanks, Hero Qiao, for your benevolence.

488
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,599
You can understand a good martial artist

489
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,420
from his skills in martial arts,

490
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,779
just like how you can understand a scholar from his writings.

491
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:11,639
To be honest,

492
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,760
the five of us have always wanted to meet you.

493
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:20,539
We followed you from Weihui to the Shan residence in Tai'an, and then here.

494
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:22,999
I didn't know seniors had been following me.

495
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,559
Otherwise, I would have early welcomed you to join me.

496
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,859
In a while, you will meet up with Reverend Zhi Guang.

497
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:30,359
We couldn't wait anymore,

498
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,999
so we came here without prior notice.

499
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,719
After a brief exchange with Hero Qiao,

500
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,479
we know that you're an upright and honest man.

501
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,719
There must be something fishy behind the rumor spread across the martial arts world.

502
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,159
I hope Hero Qiao won't get swayed by the rumor,

503
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,439
so that you won't get into trouble.

504
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,319
The five of us believe in Hero Qiao,

505
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,519
so we won't hide the purpose of our trip anymore.

506
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,199
Reverend Zhi Guang is a virtuous monk.

507
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,720
We hope that you won't harm him.

508
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,319
The previous match appeared to be uneventful,

509
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,820
but was actually full of dangers.

510
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,399
I thought, "What if I died unfortunately

511
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,479
and left you all by yourself?"

512
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,400
What should I do?

513
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,420
You're worried about me, then.

514
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,230
[Zhi Guang Temple]

515
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,839
Master, Hero Qiao is here.

516
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,519
You have traveled a long journey.

517
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,519
I'm sorry to not have welcomed you personally.

518
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,139
We are sorry to disturb Master's quiet time.

519
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:07,260
Benefactor Qiao, your last name was originally Xiao.

520
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,580
Do you know that?

521
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,679
I am an unfilial son.

522
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,860
Master, please enlighten me.

523
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,159
At that time, your father left a text on the wall of the Yanmen Pass.

524
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,259
He said his last name was Xiao, and his name was Yuanshan.

525
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:30,719
In the text he left behind, he named you Feng'er.

526
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,759
We kept your name,

527
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,079
but we just entrusted you to Qiao Sanhuai.

528
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,419
Thus, you took his last name.

529
00:37:37,419 --> 00:37:40,919
I only learned about my father's name today.

530
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,039
Thanks, Master, for your kindness.

531
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Please accept my gratitude.

532
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,380
Amitabha.

533
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,979
What I did is not worth being called kind.

534
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:56,760
From now on,

535
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,180
I will be Xiao Feng,

536
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,679
no longer Qiao Feng.

537
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,560
Yes. Brother Xiao.

538
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,599
Very good, indeed.

539
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:11,279
I guess you've seen

540
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,900
the text on the wall of the Yanmen Pass.

541
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,079
No. When I reached the wall,

542
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,199
the text had already been scraped off.

543
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,300
There was nothing left.

544
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,319
What is done is done.

545
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,079
They could scrape off the text on the stone wall,

546
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,480
but they can't revive

547
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,760
the dozens of lives they killed.

548
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,620
Benefactor Xiao, this is the rubbing of the text written on the wall.

549
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,639
Master, please translate this.

550
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,079
After we duplicated the text,

551
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,139
at the gate of Yanmen Pass, we found some men who understood Khitan to translate this to us.

552
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,299
We found a few men and they gave us similar translations.

553
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:12,999
The rubbing says,

554
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,240
"It was Feng'er's birthday.

555
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,199
I brought my wife and my son to my grandmother's house to attend a banquet.

556
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,599
On our way, we ran into thieves from the Four Dynasties.

557
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,279
It happened all of a sudden.

558
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,999
Hence, my wife and my son were hurt by the robbers.

559
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,839
I have no more will to stay alive.

560
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,279
The teacher I respected was a Han person from the Four Dynasties.

561
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,519
I swore before my teacher that I would never kill any Han person.

562
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:39,479
However, I killed a dozen of Han people today.

563
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,959
I am now swamped with pain and remorse.

564
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,039
I will also be too ashamed to meet my teacher after I die.

565
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,500
The last word by Xiao Yuanshan."

566
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,400
This is the translation of the text left by the late Mr. Xiao.

567
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,120
Master, can I have this?

568
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,000
This is supposed to be my gift to you.

569
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,619
Back then, we thought your father led the Khitan Warriors

570
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,439
to Shaolin Temple to steal the scriptures.

571
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,399
But after we read the translation of the text on the wall,

572
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:18,079
only did we learn that we were so wrong.

573
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,239
If your father had decided to die,

574
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,699
there was no reason for him to write down a lie on the wall right before he died.

575
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,079
If your father intended to steal the scriptures from Shaolin Temple,

576
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,639
why would he bring along his wife who knew nothing about martial arts,

577
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,439
and a baby who was barely one year old?

578
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,199
After we inquired into it, the rumor of him trying to steal the scriptures from Shaolin

579
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:41,079
came from a presumptuous man who intended to fool with the leader.

580
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,879
He wanted to tire the leader out,

581
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,040
and scoffed at him.

582
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,000
He did all of this just to poke fun at him?

583
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,440
What happened to the presumptuous man?

584
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,639
When the leader found out the truth,

585
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,599
he naturally was furious.

586
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,599
But the presumptuous man

587
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,679
was already nowhere to be seen.

588
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,959
Now that 30 years have passed,

589
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,560
I guess

590
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,299
he is no longer alive.

591
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:18,200
Thanks, Master, for the explanation.

592
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,880
I have another question.

593
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,180
Benefactor Xiao, what do you want to ask?

594
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,740
Who is the leader?

595
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,539
I saw this coming.

596
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,159
Benefactor, please give me a minute.

597
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,460
I have something to show you.

598
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,359
Benefactors, my master wants to speak with you in the meditation room.

599
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,640
[Meditation]

600
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,060
Master.

601
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,919
"Every being on earth is born equal.

602
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,359
The Saint and the beasts are treated equally.

603
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,679
The Han and the Khitan could be both fake and real.

604
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,660
Gratitude and resentment will all eventually turn into ashes."

Gratitude and resentment will all eventually turn into ashes.

Actually, no matter it be Khitan or Hans, there is no difference.

00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:40,590
In this martial arts world where you are always tasting blood, I'm sure you've had enough of it.

634
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,770
Why don't we go to Yanmen Pass, make a new life,

635
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:48,730
and forget all the greivances of the martial arts world?

636
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,660
You can hunt,

637
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:54,030
