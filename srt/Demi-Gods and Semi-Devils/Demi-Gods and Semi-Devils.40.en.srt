[Episode 40]

13
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,400
Cousin,

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,779
Mister Xu Zhu looks too busy to handle all of them.

15
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,340
Why don't we go and help him out?

16
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,360
At this point, staying is meaningless.

17
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,440
We should just leave.

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,180
Cousin!

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,639
I will leave this to you.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,240
Yes, Master.

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,379
Young Master Murong!

22
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:31,680
Y-Y-Young Master Murong, please wait.

23
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,000
Young Master Murong, why are you leaving in a hurry?

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,879
Why don't you stay for a meal and leave after that?

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,720
How pretentious.

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,600
Fourth Brother.

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,779
I have offended the Piaomiao Peak, thus feel embarrassed.

28
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:50,339
I am already grateful that you did not blame us.

29
00:02:50,339 --> 00:02:51,519
How can I bother you again?

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,659
No, not at all. You are not bothering me at all.

31
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,159
Young Master Murong, you are an unparalleled hero who is adept in both literature and martial arts.

32
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,460
You have my utmost admiration.

33
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,119
I wish to make you stay to...

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,520
I only want to...

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,020
Want to...

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,660
You want to ask Young Master Murong for advice, right?

37
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,239
Yes, exactly! That is exactly my intention.

38
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,760
Young Master Duan, you really know what to say.

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,139
That is exactly what I had in mind.

40
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,500
Little Master, I don't think you intend for him to stay.

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,140
What you want is for this beautiful lady to stay, right?

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,539
You keep Miss Wang's portrait close to you all the time.

43
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,679
Now, you are making us stay.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,679
Do you take us from the Murong clan as a bunch of fools?

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,839
Mister, you have misunderstood me.

46
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,020
The person in that portrait is not Miss Wang, just similar to Miss Wang.

47
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,759
She even looks like Senior Li Qiushui.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,060
- Oh, please.
- Third Brother Bao, say no more.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,560
Let's go.

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,419
Cousin, let's go.

51
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,960
Young Master Duan, thank you.

52
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,320
Miss Wang.

53
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,279
Forget it.

54
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,600
In Miss Wang's eyes,

55
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
she only has her cousin.

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,920
The only thing I can do

57
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,279
is to tell her to take care of herself.

58
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,159
Elder Brother. Elder Brother, you asked for me?

59
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,520
Brother Zhuang, come and have a seat.

60
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,019
The Beggar's Sect's annual Kunshan General Assembly will be held soon.

61
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,059
Sit.

62
00:05:01,059 --> 00:05:03,519
We will elect a new chief at the tournament.

63
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,979
We are going to depart to take part in it.

64
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:08,379
Since you are Beggar's Sect's disciple,

65
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:10,499
why don't you bring Miss A'Zi along?

66
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:12,100
So you can take care of her.

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,099
Thank you, Brother. This would be great.

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
In the election of the new chief,

69
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,100
any disciple can take part.

70
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,960
The election of the new chief will be determined by strength.

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,959
My martial arts is average,

72
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
so I'm no match to those elders.

73
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,339
But you're good at martial arts.

74
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,339
Would you like to take the stage to fight for the position of chief?

75
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,659
Me?

76
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:40,019
How can I?

77
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,799
Brother, I can't do it.

78
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,199
Why not?

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,340
It's merely days since I joined Beggar's Sect.

80
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,059
I don't have much experience.

81
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:51,339
Besides, I have made no contribution to the Beggar's Sect at all.

82
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:54,100
So, how can I be the Chief of Beggar's Sect?

83
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,160
You must not think this way.

84
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,699
Ever since that traitor, Qiao Feng left Beggar's Sect,

85
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,820
the sect has no leader,

86
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,800
which has brought us complete shame.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,100
This concerns the century-old foundation of the Beggar's Sect.

88
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,459
This decision is made in order not to be restricted to one's seniority.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,499
If you could win in one fell swoop

90
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,419
and have your name spread over the world,

91
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:19,360
wouldn't that be great?

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,500
Brother, I don't mind you teasing me.

93
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,840
I have no ambition at all.

94
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,200
I only wish to stay beside Miss A'Zi.

95
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
That would be enough for me.

96
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,320
Brother, I have something I'm not sure if I should tell.

97
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,299
Brother, do tell.

98
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:44,720
I know you have a deep affection towards Miss A'Zi,

99
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,880
but Miss A'Zi doesn't feel the same way.

100
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,139
She thinks of returning to the Liao Kingdom.

101
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,600
Do you want to know why?

102
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,420
Please enlighten me.

103
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,539
Miss A'Zi has a strong personality.

104
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,340
She especially worships people with outstanding capabilities.

105
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,259
She always mentions her brother-in-law, often full of praise.

106
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,280
This person must be extraordinary.

107
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,000
The Beggar's Sect is the greatest sect in the world.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,560
When Qiao Feng was the chief,

109
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,760
he already had a great reputation in the martial arts world.

110
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,980
Everyone treated him with great admiration.

111
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,560
If you can be the Chief of the Beggar's Sect

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,199
and become a famous hero all over the world,

113
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,760
why worry about Miss A'Zi not looking at you in a different light?

114
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,260
There are still a few days left before we leave.

115
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,320
It's either you want to stay the same,

116
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,959
chasing Miss A'Zi from behind, or show your strength,

117
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,900
so she'll commit and stay by your side.

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Think about this carefully.

119
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,690
[Wine]

120
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,780
Madam, you left just like that.

121
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,240
But you didn't tell me where Mrs. Dreamy is.

122
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,380
I really miss her now.

123
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,859
My dear friend, we share the same predicament.

124
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:45,480
Such unforgettable yearning,

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,680
how do we divert ourselves from it?

126
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,679
Mister Duan, so you heard what I said just now.

127
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,180
My dear friend, you're an unparalleled hero,

128
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,779
but love doesn't consider literary and martial arts skills.

129
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,380
If there's no fate,

130
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,200
it won't work out anyway.

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,140
Buddha once said, "Everything is fated.

132
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,919
Everything is all about fate,

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,840
but we can only wait and not ask for it."

134
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,720
After we separated,

135
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,920
how can I even find her in a sea of faces?

136
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
The scripture says, "Everything is born by fate,

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,899
everything is destroyed by fate.

138
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,339
In order not to fall into depression,

139
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,460
one can only let fate decides gains and losses."

140
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
"Let fate decide gains and losses."

141
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,420
You're right, fate decides while my heart settles.

142
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,959
But we're just ordinary men.

143
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,800
How can we cultivate to such a level?

144
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,940
I have been longing for her,

145
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,040
but I do not know if she has me in her heart.

146
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,960
Mister Duan.

147
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,040
Here.

148
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,540
Mister Duan, it bothers you if she likes you.

149
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,600
As for me,

150
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,939
I don't even know her name

151
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:28,920
and her whereabouts.

152
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,199
Oh, Buddha, am I fated to see her or not?

153
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,760
My dear brother, whether you're fated to see her, I do not know.

154
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,179
But the world is vast.

155
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,620
You and I have met again and again.

156
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,679
We met outside Wuxi City, at the bamboo forest,

157
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,499
at Leigu Mountain to meet Deaf Mute Old Man,

158
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,779
and now at Lingjiu Palace of Piaomiao Peak.

159
00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:00,039
Now, you and I are on the same stone step,

160
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,760
similarly lamenting as we're troubled by love.

161
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,900
What is this called if not fate?

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,840
Shouldn't we enjoy our wine then?

163
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,020
That's the spirit.

164
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,399
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

165
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,500
How delightful!

166
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,600
Buddha once said,

167
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,319
"There are countless beings, but a true friend is hard to find."

168
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,179
Today, I feel comforted by a friend.

169
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:44,320
The sadness in my heart has been lifted.

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,180
Mister Xu Zhu, you and I think alike.

171
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,819
Why don't we just be sworn brothers?

172
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,259
Qiao Feng is my older sworn brother.

173
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,319
He is a real hero,

174
00:11:55,319 --> 00:11:58,360
who is unrivaled in martial arts and drinking liquor.

175
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,299
It's too bad that he is not here.

176
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:03,099
Otherwise, the three of us would be sworn brothers

177
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:07,679
and share the joy of righteousness. It is such a pleasure in life!

178
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,579
Mister Duan, for you to ask me to be your sworn brother

179
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,760
means you think highly of me.

180
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,659
Then, let's be sworn brothers first.

181
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,779
Someday, we will find Brother Qiao

182
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,220
and do the ritual again. What do you think?

183
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,359
Marvelous! Marvelous!

184
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,739
Brother Xu Zhu, please accept my respect.

185
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:27,900
Third Brother, please get up.

186
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,439
- Third Brother.
- Second Brother.

187
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,240
What about paying respect to Heaven and Earth?

188
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,640
Sure.

189
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,259
Master, you're awake. Rinse your mouth.

190
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,900
Thank you.

191
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,340
Thank you very much.

192
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,979
Where is Young Master Duan?

193
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:23,479
Master drank too much last night.

194
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,239
Young Master Duan has already gone down the mountain.

195
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,400
Before he left, he instructed me to tell Master

196
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,319
that after everything in Lingjiu Palace has settled,

197
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,980
he asked Master to meet him in Central Plains.

198
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,180
He already left?

199
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,960
I still have many things to ask him.

200
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,340
Older sisters, how about you go out first?

201
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,159
I want to get out of bed and put on my clothes.

202
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,999
Master, both of us will help you get dressed.

203
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,160
I can do it myself.

204
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,899
Where's my cowl?

205
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,519
Master was drunk last night.

206
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,059
So the four of us bathed and dressed you.

207
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:29,200
Didn't you know?

208
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,820
Bath?

209
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,700
Dressed?

210
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,740
The four of you?

211
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,380
Master, is there anything wrong?

212
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,039
I am a man.

213
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,699
You are all women.

214
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,880
How could you give me a bath last night?

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,599
This...

216
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,759
All four of us are your maids.

217
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,379
It is our duty to die for you.

218
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,800
- If you have any requests, you can...
- Get out!

219
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,159
Get out. Just get out!

220
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,799
I can put the clothes on myself.

221
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,280
I don't need you to help me. Just get out now.

222
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,320
Next time, it's better for you not to enter anymore.

223
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,620
Man and woman shouldn't get too intimate. So just leave.

224
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,420
Get out.

225
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,559
Why are you crying?

226
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,140
You want us to get out

227
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,640
and refuse to let us attend to you.

228
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,900
You must hate us.

229
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,600
Don't be sad. It's my fault.

230
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,839
I'm not good at talking.

231
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,119
Next time, if there's anything that you want to do,

232
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,239
tell me in advance so I can prepare myself.

233
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,160
Master, don't blame them.

234
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,559
There was never a man residing in Lingjiu Palace,

235
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,259
but you are still our master.

236
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,420
So there's no difference if you are a man or a woman.

237
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,699
- Go and help Master wash up and put on his clothes.
- Yes

238
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,759
Master, please come this way.

239
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,899
Elder Sister, there are still many island owners

240
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:52,839
and cave masters who haven't gotten their Mortality Talismans dispelled.

241
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,619
I have put them in order and they are waiting in the hall.

242
00:16:56,619 --> 00:17:00,259
After you have finished breakfast, you can treat them.

243
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:05,220
This Mortality Talisman can be serious when it takes into effect.

244
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,959
Since I'm not hungry now,

245
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,440
let's just meet them first.

246
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,240
Yes, Master.

247
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,100
Me... It's my turn now.

248
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,300
Thank you, Master, for saving my life.

249
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,740
Master.

250
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.

251
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,740
I was born slow and dumb.

252
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm still not that proficient

253
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,060
in this method of extraction.

254
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,739
If this goes on,

255
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,200
I can only treat four people in the morning.

256
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,299
All of you will have to suffer a little longer.

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,180
What should we do now?

258
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,800
Master! Master!

259
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,420
There is a stone wall image left by Madam in the back hall of Lingjiu Palace.

260
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,240
It's said to be related to the Mortality Talisman.

261
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,540
Why don't you go and have a look?

262
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,779
Please lead the way then.

263
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:02,320
Yes, Master.

264
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,739
Master, please enter. This is the stone chamber.

265
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,380
Why aren't you coming in?

266
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,879
- Master, we cannot enter.
- Why?

267
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:28,519
This is a restricted area of the palace.

268
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,180
We cannot enter without permission.

269
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,739
It's okay, just come in with me.

270
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,519
Master, Madam said this before her demise.

271
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,779
If we can wait upon her faithfully and practice hard,

272
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,719
after we reach 40 years old,

273
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,939
she will allow us to enter this stone chamber for one day

274
00:19:44,939 --> 00:19:47,020
to study the martial arts on the stone wall.

275
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,559
At present, even if you are gracious enough

276
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,439
not to revoke Madam's promise,

277
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,799
that will be more than 20 years later.

278
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,840
More than 20 years?

279
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,339
Won't you be old when that time comes?

280
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:01,100
Would you still have the strength to practice martial arts?

281
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,280
Just come in and practice together.

282
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,880
Enough, just listen to me and come in.

283
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,600
Thank you for Master's grace.

284
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,099
Master, these images seem to be arranged in order.

285
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,399
Master, to follow the order, we should look at the first picture of the first group.

286
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,540
Isn't this Tianshan Plum Hand?

287
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,880
This is Six Solar Palms of Tianshan.

288
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,819
On the way to Xixia, those phrases that Madam passed to me

289
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:18,840
happen to correspond to these images.

290
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,600
Those martial arts at the bottom must be...

291
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,420
What's wrong?

292
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,940
Thank you, Master, for treating our injuries.

293
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,479
All of you, there is no need to thank me.

294
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,839
Please get up.

295
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,740
Thank you, Master.

296
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,540
Elder Sister, what happened just now?

297
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,959
Why did you suddenly pass out?

298
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,539
Master, our skills are very low.

299
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:21,880
We can't practice these martial arts.

300
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,200
When Madam wanted us to wait until we were 40 years old,

301
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,559
only then could we enter this stone chamber every year to study the images for a day.

302
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,100
It turns out she had her reasons.

303
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,540
The martial arts on these stone walls are too profound.

304
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,040
We lack internal power.

305
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,700
When we started to practice,

306
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,039
it instantly entered our meridian points.

307
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,979
Luckily you saved us in time.

308
00:23:42,979 --> 00:23:49,020
Or else, we would have been paralyzed forever.

309
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,500
Madam had great expectations of us.

310
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,879
She hoped after we turned 40 years old,

311
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,719
we could practice these excellent martial arts.

312
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,780
But we lack talents.

313
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,220
We fear even if we train for another 20 years,

314
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,600
we won't dare to enter this stone chamber.

315
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,199
It's all my fault.

316
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,759
I shouldn't have let you come in.

317
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,559
Master, why do you say that?

318
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,119
You were being gracious.

319
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,099
We were the ones who overestimated our abilities.

320
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:17,739
You have such profound skills,

321
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,199
so it's beneficial to practice these advanced martial arts.

322
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,439
Madam used to lock herself in here for a long time

323
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,900
just to guess the images on these stone walls.

324
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,179
Elder Sister, I just practiced one of the martial arts,

325
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,999
and now I feel energetic and full of internal force.

326
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,279
I'd like to practice a little longer.

327
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,159
You can go back and rest.

328
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,119
Perhaps, I can help more people to extract the Mortality Talisman.

329
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,320
Thank you for your thoughtfulness, Master.

330
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,360
Go on now.

331
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,220
Good! Good!

332
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,640
Today is the tournament for the selection of the sect's chief!

333
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,740
To all six branches of Beggar's Sect,

334
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,499
now is your chance to show your skills.

335
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:48,359
Disciples of all six branches,

336
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,700
who will come forward to compete?

337
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,580
Brother Zhuang, it's your turn to go up.

338
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,100
Without delay,

339
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,700
let the martial arts tournament begin!

340
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,860
Zhuang Juxian of Dazhi Branch, why are you still not up there?

341
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,599
I...

342
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,100
Brother Zhuang, don't let Miss A'Zi down.

343
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,120
Awesome!

344
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,679
Awesome! Nice one!

345
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,620
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

346
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,160
Great skills!

347
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,259
Nice one!

348
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,280
What martial art is this?

349
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,419
- It's incredible.
- You're right.

350
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,079
Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!

351
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,700
Incredible! Incredible! Incredible!

352
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,860
Awesome!

353
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,599
We're all brothers from the same sect. How could you be so merciless?

354
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,899
That's right! This isn't a tournament.

355
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:51,820
This is obviously killing people.

356
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,980
Why are you talking so much when your skill is inferior to his?

357
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,599
That's right. You lost so just accept it.

358
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,259
If you're not happy with it, fight him then!

359
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:02,019
- What did you say?
- I dare you to fight.

360
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:04,819
- Come and bring it on!
- Come here!

361
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:07,200
- I'm not scared of you!
- Bring it on!

362
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,800
Come here!

363
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,699
For this year's martial arts tournament,

364
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:14,820
Dazhi Branch, Zhuang Juxian has won!

365
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,140
- I don't accept it!
- We don't!

366
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,660
We don't accept!

367
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,100
- That's right!
- Why?

368
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,680
Why?

369
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,060
- That's right!
- We don't accept it!

370
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,900
- Give us a reason!
- That's right!

371
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,700
Brothers from all six branches,

372
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,039
anyone who is not satisfied,

373
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,579
you can challenge Zhuang Juxian on stage!

374
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:37,300
I'll go first!

375
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,780
Great!

376
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,540
Your Highness, we have news of the princess.

377
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,200
- Where is she? Have you brought her back?
- No.

378
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,340
We have been searching for the princess' whereabouts for days but found nothing,

379
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,420
until a couple of days ago, we found a message left by the princess asking for help.

380
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,339
After our search, we found she's together with those from Dazhi Branch of Beggar's Sect.

381
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,779
I've already sent some men to watch them closely.

382
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:26,260
They will report back right away if there's news.

383
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,780
Beggar's Sect?

384
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,680
Dazhi Branch?

385
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,260
That's Quan Guanqing's branch.

386
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,500
- How did she end up with them?
- I'm not sure.

387
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,519
Our brothers who sneaked in reported

388
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,099
that the princess is always with a man by the last name Zhuang.

389
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,840
It seems like there's no need to worry about her life for now.

390
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,679
Could they have found out A'Zi's identity?

391
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,740
So they want to use her to deal with me?

392
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,380
It's probably because of me.

393
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,380
A'Zi is a stubborn person.

394
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,219
She won't ask for help that easily.

395
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:02,799
Could the Beggar's Sect have captured her just to target me?

396
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,739
Tell your men to watch over the princess.

397
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,939
Don't alert the enemies.

398
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:10,339
- I'm going to Central Plains to bring her back.
- But, Your Highness—

399
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:13,739
Also, tell Brother Mo that I want to see him.

400
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,580
Yes, Your Highness.

401
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,779
Where does this man come from? Why is he so merciless?

402
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,119
He defeated the sect's 13 aces in a short time.

403
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,640
Even if Chief Qiao were here,

404
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,959
I fear he would be nothing more than this.

405
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,519
Chief Qiao would never disregard people's feelings if he were here.

406
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,919
We're all part of the same sect.

407
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,559
Anyone who fought him is either dead or wounded.

408
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,080
This person is extremely vicious.

409
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,719
Who is this vicious person?

410
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:38,545
- That's right!
- He's too ruthless!

411
00:32:38,546 --> 00:32:39,839
- Unbelievable.

412
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,719
- How could he do that?
- That's right.

413
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,780
We're all brothers.

414
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,840
He doesn't care about others at all.

415
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,419
Dazhi Branch, Zhuang Juxian has won!

416
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,180
I just received news

417
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,240
that A'Zi is in the Beggar's Sect's hand.

418
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,479
It won't be easy to escape this time.

419
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,319
I've decided to head to the Central Plains to bring her back.

420
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,759
During this period,

421
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,840
all the affairs of South Palace will be for you to manage.

422
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,779
If there is something that you can't decide, you can send homing pigeons to me

423
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:21,799
or consult His Majesty and let His Majesty decide.

424
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,899
But, Your Highness, we may not be going to war at the moment,

425
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,860
but there are many matters that need Your Highness to handle in person.

426
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,940
If Your Highness leaves now, I fear Your Highness will be subjected to criticism.

427
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,919
Also, the war between Song and Liao is imminent.

428
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,560
Your Highness still has many enemies in the Central Plains.

429
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,679
Your Highness is risking your life by going there at this time.

430
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,819
- What if Your Highness' identity is exposed?
- I will decide if it's dangerous.

431
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:49,420
The Beggar's Sect is targeting me this time.

432
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,000
Even if it's a tiger's den,

433
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,940
I still have to break in, too.

434
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,960
Fine.

435
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,859
In that case, I'll dispatch the troops right away to escort Your Highness.

436
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:02,600
The relationship between Liao and Song has always been at stake.

437
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,919
If I bring a large number of people this time,

438
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,760
it will only worsen the relationship.

439
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,678
The purpose of this trip is to rescue A'Zi.

440
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,739
Other than mobilizing too many people, why not just sneak in?

441
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,299
Go and select a few capable men to leave with me immediately.

442
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,880
Yes, Your Highness.

443
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,720
Zhuang Juxian of Dazhi Branch has 13 consecutive victories.

444
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,799
Is there anyone else from the six branches who wish to come up and challenge him?

445
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,779
If there's no one else,

446
00:34:48,779 --> 00:34:51,319
Zhuang Juxian will be today's winner!

447
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,880
Good!

448
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,559
According to the rules of this year's general assembly,

449
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,080
I now announce the new Chief of Beggar's Sect, Zhuang Juxian!

450
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,420
Stop!

451
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,000
I don't agree!

452
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,139
Elder Wu, what are you doing?

453
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:27,820
After Qiao Feng left,

454
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,120
the position of the chief sect has been vacant.

455
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,220
We, elders, agreed not to participate in this tournament

456
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,320
was precisely to select talents

457
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,180
to expand the century-old foundation of Beggar's Sect.

458
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,480
This Brother Zhuang's origin is unknown.

459
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,680
We know nothing of his background and behavior

460
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,700
to the point that he doesn't dare to reveal his true face.

461
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,940
If we rely solely on one's excellent martial arts skill

462
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,060
to be the sect's chief,

463
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,700
won't that be too hasty?

464
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,440
Former Chief Qiao Feng was the direct disciple of late Chief Wang.

465
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,100
He has long been famous in the martial arts world.

466
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,319
He has also passed the three obstacles.

467
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,019
After he made seven huge contributions,

468
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,940
only then was he appointed as the chief.

469
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,140
It has only been days since Brother Zhuang joined the Beggar's Sect.

470
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,260
Not only has he made no contributions to the Beggar's Sect at all,

471
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,740
he is also vicious.

472
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,260
This is completely inconsistent with the Beggar's Sect of being open and frank.

473
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,000
My question is...

474
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,220
If he really becomes the chief sect,

475
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,560
how can he convince everyone?

476
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,500
- He's right.
- That's right.

477
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,960
Elder Wu, you are wrong.

478
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,779
Since we have set the rules on selecting the chief through martial arts tournaments within the sect,

479
00:37:12,779 --> 00:37:16,300
naturally, it depends on the result of the tournament then.

480
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,900
The so-called "regardless of the hero's origin."

481
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,600
Brother Zhuang may have joined Beggar's Sect just recently,

482
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,419
but in terms of his martial arts strength,

483
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:28,579
- he's above all of you.
- You...

484
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,959
Even if the elders attack together at the same time,

485
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,459
you may not necessarily defeat him.

486
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,639
Why you...

487
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,380
Only when someone like him becomes the Chief of the Beggar's Sect

488
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,000
can our reputation be restored

489
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,260
and let our fame spread far and wide.

490
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,679
Elder Wu, for you to firmly oppose this,

491
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,699
could it be you still think about that Qiao Feng?

492
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,520
That's slander!

493
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,540
My brothers, don't tell me there's only Qiao Feng of the Khitans,

494
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,560
and there's none in Central Plains?

495
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,300
He's right.

496
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,999
Since we have selected the Chief of the Beggar's Sect,

497
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,120
why aren't you paying your respects to him?

498
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,380
I, Head of the Dazhi Branch of the Beggar's Sect, Quan Guanqing

499
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,439
leading our brothers to greet Chief.

500
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,960
Greetings, Chief!

501
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,440
Outrageous!

502
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,139
Please get up. Brothers, please get up.

503
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,860
Get up.

504
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,780
Chief, come here.

505
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,820
Training Elder, Brother Zhuang is modest and not good at words.

506
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,879
May I ask you to preside over the ceremony

507
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
and make his position official as soon as possible?

508
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,239
So the Beggar's Sect has a leader

509
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,160
and let our brothers feel settled.

510
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,559
Am I right, Brothers?

511
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:43,220
Yes! Chief Zhuang! Chief Zhuang! Chief Zhuang!

512
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,320
Go to Central Plains?

513
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,239
Great Prince of South Palace has a high position.

514
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,559
At a time when the situation in both nations is critical,

515
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:06,279
for you to head to Central Plains only for A'Zi will certainly invite rumors.

516
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:09,359
It will bring harm to you and Great Liao.

517
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,260
The Beggar's Sect threatens you with A'Zi.

518
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,199
I fear they have already set up a trap.

519
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,420
Even if you have extraordinary skills,

520
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,879
one person is no match for two people.

521
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,220
If there is a mishap,

522
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,599
how am I going to deal with it?

523
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,300
Your Majesty's words, I understand,

524
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,660
but I have promised one person

525
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:34,299
that I will keep A'Zi safe in this life.

526
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:36,079
A'Zi may be stubborn,

527
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,460
but she is being implicated because of me.

528
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,780
How can I ignore it?

529
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,199
You really want to go?

530
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,880
This concerns my sister's life, I have to go.

531
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,700
If I make it difficult for Your Majesty,

532
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,719
please strip me off my position as the Great Prince of South

533
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,900
to avoid future trouble.

534
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,279
Put down Prince of Chu and stabilize the nation

535
00:41:11,279 --> 00:41:13,159
is your righteous act.

536
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,519
Even if it's Great Liao,

537
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,919
I am willing to share it with you.

538
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,220
I give you my permission to go.

539
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,259
Return right away after you have found A'Zi to avoid trouble.

540
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,020
I shall wait for your return.

541
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

542
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,820
Are you full, Miss?

543
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,380
Here, have some water so you won't choke yourself.

544
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,780
Here.

545
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,900
Chief Zhuang!

546
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,574
Chief Zhuang!

547
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:26,039
What's going on?

548
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,740
Nothing, Miss.

549
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,740
As the Beggar's Sect's senior elder, I, Chen Guyan, have something to ask.

550
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,279
So I came all the way from the Yanmen Pass.

551
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,160
There are many doubts in my heart,

552
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,100
so I hope Chief can answer them in person.

553
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,400
Elder Chen!

554
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,620
How can you be so disrespectful to the chief?

555
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
- Chief.
- Brother Quan.

556
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,160
So, this is the new chief you have chosen with great effort?

Yes. And that, just that.

584
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,990
You... Have you had wine?

585
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,770
Master, I have broken the rules,

586
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,060
and many other things.

587
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:47,500
Kneel down.

588
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:51,560
You are so young.

589
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,110
Yet you are so daring. You dared to break that many rules.
