If you still care for our poor daughter,

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,820
then from today onwards, you must listen to me.

16
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,980
You can never come back,

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,199

It's not that I don't want to,

I can't just leave.

22
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,120
You said that eighteen years ago,

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,180

Senior Sister!

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,459
Senior Sister! You have been fooled by him again.

36
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:36,959
He is going to fool with you for some days

37
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,500

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,720
Baobao, what a surprise.

Duan, are you all right?

47
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:11,260
Little Sister, from now on, you have to call me brother.

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,020
Loving each other as siblings is also fine.

49
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,620
No.

50
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,020
I don't believe it.

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,980
You are the first man who has ever seen my face.

52
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,240
I've sworn.

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,799
I've sworn. I don't believe it!

- I don't believe it!

Let my son go now!

He is going back with me as my apprentice.

58
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:48,499
Order your men to retreat immediately!

59
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,480

Let's go!

61
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,919
Do you want to keep him alive or not?

62
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,859
He was wounded by a poison arrow and is seriously injured.

63
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:38,524
Let him go first. We can talk everything out.

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,720
Follow my boss to Wanjie Valley to talk then!

65
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,380
Yu'er!

66
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,020
Yu'er!

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,400
Duan Zhengchun, shall we have a battle today?

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,200
Baobao, are you putting me in a difficult position, too?

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,320
Listen!

71
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,776
I am the wife of Zhong Wanchou, the Chief of Wanjie Valley.

72
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,359
Baobao, I've been missing you a lot lately.

73
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,640
How have you been all these years?

74
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,280
I'm fine without you.

75
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,920
Junior Sister!

76
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,320
Please excuse me.

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,099
Duan Zhengchun, you have bullied us.

78
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,339
I sincerely apologize to the both of you.

79
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,619
Who wants your apology? Let us go now!

80
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:35,019
Hong Mian, calm down.

81
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:36,819
You have to believe what I just said.

82
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:40,679
Senior Sister, this guy is an expert in sweet-talking people.

83
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,660
Don't believe anything he says.

84
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,059
Then, Baobao, I'd like to ask you.

85
00:05:45,059 --> 00:05:47,339
What kind of man did you marry?

86
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,250
My husband, he's ugly, has a bad temper,

87
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,959
his martial arts skills are nothing like you,

88
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,200
don't even mention your wealth and status.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,579
However, he loves me wholeheartedly,

90
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:01,019
and I love him with all my heart and soul, too.

91
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,880
If I were to fail him,

92
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:06,051
then I, Gan Baobao, shall stand condemned by God,

93
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,659
and would be condemned to eternal suffering.

94
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,860
Don't say such nonsense.

95
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,659
It's me that's not blessed to have you treat me like that.

96
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:16,000
It's me to blame, I'm not good enough.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,319
But... why did both of you take my son captive?

98
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,319
Baobao, where is that Wanjie Valley?

99
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,180
His Majesty the Emperor arrives!

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,599
Brother! Don't do this!

101
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:45,100
Yu'er was held captive.

102
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,400
Wan Li told me everything.

103
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,179
Brother Chun, now that the descendant of the Duan family has fallen into the hands of others,

104
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,880
he must be rescued by his parents and uncle.

105
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,239
If you take both of them as hostages to exchange for your son,

106
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:02,740
it'll ruin the reputation of the Dali Duan family.

107
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,779
You are a member of the royal family,

108
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:07,139
how can you act like a night thief?

109
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,240
In three days,

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,579
someone from the Duan family will get him back from the Wanjie Valley.

111
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:14,479
Both of you, do as you please.

112
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,480
I have to forget Duan Yu and never think of him again.

113
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,100
I was once an orphan without parents,

114
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,940
but now I have a father and a mother,

115
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,600
and a brother too.

116
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,280
I should feel happy.

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,140
Right, all I need is to take a leap,

118
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,620
and I can leave all worries behind.

119
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,800
Who is it?

120
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,860
Who's there?

121
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,600
Who?

122
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,780
Senior, was it you who saved me just then?

123
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,619
Who is it?

124
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:04,519
How dare you pull a trick on me, are you tired of living?

125
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm indeed tired of living.

126
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
Are you the one talking to me?

127
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,980
Exactly.

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,919
Are you a ghost?

129
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,539
You're the one who doesn't want to live and wants to be a ghost,

130
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:21,819
then why are you scared of ghosts?

131
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:23,099
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

132
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,620
I, Mu Wanqing, fear nothing and no one.

133
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,339
You're afraid of one thing,

134
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,039
you're afraid that your husband

135
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,420
has turned out to be your blood brother.

136
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,719
You're a ghost. How dare you speak nonsense to me.

137
00:09:39,719 --> 00:09:40,839
I'll kill you!

138
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,220
You've fallen deeply in love, don't deceive yourself.

139
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,260
I know what's in your mind.

140
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,340
[Overflowing with Evil: Duan Yanqing]
We barely know each other. How do you know what's on my mind?

141
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,539
I have a better idea

142
00:09:56,539 --> 00:10:00,719
to make your blood brother your husband.

143
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,820
Do you believe me?

144
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,680
You're not even afraid of death, what else can you be afraid of?

145
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,920
Follow me.

146
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,879
Senior, why do you bring me to Wanjie Valley?

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,280
Keep up, little girl.

148
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,280
Go in.

149
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
Let me out! Open the door!

150
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,920
Sister Wan? Sister Wan!

151
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,600
Why are you here, too?

152
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,100
Duan!

153
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,620
Sister Wan.

154
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,900
Sister Wan.

155
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,220
We are siblings,

156
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,320
we can't be like this.

157
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,740
Sister Wan.

158
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,100
Sister Wan. Sister Wan.

159
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,060
This is predestined,

160
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,280
don't be too upset about it.

161
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,840
But... But I am happy to have a sister like you.

162
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,220
I want to be upset, I don't want to be happy.

163
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,579
If you are happy, then you're a man with no conscience!

164
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:34,640
There's nothing I can do.

165
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,932
If I hadn't met you at the very beginning,

166
00:12:39,932 --> 00:12:41,479
then everything would be fine.

167
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,020
It's not that I want to meet you either.

168
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,119
It was you who came to alarm me.

169
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,040
I wouldn't die even if you didn't alarm me.

170
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,720
It's all your fault.

171
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,540
You caused the death of my Black Rose.

172
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,900
It was you who made my master my mother.

173
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,340
It was you who made your father my father.

174
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,440
It's you who made yourself my brother.

175
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,740
I don't want to! I don't want to! I want nothing!

176
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,100
I was imprisoned here because of you!

177
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,500
I want to go out!

178
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,820
Sister Wan.

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,820
Yes, it's all my fault.

180
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,440
Please don't be sad anymore.

181
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,459
Let's think of a way to get out of here, okay?

182
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,880
Now, I don't want to leave.

183
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,159
It's the same to die here or to die outside.

184
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,340
I don't want to go out anymore. I'm not leaving.

185
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,780
Why don't you say something?

186
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,500
I'm afraid that I might upset you.

187
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,159
What do you want me to say?

188
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,720
Tell me why you are here.

189
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,079
My apprentice caught me and brought me here.

190
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,359
He imprisoned me here, but I don't know why.

191
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,760
Apprentice?

192
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
- Nanhai Crocodile?
- Yes!

193
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,479
How about you, Sister Wan? Who caught you?

194
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,640
I walked all the way from the palace to the riverside and ran into a weird old man.

195
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,840
He is a cripple but his martial arts skills are incredible.

196
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,540
I don't know what I did that offended him,

197
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,920
then he locked me up in here.

198
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:29,684
Does the emperor know where Wanjie Valley is?

199
00:14:29,684 --> 00:14:33,396
This is my first time hearing of this place. Wanjie Valley.

200
00:14:33,396 --> 00:14:38,840
I think it shouldn't be too far from the Dali Kingdom.

201
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,860
You've heard what Gan Baobao said.

202
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm afraid that place can't be found easily.

203
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,440
If Yu'er falls into the hands of the enemies for such a long time, I'm afraid...

204
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,519
Yu'er has been spoiled as a kid and detached from worldly affairs.

205
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,159
Let him suffer a bit of setback, experience some hardships.

206
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,599
It might be a good thing for him.

207
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,460
You don't have to worry about this matter.

208
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,619
- But...
- Feng Huang'er,

209
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:04,260
brother always regards Yu'er as his own child, he won't just sit back and do nothing.

210
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,483
Feng Huang'er, don't be so worried.

211
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,300
It's all because of you.

212
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,320
If it wasn't for you,

213
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,940
Yu'er wouldn't be in this situation.

214
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,960
If anything happens to Yu'er,

215
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,340
you...

216
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,940
Feng Huang'er.

217
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:22,340
I was at fault.

218
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,740
Please rest assured. I will make sure Yu'er is safe and sound.

219
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,380
Even if it means I have to risk my own life.

220
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,080
Time to eat.

221
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,560
Sister Wan.

222
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,300
Sister Wan, do you think they would poison our food?

223
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,940
Are you stupid?

224
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,140
He's got such good martial arts that could kill us.

225
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,220
Would he need to poison us to kill us?

226
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,580
You're right.

227
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,679
Sister Wan, don't worry.

228
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,840
Uncle and Father will come to our rescue.

229
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,340
Although Nanhai Crocodile and Second Madam Ye are highly skilled,

230
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,839
they are definitely no match for Father and Uncle.

231
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,980
Your uncle is just an emperor.

232
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,439
How strong can he be?

233
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,700
I don't believe he can defeat that green robe freak.

234
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,619
The most he could do is bring along 2000 armored cavalry and attack.

235
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,280
He won't.

236
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,199
The ancestors of the Duan family are the warrior of the martial arts world.

237
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,479
Although he is the Emperor of Dali,

238
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,860
he dares not forget the rules in the martial arts world.

239
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,279
If he abuses his power and attempts to win with a force superior in number,

240
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,079
then he would be the joke of the heroes.

241
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,620
Turns out the emperor or the prince has more rules to obey than those martial artists.

242
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,619
My uncle used to say, never forget where you came from.

243
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:30,223
A mouthful of benevolence and morality, but his ways of doing things are despicable.

244
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,780
Your father already has your mother as his wife,

245
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,320
and yet he does my master wrong.

246
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,519
Sister Wan, how can you criticize my father?

247
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,980
My father is your father, too.

248
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,799
Moreover, look at all the princes and nobles in the world,

249
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,040
which one of them doesn't have...

250
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,040
All of them have a few...

251
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,620
wives...

252
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,020
I'm not calling him my father.

253
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,320
A man who has many wives and concubines has no conscience.

254
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,400
You're right.

255
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
Sister Wan, you're right.

256
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,540
I was too impetuous.

257
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,720
But, Sister Wan, I need to tell you this.

258
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,060
No matter what my father does, right or wrong, he is still my father.

259
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,119
Moreover, he is your father too.

260
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,479
You're his daughter.

261
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,479
Then it makes me your elder brother.

262
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,740
You can't be rude to Father.

263
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,540
As your elder brother, I must teach you a lesson.

264
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,600
To be double-minded is the same as being heartless.

265
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,140
How can you hit your elder brother?

266
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,080
How dare you dodge it?

267
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,560
- Sister Wan.
- You...

268
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,560
- Wan, Sister Wan.
- You...

269
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,079
Sister Wan.

270
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,480
You!

271
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,140
You... What are you doing?

272
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,460
You are my brother.

273
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,740
I deserve to die!

274
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,479
- Duan.
- Sister Wan.

275
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,000
We seem to have fallen into someone else's trap.

276
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,620
The food was poisoned.

277
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,300
- Your Majesty.
- What's is it?

278
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,680
Wanjie Valley is on the outskirts of the city, after crossing Shanrendu Town

279
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,420
and the chain bridge, then we will arrive.

280
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,660
However, the valley entrance is loaded with traps.

281
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,600
I don't think we can get through it easily.

282
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,819
- Get up.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

283
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,600
So you had plans earlier on, Your Majesty.

284
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,555
I should have known that if Ba Sikong is going into action,

285
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:06,855
there's no reason the enemy's hideout can remain a secret.

286
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:09,799
And I wouldn't have to be worried for all this while.

287
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,239
Your Highness, I'm flattered. Tian Shi dare not accept the compliment.

288
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:14,739
- Ba Sikong.
- Here.

289
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:16,780
Are the "Four Evils" in the valley?

290
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,700
Your Majesty, they're in the valley.

291
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,460
I have searched through the valley,

292
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,740
but there was no sight of the young prince.

293
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:26,420
However, I saw a man sending out meals to a stone house.

294
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,080
They must be hiding the young prince in that room.

295
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,300
Ba Sikong, you did a great job.

296
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,820
Brother Chun.

297
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,919
The "Four Evils" are highly skilled in martial arts.

298
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,020
We must not spend too much time battling them.

299
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,020
Our priority is to rescue Yu'er.

300
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,219
- Ba Sikong.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

302
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:51,239
Next, take down what you've seen and heard, write and visualize them in detail.

303
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:54,179
Tomorrow, bring along your people, we will set off for Wanjie Valley early in the morning.

304
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

305
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,320
Duan.

306
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,980
Duan, I'm feeling hot. Duan.

307
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,860
Duan, I still feel so hot.

308
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,200
Duan.

309
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,854
Sister Wan. Sister Wan.

310
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,139
Lie on this stone bed, it can cool you down a bit.

311
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,379
Sister Wan, lend me one of your poisoned arrows, please.

312
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:01,559
What do you want to do?

313
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,739
By the time the drug controls my sanity,

314
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:07,740
I will use the poisoned arrow to jab myself to death.

315
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,919
I must not hurt you!

316
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,680
Don't.

317
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,000
I can't bear to see you like this.

318
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,100
How? Sister Wan, promise me.

319
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,859
If I touch you in any form, you have to shoot me with the arrow immediately.

320
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:26,820
No way. I can't do it.

321
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,380
Sister Wan, I'm begging you. Please promise me.

322
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,579
The centuries-old reputation of the Duan family cannot be ruined in my hands.

323
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,299
If we do commit incest,

324
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:43,779
how can I face the ancestors of the Duan family.

325
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,820
Dali Duan family was extraordinary;

326
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,519
however. after it fell into the hands of Duan Zhengming,

327
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,614
a man who is nothing but a mouthful of benevolence and morality,

328
00:22:51,615 --> 00:22:54,479
deep inside he is cruel and unscrupulous.

329
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,559
There's no more good reputation left of the family.

330
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,800
Who are you? Who are you?

331
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,479
You're talking nonsense!

332
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,320
Duan.

333
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,479
He's that weird old man.

334
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,900
Miss Mu, you have my words.

335
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,199
I can make your brother your husband.

336
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,999
For sure, I will keep my promise.

337
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,839
In the bowl of braised pork,

338
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,420
I've put in a large amount of aphrodisiac.

339
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,420
If you don't do it,

340
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,039
your skin will crack and you'll bleed to death from the 7 orifices of the head.

341
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,679
The drug efficacy will increase day by day.

342
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,979
On the 8th day, even Da Luo God will find it hard to resist.

343
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,050
Who on earth are you?

344
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,750
There's no grudge between us. Why do you use such a deadly trap to harm me?

345
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,719
How can I live my life without feeling ashamed then?

346
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,759
You want to ruin my uncle's and my family's reputation.

347
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,199
I would rather die a hundred times!

348
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,399
I would rather die a hundred times than letting your conspiracy succeed!

349
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,679
There's no grudge between us indeed,

350
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,119
but there's deep resentment between your uncle and me.

351
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,319
I want Duan Zhengchun and Duan Zhengming, these two brats to feel ashamed for the rest of their life.

352
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,580
Even better, to be embarrassed about facing the public.

353
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,720
Wonderful, wonderful.

354
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,499
- Duan.
- Great, great.

355
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:34,807
By the time both of you are married and have children, then I will release you.

356
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,439
I'm not going to kill you;

357
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,740
meanwhile, I'll pass my martial arts to both of you,

358
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,300
to let both of you conquer the world.

359
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,400
Don't even think about it!

360
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,980
At the very last minute, I will kill myself by hitting my head on this stone wall.

361
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,479
Sister Wan, please remember.

362
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,740
The descendants of the Duan family would rather die than be humiliated.

363
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,639
Dead or alive, that's not my concern.

364
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,119
If you wish to kill yourself,

365
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,399
I will strip your bodies naked, salt them,

366
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,519
then hang them at the city center of Dali City for three days.

367
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,959
I will make it clear that you are the nephew and niece of Dali Duan Zhengming,

368
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,320
who committed adultery in private and got caught in the act.

369
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,180
Both of you were too ashamed and thus committed suicide.

370
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,740
Wouldn't it be better?

371
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,820
How did the Dali Duan family offend you that

372
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,799
you want to take such vicious revenge on us?

373
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,479
I don't need to tell you my private matters.

374
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,239
Siblings, hurry up and get things done,

375
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,040
the sooner you give birth to a child, the sooner you can leave here.

376
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,400
[Anyone with the last name Duan is not permitted in the valley]

377
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,230
[Anyone with the last name Duan is not permitted and will be killed upon entrance]

378
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,840
This Lord of the Wanjie Valley,

379
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,980
how much resentment does he hold against the Duan family?

380
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,090
[Anyone with the last name... ]

381
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,880
Let's go!

382
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,959
The brothers of the Dali Kingdom Duan family are here to pay an official visit.
[Visiting Card]

383
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,640
Hey, Duans!

384
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,820
If you're visiting and abiding by the rules of the martial arts world,

385
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,220
why did you break the valley's entrance?

386
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,180
Where is my son?

387
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:22,040
Where did you guys hide him?

388
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,180
You're late.

389
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,879
That Duan boy?

390
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,260
We had cut his body open and fed the dogs.

391
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,932
I'm asking Lord Zhong.

392
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:43,992
I'm not talking to you, a commoner woman.

393
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,460
Wait a minute!

394
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,860
Stop fighting.

395
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,100
Duan Zhengchun!

396
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Feng Huang'er.

397
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,660
I don't need your help.

398
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,060
Feng Huang'er, don't be so relentless.

399
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,860
What's with the phoenix and peacock?
(TN: Feng Huang means 'phoenix' in Chinese)

400
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,300
Calling her with such affection.

401
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,220
Husband.

402
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,500
Why did you kick my husband?

403
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,690
Duan, I didn't mean to do that.

404
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,240
Are you all right?

405
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,540
Stop!

406
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,960
Fight him!

407
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:12,103
Duan thief! You're such a boy toy!

408
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:16,560
All you do is rely on women to save your life, are you a true man or not?

409
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,360
You're not injured!

410
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,460
This guy is good at deceiving people, and yet you trust him.

411
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,100
Take this!

412
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,980
What a sin.

413
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,260
Yes, Your Majesty.

414
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,540
You are my biological sons. How could you attack your mother?

415
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,279
Aren't you afraid of being punished by God's lightning strikes?

416
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,340
You witch! You are full of nonsense. Take this!

417
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,020
You bastard!

418
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,720
Sir, please let me through.

419
00:34:38,819 --> 00:34:41,460
If you won't let me through,

420
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,420
then don't blame me for being rude.

421
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,160
Your staff skill is the same origin as the Duan family's One-finger Death Touch.

422
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,920
Are you related to the Duan family?

423
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,320
Are you Duan Zhengming or Duan Zhengchun?

424
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,460
I'm Duan Zhengming.

425
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,760
Uncle.

426
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,720
Uncle.

427
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,060
So you're the Emperor Baoding?

428
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,079
Compare your martial arts skills to mine.

429
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,520
Whose are better?

430
00:36:14,855 --> 00:36:18,735
If we talk about martial arts skills, you're slightly better than me.

431
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:21,180
However, if we were to fight,

432
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,720
I can assure you that I can defeat you.

433
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,120
Not bad.

434
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,160
After all, I'm at a disadvantage of physical disability.

435
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,460
After years of holding the title of emperor,

436
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,840
you didn't put your martial arts aside. That surprises me.

437
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:51,360
Uncle! Uncle, save me!

438
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,380
Yu'er, Uncle is here.

439
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,340
What did you do to Yu'er?

440
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,700
That boy has a strong mentality.

441
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,039
He can withstand the effect for so long

442
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,440
after taking the aphrodisiac.

443
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,620
Aphrodisiac?

444
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,620
What kind of drug is that?

445
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,140
It's not a drug.

446
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,520
It's just a type of powerful aphrodisiac.

447
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,159
Don't you know there's a woman in the stone house?

448
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,519
It would be great to die in your hands.

449
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,140
That'll add to your sins.

450
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,880
Why are you doing this to our Duan family?

451
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,880
Who are you?

452
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,440
I'm the former crown prince of Dali Kingdom,

453
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
Duan Yanqing.

454
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,340
I don't believe you.

455
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,740
You don't believe what I had just said? Not even a bit?

456
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,360
Zhengming greets Senior.

457
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,159
You address me as a senior. Is it because you refuse to recognize me?

458
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,260
Or are you still having a doubt?

459
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,539
As the head of a country, I must take extra caution in my words and deeds.

460
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,400
Senior, I don't have an heir.

461
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,040
Yu'er is entrusted with the sustenance of the ancestral temple and sacred shrine.

462
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:56,480
Senior, let them go.

463
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,559
I want the Dali Duan family to commit incest,

464
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,220
to die without descendants, how can I let them go that easily?

465
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:14,320
I, Duan Zhengming, will never allow it to happen.

466
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,420
Never allow?

467
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,380
Whom do you think you are?

468
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,660
You claimed to be the Emperor of the Dali Kingdom,

469
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,800
but I only think of you as a rebel who plots to usurp the throne.

470
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,120
If you choose to battle me now,

471
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,220
you might be able to defeat me in hundreds of moves.

472
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,980
But if you want to kill me, that would be extremely difficult.

473
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,720
As long as I'm alive, you won't be able to save Duan Yu's life.

474
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,020
Uncle, break in and kill me with the One-Finger Death Touch.

475
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,320
Yu'er!

476
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,900
Did you do anything that's against the Duan family's code of ethics?

477
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,520
No. Uncle!

478
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,119
I'm burning. It's killing me.

479
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,340
I'm afraid... I'm afraid that I'm going to die.

480
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,400
Senior, what will it take for you to let Yu'er go?

481
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,640
I don't ask for much.

482
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:11,639
As long as you promise to become a monk in the Heavenly Dragon Monastery

483
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,260
and pass the throne to me,

484
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,239
I will clear the drug residue in Duan Yu's body,

485
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,959
and return you with a good and virtuous nephew.

486
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,640
I have no problem in becoming a monk for Yu'er,

487
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:36,019
but Senior, first, the ancestor's political power couldn't be given away like that.

488
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:39,400
Secondly, Yu'er is a pure and kind boy.

489
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,290
He's familiar with literature and Buddhist teachings.

490
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:43,380
He is compassionate.

491
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,860
Your dissatisfaction has nothing to do with him.

492
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:51,580
Can you think of any other feasible ways?

493
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,560
If I had other ways back then,

494
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,959
I wouldn't have fallen to this state of half dead and half alive.

495
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,960
If others didn't give me another option back then,

496
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,520
why would I give you another option now?

497
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,660
Do you agree to the conditions I mentioned?

498
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,880
What if I don't?

499
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,340
We can battle for a few days and nights.

500
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:56,100
By that time, you will have a grandson already.

♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

523
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:02,700
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

524
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,290
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

525
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:20,830
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

526
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,500
Our reverend has passed away.

527
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:30,010
Passed away?

528
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,960
There is a saying in the Murong Clan,

529
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,680
"Fight fire with fire."

530
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,110
I don't know if you two have heard of this saying.

531
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,160
He didn't do anything wrong or conceal anything.

532
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,730
What's even weirder is that

533
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,120
if he wanted to kill someone,

534
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,260
he would have used another person's martial arts methods.
