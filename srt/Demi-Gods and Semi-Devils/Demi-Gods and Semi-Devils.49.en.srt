[Episode 49]

14
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,900
Mother.

15
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,239
Father, are you injured?

16
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,040
Antidote.

17
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,360
Mother.

18
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,420
Mother.

19
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,119
- Yu'er, are you hurt?
- Mother.

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,880
I'm all right.

21
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,780
That's good.

22
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,860
Father.

23
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,020
Brother Chun. Brother Chun.

24
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:21,020
- Father.
- I love all these ladies equally.

25
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,900
I love them...

26
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,520
as much as I love you.

27
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,640
Throughout my life,

28
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,680
I made too many mistakes out there.

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,820
I let you down again and again.

30
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,120
Fortunately, Yu'er is now a grown man.

31
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,080
He is well-versed in both martial arts and literature.

32
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,940
I... I... Dali...

33
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,100
- Father.
I...

34
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,820
- Brother Chun.
- Father.

35
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:17,319
Father.

36
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,360
Mother.

37
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,000
Mother, what are you doing?

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,120
My dear son.

39
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,660
Father and mother are leaving.

40
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,660
Take good care of yourself. All right?

41
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,460
Mother.

42
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,959
Pass me the antidote. I'll save your mother.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,319
This all happened because of you.

44
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,279
My father died an untimely death because of you.

45
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,650
Only one of us can live.

46
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,660
No!

47
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,740
You must not commit this heinous crime.

48
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,740
I must kill this traitor today.

49
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,320
Son. Son, listen to me.

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
Your father let me down.

51
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,260
Therefore, I was upset...

52
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,360
and I betrayed him, too.

53
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,640
Then, I gave birth to you.

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,719
Your father had always thought

55
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,380
that you were his son.

56
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,440
But, he... You...

57
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,900
This man before you

58
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,740
is actually your biological father.

59
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,400
What?

60
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,580
No.

61
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,460
I don't believe it.

62
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,580
I... I don't believe it.

63
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,499
Pass me the antidote. I'll save your mother.

64
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,180
Mother.

65
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,839
Mother.

66
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,700
This won't help.

67
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,039
Remember that he is your father.

68
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,860
Therefore, those girls you call sisters...

69
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,580
are not your biological siblings.

70
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,040
Son.

71
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,760
Son.

72
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,020
Mother wants to see you so badly.

73
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,000
Mother.

74
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,240
Mother.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,259
Mother. Mother.

76
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:22,880
Mother, please don't die.

77
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,039
Mother.

78
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,100
Mother, please don't die.

79
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,700
Mother.

80
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,380
You heard what your mother said.

81
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,460
I didn't hear anything.

82
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,350
They were my only parents.

83
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,380
Are you refusing to take me as your father?

84
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,599
Yes, I won't.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,959
I will never take you as my father.

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,639
Your life is in my hands right now.

87
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,919
I can kill you easily.

88
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,800
Moreover, you are my son.

89
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,720
You refuse to take me as your father and that makes you an unfilial son.

90
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,159
I'll never take you as my father.

91
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
You...

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,150
Why don't you do it yet?

93
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,740
You...

94
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,600
I won't kill my own son.

95
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,000
If you refuse to take me as your father,

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,820
you can kill me with the Six Pulse Excalibur.

97
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,520
Why? You are a man.

98
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,560
You shall do whatever you want. What is stopping you?

99
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,140
My mother would never lie to me.

100
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,559
I won't kill you.

101
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,300
Then, I'll be your father.

102
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,580
I, Duan Yuanqing, finally have a son.

103
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,380
I have a son.

104
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:24,459
The Dali Kingdom has returned to me after all.

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,920
I am leaving.

106
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,120
Father!

107
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,760
Father.

108
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,220
This is what we've been wishing for.

109
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,799
We've been waiting for this day to come and we finally got this opportunity.

110
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,079
I am acquainted with this master.

111
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,260
You can leave now.

112
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,500
Father, this is what we've been waiting for.

113
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,039
A war has broken out between Song and Liao.

114
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,999
On top of that, the Prince Zhennan of the Dali Kingdom is dead.

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,719
Duan Yu, the heir, has been occupied by his romance.

116
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,759
He has no intention to bring peace and stability to the country.

117
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,779
We should seize this opportunity to restore the Yan Nation.

118
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,520
The life of a peasant is dust,

119
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,559
the life of a monarch is also dust.

120
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,679
To restore the Yan Nation is just emptiness,

121
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,140
not restoring the Yan Nation is also emptiness.

122
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,279
Father, the old monk is not here.

123
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,879
You have nothing to fear.

124
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,559
Let's go to the Central Plains together and make a contribution to the nation.

125
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,679
Restoring the Yan Nation itself is a sin.

126
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,839
All beings have their birth and death.

127
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,719
The dead are gone.

128
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,640
Forcing it will only increase your karmic debt.

129
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
This is nothing but sin.

130
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,960
This is nothing but sin.

131
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,359
I have accumulated an abundance of karmic debt

132
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,620
for this unrealizable dream.

133
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,560
You shall never follow in my footsteps.

134
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,040
Father.

135
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,920
Yuyan is both talented and beautiful.

136
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,200
She has always admired you since she was little.

137
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,440
You took a liking to her as well.

138
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,680
Why don't you tie the knot

139
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,119
and spend your lives together?

140
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,099
To have your children surrounding you and enjoy the accompaniment of your family,

141
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,400
isn't that a great thing?

142
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,660
In your heart,

143
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,860
I'm not as important as the princess of Xixia you've never met before,

144
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,680
let alone the Yan Nation.

145
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,300
I hope all your wishes come true.

146
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,040
You can marry the princess of Xixia,

147
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,220
and become the Emperor of the Yan Nation.

148
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,400
Your aunt has a prejudice

149
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,920
against the Murong family.

150
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,999
She has a fierce look but a kind heart.

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,719
As long as you ask courteously,

152
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,900
she will definitely give you her blessings.

153
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,540
Aunt!

154
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,100
If you are still too proud to do that,

155
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,980
you can ask Bao Butong

156
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:51,000
or your other brothers to do it on your behalf.

157
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,740
From now on, you shall be no superior to the four of them.

158
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,959
All these years, they have been taking care of you.

159
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,719
You have to respect them

160
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,060
as if they are your elder brothers.

161
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,639
You... I...

162
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,800
From now on, the three of us

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,460
will not serve Young Master anymore.

164
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,180
Fu'er, I have let you down.

165
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,100
Please forgive me.

166
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,880
Do not let yourself down anymore.

167
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,300
Do you understand?

168
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,740
Fu'er.

169
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,320
You are determined not to help me.

170
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,920
The sea of bitterness has no bounds,

171
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,480
repent and the shore is at hand.

172
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,359
The Tibetan refuses to take my side.

173
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,999
The Liao Kingdom refuses to take my side.

174
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,359
Duan Yanqing refuses to take my side.

175
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,620
Even my father refuses to take my side.

176
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,319
Do you think this will bind my hands?

177
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,380
Fu'er.

178
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,119
All these commoners refuse to side with me.

179
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,319
God will side with me.

180
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,599
I will get Taishang Laojun, Jade Emperor,

181
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,580
and Erlang Shen to be my aide.

182
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,599
Once I restore the Yan Nation,

183
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,639
all of you shall submit to my rule.

184
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,100
You will all submit to me.

185
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,540
This is nothing but sin.

186
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,750
[Buddha]

187
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,940
Master.

188
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,039
Zhuang Juxian, the chief of the Beggars' Sect, wants to meet you.

189
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
He's here again.

190
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,399
Forget it.

191
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,300
Let him in.

192
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,100
Welcome, Chief Zhuang.

193
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,139
Mr. Xu Zhu, I implore you to heal Miss A'Zi's eyes.

194
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
Where's the eyes donor?  Where is Miss A'Zi?

195
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,139
I have something important I wish to discuss with you.

196
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,400
Miss A'Zi will be right here.

197
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,759
Then...

198
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,879
Sure.

199
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,500
- You may adjourn.
- Yes.

200
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,319
Chief Zhuang, I'll make things clear beforehand.

201
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,999
If you and Miss A'Zi are forcefully taking someone else's eyes,

202
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,520
I'll not be able to help you.

203
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,640
No. This donor will be doing it with his own will.

204
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,500
Really?

205
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,219
You found a guy who is incurable,

206
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:59,140
and willing to sacrifice himself for others?

207
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,399
Then... Where is he?

208
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,479
He Is right here.

209
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,559
Since Miss A'Zi lost her sight, she has been living her life in depression.

210
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,358
There's completely no joy in her life.

211
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,639
It was excruciating for me to watch

212
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,759
and I'd rather die than watch her suffering.

213
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,358
I can't let Miss A'Zi keep living like this.

214
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:19,679
I am willing to take the risk.

215
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,838
Are you mad?

216
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,758
You may end up with nothing because of your impulsiveness.

217
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,280
Mr. Xu Zhu.

218
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,340
Look at me now.

219
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,980
Do I look like a human to you?

220
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,559
Instead of letting Miss A'Zi see my hideous face after she recovers her sight,

221
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,320
I might as well dedicate my eyes to her.

222
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,680
From now on,

223
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,240
wherever Miss A'Zi goes, whatever she sees,

224
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,780
as long as it reminds her of me briefly

225
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,420
I'll be more than happy.

226
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,780
There'll be no regrets.

227
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,640
Mister.

228
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,500
I understand now, Chief Zhuang.

229
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,760
For me, I barely knew anything about romantic relationships.

230
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,159
However, I can see

231
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,220
that Miss A'Zi shows completely no affection toward you.

232
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,319
If you want Miss A'Zi to know that you are the donor of the eyes

233
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,300
and make her develop feelings for you,

234
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,220
I advise you to abort this idea.

235
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,199
I worry that once Miss A'Zi finds out

236
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,179
that I gave her my eyes, she would be upset.

237
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,879
So, after it's done,

238
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,020
please don't tell her those were my eyes.

239
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,059
Chief Zhuang, you can't get what you beg for.

240
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,179
Why... Why do you dwell on something you can't get?

241
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,000
My life is something...

242
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
I can't get even if I beg for it.

243
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,139
Mr. Xu Zhu, to be honest with you,

244
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,040
my surname was You.

245
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,740
I'm a descendant of the You family, hailing from the Heroes' Gathering Manor.

246
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
I came from a noble family.

247
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm not an ambitious man and only want to lead a peaceful life.

248
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,040
Because of the war at the Heroes' Gathering Manor,

249
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,360
I was left with nothing.

250
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,620
While I was suffering

251
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,320
between life and death,

252
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,100
I met A'Zi.

253
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,759
At that moment, time seemed to freeze.

254
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,599
At that moment, there was only A'Zi and me.

255
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,119
I want to go everywhere she goes. I want to stay wherever she is.

256
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,559
For A'Zi, I am willing to do anything.

257
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,360
Doomed love and foolish obsession...

258
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,640
did play a trick on you.

259
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,160
I have achieved nothing

260
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,759
and failed to execute my vengeance.

261
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,840
I live in a muddle and have become the laughing stock of the world.

262
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,959
I was suffering from head to toe.

263
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,500
The only exception...

264
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,259
Only when I am with A'Zi, can I feel a tinge of happiness.

265
00:19:59,259 --> 00:20:02,239
Although she berates me, hits me, tortures me,

266
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,420
I know that she is the only person who cares about me.

267
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,760
Everyone else is after

268
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,860
beauty, status, wealth, brothers, and martial arts.

269
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,420
All of these came to Mr. Xu Zhu by themselves.

270
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,700
You have no desire. How can you understand what I'm going through?

271
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,479
You are talking about desire.

272
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,959
The Shaolin Temple brought me up.

273
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,460
I've been practicing Buddhism since I was little.

274
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,600
Later, I violated all the monastic rules

275
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,720
and broke all the five precepts.

276
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,800
I'm a monk of the Shaolin Temple.

277
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,039
Yet, I can't perform any martial arts of Shaolin.

278
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,279
And I became its leader.

279
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,679
This is the most absurd thing on earth.

280
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,979
This is fate. Fate forces me to fulfill the duty of a monk,

281
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,080
but stops me from being a dutiful monk.

282
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,920
This is fate.

283
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,400
Mr. Xu Zhu, what you said just now

284
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,319
is nothing more than breaking the stereotypes.

285
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,200
It's nothing to be upset about.

286
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,380
I can't get what I beg for.

287
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,080
Beg. I begged for it.

288
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,680
Whether I can get it, I don't mind.

289
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,000
This can put me at ease.

290
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,299
Mr. Xu Zhu, I will die now

291
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,251
and I'll become the man you seek.

292
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:36,939
An incurable man who is willing

293
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:39,320
to donate his eyes.

294
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,360
Are you really doing this willingly?

295
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,580
As long as Miss A'Zi can be briefly reminded of me,

296
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,620
I will die with no regrets.

297
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,280
You Tanzhi spent his whole life going after Miss A'Zi.

298
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,860
After Miss A'Zi gains a new pair of eyes,

299
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:24,019
whatever she sees will be whatever You Tanzhi sees.

300
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:27,839
Isn't this what You Tanzhi has always wished for?

301
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,880
Spending days and nights with her

302
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,440
and following her wherever she goes.

303
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,060
The Grand Empress Dowager Gao of the Song Empire died of a natural cause,

304
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,260
and chaos broke out.

305
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,719
When I was defending myself against Jiu Mozhi at the Heavenly Dragon Monastery,

306
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,180
Master gave me a tonsure.

307
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,400
I have since joined Buddhism.

308
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,580
However, the Dali Kingdom needs a ruler.

309
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,460
Today, I'll pass the throne to you.

310
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,200
You have to keep two things in mind.

311
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,399
The first is to care for the people of the country.

312
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,780
The second is to humbly accept the opinions of others.

313
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,410
I hope that you can be kind to the people of the country and maintain a friendly relationship with the neighboring nations.

314
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:19,999
This is how you can repay your parents' kindness and protect their reputations.

315
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,300
Grand Empress Dowager Gao passed on.

316
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,679
Emperor Zhezong exiled all the important officials promoted by the Grand Empress Dowager Gao one by one.

317
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,680
Obviously, he is planning a reformation.

318
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,020
Really?

319
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:50,159
I have looked into it. It's true.

320
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,560
Even God is on my side.

321
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,680
It seems that I have to pay a visit personally.

322
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,800
Great!

323
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,000
- Xiao Feng came late.
- I beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness.

324
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,260
Brother, please get up.

325
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,879
I caught a few hunters today.

326
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,380
I'll leave the rest to you.

327
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,470
These people have committed no sin.

328
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,570
I implore Your Highness to let them go.

329
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,850
Sin?

330
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,999
Brother!

331
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Long live Your Majesty.

332
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,040
Brother-in-law.

333
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,400
A'Zi.

334
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,860
Brother-in-law.

335
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,500
A'Zi.

336
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,580
A'Zi, are your eyes okay?

337
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,660
Mr. Xu Zhu cured me.

338
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,620
Your Majesty, I hope you don't mind that I took your arrow.

339
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,380
A'Zi, stop messing around.

340
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,720
What a fine skill.

341
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,600
Protect His Majesty! Protect His Majesty!

342
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,839
How dare you ambush me? You have overestimated yourself.

343
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:14,320
Brother-in-law, I saved you again.

344
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,879
What a nimble lady.

345
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,119
A'Zi, tell me. What reward do you want?

346
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,920
Reward?

347
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,800
Since you promoted my brother-in-law, I want to be promoted too.

348
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,099
I don't need a high rank, but don't give me something too insignificant, too.

349
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:36,620
Sure. You are already a princess.

350
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,239
I'll promote you and make you the Princess of Pingnan?

351
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:43,899
Princess of Pingnan? That doesn't seem appropriate.
(TN: This princess is of higher rank than the previous one)

352
00:26:43,899 --> 00:26:46,680
You are my brother-in-law's brother.

353
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,699
If I become the princess, I'd be of the same status as your daughter.

354
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:52,179
- Then, I'd be one rank more inferior than him.
- You got it wrong.

355
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:54,599
You will be Grand Princess, of the same rank as my younger sister.

356
00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:01,319
Not only can I make you a princess, but I can also fulfill your wish.

357
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,319
Fulfill my wish?

358
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,620
How do you know what my wish is?

359
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,179
You are the emperor. You have to take your words seriously.

360
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:11,899
A'Zi, stop messing around.

361
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:14,659
If you don't like it, we can just forget my offer.

362
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:16,860
I'll count to three.

363
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,760
One.

364
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,439
Two.

365
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,840
A'Zi owes Your Highness my gratitude.

366
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,680
Xiao Feng thanks Your Majesty on behalf of my sister.

367
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,799
Why did Your Majesty travel all the way here?

368
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,079
It had been a long time since our last meeting.

369
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,500
Let's have a good chat.

370
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,879
When I was little, my imperial father always told me

371
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:45,340
about how beautiful Great Song is.

372
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,600
You lived there all year round.

373
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,879
Is that a place more comfortable than a northern country like ours?

374
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,680
It's the same everywhere.

375
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,959
But a man from the north finds it difficult to live in the south.

376
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,439
A man from the south will also find it difficult to live in the north.

377
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,500
This is God's arrangement.

378
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,220
Disobeying this arrangement is like asking for trouble.

379
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,179
Although I am the monarch and you are my aide, we are sworn brothers, too.

380
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:12,940
I have both wealth and status.

381
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,600
If you need anything, you can tell me directly.

382
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,280
I'm thankful for Your Majesty's kindness.

383
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,680
I have no desire.

384
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,499
I paid the Central Plains a visit and solved the grievances I had toward the heroes of the Central Plains.

385
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:32,240
If revenge breeds revenge, there will be no end to it.

386
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,310
Moreover, a war will bring about continuous disasters.

387
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,660
- This is not something we can disregard.
- Do you know why I am here?

388
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:50,439
- Please enlighten me, Your Highness.
- A decree for Xiao Feng, the Great Prince of the South Palace.

389
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,000
Right here.

390
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,159
Xiao Feng, the Great Prince of the South Palace, has been serving the country royally as my right-hand man.

391
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,439
He will now be promoted as the King of Song.

392
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,180
You will now become Grand Marshal of Pingnan and the leader of the army.

393
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,060
Your Majesty, there shall be no gains without pains.

394
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,280
I don't deserve Your Majesty's kindness.

395
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,020
Why?

396
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,420
Are you disobeying me?

397
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,540
Then, I shall accept Your Majesty's kindness.

398
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,480
Here.

399
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,180
This is what brothers do.

400
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,060
I can assure you. The army will be right here.

401
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:34,499
Brother, you can command the army as the Grand Marshal of Pingnan.

402
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:38,119
Your first task is to blitz Bianliang.

403
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:51,000
Your Majesty, I have a request.

404
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,639
I hope Your Majesty can think about the millions of people of Song and Liao, and revoke the edict.

405
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,900
I have made up my mind.

406
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,360
You don't have to dissuade me.

407
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,080
If that's the case,

408
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,620
I wish Your Majesty can appoint someone else.

409
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,059
If I am to command the troops, I am afraid that I'd ruin Your Majesty's plan.

410
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:19,460
When I told you to go south, you defended the people of Song.

411
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,660
This time, I entrusted you with great responsibility.

412
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,919
Yet, you fobbed me off with many excuses.

413
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,879
Xiao Feng is a Khitan.

414
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,910
I swear to always protect the Liao Kingdom.

415
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,040
If the Liao Kingdom is in danger,

416
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,950
I will do all I can to serve the country even if I have to die for it.

417
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:40,339
You'll serve the country even if you have to die for it.

418
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,580
I want you to command the troops, but you refuse to obey.

419
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,280
I have killed too many people.

420
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,540
I don't want more blood on my hands.

421
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,840
I hope Your Majesty can accept my resignation,

422
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,539
so that I can live in seclusion in the woods.

423
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,080
You'd rather swear your loyalty to the Song Dynasty

424
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,620
than serve the Liao Kingdom.

425
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,280
Please make a wise decision, Your Highness.

426
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,180
Give it another thought.

427
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,530
Hopefully, you can change your mind.

428
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,119
This is supposed to be good news.

429
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,919
I appointed him as the Grand Marshal of Pingnan,

430
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,079
hoping that he can command the troops,

431
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,880
and fight the enemies.

432
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,279
However, he refuses to do it.

433
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,780
He cares for the people of Song who brought him up.

434
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,579
But I care for our brotherhood.

435
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:12,780
He saved my life.

436
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,300
I don't know what to do.

437
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,740
After all, Your Majesty doesn't wish to jeopardize the bond you share with him.

438
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,439
In my opinion, since King Xiao is a loyal man,

439
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:31,520
we shall tackle the problem from there.

440
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,759
As long as we can capture his weakness,

441
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,880
we can surely talk him into this.

442
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,060
You're saying...

443
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,960
Miss A'Zi.

444
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,500
A'Zi.

445
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,399
King Xiao infiltrated the Shaolin Temple on his own just for her.

446
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,179
Judging from his character,

447
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,400
he will never leave A'Zi behind.

448
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,959
If we can involve Miss A'Zi,

449
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,419
we will be able to achieve our goal more efficiently.

450
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,660
Then, we can solve all Your Majesty's worries.

451
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,680
Brother-in-law.

452
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,520
I'm here.

453
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,399
Why do you look upset?

454
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,759
How can I be upset?

455
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,859
You're the only person in this world I worry about.

456
00:33:29,859 --> 00:33:32,899
Now that you have recovered your sight and regained your martial arts.

457
00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:34,379
Of course, I am happy.

458
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:36,900
I knew you cared about me.

459
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,039
If not for the ugly man,

460
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,980
I would've returned to your side earlier.

461
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,780
Which ugly man?

462
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,159
Zhuang Juxian, the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

463
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,839
Do you know who he is?

464
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,119
He's You Tanzhi, whom I put an iron head on.

465
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,359
He is the son of the Second Master You of the Heroes' Gathering Manor.

466
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,679
He attacked your eyes with lime.

467
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,999
Do you remember him?

468
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:01,080
I have something to report to the king.

469
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,759
This is an important matter.

470
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,700
No one else shall hear this.

471
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,119
King, please die.

472
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,870
The Ugly Metal Iron Crown is Chief Zhuang of the Beggars' Sect

473
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,690
and You Tanzhi, a descendant of the Heroes' Gathering Manor?

474
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,279
That's too much.

475
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,240
How could you do that to him?

476
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,159
Fortunately, he is not a grudgeful man and treated you well.

477
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,279
You were really fortunate.

478
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,879
Fortunate? He had his own agenda.

479
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,939
He gave me his eyes so that I would never forget him.

480
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:46,319
Mr. Xu Zhu disagreed with him and he threatened to kill himself.

481
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:50,039
Xu Zhu had no other option but to give me his eyes.

482
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:52,180
Are you saying that You Tanzhi

483
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,158
that You Tanzhi gave you his eyes willingly?

484
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,079
Yes.

485
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,580
He gave you his eyes and you accepted them?

486
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,880
Brother-in-law, if you ever lose your eyesight,

487
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,119
I'll give you my eyes willingly, too.

488
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,619
What's so great about that?

489
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,640
What are you talking about?

490
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,960
This...You Tanzhi devoted himself to you.

491
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,679
And, you took it for granted.

492
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,439
You will never find someone like him.

493
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,940
Brother-in-law, you are the one who takes things for granted.

494
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,499
You made a promise. You gave my sister your words to always take care of me.

495
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:25,739
Am I not taking care of you?

496
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:27,159
What have you done for me?

497
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,719
Have you cared about my worries?

498
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,400
Do you know what I'm thinking?

499
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,860
Brother-in-law.

500
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,899
That day, I saw how you killed my sister by the bridge.

501
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:47,600
You were crying so sorrowfully.

502
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,720
Don't mention it ever again.

503
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,540
I want to tell you that you don't have to live in sorrow.

504
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,559
Without Sister A'Zhu, A'Zi can do the same as well.

505
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,320
I will care for you wholeheartedly.

506
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,740
Since that day,

507
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,760
I have made up my mind to follow you wherever you go.

508
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,260
- A'Zi.
- Brother-in-law.

509
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,599
Brother-in-law, I know you won't allow me to do that.

510
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:29,599
Therefore, I intended to cripple you,

511
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,940
so that you will never leave me.

512
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,519
Why?

513
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,399
A thousand living A'Zi's is not as good as a dead A'Zhu.

514
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,300
Tell me. Why am I not as good as her?

515
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,720
Am I not pretty enough? Or am I not as smart as her?

516
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
A'Zhu is dead.

517
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,399
If I get to choose,

518
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,879
I want you to kill me instead of her.

519
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:07,619
Then, you will miss me like how you've been missing A'Zhu.

520
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:09,220
That's enough.

521
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,640
I can take care of you like a brother.

522
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,400
But there's only one woman I've ever loved.

523
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,900
And she's your sister, A'Zhu.

524
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,359
I care for you because of A'Zhu.

525
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,239
Brother-in-law, I'm sorry, Brother-in-law.

526
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,760
Hit me. Hit me, please.

527
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,420
A'Zi.

528
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,900
I am an uncouth man.

529
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,040
I have no idea what's on your mind.

530
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,720
I'm sorry.

531
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,339
The imperial decree has arrived.

532
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:04,359
The empress misses the Princess of Pingnan,

533
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,300
and wishes to summon the princess to the imperial camp.

534
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,180
Your Highness.

535
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,139
Sister A'Zi, I have been missing you.

536
00:38:21,139 --> 00:38:22,600
Come here.

537
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,200
Your Highness, where is His Majesty?

538
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,899
I wish to resign from being the Princess of Pingnan.

539
00:38:30,899 --> 00:38:32,740
Why?

540
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,559
Your Highness installed you as the Princess of Pingnan,

541
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,879
and King Xiao as the Grand Marshal of Pingnan,

542
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,399
so that the both of you can have a grand wedding.

543
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:44,480
Why? You don't want that to happen?

544
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,220
I understand His Majesty's kind intention.

545
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,920
But my brother-in-law doesn't like me at all.

546
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,060
Sister A'Zi, all men are uncouth,

547
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,579
especially His Majesty, the General of Pingnan.

548
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,599
They are all heroes and great men.

549
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,799
It's not that easy to capture their heart.

550
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,919
There are hundreds of beauties living in this palace.

551
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,679
Yet, the emperor loves me the most.

552
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:22,959
Do you know why?

553
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,640
Why?

554
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,159
Although fate plays a vital role in this,

555
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,419
this also happened because of the favor given by an old monk at the Shengde Temple in Shangjing to me.

556
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,980
Old monk?

557
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,299
Sister A'Zi, I can see how much you care for King Xiao.

558
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:45,119
And this is why I'm telling you about this.

559
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,799
You can never tell anyone about this.

560
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,919
If I fail to keep Your Highness' words,

561
00:39:49,919 --> 00:39:52,879
I, A'Zi, will be struck and killed by lightning and meet a horrible end.

562
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:59,740
Good sister. The senior monk gave me two bottles of holy water.

563
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,559
He told me to say my prayers in secret,

564
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,880
and feed it to the man I love.

565
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:08,839
Then, the man will stay loyal to me until he breathes his last.

566
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:13,480
I secretly fed His Majesty one bottle of these.

567
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,420
I have another bottle.

568
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,199
Your Highness, may I take a look at it?

569
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,400
Sure.

570
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,920
After he drinks this,

571
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,940
he will stay loyal to me.

572
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,240
Sister A'Zi.

573
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,840
Your brother-in-law is not interested in you.

574
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,000
You have nothing to worry about.

575
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,700
After we are done with this, I will bring you to Shangjing.

576
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,080
Then, you can get one bottle of these from the old monk in Shengde Temple, too.

577
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,440
Really?

578
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,780
Thanks, Your Highness.

579
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,300
Your Highness, His Majesty is sending for you.

580
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,080
I'll be right there.

581
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,139
Sister A'Zi, wait for me here.

582
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,720
His Highness mentioned the expedition to the south.

583
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,660
I am certainly reluctant to do so.

584
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,359
Perhaps, I should pay Second Brother a visit, and stay there for a few days.

585
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,100
Then, I'll see how it goes.

586
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,400
Brother-in-law.

587
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,379
Brother-in-law, I brought you some good wine.

588
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,759
A'Zi, let me tell you something.

589
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,119
We will set off now and head to the Piaomiao Peak.

590
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,940
I won't meet the ugly man.

591
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,059
Hear me out.

592
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,639
His Majesty wants me to go on an expedition to the south, but I'm reluctant to do so.

593
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,759
I worry that if this drags on, something bad will happen.

594
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,319
Since we are leaving this place,

595
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,959
you shall drink this to refresh yourself.

596
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,700
Brother.

597
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,340
Please forgive me for leaving without bidding my farewell.

598
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,360
Let's go.

I have tens of thousands of soldiers here that can still go right past Yanmen Pass.

626

I am always full of myself.

627

I have always thought of myself as a hero.

628
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:50,890
A hero serves the nation and the people.

629
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,170
In my lifetime, I cannot let you attack the Song Empire.
