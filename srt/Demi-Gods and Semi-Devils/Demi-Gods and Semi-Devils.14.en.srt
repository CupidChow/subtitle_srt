[Episode 14]

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,119
Our chief put benevolence and righteousness before everything else.

15
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Here's the antidote.

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,719
Thanks, Elder Chen.

17
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,380
Thanks, Chief Qiao.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,900
But... how do I use this?

19
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,639
Suck the poison out of the wound

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,319
and then apply the antidote to it.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,759
If you do it before the poison is completely sucked out,

22
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,679
the antidote will do more harm than good.

23
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:01,340
Also, this can't be done by a woman.

24
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,839
Why not?

25
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,559
This is a poison of Yin.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,619
Women have Yin energy, and to add this on top of the poison,

27
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,880
it will increase its toxicity.

28
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,839
Third Brother Bao, stop fighting.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,680
Please come back and save Fourth Brother.

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,680
I'll do it.

31
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,100
Big Brother.

32
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Such a petty thing. Please allow me.

33
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,400
Fourth Brother Feng.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,080
Fourth Brother Feng, the wound here is the worst.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,520
Young Master Duan.

36
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,099
You should let the dark blood drain off before you suck it.

37
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,239
Quan Guanqing! Show yourself.

38
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,519
Two elders, please stay calm.

39
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,479
Our branch leader bears no malice.

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,479
When everything settles down, we'll let you go.

41
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,639
Show yourself!

42
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,299
Quit your nonsense!

43
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:54,260
Tell me what your Branch Leader Quan is planning.

44
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,179
Otherwise, when I get out, I'll make sure you suffer.

45
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:00,479
Two elders, please don't put me in a difficult position.

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,219
This involves the future of the Beggars' Sect.  I can't reveal it.

47
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,559
The future of the Beggars' Sect? Nonsense!

48
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,319
Are you capturing us here for the sake of the Beggars' Sect?

49
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,879
Show yourself and let us go.

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,359
Otherwise, when I get out,

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,680
I'll make sure you get punished.

52
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,439
Quan Guanqing!

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,880
Quan Guanqing, let us out!

54
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,959
Fourth Brother Feng.

55
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,919
Fourth Brother, you can move?

56
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,700
Fourth Brother.

57
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,860
Fourth Brother.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
Thank you for saving me, Young Master.

59
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,439
Fourth Brother, it's nothing.  It isn't worth mentioning.

60
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,959
It might be nothing to you.

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,760
But for me, it's a big deal.

62
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,599
Chief Qiao is indeed a righteous man.

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,359
He lives up to his name as the chief of the greatest sect.

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
I have great respect for you.

65
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,360
You're too kind.

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,100
Elder Xi.

67
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,740
- Fourth Brother, how are you?
- I'm all right.

68
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,440
I lost to you and I admit my defeat.

69
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,159
We'll have another match next time we meet.

70
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,680
I look forward to it.

71
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,979
Brothers, you're here right on time.

72
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,200
Get in your position for the Dog-Beating Array!

73
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,159
Third Brother Bao. Fourth Brother Feng. This is bad.

74
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,739
You won't be able to break the Dog-Beating Array of the Beggars' Sect.

75
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:28,680
You should surrender before it's too late.

76
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,160
We have no other choice but to break it.

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,440
Fourth Brother Feng, don't do that.

78
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,799
Dragon Capturing Skill?

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,560
There's actually someone who has mastered this skill?

80
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,099
Chief Qiao is so skilled.

81
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,520
People say "Qiao Feng from the north and Murong from the south are great martial arts masters."

82
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,879
But how can my cousin's martial arts...

83
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,919
What happened today is just a misunderstanding. Please leave.

84
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,279
We are no match for you.

85
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,959
A match between us will be boring.

86
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,340
I'll see you again.

87
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
Let's go.

88
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,439
Our skills were no match for theirs, we got shamed.

89
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:37,619
Even after another ten years of practice, we still lose to them.

90
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:41,379
We shall just forget it or we'll lose everything.

91
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,720
Let's go.

92
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,519
The Beggars' Sect has a serious matter to discuss later.

93
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,440
We should get going, too.

94
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,860
Chief Qiao, we'll see you around.

95
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,579
- Miss Wang.
- Wait a minute.

96
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,380
Chief, we have not avenged Deputy Chief Ma's death.

97
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,100
How can the chief let our enemies off?

98
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,700
We came all the way to Jiangnan to avenge Deputy Chief Ma's death.

99
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,020
But after I spent the past few days inquiring into it,

100
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,139
I realized that Young Master Murong may not be the one who killed Brother Ma.

101
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,940
How so?

102
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,879
We can defeat him neither physically nor verbally.

103
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,720
We have no other choice.

104
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,419
Then, what about Miss Wang, A'Zhu, and A'Bi?

105
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,420
Are we supposed to leave them behind?

106
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,918
That's not what I mean.

107
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,199
Qiao Feng is a man of high morals.

108
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,719
Before he proves that our young master killed Ma Dayuan,

109
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:55,519
he will never hurt Miss Wang and the ladies.

110
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,759
Our top priority now

111
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,059
is to inform Young Master about what's happening at the Beggars' Sect.

112
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,839
The Beggars' Sect is the greatest sect in the martial arts world.

113
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,200
A slight change will bring about a major effect.

114
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,699
An intelligent man like our young master may be able to take advantage of the situation.

115
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,180
Let's go.

116
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,099
There has never been animosity

117
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,039
between Young Master Murong and the Beggars' Sect.

118
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,360
He and Deputy Chief Ma never knew each other either.

119
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,820
What could have motivated him to kill Brother Ma?

120
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,319
Besides, the Murong Clan

121
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,559
is well known for its techniques with "fight fire with fire."

122
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,460
Deputy Chief Ma was killed by the Throat Locking Skill.

123
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,239
Naturally, Young Master Murong becomes the suspect.

124
00:09:47,239 --> 00:09:49,840
So, why should he be here?

125
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,540
Chief, perhaps he is so arrogant

126
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,800
that he doesn't have to cover up his acts.

127
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,940
If that's the case, why did he have to provoke so many sects?

128
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,020
Lately, many people were killed by the skills they were best at.

129
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,300
Deputy Chief Ma, Reverend Xuan Bei,

130
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,560
and the Qin Clan of the Qingcheng Sect.

131
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,620
It seems like he is being framed.

132
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,619
Chief, are you trying to defend Murong Fu?

133
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:17,100
No, I'm not.

134
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,300
But this matter is definitely not as simple as it seems.

135
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,940
If we suspect Young Master Murong of this murder,

136
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,080
we should confront him face to face.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,180
Bullying these ladies and his family attendants

138
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,640
is not what a real hero would do.

139
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,780
If others find out about this,

140
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,960
the Beggars' Sect will definitely lose face.

141
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,379
I wonder why all brothers have assembled here today.

142
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,460
Branch Leader Quan, you're here.

143
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,320
Where is Elder Bai?

144
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,641
Also, the branch leaders of Daxin,

145
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:03,600
Dayong, and Dali. Where are they?

146
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,360
Zhang Quanxiang.

147
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm here.

148
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,340
Where is your branch leader?

149
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,459
I... I have no idea.

150
00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,080
He's probably... drunk.

151
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,960
Drunk?

152
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,320
Branch Leader Fang never let alcohol get in his way.

153
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,200
Where is he?

154
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,860
Tell me.

155
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,950
It has nothing to do with me. I didn't do it.

156
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,399
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.

157
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,580
Branch Leader Fang is not dead. He is still alive.

158
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,460
Elders,

159
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,100
what's going on?

160
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,380
Everyone of Beggars' Sect values loyalty a lot.

161
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,420
The Dragon Capturing Skill?

162
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,920
Since you have admitted your fault,

163
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,580
there's no need for you to get on your knees.

164
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,880
But you have to be punished

165
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,120
for rebelling against your superior.

166
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,720
- Branch Leader Quan.
- Branch Leader.

167
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,560
Brother Jiang.

168
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,440
Help him up.

169
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,279
Zhang Quanxiang, take your men with you

170
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,880
to bring Elder Bai and the others here.

171
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,640
Yes, Sir.

172
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,520
The rest of you sit down right here and stay still unless I say otherwise.

173
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,880
- Sit.
- Yes.

174
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,079
Brothers, our sect is going through a mishap.

175
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:42,819
This is when we should give our all to repay the chief's kindness.

176
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:44,139
We should protect our chief at all costs.

177
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,020
Be sure to obey the chief.

178
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,300
Yes!

179
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,720
They have been our brothers for many years.

180
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,640
They were distracted somehow.

181
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,840
It shouldn't be a big deal.

182
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,420
Brother Jiang, bring your men with you.

183
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,220
Your top priority now is to save the others. There shall be no mistake.

184
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,599
Yes, Chief.

185
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,920
Please take care. I'll be right back.

186
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,160
Send some men to the First Class Hall of Xixia.

187
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,880
Postpone the meeting at Mount Hui to 7 days later than scheduled.

188
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,380
Yes, Sir.

189
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,960
Come with me!

190
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,690
[Smartly separate and split]

191
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,060
Tie them up!

192
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,560
Elder Bai. Elder Xiang.

193
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,919
- Hurry up and untie the elders.
- Branch Leader Jiang.

194
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,680
Branch Leader Jiang.

195
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,079
- Elder Bai, please get up.
- Elder Xiang.

196
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,220
Branch Leader Jiang.

197
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,279
Branch Leader Jiang, beware of the saltpeter outside the house.

198
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,839
Don't worry. The brothers have captured the rebels.

199
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,520
They have cleared up the saltpeter, too.

200
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,500
The other branch leaders have just been rescued and are waiting for us out there.

201
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,980
How many rebels are there?

202
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
- Is the chief all right?
- Quan Guanqing,

203
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,340
the Four Great Elders,

204
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,639
and half of the brothers of the four branches are involved.

205
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,819
Chief is fine.

206
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,999
When I left, the situation was still under control.

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,279
But he doesn't have many men with him.

208
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,759
The chief is on his own.

209
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm afraid that there will be a mutiny if this carries on.

210
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,239
Where is Chief now?

211
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,060
He is at the apricot forest outside the city.

212
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,580
I've assigned a guide for you.

213
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,999
Elders, please head there with the branch leaders first.

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,119
I'll be right there with my brothers.

215
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,760
Fire the flare gun to inform all the nearby members of the Beggars' Sect

216
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,360
to hurry to the scene.

217
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,880
Yes!

218
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,300
Brothers, I'm really happy to have met Brother Duan Yu

219
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,420
who agrees with me in many ways.

220
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,700
From today on, we are sworn brothers.

221
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,080
Here.

222
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,280
Big Brother.

223
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,500
Little Brother, let me introduce the elders of the Beggars' Sect to you.

224
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,200
Elders... this is Brother Duan.

225
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,260
This is Elder Song, a respectable elder of the Beggars' Sect.

226
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,620
When his Inverted-Toothed Iron Jian
(A kind of ancient weapon)

227
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,780
stunned the martial arts world,

228
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,040
you weren't even born yet.

229
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,800
I've heard a lot about you, Elder Song.

230
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,840
Elder Xi, when I was 10 years younger,

231
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,080
I often asked for his guidance in martial arts. Here.

232
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,819
He is not only my teacher but also my friend.

233
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,319
We have a very strong bond.

234
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,200
Elder Chen. Come on.

235
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,960
Elder Chen doesn't like to drink

236
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,280
but he's very proficient in Full-Arm Boxing

237
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,560
and is very good with poisons, too.

238
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,499
He has contributed a lot to the Beggars' Sect.

239
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:39,280
Thanks for the compliment, Chief.

240
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,759
This is a critical situation.

241
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,439
How can Chief Qiao look so relaxed?

242
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,580
Chief Qiao is an intelligent man.

243
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,159
His aides are gone. Although he has good martial arts skills,

244
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,060
he won't be able to defeat the four men alone.

245
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,479
He is now trying to distract them

246
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,880
as he waits for his strong support to come back.

247
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,719
Look! Signal flare. What happened?

248
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,160
Let's go have a look. Quick. Let's go

249
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,820
Look.

250
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,380
Thanks to the acknowledgment

251
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,340
given by our friends in the martial arts world,

252
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,020
the Beggars' Sect is known as the greatest sect in the world.

253
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,740
Since we have a large number of members,

254
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,260
it's not a surprise that our beliefs are not aligned.

255
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,560
If you have anything on your mind, speak up

256
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,580
and we will still be brothers.

257
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,180
I thought... Quan Guanqing was the only man responsible for this.

258
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,199
I didn't expect the Four Great Elders were involved, too.

259
00:21:08,199 --> 00:21:13,320
Four Great Elders, you ordered your men to lock us up.

260
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,580
Why did you do that?

261
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,000
Brother Bai... I'm deeply guilty.

262
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,820
We have been brothers for many years.

263
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,780
I meant no evil.

264
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,260
No evil intention?

265
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,720
I don't think so.

266
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,160
This elder and I were trapped in the abandoned house

267
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,700
which was surrounded by firewood and saltpeter.

268
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,780
We were told that the house would be burned if we tried to run away.

269
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,119
Elder Song, is this what you mean by no evil intentions?

270
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,020
Li Chunlai.

271
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm here.

272
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,620
I'm here. I'm here.

273
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,860
Li Chunlai, answer me.

274
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:03,639
You lied to us about the mutiny and led us into the trap.

275
00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:06,140
How should you be punished?

276
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,600
I'm only a lowly disciple.

277
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,759
I don't dare to do that.

278
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,440
It was...

279
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,900
What?

280
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,800
It was the order from your Branch Leader Quan, right?

281
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,600
Then I ask you.

282
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,280
Did you know that the order was fake?

283
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,180
Speak!

284
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,139
Don't you dare to admit what you did?

285
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,560
Elder Bai, you are right.

286
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,659
I made a mistake.

287
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,640
I will accept whatever punishment you impose on me.

288
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,200
That's correct.

289
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,780
That day when I relayed the order to you,

290
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,440
I knew it was a fake.

291
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,319
Why did you do that?

292
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,279
- Did the chief mistreat you?
- No.

293
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,659
- Or did I mistreat you?
- No.

294
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,320
None of that.

295
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,580
I owe a great debt of gratitude to Chief Qiao.

296
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,340
Elder Bai is a man of justice and precision.

297
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,980
I have never held any grudge against you.

298
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,059
Then, why did you do it?

299
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,720
Why?

300
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,619
I... I...

301
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:28,080
I disobeyed the sect's rules. I deserve to die.

302
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,220
But it's not my place

303
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,820
to reveal the details.

304
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,599
Li Chunlai, you knew that the order was fake

305
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,200
and you didn't inform the chief.

306
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,580
Instead, you lied to me. You should be sentenced to death.

307
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,880
Brother Xiang, who lied to you?

308
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,179
Disciples of the Beggars' Sect should abide by the law set by the ancestors.

309
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,380
Being a man, we should be able to admit our mistakes

310
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,020
and dare to face the consequences of our own actions!

311
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,720
Chief, we all agreed

312
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,560
to remove you from the chief position.

313
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,619
But we were afraid that Training Elder and Disciplinary Elder would disagree with us.

314
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:47,560
So we decided to lock them up with a trick.

315
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,360
This is a matter that will decide the future of our sect.

316
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,440
So we had to take the risk.

317
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,220
It wasn't our lucky day and you got the upper hand.

318
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,760
You can punish us however you like.

319
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,160
I have been with the Beggars' Sect for 30 years.

320
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,780
Everyone knows that I'm not a coward.

321
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,900
The Four Great Elders staged a rebellion against the chief,

322
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,680
which violates the first rule of the sect.

323
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,760
Disciplinary disciples.

324
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,380
Yes.

325
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,620
- Tie them up.
- Yes.

326
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,259
Cowards. The rebellion could have been a success.

327
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:38,680
Look at you. See how much you fear Qiao Feng.

328
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,339
Disciples of the Beggars' Sect.

329
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:01,900
Chief Qiao succeeded Chief Wang as our sect's leader.

330
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,779
Neither did he seize the position by force,

331
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,920
nor did he scheme to be where he is now.

332
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,659
Chief Wang, his predecessor, gave him three tests.

333
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:13,259
Only after he made the seven great contributions to the sect,

334
00:26:13,259 --> 00:26:16,180
did Chief Wang pass the Dog-Beating Stick to him.

335
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,560
Back then, at the meeting at Mount Tai,

336
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,100
we were surrounded by our enemies and were in a dire situation.

337
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,399
Thanks to Chief Qiao who defeated the Nine Great Men,

338
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:29,979
our sect was able to avert the crisis.

339
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:35,680
Many of you here witnessed it yourselves.

340
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,760
During the past few years when Chief Wang was sick,

341
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,499
Chief Qiao took care of all the affairs of the sect

342
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:45,060
and managed them accordingly.

343
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,720
Consequently, our sect grew stronger and stronger.

344
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,379
Chief Qiao's contributions to the sect speak for themselves.

345
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:56,760
Since he succeeded the position, he has treated all of us with a big heart.

346
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,240
He deserves more than just our respect and complete fairness.

347
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,980
Why would anyone stage a rebellion against him?

348
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,540
Quan Guanqing.

349
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,320
Explain yourself.

350
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:31,400
Branch Leader Quan, if I have done anything that betrays my brothers' trust,

351
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,560
please tell me to my face.

352
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
You don't have to hold back.

353
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,940
You haven't done anything that betrays our trust,

354
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,600
but soon you will.

355
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,139
Quan Guanqing, Chief Qiao is an upright man.

356
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:52,460
He hasn't done anything wrong,

357
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,340
and will not do anything wrong either.

358
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,920
You were the one who deluded the others

359
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,280
with the intention to rebel against the chief.

360
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,799
If I'm ever told these words, I'll take it as nonsense.

361
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,900
How can anyone be so stupid to believe your lies?

362
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,720
Elder Bai, allow Branch Leader Quan

363
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,000
to tell the whole story in detail.

364
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,279
Yes.

365
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Quan Guanqing, explain yourself.

366
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,460
Deputy Chief Ma was killed

367
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,000
and I suspect that it was Qiao Feng's doing.

368
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,340
What did you say?

369
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,780
Deputy Chief Ma has a good name in the sect

370
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,960
and was also an experienced man.

371
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,620
You had always feared Deputy Chief Ma and wanted to eliminate him.

372
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,180
Before you got him out of the picture,

373
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,980
you wouldn't be able to secure your position as the chief.

374
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,459
Deputy Chief Ma and I have a strong bond

375
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,440
and share similar interests.

376
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,320
When Chief Wang passed away,

377
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,700
Brother Ma took me as his own brother.

378
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,320
Repeat...

379
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,040
whatever you just said.

380
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,740
Deputy Chief Ma was killed

381
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,360
and we wanted to seek revenge against Murong Fu.

382
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,560
Yet, you repeatedly colluded with our enemy.

383
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,980
These people are Murong Fu's family

384
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,539
and you tried to protect them.

385
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,359
He is Murong Fu's friend and you've become sworn brothers with him.

386
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,839
That's not right.

387
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,859
I have never met Young Master Fu.

388
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,239
Also, these ladies maybe Young Master Murong's relatives,

389
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,959
but family? Not accurate.

390
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,819
Beggars' Sect has been around for hundreds of years.

391
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,620
We are a reputable sect.

392
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,080
Not because of our huge number of members,

393
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,619
but because of effort in helping others and our strong sense of justice.

394
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,540
Branch Leader Quan.

395
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:36,380
You said that I protected the three ladies.

396
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,939
Yes, I am because I have our sect's reputation to protect.

397
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,439
I don't want outsiders to say

398
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:54,100
that the elders of our sect work together to bully three weak ladies.

399
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,560
Even if you don't care about our sect's reputation,

400
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,280
our brothers do.

401
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,500
Quan Guanqing, anything else you want to say?

402
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,920
Chief, you don't have to waste your time with this wicked and unscrupulous man.

403
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,800
Just punish him according to the sect's rules.

404
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,580
Wait a minute. Chief,

405
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,180
I can't tell

406
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,919
if you are a villain who's pretending to be good

407
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,979
or a straightforward man.

408
00:31:27,979 --> 00:31:29,219
I'm not capable of doing that.

409
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,800
So, just kill me.

410
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,160
Elder Wu, why do you call me a liar?

411
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,060
What made you doubt me?

412
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,060
This matter involves too many men and things.

413
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,560
If others find out about this, Beggars' Sect will lose face in the martial arts world.

414
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,639
People will despise us.

415
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,800
Initially, we planned to kill you.

416
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:04,220
Only because I saved Murong Fu's people,

417
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,780
you think that I'm in collusion with him?

418
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,980
But you staged the rebellion even before I saved them.

419
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,539
What do they have to do with each other?

420
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,240
Moreover, we haven't concluded this matter.

421
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,720
Chief Qiao.

422
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,239
So, you are positive that Murong Fu

423
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,279
didn't kill Deputy Chief Ma.

424
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,019
To find out whether Murong Fu is the killer, we need to investigate further.

425
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,800
But if he really is,

426
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,759
I will definitely capture him and avenge Deputy Chief Ma.

427
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,940
But if he's not,

428
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,140
we will have to find the real murderer.

429
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,940
If we kill the good guy

430
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,240
based on your wild guesses,

431
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,679
the killer will still be free,

432
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,520
sneering at the Beggars' Sect for our incapability.

433
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,280
It's unfair to the innocent man.

434
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,900
We'll also let Deputy Chief Ma down

435
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:06,360
and ruin Beggars' Sect's reputation.

436
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,459
Chief, we rebelled against you because we trusted the wrong man.

437
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,899
He told us that you were at outs with Deputy Chief Ma

438
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,799
and colluded with Murong Fu to murder him.

439
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,600
When we put together all of these small things,

440
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,940
we had to believe him.

441
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,520
Now that I have thought it through, I was really muddle-headed.

442
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,380
Elder Bai, bring over the sect's knife.

443
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,679
According to the sect's rule,

444
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,300
I shall end my own life.

445
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,579
Disciplinary disciples, bring over the sect's knife.

446
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:01,780
[A drip from the head, the colored water, send it out]

447
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,279
The Four Great Elders were swayed by rumors

448
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,630
and led a rebellion against the chief.

449
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,610
According to the sect's rule,

450
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,500
he shall be punished with death by one cut.

451
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,500
Quan Guanqing, Head of Dazhi Branch,

452
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,479
spread rumors about the chief and attempted to rebel against the chief.

453
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,678
According to the sect's rules, he shall be punished with death by nine cuts.

454
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,359
Other disciples who were involved in the rebellion

455
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,619
will be handled according to the sect's rules after a thorough investigation.

456
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:35,960
All right.

457
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,560
Chief, I let you down.

458
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:45,060
I'll follow the sect's rules and end my own life.

459
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,300
Before that, I have a request.

460
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,160
When I'm gone,

461
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,559
I hope that you can remember the small contribution I made to the Beggars' Sect and forgive me.

462
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,360
Untie me.

463
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,020
Chief,

464
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,400
do you think I'm too sinful to be allowed to end my own life?

465
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,080
Fifteen years ago, the Khitans invaded Yanmen Pass.

466
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,680
When you got the news,

467
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,639
you starved for three days and stayed up for four nights,

468
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,380
just to hurry back to send the news.

469
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,300
Nine good horses died

470
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,099
while you suffered from internal injuries and were throwing up blood.

471
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:32,920
Because of that,

472
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,239
the army of our nation was able to brace themselves

473
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,279
and the Khitan troops had to retreat.

474
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,860
This is a major contribution to the nation.

475
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,020
Disciplinary Elder,

476
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:47,759
please take into consideration Elder Song's contribution to the nation.

477
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,319
Allow him to atone for his sin.

478
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,840
Chief Qiao,

479
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,739
I understand why you interceded for Elder Song.

480
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:59,599
But these are the sect's rules saying that a rebel

481
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,360
can never be forgiven, no matter how much credit he has accumulated.

482
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,160
He can't be forgiven, or he might claim credit for himself in the future

483
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,360
and create more trouble with his arrogance.

484
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,460
Chief,

485
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,280
our sect spent hundreds of years to achieve what we have and we can't ruin it.

486
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,359
We cannot disobey the rules set by the previous chiefs.

487
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,020
Chief.

488
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,319
Chief, the Disciplinary Elder is right.

489
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:33,000
As the elders,

490
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,940
we all have contributed to the sect in some way.

491
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,879
If they can atone for their sins with their credits,

492
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
they will commit any crime as they please.

493
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,840
Thanks, Chief.

494
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,800
Please sympathize with me.

495
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,439
Allow me to end my own life.

496
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,500
Chief, you...

497
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,560
Fine.

498
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,539
I had the intention to kill you.

499
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,039
I deserve to be killed by you.

500
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,820
Do it.

501
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,280
Chief, you!

502
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,699
- Elder Bai.
- Chief.

503
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,900
Among our sect's rules,

504
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,920
there's a rule that says

505
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,200
a disciple who disobeys the rules shall not be pardoned.

506
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,599
If the chief intends to show mercy to the disciple,

507
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,840
he shall bleed himself to cleanse the disciple from his sins.

508
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,440
Chief, there indeed is such a rule.

509
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,619
The chief shall bleed himself to cleanse the disciple from his sins.

510
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:45,179
But, Chief, is it worth doing that?

511
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,239
Exactly, Chief. Why do you have to do that?

512
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,480
As long as we don't break the rules set by our ancestors.

513
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,080
Chief!

514
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,860
Elder Xi, you taught me martial arts.

515
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,620
Although you're not my teacher,

516
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,200
you did take me as your student.

517
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,160
Thanks.

518
00:38:29,879 --> 00:38:35,820
Back then, Chief Wang was captured by the Five Great Men of Khitan

519
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,479
and was imprisoned in the Heifeng Cave at Mount Qilian.

520
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,340
He was threatened to surrender the Beggars' Sect to the Khitans.

521
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,860
Elder Xi, you shared a slight resemblance with Chief Wang.

522
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,760
You disguised as Chief Wang

523
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,380
and were ready to die for him.

524
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,820
Because of that, Chief Wang got out of the woods.

525
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,160
It's a great contribution to both the nation and the sect.

526
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,360
Chief!

527
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,740
You have to get pardoned today.

528
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,500
Chief Qiao,

529
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,359
we have never had a good relationship.

530
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,340
I upset you quite often as well.

531
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,659
So, I don't have the audacity to ask you to bleed for me.

532
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,780
Elder Chen.

533
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,660
I am a lowbrow person.

534
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,359
I don't like to make friends with people who are grim,

535
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:50,180
nosy, cruel,

536
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,500
and speak with sarcasm.

537
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,979
This is how I am.

538
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:59,040
I am blunt.

539
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Moreover, you don't like to drink.

540
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,420
So we never got along.

541
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,339
- Chief.
- Chief Qiao.

542
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,700
Chief, what are you doing?

543
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,740
But who is the guy

544
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,080
who risked his life to steal the Khitan's deployment map?

545
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,480
Others might not know about this.

546
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,060
But I've always known what you did for the sect.

547
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,280
Chief.

548
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,300
I, Chen Guyan, thank you for your mercy.

549
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,780
Forgive me for the nonsense I've said, please.

550
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,780
Thanks, Chief.

551
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,400
Elder Wu.

552
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,399
Back then, you guarded the Yingchou Gorge on your own.

553
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,660
You fought off the men of First Class Hall of Xixia

554
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:24,360
and ruined their plan to assassinate the generals of the Yang family.

555
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,360
With the gold medal only rewarded to you by Marshal Yang,

556
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,980
you shall be forgiven.

557
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,720
Show the gold medal to the brothers.

558
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,020
Chief, I'm ashamed to admit this.

559
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,980
That day, I had no money to buy wine

560
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,600
and I sold the gold medal to the jeweler.

561
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,060
Elder Wu, we are beggars.

562
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,760
If you are running out of food or wine,

563
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,080
you should just beg for it.

564
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,320
Why did you sell the gold medal?

565
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,839
It's easy to beg for food, but not for wine.

566
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,720
They usually say, "Stinky beggars.

567
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,439
How dare you ask for wine after I gave you food? That's absurd.

568
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,320
I won't give you wine."

569
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,700
Nice! But you might have let Marshal Yang down.

570
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,620
Chief, thanks for your benevolence.

571
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,100
I owe you my life.

572
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:46,180
From now on, I won't believe whoever talks bad about you.

573
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,420
Quan Guanqing,

574
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,060
do you have anything else to say?

575
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,950

That farmer from down the mountain,

what is his surname?

602
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,490
That farmer...

603
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:41,700
is called Qiao Sanhuai.

604
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,800
Nonsense!
