Miss Wang must have prayed for

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,359
the safety and well-being of Young Master Murong.

16
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,399
Is there a young girl in this world who would secretly wish for me

17
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,440
the way Miss Wang did?

18
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,760
Junior Xuan Bei was killed by his famous technique, Vajra.

19
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,559
I have asked Young Master Murong to come here today

20
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,220
to clarify this matter.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,200
Junior Xuan Bei was killed on the 28th of last month.

22
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,079
Were you in Dali on the day of his death?

23
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:20,019
I was not in Dali the day Reverend Xuan Bei was killed.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,480
Then, where were you?

25
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,820
And who can testify to that?

26
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,120
I had an important matter to attend to that day.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,180
As to where I was,

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,500
I cannot tell you.

29
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,580
However, I was indeed not in Dali.

30
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,399
Deng Baichuan, Brother Deng, who traveled with me can testify to this.

31
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:43,200
You have nothing to hide if you are honest.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,660
[Shaolin Temple, Master Xuan Ku]
Besides, Deng Baichuan is the Murong Clan's attendant.

33
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,420
How can we trust his words?

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,719
Your words are too arbitrary, aren't they?

35
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,640
All of you here are highly respected monks.

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,479
How many of you here dare to be absolutely frank with everybody?

37
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,559
And naturally, I have things I do not want others to know.

38
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,079
It would be ridiculous to say

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,860
that I was the murderer of Reverend Xuan Bei

40
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,640
based on this point.

41
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,900
Mr. Murong has a point.

42
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,559
However, Vajra is one of Shaolin's 72 Secret Arts.

43
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,500
Only a few people know it.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
There is no one but people of the Murong Clan,

45
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,600
who can injure Junior Xuan Bei with a single blow.

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,159
My Shaolin Temple will not rest

48
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:33,840
Then I dare ask,

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,060
Reverend Xuan Bei and I have never met.

50
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,960
Why would I go all the way to Dali to kill him?

51
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,759
And Reverend Xuan Bei was killed by a Vajra,

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,340
but you are all pointing the finger at me.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,659
If I had hoped to get away with it, I could have gone into hiding.

54
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,640

Mr. Murong did not murder Junior Xuan Bei.

It is extremely difficult to master Vajra.

60
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,439
In all my years at Shaolin Temple, I have only cultivated the basics.

61
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,119
I tested Young Master Murong just now with Vajra's move and mental cultivation method.

62
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,660
Although Young Master Murong knows something about Vajra,

63
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,959
his familiarity with the moves and his skill level are below mine.

64
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:29,880
There is no way he could kill Junior Xuan Bei with one move.

65
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,439
With Mr. Murong's current martial arts skills, it is indeed difficult to do such a thing.

66
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:44,559
I knew it. With Shaolin's century-old reputation, you are certainly reasonable.

Monk Xuan Bei of Shaolin Temple

117

Some foolish jerks are blaming it on us, the Murong Clan.

119

Actually, I sneaked out behind my mother's back.

126
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,159
I was in danger.

127
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640

130
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,940
Won't that make my brother, Murong, jealous?

131
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,140
What is there to be jealous about?

132
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:30,499
Young Master Duan here saw how Monk Xuan Bei was killed with a Vajra.

133
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,200
Maybe, he can help my cousin.

134
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,599
He is just a boy toy.

135
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,860
Do not be fooled by him.

136
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,460
What are you talking about?

137
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,879
So you are saying he would fabricate information about the Shaolin Sect?

138
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,959
How do you know that the death of Monk Xuan Bei is being used

139
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,840
to frame the Murong family?

140
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,200
Are you interrogating a prisoner?

141
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,779
Go ahead and torture me. I will not answer you.

142
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,039
Third Brother Bao,

143
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,820
Young Master Duan is our benefactor.

144
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,400
Don't hurt him.

145
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,380
I am sure you are all hungry. Third Brother Bao,

146
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,439
I will cook something delicious for everyone

147
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,620
and calm Miss Wang down.

148
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,710
Come on, Miss Wang. This way, please.

149
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,340
Let's go.

150
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Who is it?

151
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
The fist skills of Vajra are powerful.

152
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,200
All the inner strength has to be concentrated in the fists.

153
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,000
From Zhaohai and Diji,

154
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,600
through Jimen and Daheng, to Tianquan and Quze.

155
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,700
The acupoints have to be dredged with internal force

156
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,400
like a thousand streams returning to the sea.

157
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,600
The strength increases passing every spot.

158
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
Who are you?

159
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,700
You are practicing the Dog-Beating Stick Technique

160
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,400
but could not improve because you kept rushing it.

161
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,100
You practiced the Knife Skill of Compassion

162
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,000
but you have never understood the meaning of compassion.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,200
And now is the same case for your Vajra.

164
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,600
You only know what its moves are but not the spirit of it.

165
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,800
How can you improve in the long run?

166
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,100
Who exactly are you?

167
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,600
How do you know all these?

168
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,400
You don't need to know who I am.

169
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,600
You mastering your martial arts ability well is the priority.

170
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Vajra is all about instant power.

171
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,900
A seemingly ordinary punch actually

172
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,800
consists of hundreds and thousands of powerful punches.

173
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,000
That's why it can break people's ribs and organs.

174
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,200
When will you be able to integrate the essence

175
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,800
if you only focus on the form?

176
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
You are right.

177
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,200
It sounds like you have a connection with us, the Murong family.

178
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I would be most grateful if you could enlighten me.

179
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,300
Enlighten is too much of a word.

180
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,800
But for the sake of an old acquaintance, I offered some comments.

181
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,400
Lest you disgrace the Murong Clan.

182
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,600
Senior!

183
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,000
Are you Qiao Feng, Chief Qiao?

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
That is me.

185
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,800
May I know why you are here?

186
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,200
I am Nu Erhai, a warrior of the First Class Hall of Xixia.

187
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,600
I am escorting the General of the Eastern Expedition, Helian Tieshu, to Bian Liang.

188
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
The general has a passion for martial arts

189
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,100
and is here to visit all the masters in the Central Plains.

190
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,000
He heard that Chief Qiao was quite famous.

191
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,400
I was sent here to make a request to fight.

192
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,700
We request to fight with you, Chief Qiao.

193
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,500
[Letter of Challenge]

194
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
I have important business to attend to and I have to go to Shaolin.

195
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
I am afraid I will not have time for this.

196
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
What urgent business can a beggar have with monks?

197
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,600
It is said that Qiao Feng from the north and Murong from the south are top martial arts masters.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,000
My general respects you as one of the best

199
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
in the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

200
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,800
So I have come to send you the invitation first.

201
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
Abbot Xuan Ci of Shaolin Temple is a highly respected monk,

202
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,000
but he is very old.

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,200
The Murong Clan is known for their lightness and agility.

204
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,000
Taking them down could not manifest my general's ability.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,800
If that is the guts you have,

206
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
who else in the martial arts world of the Central Plains

207
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,400
deserves a fight with our general?

208
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,800
Do not be so arrogant.

209
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,400
Chief, if you do not go for that fight,

210
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,000
I will be going then.

211
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
Okay.

212
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,000
Go back to your general and tell him

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
let's do this in a few days.

214
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,200
If that's the case, make it noon in three days.

215
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,400
We will see you at the Huishan Pavilion.

216
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,500
Little brat, go back and tell your general

217
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,200
that our chief will give him a taste

218
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,900
of the martial arts of the Central Plains.

219
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
Miss Wang. Young Master Duan. Enjoy your meal.

220
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,500
There are a lot of good dishes coming.

221
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Third Brother, how is my cousin doing?

222
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,900
Miss Wang, there is an outsider here,

223
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,600
and he's even a foppish boy toy.

224
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,200
There are some things that he cannot know.

225
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Young Master Duan, do not be mad.

226
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Our Third Brother Bao always behaves like this.

227
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,400
He has to be harsh to someone first; otherwise, he doesn't have the stomach to eat food.

228
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,000
Mr. Bao, you said I am foppish and very unreliable.

229
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
What about the appearance of your Young Master Murong?

230
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Does he look like you?

231
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,200
That is a good question.

232
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Our young master has a handsome face,

233
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
but he is very macho.

234
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Unlike you, Brother Duan,

235
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
just a book with a nice cover.

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,100
He is so different from you.

237
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,300
As for me,

238
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,400
I am attractive but not handsome.

239
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I am macho but ugly.

240
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,800
I can be called Mr. Ugly Hot.

241
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,700
I have come all the way here with Brother Feng.

242
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,800
I heard that Deputy Chief Ma Dayuan of Beggars' Sect

243
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,000
was killed by Throat Locking Skill.

244
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,200
Yet some bastards, again, blame it on us, the Murong Clan.

245
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,800
Isn't that slandering?

246
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, then, who is secretly messing with us?

247
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
First, it can't be the Shaolin Sect.

248
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,500
Neither can it be the Beggars' Sect.

249
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
Their intention is to frame the Murong Clan.

250
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,800
So they won't go after their own people.

251
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,400
We ran into some people of First Class Hall of Xixia on our way back.

252
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Second Brother Gong Ye has gone to tail them.

253
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,600
We do not know yet if they are the ones behind this.

254
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Do people of First Class Hall of Xixia want to make things difficult for us, too?

255
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,800
There seem to be more and more enemies.

256
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
Exactly, so Fourth Brother and I

257
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,400
are going to take A'Zhu and A'Bi to meet with Young Master

258
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,600
to tell him about the situation at home,

259
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
so he can be prepared.

260
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
Miss Wang, are you coming with us

261
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,500
or following us? Or...

262
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,000
Of course, I will go with you.

263
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,100
Wonderful, wonderful.

264
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,800
If Miss Wang is going with us,

265
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,600
you can tell our enemy's backgrounds

266
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,000
just by a look at them.

267
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,100
We can know how far we can go when confronting them.

268
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
We can't talk as much as we want

269
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,900
with you around all the time.

270
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,000
Brother Duan, why don't you see yourself out?

271
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:20,000
Miss Wang. Miss A'Bi. I shall take leave now.

272
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,800
We will meet again.

273
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,000
Young Master Duan, where are you going?

274
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,800
You are not familiar with the waterways of Lake Tai.

275
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Why don't you stay the night and leave tomorrow?

276
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,900
It makes no difference

277
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,400
whether I leave today or tomorrow.

278
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,600
Miss Wang, take care.

279
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,200
During the years of the war between Liao and Song,

280
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,900
our country has been defeated repeatedly.

281
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,940
The Xixia Kingdom seems to be befriending our country,

282
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,260
but in fact, it is thinking otherwise behind our backs.

283
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,139
This time, if this General He Lian could challenge

284
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,140
the entire martial arts world of the Central Plains on his own,

285
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,639
it would put great pressure on the imperial court.

286
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,359
And he can use it as leverage to demand more.

287
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,400
In that case...

288
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Chief, General He Lian is so proud and arrogant.

289
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,959
Is it okay if you go fight him alone?

290
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:39,100
That is right, Chief.

291
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,299
We are not afraid to fight but what if they are up to something else?

292
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:44,900
Should we contact the Daren Branch first?

293
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,359
It is good to have a backup in case something goes wrong.

294
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,200
I have already sent carrier pigeons to Elder Xiang and Elder Xi

295
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,959
to ask them to come and join us as soon as possible.

296
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,040
Even if the Xixia people plot something else, we at least have a countermeasure.

297
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,980
This... This... This is bad!

298
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,399
Something has happened at the Daren Branch!

299
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,119
A large group of people is clamoring

300
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,039
to avenge Deputy Chief Ma.

301
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,780
Well... they said...

302
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,820
they were going after the Murong Clan.

303
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,140
This timing is too coincidental.

304
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,479
We will surely seek revenge for Deputy Chief Ma

305
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,080
but we Beggars' Sect are upright and honest.

306
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,999
Even if we are seeking revenge, we have to do it with solid proof.

307
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:28,000
Chief, since you have plans,

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,439
shall I go and find out what's going on?

309
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,159
Then I'm counting on you to tell our brothers to calm down.

310
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,740
No wonder Jiangnan is widely admired.

311
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:55,700
I am the only one enjoying this beautiful scenery right now.

312
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,919
I wonder where Miss Wang is and what she is doing.

313
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,659
Take care, sir. Come again next time.

314
00:22:11,659 --> 00:22:13,760
[Songhe Restaurant]

315
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,239
Well, well, well. I really get what I want.

316
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,700
Just in time. Right.

317
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,759
As the old saying goes, drinking drives all worries away.

318
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,479
Now that I am all alone,

319
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,140
why can't I follow suit?

320
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,920
Please come this way, sir.

321
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,500
Please have a seat.

322
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,799
Waiter, get me a pot of wine.

323
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,970
And prepare four kinds of dishes for me.

324
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,520
Yes, sir.

325
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,220
Just call me if you need anything.

326
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,519
What a strong man.

327
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,420
He must be the kind of heroic man of Yan and Zhao of the north.

328
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,260
There is no such person in Jiangnan or Dali.

329
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,679
That Bao Bu Tong bragged about being macho.

330
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,299
This strong man here is the one who deserves to be called macho.

331
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:04,780
- Waiter.
- Coming!

332
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,219
- I will pay for that gentleman's tab.
- All right.

333
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,320
Brother!

334
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,600
Come up and drink with me.

335
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,859
Sure, sure. Waiter, move my stuff to the table over there.

336
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,060
Nice to meet you.

337
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,559
The cup is a little too small if you are treating me to drinks, isn't it?

338
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,940
- Waiter.
- At your service.

339
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,799
Bring me two large bowls later.

340
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,239
- And another ten catties of Sorghum wine.
- Sir,

341
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,380
can you finish ten catties of Sorghum wine?

342
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,660
He is buying me drinks. And you are trying to help him save money?

343
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,260
Ten catties is not enough, make it twenty.

344
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,439
All right!

345
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,940
Twenty catties of Sorghum wine.

346
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,380
- Please enjoy.
- Come on.

347
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,680
Okay. Then I will accompany you with all my might.

348
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,600
Don't be offended if I misbehave after drinking.

349
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,980
- Come on.
- Cheers.

350
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,720
Good one! Good one!

351
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,200
Brother,  your alcohol tolerance isn't bad.

352
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,319
-  I can't always...
- Come on.

353
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,620
I can't always drink like this. It depends on who I drink with.

354
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,119
There's a saying, "A thousand cups of wine is not enough when drinking with a bosom friend."

355
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,479
I think this bowl of wine can only fill twenty cups.

356
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:38,659
If we were to fill a thousand, we'd have to drink forty or fifty bowls.

357
00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:41,580
- Then we must drink it all.
- Drink it all.

358

375
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,839
Young master, I just got some news.

376
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,119
Second Brother has found out about the whereabouts of the Xixia people.

377
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,740
They are near Wuxi. Third and Fourth Brother

378
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,940
are on their way there with A'Zhu and A'Bi.

379
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,200
Should we go and meet them?

380
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,920
We will be right there.

381
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,459
Oh, right. I have unfinished business.

382
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:25,639
Wait for me at the mountain gate. I will be there soon.

383
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,180
I am Murong Fu.

384
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,800
Thank you for your guidance from which I've benefited greatly.

385
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:44,319
I am leaving the mountain today and have come to bid you farewell.

386
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,780
I wonder if you could show yourself.

387
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,020
If that is the case,

388
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,520
I thank you for your guidance.

389
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:08,979
I will follow your advice and train hard, not to ruin the reputation of the Murong family.

390
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,580
Take care, Senior.

391
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,240
Farewell.

392
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,360
Waiter!

393
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,460
Another twenty catties of wine.

394
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,099
Brother, we have already had about forty bowls of wine.

395
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,960
Forty bowls?

396
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,599
You are quite sober.

397
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,420
You know the numbers so well.

398
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:49,699
My dear friend, let me say, that the two of us meeting each other,

399
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,999
is like "the desire to meet someone of good talent."

400
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,419
I am afraid it is not that easy to win on drinking over the other,

401
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:02,580
but if we keep drinking like this, I won't have enough money to pay.

402
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,240
All right.

403
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,199
We've had our wine. And the meat. Let's go.

404
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,920
Okay.

405
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,380
Brother, you've got strong legs.

406
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,380
- How about a match with me?
- I'm in.

407
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,060
Go!

408
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,860
Brother, your feet are okay. Right?

409
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,100
- Let's run for a bit.
- Okay.

410
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,360
Brother, you were very fast.

411
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,659
I wonder where you come from?

412
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,759
I'm from the Duan family of Dali. This is my first trip to Jiangnan.

413
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,259
I am lucky enough to know a hero like you, Brother Qiao.

414
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:28,859
Did you say your name was Qiao Feng?

415
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,720
Yes, I am Qiao Feng.

416
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,900
You are... from the Duan family of Dali.

417
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,400
No wonder. What brings you to Jiangnan?

418
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:44,419
To tell you the truth, I... I was captured by someone.

419
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,580
By whom?

420
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,160
He said he is the Advisor to the Tibetan ruler. His name is Jiu Mozhi.

421
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,519
He said he wanted to trade me with Young Master Murong for some kind of martial art.

422
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,820
I had just escaped from danger, so I didn't want to go home.

423
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,359
So I can only wander around aimlessly.

424
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,780
What is your next plan, Brother Qiao?

425
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,919
I was on my way to Shaolin, but I'm staying here for a few days

426
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,759
because I have a martial arts contest in Mount Hui tomorrow.

427
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:12,760
Contest?

428
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,659
Brother Qiao, how about this?

429
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:18,239
I don't know much about martial arts but I'd like to tag along.

430
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,380
What do you think?

431
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,999
Okay. Our meeting was fated.

432
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:24,680
It is still early.

433
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,600
Let's go back and get wrecked.

434
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,320
Brother. To be honest,

435
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,199
I cheated when we were drinking just now.

436
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:36,519
The wine I drank traveled through my acupuncture points

437
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,799
with my true qi and streamed out of my body through my fingertip.

438
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,839
Naturally, I wasn't affected.

439
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,580
But if we continue to drink,

440
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,480
it would be bad for your health, so I called it off.

441
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,559
Brother Qiao, please don't blame me.

442
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,880
Is that Dali's Duan family's Six Pulse Excalibur?

443
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,500
Exactly. I just learned it, and I am still unfamiliar with it.

444
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,440
My master once told me

445
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,039
that the Duan family has a technique called Six Pulse Excalibur

446
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,439
that can hurt people with invisible sword energy.

447
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,820
I used to wonder if that was true.

448
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,940
Sure enough, such divine art really does exist.

449
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,570
In my opinion, I don't see how it can be used for anything other than cheating while drinking with you.

450
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,590
Other things... I haven't found anything good about it.

451
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,479
For example, when I was being held captive by Jiu Mozhi,

452
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,559
I had no way to fight back.

453
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,440
So I think the world must have exaggerated the power

454
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,460
of Dali's Six Pulse Excalibur.

455
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,860
Brother, you are very straightforward.

456
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,359
This is our first time meeting but we are friends already.

457
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,680
How about we become sworn brothers?

458
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,900
Brother Qiao, you are a hero.

459
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,879
If you are willing to do so, I am all for it.

460
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,340
Okay.

461
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,540
I am twenty years old.

462
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
I am ten years older than you.

463
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,360
Big Brother.

464
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,980
Little brother.

465
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,300
Elder, please come in.

466
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,600
Have some water.

467
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,000
Please have some tea.

468
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,000
Where is your Branch Leader Quan?

469
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,600
He will be here soon.

470
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,000
No.

471
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,100
You'd better take me to him.

472
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,600
You...

473
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I'm sorry...

474
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

475
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,600
Don't bother, Elder Bai.

476
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,000
They went to great lengths to get you and me here.

477
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,400
How could they let us leave so easily?

478
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,800
The firestone is stacked up both inside and outside this house.

479
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,200
If we try to run,

480
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,000
they can set fire to us right away.

481
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
Brother Xiang, how could you be tricked by them, too?

482
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,400
It's not just me. Since yesterday,

483
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,000
they've tricked everyone who has a say in the gang here, even just a little.

484
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,600
I don't know where they're being held.

485
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,600
I wonder what Quan Guanqing is up to.

486
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,400
He has got a lot of nerve.

487
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,600
What?

488
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,300
They tricked you into coming here yesterday?

489
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,000
That's right.

490
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,500
Later, I heard people shouting

491
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,200
and realized that several branch leaders

492
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
had also been set up by them.

493
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,900
I guess they are being detained somewhere around here, too.

494
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,400
Fortunately, Chief and the elders didn't fall for it.

495
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,600
It won't be long before they find this place.

496
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,100
They will get their punishment.

497
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,400
But Quan Guanqing is just a branch leader.

498
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,600
How could he have accomplished such a great thing

499
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
and not a word of it has gotten out?

500
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,600
You mean Quan Guanqing is not the only one who has rebelled?

501
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,000
Brother, have you met Young Master Murong?

502
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,400
I heard he had great martial arts skills and a charming demeanor.

503
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,000
I wonder who is better between you two.

504
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,400
Murong Fu is just a few years older than you.

505
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,300
I have always wanted to be friends with him.

506
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,000
But now, I am afraid that is not going to happen.

507
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,600
- Why?
- I had a close friend.

508
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,800
He died in an accident the other day.

509
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,800
People are all saying that Murong Fu murdered him.

510
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,800
"Fight fire with fire"?

511
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
The technique that made him famous got him killed.

512
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,999
However, as for matters in the martial arts world,

513
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,300
you can't just listen to rumors.

514
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,700
So I came to Jiangnan this time to find out the truth.

515
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,500
It does sound strange.

516
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,900
Then, who is this powerful enemy that is meeting with you today?

517
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,600
They are from the First Class Hall of Xixia

518
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,200
and have incredible martial arts skills.

519
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
They want to challenge the heroes of the Song Dynasty

520
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,600
and put us down.

521
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,800
Brother, you are an outstanding man.

522
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
Those First Class Hall of Xixia people

523
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,900
are just asking for trouble.

524
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,200
Murong Fu owes me Deputy Chief Ma's life.

525
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,200
How dare he show up in Beggars' Sect territory?

526
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,600
Are you here to pay for his life?

527
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,000
No. No.

528
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,500
Why are you blaming the death of your family member on us?

529
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,800
You beggars are just like the Shaolin monks!

530
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,800
You slander people without any evidence.

531
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
We were just passing through Luoyang.

532
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,100
Shall we be blamed for all the deaths in Luoyang?

533
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,600
- Brother Jiang.
- Chief.

534
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,400
Chief... Chief is here.

535
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Greetings, Chief.

536
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
Brothers, please stand.

537
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,600
Chief Qiao.

538
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,800
What good timing!

539
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,200
If you had come any later,

540
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,600
your disciples would have chopped me,

541
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,600
these three girls, and Fourth Brother up.

542
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
to make a blood sacrifice to your Deputy Chief Ma.

543
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
- Hand over Murong Fu!
- Yes!

544
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,600
Hand him over!

545
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,900
Brother Bao,

546
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,400
Deputy Chief Ma was killed by his own Throat Locking Skill.

547
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,600
My brothers are inevitably speculative and emotional,

548
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,800
but the cause is still unknown.

549
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,000
If they have gone too far,

550
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I apologize to you on behalf of them.

551
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,300
However, we are indeed looking for Young Master Murong.

552
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,000
I would like to know where he is.

553
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,700
Do I need to answer you just because you ask me?

554
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,900
Chief Qiao,

555
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,200
people of your sect have accused my young master without proof.

556
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,800
They should be punished for making false accusations.

557
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,500
You must give us an explanation.

558
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,600
Do you think an apology will suffice?

559
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,600
That would be too easy on you.

560
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,400
I heard that Bao Butong from Jiangnan loves to talk crap.

561
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,400
Now that I've heard it, you indeed live up to that name.

562
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,200
As the saying goes, quiet dogs bite.

563
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Some dogs were noisy and took a bite just now.

564
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,600
It must be the four elders of Beggars' Sect.

565
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,200
Why are you still babbling here

566
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,200
if you know the four elders of Beggars' Sect?

567
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,600
Hello, Chief.

568
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,400
Four Great Elders.

569
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,800
You four old men,

570
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,700
what opinion do you have? Do you want to...

571
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,200
fight with me?

572
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
Who loves to fight the most in this world?

573
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,700
Is it you, Mr. Bao?

574
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,600
Wrong, wrong!  It's me, the wind of Jiangnan,

575
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,400
Feng Bo. Bring it!

576
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,600
Come out and fight with me!

577
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,200
Fourth Brother,

578
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,400
you've really mastered the dog-biting technique!

579
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,600
Your ten-year practice.

580
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:41,200
You have bitten over 1,800 colored dogs, black and white,

581
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,400
before you acquired this skill.

582
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,400
Fourth Brother!

583
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Fourth Brother, what's the matter with you?

584
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,600
Nothing, I...

585
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Fourth Brother!

586
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,200
Fourth Brother, what's the matter with you?

587
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,700
- You were playing dirty.
- What's wrong?

588
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,400
You want to fight with me one by one?

589
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,100
Let me see what the great men of the Murong Clan are capable of!

590
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,400
Fourth Brother.

591
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,800
- Fourth Brother Feng, are you okay?
- I think he has been poisoned.

592
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
There are many ways to cure poison in martial arts books.

593
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,000
But I read all books but them.

594
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,200
Now I can only watch Brother Feng being poisoned,

595
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,400
and can do anything about it.

596
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,200
Elder Chen.

597
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,100
- Chief.
- Cure Fourth Young Master Feng's poison first.

598
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,700
This man is rude. If you cure him,

599
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,000
there will be no end to trouble.

600
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,700
That is true.

601
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,100
However, we have been rude and accused them in the first place.

602
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,200
Deputy Chief Ma was clearly killed by Murong Fu.

603
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,400
I'm taking revenge.

604
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
I don't care about morality and righteousness.

605
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,500
First, relieve him of the poison.

606
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,000
We will talk about the rest later.

607

632
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,400
Chief Qiao, then

633
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,000
do you not think it was Murong Fu who killed Deputy Chief Ma?

634
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
Whether the murderer is Murong Fu

635
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,800
is something we still need to investigate carefully.

636
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:42,400
If it really is him, we will definitely capture him to avenge Deputy Chief Ma.

637
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,600
If it wasn't him,

638
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,800
then we still need to find the true murderer.

639
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,700
Just with you guessing around,

640
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,000
you nearly killed a good and innocent person.

641
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Yet, the real murderer is still out there carefree and without worry.
