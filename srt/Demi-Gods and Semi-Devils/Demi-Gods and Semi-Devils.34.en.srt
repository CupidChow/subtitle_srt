[Episode 34]

13
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,200
Greeting, Your Highness.

14
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Duan Yu, Duan Yu...

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,600
Not only did you compromise the interests of yourself and those of others,

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,700
but you also got trapped within.

17
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,300
All your years of education have gone to waste.

18
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,200
What's wrong with His Highness?

19
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,800
I need to stop on the edge of the precipice

20
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,800
to avoid imminent disaster.

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,800
It's necessary to put a halt to romance.

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,400
Otherwise, you will sacrifice your entire life for nothing.

23
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Highness aided the Shaolin Sect

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
to investigate the death of Reverend Xuan Bei.

25
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,600
We were told to go to the Murong Residence

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
to find if there are any traces left behind.

27
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,000
We paid them a discreet visit and we found nothing suspicious.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,600
Brother Ba recalled the incident where Jiu Mozhi, the Tibetan Monk,

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,600
invited Your Highness to travel from Dali to Jiangnan.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,200
He said it was a trip to pay homage to the late Mr. Murong.

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,400
That was exactly what happened.

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,600
But the girl at the Murong Residence

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,000
refused to bring the Tibetan Monk to the tomb regardless.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,800
That was how our young master was able to escape from the Tibetan Monk.

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,500
Grand Marshal Fan, why did Grand Marshal Ba bring this up?

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,000
When Brother Hua heard about the tomb,

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,400
he was excited to visit it.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
Although Brother Ba and I disagreed on his plan,

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,500
Brother Hua insisted.

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,000
We couldn't persuade him otherwise,

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
so we could only listen to him.

42
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
We entered the tomb and opened the casket.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
- And guess what we saw.
- What did you see?

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
The casket was empty.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
There was nobody in there.

46
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Murong Bo is still alive?

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Murong Bo is still alive.

48
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,600
He told his son to travel across the Central Plains.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Yet, he was killing people at a place far away.

50
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
He's a mystery-monger.

51
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,800
That was what we thought, too.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,000
But Murong Bo has unfathomable skills in martial arts.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,900
If he wants to kill them, he could have used other means.

54
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,700
Why did he have to leave traces behind

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,400
by using the "fight fire with fire" technique?

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,700
and make it evident that the murders were committed by the Murong Clan?

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,800
If he wanted to showcase his skills to the martial arts world,

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,000
why did he pretend to be dead?

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,200
If Brother Hua wasn't that persistent,

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
who would have found out about his secret?

61
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,800
Please come again.

62
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,500
Boss!

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,800
Have you seen a few monks passing by this place?

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
No, I haven't.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,800
Thanks, Boss.

66
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,600
Could it be that they have gone in an opposite direction?

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,800
Forget it.

68
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,600
I should perhaps fill my stomach first

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,000
before I continue searching for them.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,400
Enjoy the food.

71
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,300
Boss.

72
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,300
Amitabha.

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,500
Can you give me two bowls of plain noodles?

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,200
- Master, have a seat.
- Thank you.

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,800
Two bowls of plain noodles.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Waiter, here.

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,400
I'll be right there.

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,000
Two more bowls of noodles.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,300
Sure.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Amitabha.

81
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,200
Waiter, bill.

82
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,800
I'll be right there.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,600
Little Monk.

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Can I sit here?

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Young Master, suit yourself.

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,900
Are you waiting for someone?

87
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,900
I'm looking for someone.

88
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,800
I'm looking for my martial brothers and my martial uncles.

89
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, a few monks!

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Yes. Young Master, have you seen them?

91
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,400
No, I haven't.

92
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,600
But I ran into a monk.

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,000
What does he look like?

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
What does he look like?

95
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,500
He...

96
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,000
has a wide forehead, a pair of big ears, a wide mouth, and thick lips.

97
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,800
His nostrils are facing upward and he's in his early twenties.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,200
He's waiting for two bowls of plain noodles in this shop.

99
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,600
He's still waiting for the noodles.

100
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
Young Master, so you're describing me.

101
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,530
Yes.

102
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,000
Master, your noodles are here.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
Thanks.

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
Enjoy your food.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,600
Young Master, do you want some?

106
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
There are only greens and some mushrooms.

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,300
Wait a minute.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll buy you a meal.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,600
Do you like roasted chicken?

110
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,300
Thanks, Young Master.

111
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,600
But I'm a vegetarian.

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Young Master, please enjoy your food.

113
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,800
There are a few monks.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,100
They are walking toward us.

115
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,460
[Food and rest]

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,100
Young Masters, this way.

117
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,800
There's no one.

118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,600
Why did you have to lie to me?

119
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,900
I probably made a mistake.

120
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,800
Their noodles taste so good.

121
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,900
Do they taste good?

122
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Are they delicious?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do they taste different?

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,500
Do you like the pork or the chicken?

125
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,800
Little Monk, I think you like meat after all.

126
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,500
Why did you throw up? Is the meat unpalatable?

127
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,600
It's been 23 years... It's been 23 years since I last ate meat.

128
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
You ruined me.

129
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,800
How did I ruin you?

130
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,100
Greens and tofu will never taste as good as meat.

131
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,800
You haven't tried it because you were stupid.

132
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
I'm a monk.

133
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,500
I...

134
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,300
I spent a great effort in fruitless searching,

135
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,300
yet I ran into you here by a lucky chance.

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,100
Stand right there.

137
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
Come here.

138
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,800
Master.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,800
You still remember that I'm your master.

140
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,000
Come here.

141
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,700
Bring them inside. Then, go take a look

142
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
- at how Reverend Hui Jing is doing.
- Yes.

143
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,600
Later, we'll interrogate them one by one.

144
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,800
Martial Uncle Hui Jing?

145
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Let's go.

146
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,400
Let's go.

147
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,800
- Master.
- Master.

148
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Martial Uncle.

149
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,000
Where is it?

150
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
It's at Nanjing City of the Liao Kingdom.

151
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Nanjing City of the Liao Kingdom?

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
You're still lying to me at this moment?

153
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,900
I dare not lie to you, Master.

154
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,700
Eldest Martial Sister, I advise you to be honest.

155
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,100
Master is a wise man.

156
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,200
He won't be deceived by your tricks.

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,500
Eldest Martial Sister?

158
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,200
So, you're a woman.

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How do you know her?

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,200
We ran into each other at the shop.

161
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
"We ran into each other at the shop."

162
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
A'Zi, you're getting increasingly bolder.

163
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,600
How dare you keep lying to me?

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,700
Master. Master!

165
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Master, the food is ready.

166
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,800
Watch these two monks.

167
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,500
A'Zi, come with me.

168
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,800
Master.

169
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,300
Tell me. Where is it?

170
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,600
I dare not lie to Master.

171
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,000
It's indeed at Nanjing City of the Liao Kingdom.

172
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Which part of Nanjing City?

173
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,800
When I arrived at the north,

174
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,200
I worried that the pot would fall into the wrong hands.

175
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,300
Therefore, I discreetly hid the pot

176
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,700
at the Great Prince of the South Palace's backyard.

177
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,200
It was a hidden place.

178
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,800
I'm the only person who knows about the place.

179
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,300
Master, you can rest assured.

180
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Are you the only person who knows its location?

181
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,300
You're trying to protect yourself,

182
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,600
worrying that I might kill you.

183
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,900
Then...

184
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,600
If you rupture the tendons of my hands and my legs,

185
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,400
eradicate my ability in practicing martial arts,

186
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,800
and cut off my four limbs,

187
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,100
I'd rather die.

188
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Then, no one will ever know where the Holyword's Pot is.

189
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Brat.

190
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Are you bargaining with me?

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
I dare not.

192
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,600
But, Master,

193
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,800
my taking the pot... was for another reason.

194
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Tell me about it.

195
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,400
For the past few years, every sensible person knows

196
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,200
how omnipotent Master is.

197
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
The Holyword's Pot is nothing compared to Master's skills.

198
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,600
It's just like comparing a lamp to the bright moon.

199
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,000
They are never in the same league.

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Master, I think you're reluctant to let go of the pot

201
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,800
only because of nostalgia.

202
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,900
Am I right?

203
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,000
But those disciples have no idea about this.

204
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,600
They thought Master couldn't do without the pot.

205
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,400
They are so stupid.

206
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,900
They have no idea about Master's omnipotence.

207
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
You're right.

208
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,000
Go on.

209
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,300
In my opinion,

210
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,200
the Xingxiu Sect excels in martial arts.

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
We are the best martial artists in the world.

212
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
Yet, we have a magnanimous master,

213
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,500
who's unwilling to go to the Central Plains to teach those know-nothings a lesson.

214
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,400
That's why the Deaf-Mute Old Man and the Duan family of Dali

215
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,000
were able to make it big.

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Isn't it ridiculous?

217
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,400
So, I was thinking

218
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,300
that we should announce Master's omnipotence to all of them,

219
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,000
so they will know that there's a man way more powerful than them.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
However, if we only bring Master there as if it's an everyday matter,

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,600
it doesn't suit Master's reputation

222
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
as the best martial artist in the world.

223
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,300
Therefore, I brought the pot there

224
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,200
so that I could officially invite Master

225
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,000
to the Central Plains.

226
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,599
So, you're saying

227
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
that you stole the pot

228
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
only to fulfill your filial duty.

229
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
That's right.

230
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,900
Good.

231
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,000
Look at how glib-tongued you are,

232
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
it'd probably be a waste if I kill you.

233
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,100
Exactly.

234
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,800
But if we excuse you from the punishment...

235
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,000
- Yes. You'll be letting me off too lightly.
- Precisely.

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,800
But we all know how magnanimous Master is.

237
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,500
From now on, we will give our best

238
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
and selflessly dedicate our entire lives to the sect.

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
Brat.

240
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,600
You're too eloquent.

241
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
I like what you say.

242
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,800
But if I really believe your lies,

243
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,000
doesn't that make me an old fool?

244
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,600
Give me a table for one.

245
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,000
Brat, you're saying that

246
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,200
if I eradicate your ability in practicing martial arts

247
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,500
and rupture your tendons, you'll kill yourself right away

248
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,200
and not reveal the whereabouts of the item.

249
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Am I right?

250
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Master is a magnanimous man.

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,900
Don't take my untactful words to heart.

252
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,400
Mr. Ding is no longer young.

253
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,800
You shouldn't be upset by a kid's words.

254
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,700
Why don't we enjoy a drink

255
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,800
as we discuss martial arts?

256
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,100
Young Master Murong, it must be fate that brought us together.

257
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,300
Here. I'll drink first.

258
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,500
Young Master Murong, I have to propose a toast.

259
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,700
Master is so impressive!

260
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,100
Master has amazing skills.

261
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,700
With what you've got, you can't hurt me.

262
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm coming!

263
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,700
- Great Energy Dissolving Skill?
- Master obviously has the upper hand.

264
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,100
Yes!

265
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,300
Could this be the Galactic Shift?

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,700
No. Master is fighting with a guy named Murong Fu out there.

267
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,200
Why are you panicking?

268
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,400
Master holds the realm in awe.

269
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
How can the Murong guy beat him?

270
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,400
No. A few of the brothers

271
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
have already had their internal force drained.

272
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,300
What?

273
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,100
Let's go.

274
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,400
Old Freak Ding, don't you feel sorry for your disciples?

275
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
You should let go.

276
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,700
It doesn't matter even if all my unhelpful disciples die.

277
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,900
I can easily get another batch of boasters and bootlickers.

278
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,300
Master, you can finally show your great power to the people of the Central Plains.

279
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,400
You can finally show your great power!

280
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,300
My eyes. My eyes.

281
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,500
My eyes.

282
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,300
My eyes hurt.

283
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,600
Miss, take a seat.

284
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,000
Miss, how are your eyes?

285
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Do you feel better now?

286
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,300
My eyes hurt.

287
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
I'm blind. I've lost my sight.

288
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,300
Miss, don't panic.

289
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,400
- Perhaps, we can cure it.
- How is that possible?

290
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Old Freak of Xingxiu is very good with his poisons.

291
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,000
There's no way I can cure this.

292
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,200
- You're lying.
- Miss.

293
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
Miss, don't panic.

294
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I'll figure something out.

295
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Miss, I have an idea.

296
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,700
There's water over there. I'll get you some water.

297
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,800
You shall first rinse off the poison in your eye.

298
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,000
There must be a way to cure your eyes.

299
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,319
Miss, how do you feel?

300
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,520
I feel better.

301
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,900
Do you want to get up?

302
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,739
Miss, try to slowly open your eyes.

303
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,600
Let's see how it went.

304
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,599
I can't see.

305
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,159
Why can't I see anything?

306
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,839
I'm blind.

307
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,719
Miss!

308
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,860
Miss, don't be sad.

309
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,419
I won't leave you. I'll stay with you.

310
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:09,360
I will always be with you.

311
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,060
Who are you?

312
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,080
Miss, can't you recognize me?

313
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,860
You aren't even telling me your name.

314
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,820
Yet, you lied to me and said that you'd stay with me.

315
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,260
You're just a liar.

316
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,179
Miss, as long as you allow me to stay with you,

317
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,060
I'll never leave you.

318
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,040
I'll die a gruesome death if I ever leave you.

319
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,760
So, what's your name?

320
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,660
My name is Ju Xianzhuang.

321
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,519
No, I mean... My last name is Zhuang, and my name is Juxian.

322
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,180
So, you're Elder Zhuang.

323
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Elder Zhuang, thanks for saving my life.

324
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,379
Miss, you don't have to thank me.

325
00:24:57,379 --> 00:24:58,939
I'm no elder to you.

326
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,879
I'm only a few years older than you.

327
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,380
Then...

328
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,520
Then, I'll address you as Brother Zhuang.

329
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,519
Brother Zhuang, I have a favor to ask.

330
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,999
Miss, ask away.

331
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,820
I'll do anything just for you.

332
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,919
I want to go back to my brother-in-law's side.

333
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,300
My brother-in-law is at Nanjing of the Liao Kingdom.

334
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,180
Brother Zhuang, can you bring me there?

335
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,100
Why? Are you reluctant to help me?

336
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,059
I... I'm not reluctant.

337
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,459
But at the moment, I don't want to go to Nanjing of the Liao Kingdom.

338
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,239
But you just said that you

339
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,879
would fulfill all my requests

340
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,639
even if you have to die for it.

341
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,940
It seems like you were just lying.

342
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,700
- I'll go by myself.
- No, miss.

343
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,059
Miss!

344
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,639
How can you go by yourself? I'll go with you.

345
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,220
I'll go with you.

346
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,740
I'll go with you.

347
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,521
Miss, be careful. Beware of the rocks.

348
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,180
All right.

349
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,320
Miss, this way.

350
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,920
Stay put.

351
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,620
This way! Hurry up!

352
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,400
There's an ugly face sneaking around here.

353
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,280
What are you?

354
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,399
Branch Leader Quan, look at this guy here.

355
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,780
Look at what he's wearing. What does he want?

356
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,480
Stop talking.

357
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,540
No one is allowed to speak.

358
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,020
Brother Zhuang.

359
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,279
- Miss A'Zi.
- Brother Zhuang, what happened?

360
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,880
Who are they?

361
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,319
They are my friends from the Beggars' Sect.

362
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,579
He is Branch Leader Quan, the Head of the Dazhi Branch.

363
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:11,739
I've always admired his exceptional benevolence and righteousness.

364
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:15,059
I accidentally injured a few of your brothers, and am really sorry for what I've done.

365
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,939
Are there any good guys in the Beggars' Sect?

366
00:28:16,939 --> 00:28:18,699
Brother Zhuang, you're such a good martial artist.

367
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,059
Why don't you kill them all?

368
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:23,280
- We can also take revenge on them on behalf of my brother-in-law.
- No.

369
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,379
It was just a misunderstanding.

370
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:27,339
Branch Leader Quan is a good friend of mine.

371
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,819
Miss A'Zi, wait for me here.

372
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:31,539
I'll explain it to Branch Leader Quan.

373
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,340
You stay here.

374
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,059
Branch Leader Quan, thanks for helping me in keeping this a secret.

375
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,560
I'll never forget your great kindness.

376
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,660
I've completely no idea what's going on.

377
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,899
What is your name?

378
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,580
My surname is Zhuang, and I'm Zhuang Juxian.

379
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,019
Due to a mishap, my head got stuck in this nuisance.

380
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:02,579
But about my hideous appearance,

381
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:06,500
please keep this from the young lady.

382
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,140
I see.

383
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:12,440
But how did you know my name?

384
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,200
I've run into Branch Leader Quan before.

385
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,379
I am sorry to have accidentally hurt your brothers.

386
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:21,400
I hope that Branch Leader Quan can forgive me.

387
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,020
It's just a misunderstanding. Never mind it.

388
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,399
But you're traveling with this young lady.

389
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,340
If you run into someone else during your journey,

390
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,379
they would definitely cry out in surprise.

391
00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:38,979
I'm afraid it'd be too late even if Brother Zhuang kills them all.

392
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,539
In the future, if Brother Zhuang marries this young lady,

393
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:49,160
she will find out about it sooner or later.

394
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,900
Marry her?

395
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,620
No. I don't even have the audacity to imagine marrying her.

396
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,220
I don't deserve this lady at all.

397
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Brother Zhuang, thanks to your kindness,

398
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,240
we can be friends.

399
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,640
What about this? Here.

400
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,039
We will go to the town

401
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,119
and hire a sedan.

402
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,479
Then, you can stay inside the sedan with the young lady,

403
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,940
and no one will see you.

404
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,799
And then, we will try and figure out

405
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,399
how to remove that iron hat.

406
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,400
What do you think?

407
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,139
Yes.

408
00:30:29,139 --> 00:30:31,960
Brother Quan, that's a good idea.

409
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,200
Please accept my gratitude.

410
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,899
There's no need for thanks.

411
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,619
Brother Zhuang, if you don't mind,

412
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:43,440
what do you think about us being sworn brothers?

413
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,500
Wonderful. That would be wonderful.

414
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,259
I have limited knowledge.

415
00:30:50,259 --> 00:30:53,759
To have a wise and resourceful brother guiding me,

416
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,240
I couldn't ask for better.

417
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,199
I'm only a few years older than you.

418
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,580
So, from now on, I'll address you as my brother.

419
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,460
Brother Quan.

420
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,720
Young Master.

421
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,079
We are martial artists and we don't mind traveling all night.

422
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:28,679
But Miss Wang is a delicate girl.

423
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,380
Shouldn't we take a break?

424
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,980
Young Master, there's a residence here.

425
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,699
It looks like a residence of a hunter or a farmer.

426
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:46,239
But I think we can find Miss Wang a place to stay there.

427
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,080
Let's go.

428
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,999
- Miss Wang.
- This way.

429
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Here.

430
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,520
It doesn't look like it's far away, but it's taking us longer than expected.

431
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,900
Young Master, there's something fishy going on.

432
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,560
Who's there trying to scare us?

433
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,339
Martial Brother, Miss Wang is here. Don't cause unnecessary trouble.

434
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:27,439
Who's interrupting the Assembly of Demi-gods?

435
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:32,359
Are you disrespecting the 36 Cave Masters and the 72 Island Owners?

436
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,899
My five friends and I were rushing somewhere.

437
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,619
We had no idea that you were gathering here.

438
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:39,280
I apologize if we have upset you.

439
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,059
We made a mistake in the dark.

440
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,899
I hope you can laugh it off.

441
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,880
Besides, I also hope that you can make way for us.

442
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,339
How can you come and go as you like?

443
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:54,019
Are you trying to humiliate the 36 caves and the 72 islands?

444
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,399
I was being respectful because you are my seniors.

445
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,800
I was trying peaceful means before resorting to violence.

446
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,719
I, Murong Fu, am not afraid of you.

447
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,619
You're from the Murong Clan who practices "fight fire with fire"?

448
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm flattered.

449
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,439
Yes, I am.

450
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,080
The Murong Clan is not one to be trifled with.

451
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,360
Light the lanterns.

452
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,179
I am Murong Fu.

453
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,420
I send you my greetings.

454
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:45,539
Murong Fu, you claim to have mastered the "fight fire with fire" technique.

455
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,839
Now, let me ask you.

456
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,939
If you're to apply that technique on me,

457
00:34:49,939 --> 00:34:51,600
how would you do it?

458
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,000
Senior, you're sitting there motionlessly.

459
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,979
I know neither which sect you're from, nor your name.

460
00:34:57,979 --> 00:34:59,539
I don't know what skill you're best at is, either.

461
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:01,640
How am I going to mirror it?

462
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,159
How dare unfledged boys like you

463
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:10,099
go by Qiao Feng of the North and Murong of the South?

464
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,320
That's ridiculous!

465
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,979
You know what? It won't be difficult for you to escape here.

466
00:35:17,979 --> 00:35:24,859
You only have to do ten kowtows to each of the 36 Cave Masters and the 72 Island Owners.

467
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:28,619
A total of 1080 kowtows.

468
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:32,380
Then, we'll let all the six of you go.

469
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,739
You wanted our young master to apply the "fight fire with fire" technique to you.

470
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:44,859
It turns out that you want him to mirror your kowtowing skill.

471
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:46,739
You have a real shameless skill.

472
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:49,920
Of course, our young master won't be able to do it.

473
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,859
You're driving us into a corner.

474
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,019
Then, you can't blame the Murong Clan for being ruthless.

475
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:06,199
In for a penny, in for a pound.

476
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,520
We'll blitz these monsters' dens.

477
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,099
Brother Murong, he is Lord Sang Tu from the Biling Cave in Chuanxi.

478
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,780
His Burrowing Technique is extremely insidious.

479
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,519
There are still people in this world who are practicing this grave-digging skill.

480
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,500
Jerk, don't disturb Miss Wang.

481
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,719
Murong, if you don't surrender now,

482
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,439
I'll kill your lover.

483
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:57,019
You can't defeat me,

484
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,939
so you hold someone else hostage.

485
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,639
You're truly a shameless man.

486
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,899
The Murong Clan has been in the martial arts world for tens of years.

487
00:40:03,899 --> 00:40:05,299
We are never one to surrender.

488
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:07,280
You should think twice about it.

489
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,960
This is such a pity.

490
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,140
A lady who's as pretty as a flower is going to lose her head soon.

491
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,580
I will surrender to you.

492
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,900
It's just surrendering.

493
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,839
For Miss Wang, I can surrender 1,000 times or even 10,000 times.

494
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:44,740
I have surrendered.

495
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,399
Why are you still holding her?

496
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,999
Let her go.

497
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,600
Young Master Duan.

498
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,560
Miss Wang, it's me.

499
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,900
What are you?

500
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,159
Why is this forest monk being so rude?

501
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,339
I'm a person.

502
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:03,660
How could you ask me what I am?

503
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,679
Murong, are you going to surrender?

504
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,539
If you don't surrender, I'll kill this girl.

505
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,919
Dirty forest monk, you'll never have me surrendering to you.

506
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,239
If you dare harm this girl,

507
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,540
I'll make sure to cut you into pieces.

508
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,199
I never fear blackmail.

509
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,340
I'll kill her now.

510
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,880
Miss Wang, let's go.

511
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,820
Hurry up.

512
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,820
We should escape here before anything.

513
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:48,060
[Elder Wu, One of the 72 Island Owners]
Let me take down Murong Fu first.

514
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,499
Young Master Duan, someone sealed my acupoint.

515
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:09,799
I can't stand on my own.

516
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,659
Okay. Teach me how to unseal this.

517
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:13,600
I'll unseal the acupoint.

518
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,000
There's no need for that. In a while, the acupoint will unseal by itself.

519
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,479
You don't need to do it for me.

520
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,759
I can't do that. It's too dangerous to stay here.

521
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,499
Let's unseal your acupoint first,

522
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,779
and we'll figure out how to escape this place.

523
00:42:25,779 --> 00:42:27,180
No.

524
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,739
Cousin is being surrounded.

525
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:31,520
We need to find a way to save him first.

526
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,699
All right. If that's what you want, I'll go save your cousin first.

527
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:38,260
No.

528
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,579
You don't know martial arts.

529
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:41,459
How can you save him?

530
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:44,040
Didn't I tell you to read it out?

531
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,580
We were lucky.

532
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:50,579
You worried about me, and you were able to perform the Six Pulse Excalibur.

533
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:52,499
If you were saving Cousin,

534

the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

552
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,950
