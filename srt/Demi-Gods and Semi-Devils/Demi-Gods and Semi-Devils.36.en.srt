13
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,199
Amitabha.

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,479
They are already dead.

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,759
Amitabha.

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,460
Stop pretending to be merciful.

17
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,939
- Amitabha.
- Come.

18
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:50,359
- Amitabha.
- Kill me, too.

19
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,460
Don't come close.

20
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,560
Don't touch me!

21
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,100
Mister Wu,

22
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,200
I must not kill again.

23
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,540
As I reacted just now,

24
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,720
I killed three people simultaneously.

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,620
I have broken our Buddhist precepts to abstain from killing living beings.

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,460
I've become a sinful person.

27
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,299
I really don't know what to do now.

28
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:09,600
Mister Wu, you are experienced and knowledgeable.

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,239
Can you tell me what to do?

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,600
You're asking me what to do?

31
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,920
Mister Wu,

32
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,919
your stomach is injured. Right?

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,300
Does it hurt?

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,740
I'm truly sorry.

35
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,060
I didn't expect

36
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,800
that a pine cone could be so dangerous.

37
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Mister Wu, do you think this pine cone

38
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,419
is unusual or different?

39
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,800
You...

40
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,360
You...

41
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,220
Put it down.

42
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,199
How is this pine cone different?

43
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,379
After killing people, there's no need to be sarcastic.

44
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,960
Since you have mastered the Divine Art of the Northern Darkness,

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,180
my skill is inferior to yours.

46
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,500
I have no regret even if you kill me!

47
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,060
Divine Art of the Northern Darkness? What is that?

48
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,200
Things have really worked in your favor today, Little Monk.

49
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,340
The Divine Art of the Northern Darkness has never been taught to outsiders.

50
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:52,519
But you are sincere and willing to die for me.

51
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,099
You have met my requirements to pass on the skills.

52
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:58,999
Not to mention it was at the time of crisis that I needed your help.

53
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,900
You had to do it.

54
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,159
Elder Wu, you have good eyes.

55
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:08,820
You actually knew the name of the little monk's martial arts.

56
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,720
Who are you?

57
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,599
If you are mute, how could you speak?

58
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,940
You don't deserve to ask who I am!

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,079
Little Monk, let him take these to save his life.

60
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,279
Mister Wu, take these.

61
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,460
These can save your life.

62
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,900
This is Nine Revolutions Bear Snake Pill?

63
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,039
Yes. You do know a lot.

64
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,299
You can be regarded as an outstanding person of 72 Island.

65
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:51,159
This Nine Revolutions Bear Snake Pill

66
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,059
is specially used to treat incised wounds and revive lives.

67
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,719
It's extremely effective.

68
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,159
Firstly, you did a great favor for me,

69
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,099
so I need to give you some benefits.

70
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:04,600
Secondly, you still have a use for me in the future.

71
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,900
How can I even help you?

72
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,499
I have been trying to kill you.

73
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,159
I harbor malicious intent towards you.

74
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,739
You are pretty straightforward.

75
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,180
You are indeed a man.

76
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,759
Little Monk, I need to practice more martial arts techniques.

77
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,880
Stay beside me and protect me.

78
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,980
If anyone comes to disturb me,

79
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,640
just use Divine Art of the Northern Darkness I taught you.

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,799
You can grab some silt or stones, and throw them at them.

81
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,880
What if I kill someone again?

82
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,180
I don't want to do it.

83
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,059
No one will be coming now.

84
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:51,160
Don't do it then.

85
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,780
This is the Six Paths of the Eight Desolation!

86
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,299
Are you saying you have lost trace of A'Zi?

87
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:20,719
Yes. In the scout's letter, after they lost her,

88
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,899
they searched around for several days,

89
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:24,459
but they couldn't find the princess.

90
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:29,139
Perhaps, Her Highness is traveling with someone.

91
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,019
All right, I will go find her myself.

92
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,779
- Prepare the horse.
- Yes, Your Highness.

93
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:36,040
Your Highness, you must not.

94
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,759
His Majesty has issued an emergency military order

95
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,859
for Your Highness to lead the troops

96
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,959
to the Song-Liao border to put pressure on Great Song.

97
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,139
Your Highness must not leave the mansion and be distracted by other matters.

98
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,319
I've sent some men to find the princess.

99
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,259
They will definitely keep the princess safe.

100
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,800
Liao and Song have signed a peace treaty.

101
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,699
There may be some disputes, but we still send envoys to each other

102
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:11,080
to show goodwill between two nations.

103
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,160
Why does His Majesty suddenly want me to invade the border of the Song Dynasty

104
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,699
and disrupt this stability?

105
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,859
There is something that Your Highness does not know.

106
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,339
Autumn is ending soon.

107
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:26,159
Every year around this time,

108
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,019
the army will stir up chaos at the border of Great Song.

109
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:34,019
Firstly, to trash around, looting provisions and laborers to replenish military supplies.

110
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:37,499
Secondly, to put pressure on Song

111
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:41,539
to make them promise to increase their tributes

112
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:44,058
for our unexpected needs.

113
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,819
Us Liao people herd cattle for a living.

114
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,739
It is hard to get through the winter.

115
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:50,739
If we do not have to kill or rob,

116
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,859
we are reluctant to go there.

117
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,459
It just can't help that Song has a vast territory

118
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,659
with an abundance of money and food

119
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:01,339
while we have to live in this bitter cold place.

120
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,699
We have no harvest during winter.

121
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:05,219
If we do not rob Song,

122
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:09,300
how are the people of Liao going to survive?

123
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,100
Moreover, the South Court army has not been going to battle for quite a while

124
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,640
and has been the subject of ridicule.

125
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,619
You have no idea how many times Yi Yekun and the rest

126
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,400
have impeached Your Highness in front of His Majesty.

127
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,999
But they were overruled by His Majesty.

128
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,140
His Majesty appointed Your Highness to go to war

129
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,799
is to let Your Highness take a stand and establish your great dignity.

130
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,379
Your Highness can disregard what others think of you,

131
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,780
but you have to be considerate of His Majesty

132
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,980
and not make it difficult for him.

133
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,860
In that case, deliver my order.

134
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,999
- Order the battalions to prepare the provisions and dispatch the military forces.
- Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:11,540
One more thing, this expedition is to create fear.

136
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,959
Without my command, do not harm the commoners.

137
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,720
I shall obey your command.

138
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
I am hungry.

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
I am going to find some food.

140
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,300
Go then.

141
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,700
You must come with me.

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,500
But I am wounded.

143
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,400
You plotted against her.

144
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,100
I'm worried if I am not here, you will harm her.

145
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
His Mortality Talisman is in my grasp.

146
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000
If he behaves recklessly...

147
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,000
You...

148
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,599
What did you say?

149
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,100
Do you still remember how many medicinal pills you have taken?

150
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,799
Two.

151
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,600
The Nine Revolutions Bear Snake Pill of Lingjiu Palace is extremely effective.

152
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
You do not need to take two of them.

153
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Moreover, someone who is worse than an animal like you

154
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,200
does not deserve to consume two of my miracle pills.

155
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
Then what was the other one?

156
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,000
How is your Shanzhong Point?

157
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,400
Who on earth are you?

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
How did you know the location of my Mortality Talisman?

159
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,600
You fed me the Tendon Tearing Bone Corrosion Pill.

160
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,700
I still have some tasks for you.

161
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,600
I will not hasten the effects of the pill right away.

162
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,600
So no need to be so alarmed.

163
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,600
What... What exactly is Tendon Tearing Bone Corrosion Pill?

164
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,500
Is it poison?

165
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,800
Why... Why did you feed him poison?

166
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
You...

167
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,400
You...

168
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
You stinky monk!

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
You darn monk!

170
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I curse that you will die without any descendants!

171
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,900
Mister Wu, I am a monk to begin with.

172
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,200
I will definitely die without any descendants.

173
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Well...

174
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,700
Fine!

175
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,800
Then you will take this Tendon Tearing Bone Corrosion Pill!

176
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,700
You will live for 99 days and not die!

177
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,000
So you will get a taste of this, too!

178
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,200
What...

179
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,500
What exactly is Tendon Tearing Bone Corrosion Pill?

180
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,400
Why do you curse me so viciously?

181
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
After consuming this pill,

182
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,100
it will start from tearing the soft tendons,

183
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,000
but it is not fatal.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,600
After a while, the tongue and mouth won't be able to move.

185
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
After that...

186
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
After that...

187
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Mister Wu. Mister Wu.

188
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,800
Mister Wu, what are you doing?

189
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
He wants to kill himself by smashing himself against the tree.

190
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,400
Mister Wu.

191
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Mister Wu, stop it.

192
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,800
As long as you obey me,

193
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,400
I won't hasten the effect.

194
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,800
The poison of the pill won't take effect in ten years.

195
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,600
Why do you have to be this scared?

196
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,000
Little Monk, seal his acupuncture points,

197
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,800
lest he goes out of his mind.

198
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,300
All right.

199
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,700
Don't seal the wrong one.

200
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,400
We will wait for him here.

201
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,400
It's almost noon.

202
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Mister Wu.

203
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,900
Just now, it was not easy to find a sika deer and drained its blood.

204
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,400
Mister Wu, it is very cruel for you to do this.

205
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,300
I won't do it next time.

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,000
Elder Wu, you have done well.

207
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Tomorrow at noon, bring me blood nevertheless.

208
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,400
Yes.

209
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,200
Mister Wu! Didn't you say you wouldn't do it again?

210
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, I did.

211
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,500
Madam, I can see that Mister Wu serves you with all his heart.

212
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,700
I suppose he does not harbor bad intentions towards you anymore.

213
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,600
In that case, I will take my leave now.

214
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Stand right there! Where are you going?

215
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,000
Stop right there!

216
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,500
Madam, I really have to find Martial Uncles

217
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,600
to report back to Shaolin Temple and wait for instruction.

218
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,800
It really cannot be delayed anymore.

219
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,200
Are you going to abandon me then?

220
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,400
Then just stay here and find a place to hide.

221
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,200
That way, they won't be able to find you.

222
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,000
They will withdraw after eight to ten days.

223
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,100
After eight to ten days,

224
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,300
I would have recovered my power when I was 18 or 19 years old.

225
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,000
They won't be able to stop me anymore.

226
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,400
What?

227
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Take a closer look at my appearance now

228
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,600
and look to see how it is different from two days ago.

229
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,800
There is no difference.

230
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,959
Just a little silly.

231
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Stinky monk!

232
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,600
There is a difference.

233
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,900
Elder Wu, can you see what the difference is?

234
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,200
You seemed to be growing older.

235
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,600
You have good eyes.

236
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,700
Then can you see that I am Tianshan Tonglao?

237
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,100
[Tianshan Tonglao]
[Leader of the Lingjiu Palace]

238
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,800
Tianshan Tonglao?

239
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,300
You're Tianshan Tonglao? You're Tianshan Tonglao!

240
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,600
Tian... Tianshan Tonglao.

241
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,800
When I was in your hands, you did not kill me.

242
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,000
You are regretting it now, right?

243
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,100
Yes.

244
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,700
I have been to Piaomiao Peak three times and heard you speak.

245
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,600
But I was blindfolded,

246
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,600
I failed to recognize you!

247
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
I thought...

248
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,200
I thought you were just a dumb girl.

249
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,600
You are not the only one who has heard me speak.

250
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,100
Many among the evildoers of 36 Caves and 72 Islands have heard me speak.

251
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,200
I was captured by all of you.

252
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
If I did not pretend to be dumb,

253
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,400
all of you might have recognized my voice.

254
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,300
Your martial arts skills are extraordinary. You would never kill in a different way.

255
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,700
Why did you not resist when I captured you then?

256
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,400
I did say I'm thankful for your help.

257
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,500
That's why.

258
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,800
A strong enemy came that day.

259
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,300
I was not feeling well to defend myself.

260
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,200
Coincidentally, you put me in a sack and left the peak,

261
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,600
and I managed to escape from misfortune.

262
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Shouldn't I thank you for it?

263
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,800
But after you captured me,

264
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,900
you accused me of pretending to be mute

265
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,600
and treated me with so much disrespect.

266
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
It's the most heinous crime!

267
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,300
Had it not been for that, I could have spared your life.

268
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,200
Madam! They always say ignorance can be forgiven.

269
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,100
If I knew it was you at that time,

270
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,400
whom I have deep respect for,

271
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,600
even if I'm that bold,

272
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,800
I would not dare to offend you.

273
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,399
It may be out of fear, you do not necessarily respect me.

274
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,600
You gathered all martial artists of the 36 Caves and 72 Islands

275
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,200
to rebel against me.

276
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
What do you have to say about that?

277
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,900
Madam, spare me!

278
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,800
Madam, spare me!

279
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,600
I deserve to die.

280
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:13,200
So, you are the infamous Tianshan Tonglao with ingenious martial arts skills.

281
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,300
I have failed to recognize such a great person like you.

282
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,500
I will take my leave now.

283
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
Stand right there. Where are you doing?

284
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
Madam, I only wanted to save

285
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,400
a helpless young girl.

286
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,000
I did not expect you to be Tianshan Tonglao.

287
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,400
I was even forced to kill.

288
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,600
For these past few days, I have done too many foolish things.

289
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
I am going back to the temple

290
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,800
to correct my ways and start afresh.

291
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,900
Wait. Stop right there.

292
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,800
I have something to say.

293
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:08,800
Little Monk, you indeed saved my life for the past three days.

294
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
You did not do anything foolish.

295
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,500
I have never thanked anyone in my life,

296
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,600
but you saved my life.

297
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
I will repay your kindness in the future.

298
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,900
I have such low capability. How can I even save you?

299
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,600
If I say you saved my life,

300
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,300
it means you saved my life.

301
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,700
The martial arts technique I am practicing is called Six Paths of the Eight Desolation.

302
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,900
This tenchique is extremely powerful,

303
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,400
but it has one big disadvantage.

304
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,700
Every 30 years, I will become young again.

305
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Become young?

306
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,200
Isn't that a good thing?

307
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,000
I started practicing this technique when I was six years old.

308
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,200
I became young at the age of 36.

309
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,400
It took 30 days to recover my power.

310
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,900
At age 66, I became young again.

311
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,200
That took me 60 days to recover.

312
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,800
I am 96 years old this year

313
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,300
and became young again.

314
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,300
That will mean it will take 90 days to recover my skills.

315
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,000
You are 96 years old this year?

316
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,600
- But...
- Yes.

317
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,600
This Six Paths of the Eight Desolation

318
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,000
is actually an incomparable, magical internal martial arts skill.

319
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,200
It is just that I practiced too early.

320
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
I mastered it after a few years.

321
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
The power of this internal skill then appeared.

322
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,800
That is why I always look like a young girl.

323
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,600
I see.

324
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,000
Then, what happens after you become young?

325
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,700
I will lose all my power when I become young.

326
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,400
After cultivating for one day, my power recovers to when I was seven years old.

327
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,600
The second day will recover to when I was eight years old.

328
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,600
The third day will be when I was nine years old.

329
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,900
Each day of cultivation is equivalent to one year.

330
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,100
I must consume blood at noon every day

331
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,300
in order to practice.

332
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,500
In my life, I have one enemy

333
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,800
who knows the details of my martial art technique.

334
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,200
She counted the days when I became young

335
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
and came here to harm me.

336
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Madam, since it is hard to deal with that enemy,

337
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,200
why don't you leave the peak

338
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,100
and find a place to hide for a period of time?

339
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,600
All of us will stay and stop her for you.

340
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Outrageous!

341
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,800
I never like to show my weakness!

342
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,100
How could I flee and allow this wretched woman to behave arrogantly?

343
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
She may be skilled,

344
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,400
but the terrain of Lingjiu Palace is dangerous and not easy to invade.

345
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,200
All of you better stay alert during these days.

346
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,700
Strengthen the defense and set up the traps' mechanisms,

347
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,200
so she will know that Lingjiu Palace is not so easy to break into.

348
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes!

349
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Listen up!

350
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
Guard this place heavily!

351
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,600
We must keep the enemies outside Piaomiao Peak!

352
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,500
Yes!

353
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,100
Martial Sister, you underestimate me too much.

354
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,700
Do you think these incompetents can stop me?

355
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,400
Tell me. Where is my Martial Sister?

356
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,600
Her whereabouts are unknown, so I do not know.

357
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,300
You are pretty stubborn.

358
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,800
Looks like the slaves Martial Sister raises are pretty loyal.

359
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,700
Lingjiu Palace's perimeter is only this big.

360
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,500
Martial Sister, where could you be hiding?

361
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,600
When Elder Wu captured me,

362
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,300
I only had the power like I was nine years old.

363
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,500
So I could only let him carry me down the mountain.

364
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:49,200
Becoming young is just like a snake shedding its skin.

365
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,200
As it sheds its skin, it grows a little.

366
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,600
But if it is caught while it is still shedding,

367
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
it will be very dangerous.

368
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,300
If I delay a day or two of not drinking any blood,

369
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,800
my true qi within my body will burst out.

370
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,500
I will be dead alas.

371
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:15,000
So now, you have recovered your power like you were 11 years old.

372
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,800
For you to recover all 96 years of power,

373
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,700
you still need 85 more days.

374
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,399
That also means

375
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,900
you will kill another 85 sika deers, antelopes, or even rabbits.

376
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,600
You are smart for making inferences from one thing.

377
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,000
It will be dangerous for the next 85 days.

378
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
My power has not been completely restored.

379
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,700
If my enemy finds out where I am, she will come and harm me.

380
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,300
I cannot do this alone,

381
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,900
so I need you to protect me.

382
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,300
Me?

383
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,700
Madam, your martial arts is so profound.

384
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,400
Someone you cannot even defeat,

385
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,300
what can I even do to her?

386
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,400
Your martial arts may be low,

387
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,500
but you possessed Wu Yazi's internal cultivation.

388
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,900
As long you know how to put it to use,

389
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,900
you can deal with my enemy for a while.

390
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,300
I will pass on our fine martial arts to you,

391
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,800
so you can protect me from my enemy.

392
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,000
Madam, do not say it anymore.

393
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,600
Your martial arts is great and invincible,

394
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,600
but I'm a monk of Shaolin Temple.

395
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,500
I cannot switch to other factions,

396
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,600
let alone learn other sects' martial arts.

397
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,300
Your Shaolin Temple's martial arts technique has been exhausted by Wu Yazi.

398
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,200
So forget about being a Shaolin Temple's disciple.

399
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,300
Then... Then I can return to Shaolin Temple and train from the beginning.

400
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,600
You think we're heretics, so you refuse to learn my martial arts, am I right?

401
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Senior, I am sorry for offending you.

402
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,000
Elder Wu!

403
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,700
Yes, Madam.

404
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
Go and catch two sika deers and slaughter them right away!

405
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,100
Yes, Madam.

406
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,800
Come back!

407
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,800
You have already drunk blood today.

408
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,300
- Why do you still...
- You forced me!

409
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,600
When did I force you?

410
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
You are forcing me by not helping me!

411
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,200
Those little creatures are so pitiful!

412
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,900
Why do you have to kill them?

413
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,800
I can't even protect my own life.

414
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,000
Who is going to pity me?

415
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Elder Wu, what are you waiting for?

416
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Come back!

417
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
Go!

418
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,000
- Come back!
- Go!

419
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,300
- Come back!
- Go!

420
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,000
Madam!

421
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,000
Fine.

422
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,400
As long as you stop killing the innocent,

423
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,800
I am willing to stay.

424
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,900
Elder Wu, this little monk doesn't like people who kill living creatures.

425
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,600
From today onward, you are not allowed to eat meat, either.

426
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,300
You can only be a vegetarian.

427
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,000
If you consume venison of a sika deer or antelope,

428
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,400
I will kill you to avenge them.

429
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
Yes, Madam!

430
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Get up now.

431
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
The foot of the mountain ahead looks safe.

432
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,400
Let's take a rest there.

433
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,000
These two always go against each other

434
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
and give me a hard time.

435
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
This... What exactly is going on?

436
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,700
Your Highness, as you have ordered,

437
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,200
the army has camped here.

438
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,400
Every high-ranking military officer is in position; ready to go battle anytime.

439
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,200
Your Highness, Yanmen Pass is only 5 km from here.

440
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,800
Why are we not attacking them in one go?

441
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,600
Send my orders.

442
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
Build a fire and prepare the meals.

443
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,700
Your Highness.

444
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,000
Go send my orders.

445
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes, Your Highness.

446
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,500
Pass my decree.

447
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,200
I name Xiao Feng as Prince of Chu

448
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
and he shall reside at Southern Court

449
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,800
with command over troops and horses.

450
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,000
He shall return to Shangjing

451
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,700
and assist me in unifying Central Plains in the future!

452
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,000
You must remember.

453
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,200
No matter what you face,

454
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,400
you are still a Song person.

455
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,600
No matter what happens,

456
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,800
you must protect the land of Song.

457
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,000
At any given time,

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,600
you must prioritize Song.

459
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,300
Things are the same, but people have changed.

460
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

461
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
What is the meaning of this?

462
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,400
We led the troops out to battle without authorization.

463
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,600
Please punish us!

464
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,200
When did you lead the troops?

465
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,300
Your Highness, between 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. last night.

466
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,600
How are our casualties?

467
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,200
Thanks to Your Highness' blessings, our army suffered a few casualties.

468
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,000
Not only the Song Army was unprepared,

469
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,500
but we also captured several surrounding cities and reaped great returns.

470
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,600
The Song Army thought we were going to attack Yanmen Pass,

471
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,400
but we did not act as they had expected.

472
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,800
It is often said in Han Chinese books about creating a diversion.

473
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
We first dispatch some troops to stir trouble in surrounding towns.

474
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,900
As they came to the rescue, we took the chance to ambush them.

475
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,600
This was a well-fought battle!

476
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,500
Precisely!

477
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,200
Your Highness let the army 5 km away from Yanmen Pass

478
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,300
pretending to be scared of fighting, which led the Song Army to let down their guards.

479
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,000
After this battle, the soldiers were filled with joy

480
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,400
saying Your Highness was intelligent and invincible.

481
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,100
By the way, we have brought something back for Your Highness.

482
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,800
Bring it over!

483
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,000
Sir, Chief Qiao has arrived.

484
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,800
General Han.

485
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,700
Chief Qiao, you're finally here.

486
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
The news of the victory was sent back to Liao.

487
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,600
- Let's see who dares to speak ill of His Highness!
- Precisely!

488
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,800
Exactly, no one will dare to...

489
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,200
Our expedition this time is to create fear.

490
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,600
You have already reached your goal.

491
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,700
There was no need for more soldiers to die unnecessarily.

492
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,600
Send my order.

493
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,100
All stationed army to call a truce.

494
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,000
Send a memorial to His Majesty

495
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,200
to withdraw the troops and return to the capital immediately.

496
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,300
Yes, Your Highness.

497
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,400
The Han and the Khitan could be both fake and real.

498
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,700
Gratitude and resentment will all eventually turn into ashes.

499
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,600
Actually, be it the Han or Khitans,

500
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,200
there is no difference at all.

501
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,600
The days of bloodshed in this world

502
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,200
must be something you are sick of.

503
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,300
Why don't we go outside Yanmen Pass to live a life of hunting and herding cattle

504
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,500
and forget all the resentment in this world.

505
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,100
A'Zhu,

506
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,700
if only you were still here.

507
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,200
Do you know I only wanted to live a carefree life

508
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,000
of riding horses and herding cattle with you.

509
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,600
But a world this vast...

510
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,800
has no place for me to settle down.

511
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,200
[Dazhi Branch]

512
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,600
You two go and take care of this matter.

513
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,100
Yes.

514
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,700
Brother.

515
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,700
Brother, I want to see you.

516
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,400
I am looking for you too, Brother Zhuang.

517
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,400
When we are outside traveling, most of us will rest at the sect's branch.

518
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,400
The place is indeed a little simple. Are you used to staying here?

519
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,100
Yes, I am very used to it.

520
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,200
The brothers at Beggar's Sect are worried that Miss A'Zi and I do not feel warm enough.

521
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,700
They especially sent bedding over.

522
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,500
Perhaps my appearance looks frightening

523
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,800
that they do not dare to approach me.

524
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,300
That is because they respect you.

525
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,000
We from the Beggar's Sect never judge one's appearance and origin.

526
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
We will only respect those who are good at martial arts and responsible.

527
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,600
I think you have excellent martial arts.

528
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,100
Why don't you join the Beggar's Sect?

529
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,700
We can travel together. That way, we can watch each other's back.

530
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,400
Won't that be better?

531
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,800
Brother, are you serious?

532
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,100
Of course.

533
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,800
My brothers cannot stop complimenting you.

534
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,000
They also want to learn martial arts from you.

535
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,200
But I promised Miss A'Zi to send her back to Liao.

536
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,200
Just now, I wanted to ask if you could lend us a carriage

537
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,400
to be on our way.

538
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,700
Are you sending for a famous physician

539
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,800
to help Miss A'Zi to cure her eyes?

540
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,400
You can really tell.

541
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,300
Miss A'Zi has family in the Liao Kingdom who has great influence

542
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,400
unlike me who has nothing.

543
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,200
If I send Miss A'Zi back,

544
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,600
the chances will be higher to treat her eyes.

545
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Brother, I will be frank with you.

546
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,800
Brother, please tell.

547
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,400
You have a deep affection towards Miss A'Zi.

548
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,200
I know about this.

549
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,000
But if Miss A'Zi sees you like this,

550
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,600
will she still trust you

551
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,400
and rely on you like now?

552
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,600
You look different from ordinary people.

553
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,500
With Miss A'Zi not being able to see, that is a god-given opportunity.

554
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,200
Other than returning to Liao,

555
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,000
why don't you stay with Beggar's Sect and be close to her every day?

556
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,200
In time, you may even win her heart.

557
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Really?

558
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Of course.

559
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,600
But Miss A'Zi begged me to send her back to Liao.

560
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,100
If I hide this from her,

561
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,500
I...

562
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,800
You take care of her with all your heart.

563
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
How is it hiding it from her?

564
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,400
There are conflicts at the Song-Liao border now.

565
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,200
You can use this excuse to persuade her to postpone going north.

566
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,400
I will find a famous physician here to treat her eyes.

567
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,300
When the time comes, you will be spending time with her.

568
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,500
When you take this thing off your head

569
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,400
and help Miss A'Zi to see things again,

570
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,400
won't that benefit two parties?

571
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Only you can be this thorough.

572
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Brother, you taking me into the Beggar's Sect

573
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,200
and always being considerate of me.

574
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,300
This kind of kindness is hard for me to repay even if I die.

575
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,200
Brother, since you have decided to join the Beggar's Sect,

576
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
you are now my life and death brother.

577
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
The beggars' sect regards disciples of the same sect as family.

578
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,200
So don't be so courteous.

579
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,600
If you do not mind,

580
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,500
I can arrange for you to join the sect now.

581
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,000
Just stay at our branch for now. What do you think?

582
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,300
I will do as you say.

583
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,100
Who is there?

584
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,200
Return my shoes to me!

585
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,400
Miss A'Zi, it is me.

586
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,700
Brother Zhuang! Have you prepared the carriage?

587
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,200
We can leave now, right?

588
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Miss A'Zi, take a seat first.

589
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,200
Let me help you put on your shoe.

590
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,600
Miss A'Zi, it is like this.

591
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,900
Actually, for the past few days, I planned to take you away from here,

592
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,200
but there is a war between Song and Liao and you cannot see.

593
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,100
If we go back now, I am worried it will be dangerous.

594
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,400
Besides, there are many famous physicians in Song Dynasty.

595
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,000
Brother Quan is looking for a physician to treat you.

596
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,000
When you can see again, the war will be over.

597
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,400
Only then will we go back looking for your brother-in-law.

598
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,000
Isn't it much better than taking the risk now?

599
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
Never mind then.

600
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,900
Thank you, Brother Zhuang.

601
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,900
But can Brother Quan be trusted?

602
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,200
Can my eyes be cured?

603
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,400
Of course. Miss A'Zi, as long as I am here,

604
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,200
I will make sure you can see things again.

605
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,900
When I can see, I can return to Liao Kingdom and find my brother-in-law.

606
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,000
Brother Zhuang, my brother-in-law is really a capable person.

607
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,400
When that time comes, I will definitely tell him

608
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,200
that it is all thanks to you that I can return to his side,

609
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,500
and make him reward you handsomely!

610
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,200
Okay.

611
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,800
I'm a Buddhist monk,

612
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,600
but I am being forced to stay and learn Tonglao's martial art technique.

613
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:12,199
In order not to let her kill living creatures again,

614
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,800
I can only endure it for now.

615
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,200
Mister Wu.

616
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,200
Look at this.

617
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,300
Madam, do the new clothes fit you?

618
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,800
Not bad. Just right.

619
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
We have stayed here for a long time.

620
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,700
It is about time for those evildoers to find us.

621
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,900
Little Monk, carry me to the peak of this mountain.

622
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,500
Bring Elder Wu along, lest he reports on me.

623
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,000
All right.

This is better.

In the future, I will definitely help you a lot!
