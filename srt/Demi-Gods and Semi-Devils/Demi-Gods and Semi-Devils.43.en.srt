[The Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils]

13
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,933
[Episode 43]

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,000
Dragon Capturing Skill?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,920
Old Thief Ding is so far from the young lady.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,439
How did he capture the young lady with just one move?

17
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,460
His skills are really...

18
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,960
No.

19
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,000
He's holding a hidden weapon.

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,680
Stop!

21
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,620
No!

22
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,300
Let go of Miss Duan immediately.

23
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,220
Let go of her now.

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,600
I see that you're captivated by this wench.

25
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,959
That's great.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,080
This can't get better.

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,399
So, I guess you don't want her to die.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
Let her go!

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,159
Why should I?

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,299
She betrayed the sect and disrespected her seniors.

31
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:45,719
Who else should I kill, if not her?

32
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,480
No.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,530
I'm here.

34
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,200
I won't allow you to harm her.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,380
You have already blinded her.

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,479
Please, let her go.

37
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,519
I'll be grateful. I'll be grateful.

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,399
Do you want me to spare her?

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,559
Sure.

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,339
But you have to do me a few favors in return.

41
00:03:07,339 --> 00:03:08,239
Sure.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,039
I'll do a hundred, a thousand, or even ten thousand favors for you.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,999
All right.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,880
First thing first,

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,420
you'll be my disciple.

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,220
From now on, you'll be a disciple of the Xingxiu Sect.

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,559
Master!

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,640
- He has gotten on his knees! He got on his knees for a woman.
- I'll be your disciple.

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,119
The chief of the Beggars' Sect. The chief of the Beggars' Sect has knelt down before Ding Chunqiu.

50
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:32,280
Zhuang Juxian, the disciple, greets Master with a kowtow.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What's going on?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,720
The chief of the Beggars' Sect is such a loser.

53
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,239
Master, you should let her go now.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,660
Let her go?

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,839
This wench is both undaunted and impudent.

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,439
Why should I let her go?

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,979
But it'd be different if you can atone for her sins by doing me a few favors.

58
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,660
Master, what can this disciple do for you?

59
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,580
It's only a simple task.

60
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,740
Right over there is Abbot Xuan Ci from the Shaolin Sect.

61
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,639
Challenge him and kill him.

62
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,498
Master, I bear no ill-feelings toward the Shaolin abbot.

63
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:23,479
Although the Beggars' Sect and the Shaolin Sect are contending for hegemony,

64
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,060
we aren't trying to kill each other.

65
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,779
You call me your master, yet you disobey me.

66
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:33,919
- Those were just lies.
- No, no.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,039
I will do my best to fulfill my promise.

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,999
But, Master, you have to honor your words too.

69
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,560
Don't harm Miss A'Zi.

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,119
Listen here.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,599
It's up to you whether you want to kill Xuan Ci.

72
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:56,180
It's up to me whether I want to kill A'Zi.

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,520
Abbot Xuan Ci.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,199
Shaolin and the Beggars' Sect have always coexisted in the Central Plains, and remained unaffiliated with each other.

75
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,720
Today, only one of us can win.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,599
The winner will become the hegemon of the martial arts world,

77
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,720
and the loser will have to obey the hegemon.

78
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,580
All the heroes present here today, if any of you have any objections,

79
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,260
you can challenge the hegemon of the martial arts world.

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,700
Amitabha.

81
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,439
For the past hundreds of years, the martial arts world have always known the Beggars' Sect for your chivalrousness.

82
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,960
Our sect has always respected the Beggars' Sect.

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,059
For the past hundreds of years, the Shaolin Sect and the Beggars' Sect have been on good terms.

84
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,339
I can't fathom why Chief Zhuang is accusing us all of a sudden.

85
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,950
In Great Song, we have the Liao Kingdom in the South,

86
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,339
Xixia, the kingdom of Tibetan, in the West, the Dali Kingdom in the North.

87
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,460
This guy can't even tell directions.

88
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,119
The Great Song has been caught in a dire situation for the past few years.

89
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,519
We are supposed to work together to get through this challenge.

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,959
However, all the sects are fighting against each other.

91
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
We are fighting with our own friends.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,879
Xiao Feng, the Khitan, came alone,

93
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,300
and he defeated all heroes of the Central Plains.

94
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,319
Then, I was told that from the Xingxiu Sea of the western region, the Xingxiu Old...

95
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,639
Old Freak!

96
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,199
He is the Old Freak of Xingxiu,

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,620
and you are the Young Demon of Xingxiu.

98
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,660
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

99
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,859
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

100
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,820
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

101
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,800
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

102
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,099
Ignorant children are as stupid as a donkey.

103
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,399
He lets out a fart that stinks so badly.

104
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,679
You should make a poem, too.

105
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,660
Yes. Make a poem too.

106
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,399
A tree with no bark will surely die.

107
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,039
A man with no dignity will surely be invincible.

108
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,079
The thief of Xingxiu has neither bark nor dignity.

109
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,559
He is a member of a motley crowd that tells nothing but lies.

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,900
Because we couldn't work together, we were bullied by outsiders.

111
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,340
I suggest installing the Beggars' Sect as the hegemon of the martial arts world,

112
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,940
and have everyone else listens to our commands.

113
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,920
Even if anything major happens, we won't get caught up in the chaos.

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,700
Abbot Xuan Ci, do you agree?

115
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,020
What Chief Zhuang said definitely makes sense.

116
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,040
However, there's is something I can't fathom.

117
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,160
- Can you please enlighten me?
- Go ahead.

118
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,559
Chief Zhuang has taken Mr. Ding as your master.

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Hence, you are a member of the Xingxiu Sect.

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,000
The Xingxiu Sect is a sect of the Western region.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,299
Even if we want to pick a hegemon for the martial arts world of the Central Plains,

122
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:18,179
I'm afraid that you won't be a suitable candidate.

123
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:19,839
The abbot is right.

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,959
You are the outsiders' lapdog.

125
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,260
How can you be the hegemon of the martial arts world of the Central Plains?

126
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,760
The abbot has made a mistake.

127
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,540
I originally hail from Qufu in Shandong.

128
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,939
The Xingxiu Sect was founded in the Western region,

129
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:37,980
a place where I temporarily stay.

130
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,558
To be fair,

131
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,519
the Shaolin martial arts were invented by the Grand Master of Dharma from Tianzhu.

132
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,560
I guess the Shaolin Sect is the sect of the Western region.

133
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,560
It's difficult to seek the roots of all martial arts.

134
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
Our Chief Zhuang hails from the Central Plains.

135
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,140
Our sect was founded in the Central Plains as well.

136
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,760
Naturally, he is the best candidate to lead the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

137
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,280
Abbot Xuan Ci.

138
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,280
Today, we shall decide the winner by competing with our martial arts

139
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,820
instead of our eloquence.

140
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,900
If the two leaders of your sect are willing to compete with us,

141
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,740
then we can decide who the winner is on the spot.

142
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,840
Otherwise, you can surrender

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,999
and support our Chief Zhuang as the hegemon of the martial arts world.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,940
That is a good plan, too.

145
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,020
Amitabha.

146
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,880
Since Chief Zhuang insists on fighting with me

147
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,320
if I disagree with you,

148
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,759
it may seem like I'm disrespecting your sect.

149
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,980
Heroes.

150
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,239
All of you here are my witnesses.

151
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,660
The Shaolin Sect has never wanted to compete with the Beggars' Sect.

152
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,380
However, Chief Zhuang drove us into a corner.

153
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:56,379
I have no other choice but to aggrieve our own people and gladden our foes.

154
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:58,660
All of us here will be your witnesses.

155
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,860
The Shaolin Sect is definitely not at fault.

156
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,759
We shall compete and the winner will stay.

157
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,620
No one here is at fault.

158
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,940
Let's fight now.

159
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,500
All right.

160
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,160
Today, with our sect's Great King Kong Palm and Subduing Demon Holy Staff,

161
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,399
I will compete with the Beggars' Sect Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,220
and Dog-beating Stick Technique.

163
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,660
With this opportunity, all the martial artists can witness with their own eyes

164
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,139
the skills that were passed down from one chief to another over the past hundreds of years.

165
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,880
Amitabha.

166
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,020
These are the occult skills practiced by the Xingxiu Sect,

167
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,180
not the skills practiced by the Beggars' Sect.

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,699
We're competing against the Shaolin Sect, and we shouldn't apply any occult skills.

169
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:32,399
Chief, shouldn't you be using the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms?

170
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,959
The Divine Arts of the Xingxiu Sect

171
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,780
are way more powerful than the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

172
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,899
Why should he disregard the more powerful skills and use a weaker one instead?

173
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,039
Precisely. The martial arts of Xingxiu are the best in the world.

174
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,679
It defeats all enemies and wins all attacks.

175
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,159
The awful Subduing Dragon Palms is not worth a whoop.

176
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,220
It's not worth a whoop!

177
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,559
- Who told you that the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms are weaker than the martial arts of Xingxiu?
- Who?

178
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,480
- Who?
- Who's there?

179
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,800
Brother Qiao.

180
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,559
- Chief Qiao.
- Chief Qiao.

181
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,160
Brother-in-law, you're finally here.

182
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,119
Brothers.

183
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,860
I, Xiao Feng, have been exiled from the Beggars' Sect.

184
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,420
You are not to address me like how you used to before.

185
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,359
Chief... Hero Qiao!

186
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,659
Since our parting, all of us have been missing Chief Qiao's presence.

187
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,919
You were the one who said that the martial arts of Xingxiu are better than the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,900
Nice.

189
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,180
Brother-in-law, you are finally here to save me.

190
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,340
A'Zi, what happened to your eyes?

191
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,660
I've lost my sight.

192
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,940
Ding Chunqiu, the old freak, blinded me.

193
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,160
- Brother-in-law, dig out his eyes to avenge me.
- You...

194
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,780
Let go of Miss A'Zi.

195
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,520
Let her go now!

196
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,840
Who are you?

197
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,620
I am...

198
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,580
I'm the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

199
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,140
You can call me Chief Zhuang.

200
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,780
Prince Duan.

201
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,759
Your daughter is right here. I'll hand her back to you.

202
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,160
Brother-in-law.

203
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,060
Brother-in-law.

204
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,719
Si Gui. Du Cheng. Bring Young Miss to somewhere safe.

205
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,260
Make sure to keep her safe.

206
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,420
Yes, Master.

207
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,380
I'm not leaving.

208
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,979
Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law!

209
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,400
You...

210
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,720
I'm not leaving!

211
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,620
Brother-in-law!

212
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,940
Great.

213
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,260
Miss Wang, I...

214
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,120
Older Brother!

215
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,400
- Brother.
- Brother.

216
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,719
How are you? I've been missing you.

217
00:15:40,719 --> 00:15:43,279
I'm doing well generally, but it's a long story to tell.

218
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,759
Good to hear that both of us are doing well.

219
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,520
Qiao Feng is a Khitan.

220
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,460
Everyone wants to kill him.

221
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,779
Today, we can't let him leave the Shaoshi Mountain alive.

222
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,019
- Yes.
- Don't let Qiao Feng go away.

223
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:57,899
Make him stay, and we'll kill him together!

224
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:59,519
You came here by your own will. Don't you dare think about leaving this place!

225
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,140
Stay here!

226
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,100
Make him stay!

227
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
We're in a dire situation.

228
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,299
I'm afraid that we won't be able to get together again.

229
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,279
You shall leave first. There's still a long life ahead of us.

230
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,300
I'll see you around.

231
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,859
Brother, friendship is supposed to improve happiness and abate misery.

232
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:24,899
Brother is in trouble now. I can't run away now.

233
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,440
My daughter and I are indebted to Hero Xiao.

234
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,899
Dan Chen, I'll figure out a way to blend into the crowd to help him out.

235
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:33,680
Yes.

236
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,580
But we are outnumbered.

237
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,040
How does Master plan to remove yourself from the danger later?

238
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,480
A real man should do his best in repaying the kindness he received and avenging his grievances,

239
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,454
even if it may cost his life.

240
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:48,760
Qiao Feng was responsible for Reverend Xuan Ku's murder.

241
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,279
Disciples of the Lohan Hall.

242
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,100
Guard all the exits of the mountains.

243
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,159
Before we get to the bottom of this,

244
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,580
he shall not be allowed to leave Shaoshi Mountain.

245
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,520
Yes!

246
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,200
Young Master.

247
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,659
All of the heroes are here gathering at Shaoshi Mountain.

248
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:09,999
Do you think we should side with the Shaolin Sect or the Beggars' Sect?

249
00:17:09,999 --> 00:17:14,560
Zhuang Juxian, the chief of the Beggars' Sect, seems like a dishonorable man.

250
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,000
He's nothing like Xiao Feng, the gallant man.

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,300
He actually took Old Thief Ding as his master.

252
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,140
How shameless.

253
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,419
Why don't we side with the Shaolin Sect to clip his wings?

254
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,540
Besides, we can also show the Old Thief Ding what we've got.

255
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,720
Young Master, what do you think?

256
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,540
Brothers, our first priority is to re-establish the country.

257
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,599
It shall not be hindered by our personal resentments.

258
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,239
Xiao Feng killed both his father and his master.

259
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,940
He has become the public enemy of the entire Central Plains.

260
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,699
How can I, Murong Fu, turn a blind eye to that?

261
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,320
Brother Xiao, you're a Khitan hero.

262
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,339
I, Murong Fu, would like to learn a few tricks from you today.

263
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:09,859
Even if I get killed by Brother Xiao, this would be my contribution to all heroes of the Central Plains.

264
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,060
I will die an honorable death.

265
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,619
Brother Murong, I don't agree with you.

266
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:16,020
Brother Xiao and you have no ill-feelings against each other.

267
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,619
When everyone was suspicious of you, he defended you.

268
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,340
Why do you have to take this opportunity to inflict harm upon him?

269
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,719
If Brother Duan wants to be the good guy and stand up for him, you should join us.

270
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,580
I'm in no place to join you.

271
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,240
I was just trying to be fair.

272
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,380
Mr. Xiao, you are my junior.

273
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,580
Hence, I let you win.

274
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:44,119
From now on, I will give my all.

275
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,340
Xiao, you killed my father. Only one of us can stay alive today.

276
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,780
Let's end it here and now.

277
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,100
The three of you...

278
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,740
can come at me together.

279
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,480
He is so ugly.

280
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,500
He scares me to death.

281
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,100
Bring me the wine.

282
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,639
Brothers!

283
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,539
He is Young Master Duan from the Dali Kingdom, also my sworn brother.

284
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:15,620
Now, we are under siege and are also outnumbered.

285
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,140
We won't be able to escape easily.

286
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,620
Both of us share a common destiny.

287
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,079
It doesn't matter if we live or we die. Let's drink up before anything else.

288
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,559
Sure. Today, let's drink up!

289
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,620
Older Brother. Third Brother.

290
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,100
Second Brother.

291
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,999
- Third Brother.
- Second Brother.

292
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:40,980
Older Brother.

293
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,660
Why wasn't I invited?

294
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,419
Older Brother, he is my second sworn brother.

295
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:50,020
His dharma name is Xu Zhu.

296
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,899
When we swore our brotherhood, we included Older Brother, too.

297
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:55,880
Second Brother, you should greet Brother Qiao.

298
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,680
I, Xu Zhu, greet my older brother.

299
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,080
My brother is a little foolish.

300
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
He included me in your brotherhood.

301
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,080
Get up.

302
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,790
We are in danger and on the brink of life and death.

303
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,620
My brother has the courage to stand up for me.

304
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,070
I'm sure you are a man who values justice before your own life.

305
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,720
It's my honor to be able to befriend a hero like you.

306
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,420
Here.

307
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,699
To the eighteen Khitan warriors who have been nothing but loyal to me.

308
00:21:48,699 --> 00:21:51,240
We have been getting along like brothers.

309
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,720
Today, let's have a drink together!

310
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,959
Bottom's up!

311
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,700
Drink up!

312
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,940
Drink up!

313
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:49,890
Attack!

314
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,960
Older Brother, leave Ding Chunqiu to me.

315
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,440
We have a lot of grudges to resolve.

316
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:09,339
Ding Chunqiu. Today, on behalf of my master and my martial brothers of the Carefree Sect,

317
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:13,699
my martial brothers of the Shaolin Sect and Reverend Xuan Nan, my Grand Martial Uncle,

318
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:15,479
I'm going to take revenge upon you!

319
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,920
I didn't know that Second Brother was such a good martial artist.

320
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,400
Hurry up!

321
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,860
Older Brother.

322
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,199
Eighteen Cavalries, protect Young Master Duan.

323
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:03,960
Yes!

324
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,839
The Old Fairy of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

325
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,459
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

326
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,980
The Old Fairy of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

327
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:05,099
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

328
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,519
I said it myself that I will go through thick and thin with my two brothers.

329
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,159
Yet, I'm here, protected.

330
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,540
How am I a good brother to them?

331
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,819
We will all die eventually.

332
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,659
Older Brother and Second Brother are such gallant men.

333
00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:29,400
Being their brother, I need to do something too.

334
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,719
The Old Fairy of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe.

335
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,599
The Old Fairy of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

336
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,659
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

337
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,000
Master!

338
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,439
Granny Yu, why are you here?

339
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:36,999
Master, I received news from Mei Jian, Ian Jian, Zhu Jian, and Ju Jian,

340
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:40,919
and learned how the Shaolin monks are out to make things difficult for Master.

341
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,200
Thus, I informed all the heroes to rush over here.

342
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,020
I'm more than happy to find out that Master is unharmed.

343
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,739
Granny Yu, I'm a disciple of the Shaolin Sect.

344
00:28:49,739 --> 00:28:52,020
You should speak more respectfully.

345
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,819
Yes. My apologies.

346
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,660
Take this!

347
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,479
Do you want to live or die?

348
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,279
Why would I want to die? Staying alive is more interesting.

349
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,720
Don't harm my master.

350
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,100
If you hurt him, you're also hurting Second Young Master Yue!

351
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,920
Don't you dare injure my son.

352
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,279
Cousin, watch out!

353
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,199
It's the Dali Duan family's One-Finger Death Touch. Don't let your guard down.

354
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,820
Father.

355
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,380
Don't you dare injure my father!

356
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
- This...
- This skill... Is that the Six Pulse Excalibur?

357
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,480
It is.

358
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,539
Father, are you all right?

359
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:08,659
I'm fine.

360
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,460
Young Master, take the sword!

361
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,320
The Beggars' Sect has always put justice and benevolence before anything else.

362
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,999
You are the chief of the sect,

363
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,300
yet you associate yourself with the demons of the Xingxiu Sect.

364
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:23,540
You have brought shame to the Beggars' Sect.

365
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,840
Let's go.

366
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,619
Master, give him a few pieces of Mortality Talismans.

367
00:34:06,619 --> 00:34:08,620
Show him what you've got.

368
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,119
Granny Yu, you need some wine for the Mortality Talisman.

369
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,199
Great. Great.

370
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,100
Martial Aunt, hurry up and kill Ding Chunqiu.

371
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,760
Avenge Grand Martial Aunt and Master!

372
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,059
Master, go get the antidote now.

373
00:34:58,059 --> 00:35:00,480
This is a very powerful poison.

374
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,740
So itchy.

375
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,720
So itchy.

376
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,119
Old Freak of Xingxia, pass us the antidote now.

377
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:43,600
Otherwise, you'll never be able to solve this Mortality Talisman.

378
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,959
Martial Uncle, hurry up.

379
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:55,120
We must seek revenge on behalf of our sect.

380
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,739
Master Uncle, it's more important to get the antidote now.

381
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,339
Granny Yu, look at the state he is in now.

382
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:15,879
- I don't think we can get the antidote, too. Why don't we give him the anti-itch pill? Can we?
- So itchy.

383
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,039
This half piece of antidote can stop your itch for three days.

384
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:29,699
Three days later, the itchiness will return.

385
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:31,919
Whether my master will give you another antidote,

386
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,720
it depends on your obedience.

387
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,600
Antidote.

388
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,840
Sure.

389
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,559
The red one is a topical medication,

390
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,880
and the white one is an oral medication.

391
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,960
Brother Duan, I guess this "Evil Dog Eating Shit" form

392
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,279
must be the Dali Duan family's signature move.

393
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,980
No.

394
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,920
Young Master, receive the brushes.

395
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,760
Third Brother, you're applying six sword techniques at once.

396
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,719
There will be gaps in between the conversions.

397
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,680
You should try applying just one sword technique.

398
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,560
Thanks, Older Brother.

399
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,759
Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North have been well known for some time.

400
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,759
After witnessing this today, they sure deserve their names.

401
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:59,219
The Dali Duan family's Six Pulse Excalibur is surely a great skill.

402
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,540
It's not giving way to the Murong clan.

403
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,399
A'Zhu willingly sacrificed herself

404
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,919
because she knew that if I kill her father,

405
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,279
the Dali Duan family will definitely seek revenge against me.

406
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,940
Third Brother has such a unique sword technique.

407
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:17,019
If we are to fight with each other, it's hard to tell who will win.

408
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,519
The master of the Lingjiu Palace is invincible.

409
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,399
You have my utmost respect.

410
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,439
The hegemon of the martial arts world is none other than you.

411
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:26,319
It'll be none other than you, Master.

412
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,699
Ding Chunqiu, how audacious of you to fight with the master.

413
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:32,579
It's hard to read this old man's mind.

414
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,359
Master, please get rid of this clown as soon as possible.

415
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,399
Get rid of him.

416
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,279
- You are so shameless.
- Get rid of him!

417
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:42,379
How dare you use the same hackneyed sayings and shameless words

418
00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:46,440
you flattered the Old Freak of Xingxiu with to praise my master.

419
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,819
- That is extremely rude.
- Yes.

420
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:53,039
We will give you something else making sure to please the ladies.

421
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,119
- You'll be pleased.
- Yes.

422
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,939
The young ladies are more beautiful than Xi Shi and Yang Guifei.

423
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:05,340
- Scoundrels.
- Shameless men.

424
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,719
- Bring them with you.
- Please spare us.

425
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:11,960
I beg you. Please spare us.

426
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,840
Amitabha.

427
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:22,260
This is an order for Xu Zhu, the Disciple of the Shaolin Sect.

428
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,160
Young Master Duan, please have mercy.

429
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,259
I know you only care about your cousin.

430
00:42:02,259 --> 00:42:04,300
I love you and I respect you.

431
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,560
I will never make you sad.

432
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,320
Yu'er.

433
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,360
- Cousin.
- Young Master.

434
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,860
He spared your life.

435
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,740
Yet, you tried to hurt him.

436
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,680
Do you call yourself a hero?

437
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,500
How can we share the same reputation?

438
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,120
Young Master.

439
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,479
- Young Master, are you all right?
- Go away!

Who did you have this child with?

467
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:37,230
If you don't say, I'll say for you.

468
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,440
I have been hiding at Shaolin Temple for more than thirty years.

469
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,320
What is there that can be hidden from me?

470
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:47,820
You went to Ziyundong

471
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,940
and found Granny Qiao to be your midwife.

472
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:55,090
All these things, do you want me to say them all in public?
