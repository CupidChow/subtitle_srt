Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ⚔️Martial Arts Team ⚔️@Viki.com

15
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,579
Before this, I escaped their slap, but not the punch.

16
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,179
This must be because this martial art technique is still not familiar to me.

17
00:01:56,179 --> 00:01:58,660
If I want to get out with this footwork,

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,059
I must become very proficient so that I need not think when I use it.

19
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,840
Then I'll be good.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,959
The peace talks between Liao and Song were only a year ago.

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,199
The Liao Army has already attacked our borders.

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,380
We do not wish for anything else

23
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,919
except for your country to keep its promises.

24
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,399
Retreat immediately.

25
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,239
And promise never to offend us again.

26
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,959
Song offers nothing and yet wishes for us to retreat.

27
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,919
Such wishful thinking.

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,539
Not mentioning other matters, we still have to pay for so many soldiers,

29
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:36,219
our food supplies, horses, winter supplies, and other things that were burned.

30
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,639
Who will compensate us?

31
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,579
If you can't make up this shortfall, I'm afraid

32
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:43,880
there will be no discussion about us retreating.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,379
A robber commits robbery yet forces the robbed to pay compensation for his loss?

34
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,479
I've been a beggar for so many years.

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,999
This is the first time I have heard of such a thing.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,540
General Han, a negotiation between two countries is not a place for lowly people to speak.

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,940
You…

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,419
Don't get conceited just because you have a few martial artists by your side.

39
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,879
Although the prince is in your hands,

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,799
your puny force is no match

41
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,700
for the Liao Empire in a war.

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,719
Prince of Chu is the Ruler of the South in the Liao Empire.

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,340
He is immensely noble.

44
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,060
On the day of your defeat,

45
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,340
you also have to respectfully escort the prince back.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,439
Your Highness, you…

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,380
I promise to retreat.

48
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,840
Let me go now.

49
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,300
I am the Prince of Chu.

50
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,999
I am naturally a man of my words.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,039
Great.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,580
That's great.

53
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,739
If the Liao Army retreats forty miles, I will let you go right away.

54
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,879
Qiao Feng. I will remember you.

55
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,439
Take care.

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,140
We won't send you off.

57
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:58,750
- Great!
- Great!

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,099
Looking from afar, as if the sun rises.

59
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,899
Observing closely, it's like a shining lotus on a green pool.

60
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,320
As if a moon covered by light clouds,

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,700
precarious as the snowy winds.

62
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,119
Standing lightly like a crane

63
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,900
as if at the moment right before taking off.

64
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,240
Duan.

65
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,400
You... What are you doing?

66
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,860
You dare play tricks with me!

67
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Running away?

68
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,920
Wu Guangsheng.

69
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,720
Let me go!

70
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,060
Let me go, both of you!

71
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,919
No, stop! It hurts!

72
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,520
Brother.

73
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,600
Let go of me.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,359
Let us discuss this properly.

75
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,839
Let go of me quickly! I can't hold on any longer!

76
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,280
Let go of me!

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,320
Chase him, quick!

78
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,219
I ran all this way but I don't feel tired at all.

79
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:33,300
On the contrary, I feel that I have more energy than before.

80
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,400
Divine Art of the Northern Darkness.

81
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:12,272
Why can't I finish storing this internal force?

82
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,460
Could something be wrong?

83
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,120
No way.

84
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,280
No matter what, I need to meet up with Miss Mu.

85
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,280
But I don't know where she is now.

86
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,680
This way.

87
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,879
Your master can't find you because you hide here, right?

88
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,339
If I take you back to Miss Zhong, she will be very happy.

89
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:47,839
Come on, good ferret.

90
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,440
Come here.

91
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,159
Ferret. Ferret.

92
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,320
Good ferret.

93
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,020
Good ferret.

94
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,879
Good ferret.

95
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,280
Come here.

96
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,420
Hey. Why are you so unreasonable?

97
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,359
I... I'm your master's friend.

98
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,899
How dare you bite me? You...

99
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,600
I…

100
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,599
Crimson Toad?

101
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,879
This is the toad known as the king of all poisons.

102
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,780
Be careful, ferret.

103
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,900
Be careful, ferret!

104
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,599
The ferret is dead.

105
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,920
If Miss Zhong knew, she would be terribly sad.

106
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,380
Why did this centipede decide to join in on the fun?

107
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,399
That's my mouth.

108
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Don't mistake it for a centipede hole!

109
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,480
Brother Toad?

110
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,480
What are you doing?

111
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,159
Brother Toad! Hurry up and catch the centipede.

112
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,680
There is nothing fun in this stomach.

113
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,879
Why can I move again?

114
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,300
It must be the Crimson Toad and the centipede.

115
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,280
They went into my stomach, curing the ferret poison with their poisons.

116
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,140
In my stomach.

117
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,719
It's all thanks to our chief.

118
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,241
The chief has done a lot.

119
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:21,519
- Otherwise, we couldn't have beaten them.
- Chief Qiao, here you go.

120
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,714
I am deeply impressed.

121
00:12:23,715 --> 00:12:25,260
Your praise is too much, Master.

122
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,919
His martial arts is exceptional. Come and eat.

123
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,639
Everyone, we successfully repelled the Liao soldiers this time,

124
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,020
thanks to the help of all of you heroes.

125
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,399
I have prepared some wine here today to thank you all.

126
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,399
To you, heroes. A toast.

127
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,599
Come on, a toast.

128
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,079
Thank you, General Han.

129
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Come on, cheers.

130
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,219
Attacking the Liao Army and guarding the Song is our duty.

131
00:13:00,219 --> 00:13:03,959
Why should General Han be so polite?

132
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,539
Everyone, I will use tea to replace wine here.

133
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:09,999
- A toast to everyone.
- Great.

134
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,580
Here.

135
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,460
Cheers.

136
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,559
General Han.

137
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,859
Heroes, our ambush was successful this time.

138
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:24,839
Chief Qiao deserves the most credit.

139
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,059
Our brothers are just doing the little that we can. It's not worth mentioning.

140
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,559
Come. Heroes. Cheers.

141
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,919
Brother You,

142
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,879
please don't say that.

143
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,500
If it weren't for the heroes' help,

144
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,839
we wouldn't have been able to capture Prince of Chu alive.

145
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,940
I raise a toast to everyone. Come.

146
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

147
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,780
Here, have some meat.

148
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:00,339
Brother, thank you for setting the stables on fire and creating confusion.

149
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,159
That bought time for me.

150
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,380
May I have the pleasure of knowing your name?

151
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,400
Let's be friends.

152
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,639
Thank you for your acknowledgment, Chief Qiao.

153
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,839
I am a nameless nobody.

154
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,880
I dare not make friends with important people like you.

155
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,819
Everybody, until we meet again.

156
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,800
See you.

157
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,159
Chief,

158
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,439
we don't know where this man came from. He seems suspicious.

159
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:45,020
He could be a spy from the Liao Army.

160
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,839
He was willing to take such a risk to infiltrate deep into the Liao Army.

161
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,940
I'm sure he's not a bad person.

162
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,679
He remained anonymous after saving his country.

163
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,239
That's a true hero.

164
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,359
Come.

165
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,599
Let's drink. A toast.

166
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,600
Great.

167
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,839
Come.

168
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,599
Here, Hero Qiao, cheers.

169
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,879
Great, Hero Qiao, cheers.

170
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,199
Cheers.

171
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,079
- Chief, bad news!
- Good wine!

172
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
Something big happened in the sect!

173
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,399
To every hero,

174
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,081
something important is happening to the Beggar's Sect now.

175
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,119
General Han,

176
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,159
I have to hurry back right away.

177
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,360
I hope you understand.

178
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,559
Chief Qiao, see you again.

179
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,400
See you again.

180
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,159
Fourth Brother, stop bragging.

181
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,859
Third Sister has already told me that you were being bullied.

182
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:08,200
Is that right?

183
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,080
They had seven people against me.

184
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,999
All of them are top-notch masters.

185
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,059
No matter how strong I am, it's impossible to kill all seven masters

186
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,279
["Thoroughly Cruel, Utterly Evil," Yun Zhonghe]
at once.

187
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,780
Fourth Brother, please stop bragging.

188
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,639
There were obviously only two people.

189
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,479
Where did the other five masters come out?

190
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,439
How do you know?

191
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,759
Did you see it with your own eyes?

192
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,239
If I didn't see it with my own eyes, how would I know?

193
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,899
Among the two of them, one was holding a fishing rod,

194
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,599
another was wielding a pair of axes.

195
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,740
Right?

196
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,299
If you were there, why didn't you come to help me?

197
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,159
"Thoroughly Cruel, Utterly Evil" Yun Zhonghe.

198
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,999
Everyone knows that your qinggong is top-notch.

199
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,799
If you can't beat them, you could just run away.

200
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,319
If I, the Fourth Brother, lose to them,

201
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,159
wouldn't that hurt your pride, too?

202
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,879
Why did we, the Four Evils, come here this time?

203
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,199
Is it really to serve the incapable Zhong Wanchou?

204
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,358
The hatred between the Boss and the Dali Imperial Court is abysmal.

205
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,759
He called us to come.

206
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,039
And we came.

207
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,479
I was in a bad situation.

208
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,318
But you just observed and did nothing.

209
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,579
Should I tell the boss about this?

210
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,960
Fourth Brother, you've wronged me.

211
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,039
You claim to be the "Crane in the Cloud."

212
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,759
Your qinggong must be good.

213
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,679
But those two were also beyond my reach.

214
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,119
Even me, your older sister, couldn't catch up.

215
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,279
Or else, how could I stand by and watch?

216
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,839
All right, enough.

217
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,999
Fourth Brother, who exactly was bullying you?

218
00:17:36,999 --> 00:17:40,159
Were they some lapdogs from the palace?

219
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,759
I bet they were!

220
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,579
I don't believe there are any great masters within the borders of Dali.

221
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:50,159
You two always say that beheading the Dali Emperor

222
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:52,319
is as easy as taking something out of a bag.

223
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,719
I always say it's not that simple.

224
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,479
Do you believe me now?

225
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,400
Impossible.

226
00:17:57,401 --> 00:18:00,619
When the boss comes back, we'll kill them together.

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,279
Fourth Brother, why is the chicken still not cooked?

228
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,220
I'm starving to death!

229
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,199
The young master has been away for so long.

230
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,119
Could there be a problem?

231
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,399
With his martial arts,

232
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
I don't think so.

233
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,140
Who goes there?

234
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,980
Young Master?

235
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,520
I am back.

236
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,519
Little sister, are you hungry?

237
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,079
You woke up a long time ago.

238
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,980
Why do you pretend to be lying still there?

239
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,159
This little sister's lover hasn't come until now.

240
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:47,800
I guess he left her here and ran away.

241
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,960
To the Heavens above,

242
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,359
I, Mu Wanqing, am willing to swear by my life.

243
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,199
If someone sees my face after going down the mountain

244
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,559
and I don't kill him, I must marry him.

245
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:59,319
If he refuses to marry me

246
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,559
or abandons me after marrying me,

247
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,720
I will kill this heartless man.

248
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,719
I don't need you to swear by your life.

249
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,399
You just need to know

250
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,599
that if you break the oath

251
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,479
and I find out,

252
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,560
I will immediately cut my own throat.

253
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,719
Why so, Master?

254
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,079
All men in this world are heartless.

255
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,679
You can't believe a single thing they say.

256
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,039
In the future, if someone lies to you

257
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,740
or abandons you,

258
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,919
they must be killed.

259
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,140
I will obey your order, Master.

260
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,860
Duan, are you really such a treacherous man?

261
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,799
That's probably about it.

262
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,519
Qiao Feng and his men have already left.

263
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,019
I pretended to leave town and took a detour

264
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,599
before coming back to look for you.

265
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,039
Weren't you going to compete with that bunch of beggars?

266
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,359
Why did you help Qiao Feng?

267
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,279
I wasn't there to help Qiao Feng

268
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:05,159
but to investigate the reality between the two countries.

269
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,559
As mentioned in The Art of War,

270
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,479
if you know yourself and the enemy, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.

271
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,719
If you want to understand the true strength of the two countries,

272
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,379
the best way is to go deep into them to see what they are really like.

273
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,759
You have been there for so long.

274
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,759
I think you must've learned a lot.

275
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,839
After this investigation, although the Song Empire is weak,

276
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,999
they have good commanders like General Han.

277
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,879
They also have the help of various martial arts masters.

278
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,399
If the little emperor can really rise up,

279
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,119
they might actually make a difference.

280
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,239
Although the Liao Empire is strong, internal strife persists.

281
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:38,839
The Prince of Chu has been at odds with the Liao Emperor for a long time.

282
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,959
We still don't know internal strife persists.

283
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:45,139
For us, this is a great opportunity.

284
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:47,500
- The Prince of Chu?
- Yes.

285
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,199
This person is ambitious.

286
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,159
His father was once the crown prince.

287
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,119
He had a chance to be crowned emperor.

288
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,359
But Yelv Hongji took that place first.

289
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,519
Prince of Chu is decisive,

290
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,999
vicious, and has a loyal army.

291
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,639
He is by no means a mediocre person.

292
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,439
He will rebel in the future.

293
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,779
If we try to befriend him and help him,

294
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:10,999
and if he ascends to the throne,

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,839
Yan will gain another helper.

296
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,540
Well said.

297
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,079
We have been following the young master for so many years.

298
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:23,799
We see that both the young master's strategies and martial arts are outstanding,

299
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,639
yet you were gentle and indecisive.

300
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:31,159
The four of us have always been worried.

301
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:35,179
Ever since you turned into an adult, this has been the first time I've seen you

302
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,039
having such an ambition to restore our country.

303
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,180
We should really be happy for you

304
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,420
and feel gratified for master.

305
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,359
The Murong family is here today because of your help.

306
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:54,860
I will never forget your affection for the Murong family.

307
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,519
God bless Murong.

308
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,000
Our Young Master is mighty!

309
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,599
- Good baby, don't cry.
- Senior.

310
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,199
The child is crying so pitifully.

311
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,359
You like children so much.

312
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,760
Why not send him away?

313
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,319
Young girl, you are so bold.

314
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,239
I like this baby. This baby likes me, too.

315
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,399
That's why it followed me.

316
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,079
Moreover, I, Second Madam Ye, snatched this child myself.

317
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,540
I haven't played with it enough.

318
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,960
How could it be given away?

319
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,180
Don't cry. Stop crying, baby.

320
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,900
Traveling a thousand miles with a sword,

321
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,450
please allow me to say a word.

322
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,259
Where is Young Master Duan?

323
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:54,760
Tell me now!

324
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,919
The Four Bodyguards of Dali.

325
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,419
Your short lives are ending soon.

326
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,799
As a mother, I'm so sad.

327
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:04,119
The four of you short-lived babies,

328
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,059
when you arrive in hell, you have to wait for your mother.

329
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,060
Careful, the child!

330
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,219
"No Evil Left Undone" Second Madam Ye, your title is well-deserved.

331
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:44,159
I, Gu Ducheng, will take you on!

332
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,839
This child is in the way.

333
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,419
Why don't you hack him to death?

334
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:50,020
Be careful of your axes. You might hurt the child.

335
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,320
Hold it well.

336
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,039
Your martial arts is exceptional.

337
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,599
I didn't expect hidden dragons and crouching tigers within little Dali.

338
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,039
I'm glad to have the honor of Second Madam Ye visiting our land.

339
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,179
Nice to meet you.

340
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:10,559
We in Dali should treat each other with courtesy.

341
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,819
But where is Young Master Duan? Please tell us.

342
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,459
I do not know about that.

343
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:17,199
Even if I know, I wouldn't tell you.

344
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,420
Freeze!

345
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,239
These belong to the children that she snatched away.

346
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,959
If we don't eliminate her,

347
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,759
there will be more victims in Dali.

348
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,519
Now Young Master has fallen into their hands.

349
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
I wonder how is he now.

350
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,780
Are you Duan's friends?

351
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,739
You are?

352
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:46,799
I…

353
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,239
Nanhai Crocodile.

354
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,719
Duan?

355
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,420
It's Young Master!

356
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,979
Nanhai Crocodile! I am coming!

357
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,000
Let me become your apprentice…

358
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,359
Young Master!

359
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:03,459
- Fourth Brother Zhu.
- Young Master.

360
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,820
- Fortunately, you are safe and sound.
- Duan.

361
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,119
Why are the four of you here?

362
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,319
- What a coincidence.
- It's not a coincidence.

363
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,039
We had orders to pick you up.

364
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,819
We searched all the way from Wuliang Mountain.

365
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:16,659
Young Master, you really had us worried all these days.

366
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,039
Miss Mu.

367
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,540
Duan!

368
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,080
Miss Mu!

369
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,459
Miss Mu. Miss Mu! Miss Mu.

370
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,739
Miss Mu, is your wound better?

371
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,579
Those wicked people didn't bully you, right?

372
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:33,979
Who am I to you?

373
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:36,580
Why are you still calling me Miss Mu?

374
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,500
Well… Wan…

375
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,579
Sister Wan, can I call you that?

376
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,799
Sister Wan, allow me to do the introductions.

377
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:50,280
This is Fourth Brother Zhu. He is my best friend.

378
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,760
- I am Zhu Danchen, pleased to meet you.

379
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,759
Fourth Brother Zhu.

380
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,559
Please, I don't deserve this honor.

381
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,919
The two masters miss you, Young Master.

382
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,960
Please go home quickly.

383
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,839
If, Miss Mu, you have nothing to do,

384
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,399
please return to the mansion with Young Master,

385
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,680
and stay for a few days.

386
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,000
What should we do now?

387
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,079
Don't talk nonsense.

388
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,579
Chief Qiao has arrived!

389
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,440
- Chief Qiao.
- Chief Qiao is here.

390
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,840
- Chief Qiao.
- Chief Qiao.

391
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,479
- Deputy Chief Ma.
- Chief.

392
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,739
How is my master now?

393
00:27:33,739 --> 00:27:34,859
Not very good.

394
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,279
After you led our brothers out of Yanmen Pass,

395
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,079
the Old Chief fell ill.

396
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,679
But he wouldn't let us tell you.

397
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,840
He didn't want to distract you.

398
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,599
He is a famous doctor in the martial arts world,

["Yanluo's Rival" Physician Xue]
"Yanluo's Rival" Physician Xue.

400
00:27:48,619 --> 00:27:51,379
He has been seeing the Old Chief for the past few days.

401
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:53,099
You've worked hard.

402
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,799
Are there any ways to cure my master's illness?

403
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,159
I am ashamed.

404
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,919
Old Chief Wang is suffering from years of old wounds.

405
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,879
In addition to that, he exhausts his mind and worries daily.

406
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,240
These lead to loss of Qi and Blood.

407
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,759
We as physicians can heal sickness but can't reverse fates.

408
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,240
I'm limited in what I can do.

409
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm afraid he will only last for another two days.

410
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,840
He can't be saved?

411
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,580
I'll go in and see my master.

412
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,560
Master.

413
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,819
Come. Take it easy.

414
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:53,699
I'm sorry for being unfilial, Master.

415
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,499
I couldn't always serve at your side.

416
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:58,000
What unfilial?

417
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,739
I know my own body.

418
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,879
Did you think I wouldn't die

419
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,200
if you kept watch over me?

420
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,079
My whole life...

421
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,279
was festive and lively.

422
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,079
After I'm gone,

423
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,059
you all must be happy.

424
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,760
Do you hear that?

425
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,339
Come. Sit down.

426
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,700
I've always been a beggar.

427
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,819
I joined the Beggars' Sect at the age of seven.

428
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:36,580
I robbed the rich and helped the poor people many times.

429
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,979
I was nicknamed "Sword Beard."

430
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,499
Only now that I've realized,

431
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:45,359
no matter what kind of hero you are,

432
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,979
in front of Prince Yanluo, we are all the same.

Come.

435
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,759
Even if Prince Yanluo sees you, he'll have to call you a hero.

436
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:17,260
The only thing I worry about is you.

437
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,320
The Beggars' Sect is huge

438
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,059
because we don't pick our members and gatekeep.

439
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,059

440

443
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,730
We have no great philosophy.

444
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,139
It's nothing more than

445
00:30:48,139 --> 00:30:52,399
defending our country and home, and being chivalrous.

446
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,720

You have to swear to me,

460

no matter what happens,

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,359
Exactly.

539
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,359
Disciples of the Discipline Hall were traveling when they caught this news.

540
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,319
Then they wrote to me.

541
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,839
Look at Song.

542
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,999
The Liao continuously attack us from the north.

543
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,959
The Western Xia in the west are always eyeing us.

544
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:41,679
Only the Dali Kingdom in the Southwest is friendly with us.

545
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,980
The royal family of Dali also has a deep relationship with our imperial court.

546
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,480
Junior Xuan Bei,

547
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,399
I would like you to go to Dali again as a warning

548
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:58,999
to prevent any mishaps from happening to the Duan Royal family.

549
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,240
I shall follow your orders, Senior.

550
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,439
Right!

551
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,159
On this trip to Dali,

552
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,959
other than Hui Zhen's disciples,

553
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:09,180
can I bring another disciple?

554
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,580
Who do you want to bring?

555
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,480
Xu Zhu, the disciple of Hui Lun.

556
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,379
Why him?

557
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:23,359
I also thought that this person is unremarkable.

558
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,699
But after a few encounters with him,

559
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,239
I found out that this person is open-minded.

560
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,959
When others are anxious and worried,

561
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,719
he will walk on the ground peacefully.

562
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,020
There is no worry in his mind.

563
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,179
This time, I want to take him out to give him some experience.

564
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:42,559
He might even be enlightened. That's possible.

565
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,920
This may be the fate of the two of you.

566
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,699
This person has ordinary qualifications.

567
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:53,919
His Buddhist knowledge and martial arts are rather mediocre.

568
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:56,940
But since you want to take him,

569
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,879
just talk to Hui Lun about it.

570
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,080
Then I will get ready immediately.

571
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,620
Master.

572
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,360
This first cup...

573
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,120
is a toast to your chivalry and your heroism.

574
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,320
[Beggars' Sect Eighth Chief, Wang Jiantong]

575
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,219
As long as you were my master for a day, you are a father to me for life.

576
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,960
This second cup is a toast to...

577
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,920
your grace as heavy as mountains.

578
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,020
The third cup.

579
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,280
I shall see you off.

580
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,339
No matter how good you are, there is someone better.

581
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,959
Don't think highly of yourself

582
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,460
and don't think lowly of others.

583
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,200
Be in the moment, yet not lost within it.

584
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,080
Don't be proud of your talents,

585
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,079
don't abuse your power because you are favored.

586
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,090
Remember these well.
