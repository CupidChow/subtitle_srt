[Episode 27]

14
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,919
What would happen to the previous successor after he was replaced by someone else?

15
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:38,739
Eldest Martial Sister, I beg you.

16
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:40,799
I really want to spare your life.

17
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,439
Unfortunately, I can't ruin our sects' rules.

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,800
Eldest Martial Sister, please spare my life.

19
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,139
Eldest Martial Sister's mightiness is incomparable!

20
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:02,060
Eldest Martial Sister's martial arts skills are the greatest!

21
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,040
Eldest Martial Sister's skills are superb!

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,200
Eldest Martial Sister's martial arts skills are the greatest!

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Eldest Martial Sister's skills are supreme!

24
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,040
You are mighty, Eldest Martial Sister!

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,419
Brother-in-Law! Wait for me!

26
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:15,999
Farewell, Eldest Martial Sister.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Stop following me.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,599
You are now the successor of Xingxiu Sect and their eldest martial sister. Aren't you content yet?

29
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,579
I earned the title through deception.

30
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,639
I don't care about it.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,079
Brother-in-Law, I want to follow you to the outside of the Yanmen Pass.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,300
Second Junior!

33
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,640
Yes, Eldest Martial Sister!

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,720
Eldest Martial Sister.

35
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,119
I am going to the north.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,760
You all stay around this area.

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,239
You can't leave without my permission. Understand?

38
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,039
We will follow your orders.

39
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,439
We wish you a safe journey, and we hope everything goes well.

40
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,039
We wish you all the best and success.

41
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,639
With your divine martial arts, there is nothing you can't achieve.

42
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,440
Our compliment is unnecessary.

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,680
- You are invincible!
- Dismissed.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,780
Eldest Martial Sister, safe journey!

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,519
- Safe journey!
- Eldest Martial Sister, safe journey!

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,460
Eldest Martial Sister!

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,580
Brother-in-Law, why are you sighing?

48
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,279
Am I too naughty?

49
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,599
Naughty?

50
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,700
You call that naughty?

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,319
You already won. Why did you still want to kill him?

52
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,139
Brother-in-Law, you don't understand the situation.

53
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,179
I am a fake eldest martial sister. You fought it for me.

54
00:03:46,179 --> 00:03:48,079
Zhai Xingzi is very powerful in martial arts.

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,119
If one day he realizes that I tricked him,

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,959
then I would be the one that dies.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,859
I can't see your sister's kindness in you at all.

58
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,620
Is my sister that good

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,380
that I can't compare at all?

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,439
Fine. Since she is so kind, ask her to keep you company then.

61
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,639
I am leaving now.

62
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,300
I am leaving.

63
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,799
Brother-in-Law! Brother-in-Law!

64
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:20,319
You are so cruel.

65
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,819
You ignored me. You are not kindhearted at all.

66
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:23,879
Kindhearted?

67
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,080
Do you know what being kindhearted means?

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,479
Of course, I know what it means.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,740
My mother told me before.

70
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,340
We must not treat others with cruelty. We must be kindhearted instead.

71
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,979
Yes, your mother is right.

72
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:37,660
But you have learned all the wickedness from your master.

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,440
You have a good heart.

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,179
Then, I will follow you to Yanmen Pass and learn how to have a good heart from you.

75
00:04:42,179 --> 00:04:44,820
Do you know why I am going to Yanmen Pass?

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,240
How could you follow me without knowing the reason?

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,680
Tell me, and I will know it.

78
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,159
I promised your sister

79
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,960
that I would live the rest of my life in the land outside the Yanmen Pass.

80
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,879
Without my sister around,

81
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,620
who will cook for you?

82
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,100
Who will make clothes for you?

83
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,160
You don't have to worry about that.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,679
We, the Khitans, eat beef and lamb and wear animal skins.

85
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,460
We treat every place as our home. We go with the flow.

86
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,660
Isn't that about living a life of hunting, drinking, and fighting?

87
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,859
Dead or alive, you live a vigorous and happy life!

88
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,620
Brother-in-Law, it looks like

89
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,000
you don't have to go outside the Yanmen Pass. You can live that kind of life right here.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,980
What about I keep you company here?

91
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,679
We will drink and fight together.

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,959
Drink?

93
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,280
Can you drink?

94
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,699
- Who can you win in a fight?
- I...

95
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:40,780
You still need my help in the end.

96
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,600
Stop bothering me.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,560
You don't care about me anymore!

98
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,860
I will just cry myself to death!

99
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,519
You're healthy and fine, you won't die from crying.

100
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,819
I... I will show you that I can do it!

101
00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:58,920
Then, go ahead and cry.

102
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,240
I am dead from crying. I am dead from crying!

103
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,079
Get up. Stop pretending.

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,400
A'Zi.

105
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,920
A'Zi! A'Zi!

106
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,880
A'Zi!

107
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,360
A'Zi!

108
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,060
A'Zi!

109
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,460
Physician!

110
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,319
The physician is out to treat a patient. Hurry.

111
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,180
Put her down on the bed.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,660
Can you give me a bowl of hot soup?

113
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,200
All right.

114
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,840
Here you go.

115
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,540
Be careful. It is hot.

116
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,799
How did she get such serious injuries?

117
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I will get the physician here now.

118
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,120
Such a harmful creature.

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,420
Sir, her pulse has stopped.

120
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,560
It's no different from being dead.

121
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,980
Why did you still bring her over?

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,100
Come. We can't resurrect the dead.

123
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,919
Don't be so sad.

124
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,959
It is better if you carry her away and bury her quickly.

125
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,199
Physician, someone from Old Master Zhang's residence is here.

126
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,820
He needs the best-matured ginseng.

127
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,039
Old Master Zhang is about to die.

128
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,799
He needs ginseng to hang on to his life.

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,900
All right.

130
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,159
Take this, Da Tou. Bring it to them quickly.

131
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,640
All right.

132
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,280
Physician, can the matured ginseng really extend life for a while longer?

133
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,920
Yes.

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,520
This ginseng...

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,599
When a person is about to die of a grave illness

136
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,240
and takes a few sips of a rich ginseng soup,

137
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,800
he will be able to hang on to his life

138
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,790
for a while longer and leave some last words.

139
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,020
I want those two pieces of ginseng.

140
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,880
Can you brew the soup for me?

141
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,199
All right.

142
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,320
I will brew it for you now.

143
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,780
Sir, the ginseng soup is ready.

144
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,260
Thank you.

145
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,559
Don't talk now. Save your breath.

146
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,620
Sir, the ginseng soup can only help in extending life for a while longer.

147
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,220
It can't save her life.

148
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,940
Even if she eats it whole,

149
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,799
she will only turn into a living dead

150
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,920
and live a little longer.

151
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,540
Do you have more matured ginseng?

152
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,959
Where can I find so many of them?

153
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,959
In fact, I went a long way to obtain those few pieces from someone.

154
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,180
That's all I have.

155
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,759
Well, where can I find it?

156
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,819
The matured ginseng grows in the bitter cold area surrounding Changbai Mountain.

157
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:33,959
The harsher the environment, the more suitable it is for it to grow.

158
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,139
If you are not afraid of death, you may try your luck there.

159
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,119
But given the current season,

160
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,560
it is rather hard to find it now.

161
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,640
A'Zi is A'Zhu's only biological sister.

162
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,080
Although she is vicious,

163
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,800
it is not her true nature.

164
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,040
It was the influence of Old Freak of Xingxiu.

165
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,599
Besides, she promised

166
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,580
to follow me and stop harming people.

167
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,000
I promised A'Zhu that I would take good care of her.

168
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,460
I will save her no matter what.

169
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,760
But it will be hard on A'Zi.

170
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,359
Despite her serious injuries,

171
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,880
she still has to travel a long distance with me to a bitterly cold place.

172
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,060
I feel sorry for her.

173
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,420
I have been searching for the ginseng at Changbai Mountain for days,

174
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,060
but I still can't find any at all.

175
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,000
This isn't good.

176
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,940
A'Zi, you must hang on.

177
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,000
I will definitely find the ginseng and save you.

178
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,080
There aren't any wild fruit here.

179
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,480
How can there be any ginseng?

180
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,760
Brother Qiao, please promise me this one matter.

181
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,340
A'Zi is my only biological sister.

182
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,460
I hope you will take care of her.

183
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,520
I am afraid she will go astray.

184
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,140
A'Zhu, I will definitely take good care of your sister.

185
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:19,544
[Jurchen, Wanyan Aguda]

186
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:04,359
Brother, you have impressive skills.

187
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,419
Changbai Mountain is bitter cold and full of wild beasts.

188
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:10,859
- Why did you come here?
- I think I have lost my way.

189
00:15:10,859 --> 00:15:13,740
I came here to look for ginseng to save my sister's life.

190
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,320
Ginseng?

191
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,859
If you need ginseng, you can just look for me.

192
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:21,079
I can guarantee that I can give you all you need.

193
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,640
Great.

194
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,420
I will follow you then.

195
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,880
You are outright.

196
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,779
Wanyan Aguda, a Jurchen.

197
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,679
Xiao Feng, a Khitan.

198
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,519
You are back.

199
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,100
These, right?

200
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,899
Both of you must take good care of Brother Xiao's sister.

201
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,040
You may leave.

202
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,959
Brother Wanyan, thank you.

203
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,399
No need for formality.

204
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,119
You may live in this tent with your sister.

205
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,140
How can I accept such kindness?

206
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,299
It is my honor that you can live in my tent.

207
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,859
That's settled then.

208
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:31,160
Thank you very much then.

209
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,600
Come on.

210
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,880
Everyone! Come over!

211
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,219
Let me introduce someone to you.

212
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:44,140
This is Brother Xiao Feng, a Khitan.

213
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,159
A Khitan?

214
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,380
All right. Shut up!

215
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,059
I came upon a tiger when I was hunting in the mountain.

216
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,580
If it weren't for his help,

217
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,759
I am afraid I would have been dead.

218
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:01,739
Brother Xiao could kill a tiger with his bare hands.

219
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:06,519
A hero like him should not be judged by his heritage.

220
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,359
Great hero!

221
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,698
I don't deserve it.

222
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:16,159
Brother Xiao came here to find wild ginseng to heal his sister.

223
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,778
So please help him out when you dig for wild ginseng.

224
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:22,199
- No problem!
- All right!

225
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,399
Thank you, everyone.

226
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,199
I can also help with hunting.

227
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,559
If you need any help, just let me know.

228
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,279
Brother Xiao, you must be tired. Get some rest.

229
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,079
I will ask our chief to come over.

230
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:36,199
Tonight, we will have a bonfire to welcome Brother Xiao!

231
00:17:36,199 --> 00:17:44,639
Great!

232
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,839
Hero Xiao, I heard from Aguda that you killed a tiger with your bare hands.

233
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,559
That's very heroic.

234
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,739
We, the Jurchens,

235
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,999
admire heroes the most.

236
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,260
I don't deserve it.

237
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,100
Come on. I will toast to you.

238
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,160
I will toast to you.

239
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,699
Come on.

240
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:45,199
By the way, we brewed this wine ourselves.

241
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,679
It contains high alcohol content.

242
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,319
Drink slowly.

243
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,879
I will drink it first to show my sincerity.

244
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,879
I have no other talent besides my ability to drink wine.

245
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,879
I have not drunk any wine for months.

246
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,819
I am afraid these few sips won't be able to fix my alcohol cravings.

247
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,620
- Come on!
- Come on!

248
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,860
Father, I was right, wasn't I?

249
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,479
Brother Xiao's alcohol tolerance is comparable to more than 10 Jurchens combined.

250
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,059
That's right.

251
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:24,399
Brother Xiao, we, the Jurchens,

252
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,639
love bold men like you the most.

253
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,039
Feel free to stay here and heal your sister.

254
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,520
We are very familiar with the terrain. Anything else aside,

255
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,839
the wild ginseng alone grows in abundance here.

256
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,339
Come on. Thank you in advance.

257
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,220
- Come on. Cheers!
- Cheers!

258
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,720
Greetings, Imperial Brother.

259
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,319
No need for formalities.

260
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,539
Yu'er, help your father sit down.

261
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,879
Is your injury healing well?

262
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:33,919
I feel much better under the daily care of the imperial physician.

263
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,399
The main purpose of your assignment to the Central Plains

264
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:40,679
was to assist Shaolin in investigating Reverend Xuan Bei's case.

265
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,640
I never thought you would cause such twists and turns.

266
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,420
You couldn't even keep your personal matters in check.

267
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,199
Treat this matter as a lesson then.

268
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,979
I admit my mistakes.

269
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:57,039
I never thought Kang Min could be so vicious.

270
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,799
She could work with outsiders to murder her own husband.

271
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,220
It was really unexpected.

272
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,439
If it weren't for Qiao Feng's help,

273
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,200
I am afraid I would have been dead in her hands.

274
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,599
Based on what you said, it seems that Hero Qiao Feng has been wronged.

275
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,819
Madam Ma murdered her own husband with outsiders.

276
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,020
She even used Qiao Feng's heritage to stir up a dispute

277
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,739
and caused him to cut off ties with the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

278
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,919
It is such a pity.

279
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,999
Based on my brief encounter with Qiao Feng,

280
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,459
I found that he is sentimental and righteous.

281
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,759
He is definitely not an ungrateful man as rumored in the martial arts world.

282
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,740
When he found he had mistaken me for his father's murderer,

283
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,239
he stopped and did not want to implicate others.

284
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,479
How would a person like him kill his own parents?

285
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,279
Uncle, Qiao Feng is my sworn brother.

286
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,879
When I saw he had to bear such grievances, I couldn't stand it anymore.

287
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,659
So I went to the Central Plains on my own to clear his name.

288
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,719
Good.

289
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,599
Madam Ma and Bai Shijing died a strange death.

290
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,419
Due to the urgency of the matter, the Ma brothers did not relay

291
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,399
the whole story to their martial arts peers.

292
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,719
But Shaolin and the Beggars' Sect need to be informed of the matter as soon as possible.

293
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,999
Since you are injured,

294
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,299
we will send Yu'er to the Central Plains as Dali's representative instead.

295
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,020
Thank you, Uncle.

296
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,319
Our Dali Kingdom was once in chaos,

297
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,980
causing Crown Prince Yanqing to leave home.

298
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,619
And this throne fell on my shoulders instead.

299
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:38,880
The burden fell to me in the moment of crisis.

300
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,719
I always feel that I am unworthy of this throne.

301
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,520
That is why I always put

302
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,260
our people's livelihood and the kingdom's reputation in my heart.

303
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,739
I dare not slack off and forget about it.

304
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,180
Yu'er, you are the only heir to the Dali Kingdom right now.

305
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,299
During this trip, closely bear in mind that

306
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:05,180
you are the crown prince, and keep yourself safe.

307
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,739
Whenever you encounter any matters, you must weigh the pros and cons carefully.

308
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:11,919
Remember, this is not just your own safety.

309
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,859
This influences the future and fate of the Dali Kingdom.

310
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:18,739
Yes, Uncle. I understand.

311
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:21,780
Yu'er, don't be reckless

312
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,819
like your father did in handling matters.

313
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,359
Anyway, it is all destined.

314
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,279
We can't force it to go the other way round.

315
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,439
Yu'er has been kind since he was a child, and he does not like conflict.

316
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,380
He is not interested in politics at all.

317
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,779
As the saying goes, there are many matters that do not go as you intend in the world.

318
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:49,440
Now, it is up to Yu'er to come to a realization on his own.

319
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,159
Brother Chun, you must make good arrangements

320
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,359
for his trip to the Central Plains.

321
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,359
You must ensure his safety.

322
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,599
Yes, Imperial Brother.

323
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,880
I will make the arrangements now.

324
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,799
Hero Xiao is back.

325
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,200
Brother Xiao.

326
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,480
Brother Xiao! Brother Xiao.

327
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Take this. Add some dishes for the kids tonight.

328
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,479
Brother Xiao.

329
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,159
I dug this from the ridge just a bit ago.

330
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,399
Here.

331
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,239
Is your sister recovering?

332
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,859
Yes. She can get up now.

333
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,279
That's good then. The winter makes it harder for her to recover.

334
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,559
When she makes it through the winter, she will get better gradually.

335
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,679
Thank you.

336
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,520
She will be fine. Don't worry.

337
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,399
Brother-in-Law.

338
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,599
How do you feel? Do you feel any better?

339
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:09,959
Of course.

340
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,179
You channel your inner energy to me every day and feed me with ginseng soup yourself.

341
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,020
How can I not recover fast?

342
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,119
Come on.

343
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,980
Brother Xiao! Brother Xiao!

344
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,879
Are you joining the singing party tonight?

345
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,620
Yes.

346
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,279
Do you know what a singing party is?

347
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,239
I don't know.

348
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,400
Why do you want to go then?

349
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,539
Miss A'Zi, a singing party is our tradition.

350
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:37,520
We will be gathering to sing and dance together.

351
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,000
All right. We will definitely be there.

352
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,319
You haven't even recovered yet, and you're already so eager to have fun?

353
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,419
Well, I'm almost turning into mud lying in bed all the time here.

354
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,160
Won't you be there too?

355
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,940
Brother Xiao, just let her join as well since she is so eager.

356
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,759
- Please.
- Take your medicine first.

357
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,099
All right then. Brother Xiao, I will leave you two alone now.

358
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,980
All right.

359
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,540
Drink it.

360
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,780
Didn't you walk normally just a while ago?

361
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,880
Brother Xiao!

362
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,679
Miss A'Zi, come on. Take a seat.

363
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,899
My sister is bored to death staying in the room.

364
00:26:34,899 --> 00:26:36,559
Yes. She should come outside and have some fun.

365
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,699
Come on. Can your sister drink?

366
00:26:38,699 --> 00:26:40,559
She can't drink. I will drink for her.

367
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,759
Drink more.

368
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,679
I suggest giving a toast to Brother Xiao.

369
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,280
All right.

370
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,759
Come on, Brother Xiao. A toast to you.

371
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,799
- Come on.
- Bottoms up.

372
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,520
Bottoms up.

373
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,580
Miss A'Zi, have some food.

374
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,919
Have you heard that the Liao and the Song are fighting at the borders again? Many people died.

375
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,159
These two kingdoms always fight against each other. It is nothing new.

376
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,070
I think the harder they fight, the better it is for us lest the Liao attacks us instead.

377
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,320
There is nothing to be afraid of even if they attack.

378
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,020
The Liao Kingdom is facing internal instability.

379
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,479
Prince of Chu is greedy for the throne.

380
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,940
It will definitely become a big problem for them in the future.

381
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,919
The Little Song Emperor is a child with a widowed mother.

382
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,040
It is hard for him to gain standing.

383
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,999
The Dali Kingdom is benevolent and does not fight.

384
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,239
Although the Xixia Kingdom intends to fight,

385
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,480
it is too remote and located too far away.

386
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,040
Although we, the Jurchens, can't compare with them

387
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,059
in terms of population and territory,

388
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:56,240
each one of us is brave and skilled in fighting.

389
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,850
If we train ourselves,

390
00:27:58,859 --> 00:28:03,879
we will be able to fight against them one day.

391
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,119
Well said.

392
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,759
We, the Jurchens, are united.

393
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,399
It is not impossible for us to fight against them.

394
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,679
That's right. Come on.

395
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,460
- Cheers!
- Bottoms up!

396
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,860
Brother Xiao.

397
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,900
Why aren't you drinking?

398
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,639
I don't know how to sing and dance.

399
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:40,319
I am going for a walk. You all enjoy your drinks.

400
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,639
Come on, brothers!

401
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,420
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

402
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,600
Come on. Let's drink to our heart's content.

403
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,880
Brother-in-Law.

404
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,940
Why are you here?

405
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,199
Everyone is having so much fun outside,

406
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,799
but you came here alone.

407
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,980
Something must be troubling you.

408
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,319
It is nothing.

409
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,559
I grew up under the rule of Song as a child.

410
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,799
It was my adoptive parents

411
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,840
and my master who taught me things.

412
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,680
Hence, I am actually a part of Song.

413
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,279
But Khitan blood runs in my veins.

414
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,900
Just now, from their conversation,

415
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,319
it seems that the situation between the Liao and the Song has grown more intense.

416
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:04,160
The Jurchens intend to take advantage of the situation as well.

417
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,719
I feel troubled hearing it.

418
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,259
Actually, I don't understand why you are feeling troubled.

419
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:13,340
What does the fight between the Song and the Liao have to do with you?

420
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,439
The Song does not treat you kindly.

421
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,979
Moreover, the entire martial arts world of the Central Plains wishes to see you dead.

422
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:23,200
And there is nothing you care for in the Liao Kingdom

423
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,180
despite your Khitan heritage.

424
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,759
In fact, I think the Jurchens treat us well.

425
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,239
If we stay here, my master will not be able to find us.

426
00:30:33,239 --> 00:30:37,259
We can live a carefree and happy life then, right?

427
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,200
Even so,

428
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,020
it is my responsibility to repay

429
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,319
my biological parents for giving birth to me,

430
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,999
the Qiaos for bringing me up,

431
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,300
and Chief Wang for passing down his martial arts skills to me.

432
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,240
How can I let it go just like that?

433
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,640
Don't let it get away!

434
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,420
Chase after it!

435
00:32:29,104 --> 00:32:32,116
[Liao Emperor, Yelv Hongji]

436
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,599
Run. Run! Quick!

437
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:41,439
They are the Khitan!

438
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,700
Run!

439
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,080
Brother!

440
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,390
Xiao Feng! Come back!

441
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,970
They don't know that you are also a Khitan!

442
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,360
Come on!

443
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,260
This way! Quick!

444
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,359
Brother Xiao! Run! Get away!

445
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,859
Xiao Feng! Come back!

446
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,400
Great!

447
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,919
Let go of our leader. Otherwise, we will tear you apart.

448
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,260
Get your men to get down from their horses.

449
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,800
You Khitan are so rude and unreasonable.

450
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,139
You have to come with us.

451
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,300
Tell your men not to chase after us.

452
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,299
If one of them chases after us, I will cut one of your hands off.

453
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:49,159
If two chase after us, I will cut both of your hands off.

454
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,280
If four chase after us,

455
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,760
I will cut all your limbs off.

456
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,140
Listen up!

457
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,500
No one is allowed to chase after us!

458
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,220
After you.

459
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,020
He is highly skilled in martial arts.

460
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,740
I would like to know who you really are.

461
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,560
Bring the Khitan in.

462
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,780
Bring the Khitan in!

463
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,220
Bring the Khitan in!

464
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,740
Move faster.

465
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,279
What is your name?

466
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,479
What is your official title in the Liao Kingdom?

467
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,959
You were not the one who captured me.

468
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,220
Why should I tell you then?

469
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,360
He is quite right.

470
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,260
Master,

471
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,939
you are the greatest hero in the world. I couldn't win you in the fight.

472
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,199
We still lost despite our larger group.

473
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:27,999
If you release me, I am willing to give you

474
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,720
50 gold,

475
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,020
500 taels,

476
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,960
and 30 horses. What do you think?

477
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,559
We caught a high-ranking Khitan official.

478
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,719
He is indeed a high-ranking official.

479
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,140
This small ransom is far from sufficient.

480
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,059
Brother Xiao, why don't you ask for 500 gold,

481
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:54,339
5,000 taels, and 300 fine horses.

482
00:37:54,339 --> 00:37:55,619
Good!

483
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,700
His surname is Xiao. Is he a Khitan, too?

484
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,960
All right!

485
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,760
It is settled then!

486
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,659
Did you hear it clearly?

487
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:13,119
I am asking for... 500...
- Gold.

488
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,399
- 5,000...
- Taels.

489
00:38:14,399 --> 00:38:16,040
- And 300...
- Horses.

490
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,879
That's right. I agreed to it.

491
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,679
My Liao Kingdom is wealthy.

492
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,359
Such a small amount

493
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,359
is nothing to us.

494
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,679
Brother Xiao, ask him what title he holds in the Liao Kingdom.

495
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,279
Don't ask me about my identity.

496
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,039
If you do, I will definitely make it up. You will not believe it either.

497
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,499
You are a great hero.

498
00:38:38,499 --> 00:38:41,759
I don't want to lie to you. So please don't ask me.

499
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Master Xiao, it is my pleasure to meet

500
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,239
the greatest hero in the world today.

501
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,539
If you want to use force to make me surrender to you,

502
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:53,920
I am afraid that's impossible.

503
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,680
We, the Khitan, can't win against you.

504
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,440
But we will not bow to others easily.

505
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,060
All right.

506
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,520
But I won't kill you here.

507
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,299
You won't surrender willingly if I kill you with one strike.

508
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,379
Let's go somewhere further and have a good fight.

509
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:13,079
Don't do it, Brother Xiao.

510
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,719
It will be a pity if he is killed.

511
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,319
Get money from him instead. It is better to get the ransom instead.

512
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:20,199
If you want to release your anger, you may just beat him up

513
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,159
with a wooden stick or a whip, right?

514
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:27,940
Yes! Beat him up!

515
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,260
He wants to be a hero.

516
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,060
I will fulfill his wish then.

517
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,040
Come on. Let's have a good fight.

518
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,720
Master Xiao, I know I can't win against you.

519
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,639
But we, the Khitan, would rather die than surrender.

520
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,039
This place has nice scenery.

521
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,480
It is a good place to die too.

522
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,240
What is the matter?

523
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,560
Are you still going to humiliate me?

524
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,660
No.

525
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,239
I am letting you go home.

526
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,199
Are you sure?

527
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,060
I admire and value heroes.

528
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,219
You are a hero.

529
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,859
You are now my friend.

530
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,320
You may leave now.

531
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,719
If you are really letting me go, I will increase the ransom by tenfold!

532
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,399
I treat you as a friend.

533
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,520
Why don't you treat me as a friend, too?

534
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,179
Do you think I am greedy for wealth?

535
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:51,020
If I did not bring you out here,

536
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,239
I am afraid the Jurchen would not let you go easily.

537
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,120
Thank you, my savior.

538
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,760
Get up quickly.

539
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,359
I don't kill friends. Nor will I accept a bow from them.

540
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,239
Since you treat me as a friend,

541
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,800
why don't we become sworn brothers then?

542
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,420
Great.

543
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,799
I am Xiao Feng. I am 31 years old.

544
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,279
May I know how old you are?

545
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,420
I am Yelv Ji.

546
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,680
I am 13 years older than you.

547
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,079
Then, you are my elder brother.

548
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,160
Let us...

549
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,879
pay respect to Heaven to become brothers.

550
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,040
- All right!
- After you!

551
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,039
Brother!

552
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,640
Elder Brother!

553
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,919
Brother, are you a Khitan?

554
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:49,100
To be honest, I am indeed a Khitan.

555
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:53,220
Brother, it is bitter cold on Jurchen land.

556
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,799
Why don't you follow me back to Shangjing and enjoy a wealthy life together?

557
00:41:56,799 --> 00:41:58,519
Thank you for your kindness.

558
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,299
But I have been poor.

559
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:02,120
When I live with the Jurchen,

560
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,139
I enjoy sumptuous meals and live a carefree life.

561
00:42:05,139 --> 00:42:07,939
I will pay you a visit when I miss you.

562
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:10,279
Elder Brother, you better depart now

563
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,159
lest that your family and subordinates worry about you.

564
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,120
Remember to visit me in the Liao Kingdom.

565
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,920
Elder Brother, take care.

566
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,480
Elder Brother, it is not safe to stay here for long.

567
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,080
Go home quick.

568
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,220
Thank you for saving my life.

569
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,939
I would like to see you off!

570
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,320
Elder Brother, you are so adorable.

571
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,900
You are in the enemy's camp. Yet, you still observe courtesy.

572
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,879
With such a spirit, I believe you must be of high standing among the Khitan.

573
00:42:51,879 --> 00:42:54,019
If anything happens to you here,

574
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:57,080
the Khitan definitely will not let it off easily.

603
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,390
I haven't seen you for so long. How have you been?

Hello, Elder Brother.

608
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,220
Such a pretty sister.
