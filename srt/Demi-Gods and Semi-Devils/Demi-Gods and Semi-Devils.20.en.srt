[Episode 20]

14
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,759
When the mother went to ask the boy,

15
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,979
she found him sharpening that dagger on the stone.

16
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,239
Where did you get the dagger?

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,020
Someone... Someone gave it to me.

18
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,740
Such a new dagger like this can be sold for two taels.

19
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,180
Who would randomly give it to you?

20
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,820
Does it hurt?

21
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,560
Come on.

22
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,719
Feng'er, you're father and I are poor.

23
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:13,179
We couldn't buy you any toys.

24
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,340
It's been very hard on you.

25
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,800
It's all right if you bought this dagger as a toy.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,340
However, you must hand over the extra money to me.

27
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,020
Your father is sick.

28
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,660
Let's buy a catty of meat to make some soup for him.

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,880
What do you mean by the extra money?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,199
You took our four taels to buy a dagger.

31
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,819
- Am I right?
- I didn't take the money.

32
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:40,580
- I really didn't take it.
- Still denying it?

33
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,799
I didn't take the money!

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,220
I really didn't take the money!

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,159
The boy was hurt and wronged.

36
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,800
He felt aggrieved and burst into tears.

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
The mother was upset,

38
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,700
but she didn't scold the boy.

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,840
The mother is very strange.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,679
It's common that poor families can't afford toys.

41
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,960
Why did the mother say she had made things harder for the boy?

42
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,100
Moreover, his father was sick.

43
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,659
The mother suspected that the boy stole the money.

44
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:18,699
She not only did not scold him but also treated him with such respect and politeness.

45
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,560
Don't you find it really strange?

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,420
Brother Qiao, whenever you channel your inner energy to me,

48
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,300
your inner energy will be reduced a little.

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,260
You treat me with such kindness.

50
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,460
I don't know how I should repay you.

51
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,079
What are you saying?

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,159
I only need to sit still and practice meditation for a few hours

53
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,100
to regain my inner energy.

54
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,439
Don't worry.

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,079
I'll definitely find a good physician to treat your injuries.

56
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,919
Brother Qiao, I want to continue listening to the story.

57
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,240
Later, when the boy had finished sharpening the dagger,

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,620
he heard his mother whisper to his father,

59
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,720
"Feng'er stole money to buy a dagger, but he denied it."

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,360
Just let him be.

61
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,220
We didn't give him much all along.

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,200
Feng'er.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,220
How did you fall so badly?

64
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,019
Father, I didn't steal the money.

65
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,020
I didn't buy the dagger, either.

66
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,759
Your mother worries too much.

67
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,040
It's not a big deal if the money is missing.

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,919
Yet, she made a fuss about it.

69
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,799
- Does it still hurt?
- It's fine.

70
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,859
- I really didn't steal the money.
- I know.

71
00:05:02,859 --> 00:05:04,880
You have been busy for hours.

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
Go and eat your dinner.

73
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,919
I'm not hungry. I'll go to bed now.

74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,740
The boy killed the physician?

75
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,239
The next day, the physician's family found that he was dead.

76
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,020
But the door was locked.

77
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,940
Hence, they suspected someone within the residence had killed the physician.

78
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,660
After a few years of dispute, the family broke up.

79
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,039
Later, it became an unsolved mystery in Xujiaji.

80
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,500
Xujiaji?

81
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,159
The physician was from this town?

82
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:46,600
Yes.

83
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,680
His surname was Deng.

84
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,879
He lived in the west of the town.

85
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,360
The physician looked down on the poor.

86
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,279
He treated the poor badly.

87
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,060
Although he was abominable,

88
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,220
but he didn't deserve to die that way.

89
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:07,559
Brother Qiao, did the seven-year-old boy really kill him?

90
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,839
The story isn't true, right?

91
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,160
It's a true story.

92
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,720
That boy is so cruel.

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,060
I am that boy.

94
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,660
Brother Qiao, I was just talking nonsense.

95
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,199
Please don't take it to heart.

96
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,600
I didn't mean it.

97
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,400
- I...
- I was so unforgiving.

98
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,520
Is it because I'm a Khitan?

99
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,679
Don't over-think it. He kicked your mother.

100
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,740
You have been heroic since young.

101
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,540
It's understandable that you killed him.

102
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,900
Not only did he kick my mother,

103
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,460
he also caused others to wrongly accuse me of what I did not do.

104
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,400
I can't stand being falsely wronged.

105
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,640
My father,

106
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,280
my mother,

107
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,100
and my master; I was accused of

108
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,640
all their deaths.

109
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,460
Who and why does this person want to frame me for such heinous crimes so badly?

110
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,539
Brother Qiao, I'm sure they are spreading rumors to slander you.

111
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,740
You are benevolent and righteous.

112
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,200
You even take good care

113
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,180
of an insignificant girl like me.

114
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,240
What if I really am a Khitan?

115
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,280
Would you still let me take care of you?

116
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,440
A Khitan?

117
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,180
Even among the Hans, there are good and bad people.

118
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:06,479
Being taken care of by you is my blessing.

119
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,220
I'll go out for a while. I'll be back soon.

120
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,680
Be careful.

121
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,040
Brother Bao.

122
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,859
- Brother Bao.
- Brother Xiang.

123
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,420
Come in.

124
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,999
Sixth Brother Qi of Guanxi has arrived, too.

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,819
- Master Xiang.
- Please.

126
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,840
Qiao Feng has been faking his kindness to deceive people.

127
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,919
When we fought together at Yanmen Pass,

128
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,359
I thought he was a great hero.

129
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:47,400
Now, he has committed heinous crimes.

130
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,839
Back then, he led us into the enemy's defense

131
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,739
to capture Prince of Chu and force the Liao Army to retreat.

132
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:54,839
I truly admired him.

133
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,180
When I heard them say that he was a Khitan,

134
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,920
I even argued with them and defended him.

135
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,679
He had kept his heritage a secret all this time,

136
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,439
but his true colors have finally come to light.

137
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,759
I never thought he was from Shaolin

138
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,999
and Reverend Xuan Ku was his master.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,860
This was a tightly-guarded secret.

140
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Only a handful from the Shaolin Sect knew about it.

141
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,919
This evil man killed his parents and master

142
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,959
and hid the truth about his heritage.

143
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,279
He silenced them so that the secret would never be found out.

144
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,299
However, his plans backfired, and his sins only grew.

145
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:26,879
Divine Physician Xue has been sending out Hero Invitations

146
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,380
to the entire martial arts world.

147
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,364
He is asking the heroes to gather at Heroes' Gathering Manor.

148
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,299
Brother Qi, what do you think is his purpose for doing so?

149
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:35,999
- Divine Physician Xue?
- In my humble opinion,

150
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,300
Divine Physician Xue did so

151
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,980
to get everyone to discuss how to deal with Qiao Feng.

152
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,539
I heard that Yanluo's Rival abhors evil.

153
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:46,319
Moreover, he has a close relationship

154
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,940
with Reverend Xuan Nan and Reverend Xuan Ji of the Shaolin Temple.

155
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,999
That's right.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,720
Recently, there have been no major incidents in the martial arts world

157
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,780
besides the evil doings of Qiao Feng.

158
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,279
It's a pity that the heroic Chief Wang

159
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,080
had made such a grave mistake.

160
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,079
They are acquainted with me.

161
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,220
But even they are saying such things about me.

162
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,460
Brother Qiao, what happened?

163
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:41,820
It's nothing.

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,800
Really?

165
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,519
Yes.

166
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,200
Get some rest.

167
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,060
If I have been unjustly framed,

168
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,520
why should I try so hard to be vindicated?

169
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,679
I should just go into seclusion

170
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,279
and have my friends and allies

171
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,720
in the martial arts world

172
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,280
forget about me.

173
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,860
Brother Qiao,

174
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,000
you must be feeling hurt. Right?

175
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,800
Tomorrow, I'll look for the best physician for you.

176
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,400
We'll definitely heal your injuries.

177
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,740
All right. I'll leave everything to you.

178
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,320
Cousin. Good morning.

179
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,679
Good morning, Cousin.

180
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
Take a seat.

181
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,780
Let's have breakfast.

182
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,500
Here.

183
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,380
This is your favorite.

184
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,260
- Here.
- Thank you, Cousin.

185
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,380
Young Master, what would you like to have?

186
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,620
Young Master.

187
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,660
No need to fret, Cousin.

188
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,540
Greetings, Crown Prince's Heir of the Dali Kingdom.

189
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Please rise.

190
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,019
Young Master, we have finally found you.

191
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,279
Your Highness is safe and sound.

192
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,819
It's a blessing for the Dali Kingdom and our people.

193
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:51,800
Welcome home, Your Highness.

194
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,680
Greetings, it's Qiao Feng.

195
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,490
[Greetings]

196
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,359
You may take my head anytime you want.

197
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:54,759
Since you could even kill your parents and master,

198
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,879
you don't have to be merciful

199
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,740
with mere acquaintances like us.

200
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,659
We have not met since we fended off enemies from Yanmen Pass.

201
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:06,779
I heard that Yanluo's Rival, Divine Physician Xue, is sending out Hero invitations.

202
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,360
I need a favor from you.

203
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,780
I hope you can lead me to the gathering.

204
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,799
The Heroes Gathering will be held at the Heroes' Gathering Manor, about 70-li northeast from here.

205
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:21,780
All odds are against you if you attend.

206
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,779
- Don't blame me for not reminding you beforehand.
- I understand.

207
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:28,460
The Heroes Banquet will be held at Heroes' Gathering Manor.

208
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,439
Then, the host must be the two heroes of the You Family.

209
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,880
You may depart first.

210
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,680
I'll take my time and depart two hours later,

211
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,680
so you have the time to be well-prepared.

212
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,339
All right. In this case, we will

213
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,720
wait for you to arrive at the Heroes' Gathering Manor.

214
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,819
When Jiu Mozhi abducted you, His Majesty immediately contacted the Song

215
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,180
to seek their help locating you.

216
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,219
A few days ago, we received news that you were in Luoyang.

217
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:09,459
We rushed there immediately but failed to find you.

218
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,959
The good are protected by Heaven.

219
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,439
Since Your Highness is safe and sound, we can be rest assured then.

220
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,959
Your Highness, please come back with us.

221
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,980
When Princess Consort heard that you had been abducted,

222
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,179
she was so worried that she couldn't eat and sleep well.

223
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,899
She will be very happy when you return safe and sound.

224
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,480
Sirs, wait for a while.

225
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,760
Miss Wang,

226
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,479
I will have to bid you farewell for now.

227
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,280
I'm not an educated man.

228
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,379
If I have offended you in any way in our travels,

229
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,580
I hope you will forgive me.

230
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,380
Miss Wang,

231
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,639
I hope you'll meet a husband who is hundreds of times better than me soon.

232
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:16,599
Someone who loves you, cares for you,

233
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:19,679
respects you, and protects you.

234
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,140
Someone who makes you happy every day.

235
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,160
In that case, I will have no regrets

236
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,540
when I think of you from afar.

237
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,920
Young Master Duan, I wish you a safe journey.

238
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,019
After today's farewell, we might not be able to meet again

239
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:55,340
in this vast world.

240
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,180
Why bother remembering me then?

241
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,540
Cousin, let's depart.

242
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,080
All right.

243
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,599
Young Master, let's depart.

244
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,060
The horse carriage is waiting at the entrance.

245
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,700
That was quite a scene when Young Master Duan's men came in.

246
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,319
I didn't know about his true identity.

247
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,679
Cousin, did you know about it?

248
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,399
I don't know him well.

249
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,599
I only knew he was from Dali.

250
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,679
He came to Mandarava Villa because he was being hunted down.

251
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,980
I don't know anything else about him.

252
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,860
I heard that the Dali emperor has no children.

253
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,460
The only heir is the son of the Crown Prince, Prince Zhennan.

254
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,520
Just now, I heard they addressed Young Master Duan as Crown Prince's heir.

255
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,140
I guess it must be him.

256
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,080
He's the future emperor of the Dali Kingdom?

257
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,760
Absurd.

258
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,759
Are you Young Master Murong?

259
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,420
Yes, I am.

260
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,500
May I know who you are?

261
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,720
I'm Shan Zheng, the Stern Faced Judge.

262
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,799
I'm heading to the Martial Arts Meeting at Heroes' Gathering Manor with my five sons.

263
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,479
We'll be planning how to eliminate the villain Qiao Feng

264
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,919
to remove harm from the pugilist world.

265
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,540
What's going on?

266
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,639
Hero Qiao is a person with integrity.

267
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,620
Why did you call him a villain?

268
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,279
And why are you trying to eliminate him?

269
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,860
I suppose you have not heard of what happened.

270
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,639
After Qiao Feng's true identity came to light, he turned into a violent man.

271
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:48,779
He killed his father, his mother, and his master.

272
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,319
He's on a killing spree.

273
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,759
He is despised by the entire pugilist world now.

274
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,999
Divine Physician Xue sent out invitations to gather everyone

275
00:20:56,999 --> 00:21:00,420
to discuss how to eliminate the villain Qiao Feng.

276
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,339
I heard Young Master Murong is highly skilled in martial arts.

277
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:07,919
I wonder if Young Master Murong would be interested in joining us?

278
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,660
Well...

279
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,199
Cousin, you can't do that.

280
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,419
When you were framed, it was Hero Qiao who defended us.

281
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:17,999
He also saved A'Zhu and A'Bi.

282
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,639
When the Beggars' Sect revolted against him, he didn't take it to heart.

283
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,940
Instead, he merely shouldered the blame and protected them.

284
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,400
Such a righteous person would never perform such unfaithful and unfilial acts.

285
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,599
That's right, Young Master.

286
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,839
When I was poisoned in Xingzi Forest, I was saved by Qiao Feng.

287
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,339
When it comes to killing his own father, mother, and master,

288
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,980
I'll be the first person to disbelieve it.

289
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,519
These small kind acts are Qiao Feng's tricks.

290
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,640
Please don't be deceived by him.

291
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,639
Qiao Feng has been committing vicious acts all around.

292
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,060
It's a good opportunity for Young Master Murong to show how skillful you are.

293
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,979
Young Master Murong, please make a prompt decision.

294
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,359
I shall take my leave now, then.

295
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,460
Heroes of the martial arts world will be waiting for you at Heroes' Gathering Manor.

296
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,600
- Farewell.
- Farewell.

297
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,199
Young Master, no matter what,

298
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,939
we must repay kindness with kindness, and harm with harm.

299
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,820
We must not fight against Chief Qiao.

300
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,379
No, that's not so.

301
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:27,119
Firstly, Qiao Feng is no longer the Chief of the Beggars' Sect.

302
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,520
Secondly, he's a Khitan.

303
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,380
He's also embroiled in many disputes.

304
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,319
That makes him an enemy of the pugilist world.

305
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,959
If Young Master comes forward now,

306
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,140
it will be a chance for you to prove yourself and gain standing in the pugilist world.

307
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,599
You'll win the hearts of many.

308
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,200
Our Young Master isn't a Han.

309
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,920
Why should he risk offending Qiao Feng for those people?

310
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,840
Young Master, what do you think?

311
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,339
This invitation was sent out by Yanluo's Rival, Divine Physician Xue.

312
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,839
All heroes will be present there.

313
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,080
It's an opportunity for us to get acquainted with him.

314
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,939
If we run into trouble one day, he might be of use to us.

315
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:04,139
If we help the heroes of the pugilist world to remove their troubles,

316
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:08,219
we'll also gain prestige and favor for the Murong clan.

317
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:12,279
How can we miss such an opportunity?

318
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,479
But I feel that Hero Qiao has no malicious intentions toward us.

319
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:20,519
On the contrary, he has helped us repeatedly.

320
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,459
How can we be soft-hearted when it comes to restoring our kingdom?

321
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:28,000
Third Brother Bao. Fourth Brother Feng. Take Cousin and A'Bi back to Swallow's Nest.

322
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,939
Everyone else, follow me to Heroes' Gathering Manor.

323
00:23:30,939 --> 00:23:32,920
Yes, Young Master.

324
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,180
[Heroes' Gathering Manor]

325
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,740
[Value Righteousness Rather Than Material Gain]

326
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,180
[Heroes' Gathering Manor]

327
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,340
Brother Shan, you arrived on time.

328
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:10,132
You're here, Old Master Tan and Old Madam Tan.

329
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,840
Amitabha.

330
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,140
Greetings, Elders.

331
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,459
Manor Master!

332
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,819
Manor Master, Qiao Feng is here.

333
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:30,839
- Qiao Feng is really here?
- The audacity!

334
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:33,520
That's right!

335
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,860
Mr. Xue, forgive me for coming uninvited.

336
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,519
Brother Qiao, what can I do for you?

337
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,980
I have acted recklessly.

338
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,319
I have made this young lady get hit by a palm move and suffered a serious injury.

339
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:46,179
In this world, no one else but Mr. Xue will be able to heal her.

340
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,860
Mr. Xue, please save her life.

341
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,959
What is the lady's surname?

342
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,719
What is her relationship with you?

343
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,860
She's a maid of my friend.

344
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,579
You must have a good relationship with your friend.

345
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:02,100
Otherwise, you would not have gone to such great lengths.

346
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,960
I have only met this friend a few times.

347
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,920
All right then.

348
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,020
Let me check her pulse first.

349
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,880
Thank you, Sir.

350
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,419
If it weren't for Old Master Tan's elixir

351
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,980
and your inner energy,

352
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,479
she would have already died from Abbot Xuan Ci's Great Vajra Palm.

353
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:01,660
Why would she get our elixir?

354
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,319
Have you forgotten? That day in Xingzi Forest...

355
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,260
It's her?

356
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,820
When did the abbot hit this lady

357
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,479
with the Great Vajra Palm?

358
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,999
That's right, Mr. Xue.

359
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,959
The abbot has not left the monastery for years.

360
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,460
Moreover, the Shaolin Temple forbids women from entering its compound.

361
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,539
This Great Vajra Palm cannot possibly be the doing of our abbot.

362
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:36,839
But as far as I know, no one besides Abbot Xuan Ci has mastered the Great Vajra Palm.

363
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:42,120
Qiao Feng, you trespassed Shaolin Temple and killed Reverend Xuan Ku.

364
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,779
You had also blocked our abbot's Great Vajra Palm.

365
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:50,339
If she was indeed hit by Abbot Xuan Ci's move,

366
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:54,900
she couldn't have possibly survived it.

367
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,460
Reverend Xuan Ku is my master.

368
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,999
I have yet to repay his kindness.

369
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,919
Even if I have to sacrifice my own life,

370
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,439
I will never kill my master.

371
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,700
Still denying it?

372
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,999
Then, where is the Shaolin senior monk you captured?

373
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:15,999
Are you trying to say that this was not your doing as well?

374
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:21,940
May I ask who the senior monk I've captured is?

375
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,979
Shaolin is an esteemed and prestigious existence in the pugilist world.

376
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:29,959
You entered and left Shaolin all by yourself and killed Reverend Xuan Ku.

377
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:33,259
You not only escaped unscathed but also captured a Shaolin senior monk.

378
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:34,780
This is absurd.

379
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,020
There must be something strange going on.

380
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,540
What you've said are either lies or incomplete truth.

381
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,759
There are many things that you don't understand.

382
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,179
The same goes for me, too.

383
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:49,219
No matter what, my senior didn't hurt this lady.

384
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:51,220
Abbot Xuan Ci is a compassionate person.

385
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,919
He would never hurt a lady.

386
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:59,199
There must be someone disguising as someone from Shaolin to deceive and harm others.

387
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:02,839
Miss, who hurt you?

388
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,599
Where did you get hurt?

389
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,479
Where is the person now?

390
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:11,439
This matter is related to Shaolin's reputation.

391
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,099
Miss, you must explain it clearly.

392
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,959
Miss, explain it clearly to us

393
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:28,540
so that Mr. Xue can save your life.

394
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:36,239
Reverends, it was a young man who hurt me.

395
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:38,260
He looked handsome and aloof.

396
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,839
He should be around 27 or 28 years old.

397
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,739
At that time, Brother Qiao and I

398
00:30:44,739 --> 00:30:47,360
were in a restaurant talking about

399
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,719
Divine Physician Xue's superb medical skills.

400
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:54,599
His skills not only have no equal in this world

401
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,279
but are also unprecedented.

402
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,699
No one else in this world has such remarkable skills.

403
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:05,039
I think even the deities are incomparable to Divine Physician Xue.

404
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,479
At that time, I said that with Divine Physician Xue around,

405
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:11,679
there is no need for us to learn martial arts.

406
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,779
But then Brother Qiao asked me why.

407
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:17,900
I told him that with Divine Physician Xue around,

408
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,219
he will save as many lives as those who are harmed.

409
00:31:21,219 --> 00:31:24,179
If two are harmed by others, he will save both of them.

410
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,479
What's the point of learning martial arts, then?

411
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,380
- That's right.
- Yes.

412
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,719
The man who sat at a table near us suddenly said with a sneer,

413
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:38,079
"All the palm techniques in the world are soft and weak."

414
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:42,780
"That Divine Physician Xue's reputation is undeserving."

415
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,819
He said, "Let's see if he can heal the injury caused by my palm strike."

416
00:31:46,819 --> 00:31:50,359
Right after he said so, he was already in the air

417
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,099
and attacked me with his palm strike.

418
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:55,999
All of a sudden, I felt dizzy.

419
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,239
I felt powerless and with no strength left.

420
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,159
I only heard the man say,

421
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,879
"Ask Divine Physician Xue

422
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,939
to study the medical books thoroughly and practice hard."

423
00:32:04,939 --> 00:32:08,919
"So that in the future, he'll be able to treat Abbot Xuan Ci's illness."

424
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:12,259
"When that time comes, he won't be at a loss then."

425
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:13,839
What do you mean?

426
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,059
This might mean that he intends

427
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:23,439
to defeat Abbot Xuan Ci with this very move in the future.

428
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:26,259
"Fight fire with fire"?

429
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:27,399
Murong Fu!

430
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,560
So it was the Murong clan, after all!

431
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,399
Qiao Feng,

432
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:35,999
what exactly is your relationship with Murong Fu?

433
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:39,300
Let's not talk about that first.

434
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,639
Her life is at stake.

435
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,519
Mr. Xue, you are benevolent and kind.

436
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:47,320
I hope this has moved your compassionate heart.

437
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,439
It doesn't matter who brought her here.

438
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,340
I'll heal her all the same.

439
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,260
However, because it's you who brought her here,

440
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,480
I will not heal her.

441
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,799
Saving a life is of boundless beneficence.

442
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:22,159
Mr. Xue, you have been doing meritorious deeds in the martial arts world.

443
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,979
If you're willing to save her life today,

444
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:29,039
I will never forget your kindness.

445
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,339
Will never forget my kindness?

446
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:39,079
Do you think you will be able to leave the Heroes' Gathering Manor alive today?

447
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:41,359
- That's right!
- Dream on!

448
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,759
You won't be able to leave!

449
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,340
That's right!

450
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,839
Everyone here are great men.

451
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:52,860
You know what is right and wrong.

452
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:57,299
You have gathered here today to discuss how to deal with me.

453
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,999
How could I not know about this?

454
00:33:58,999 --> 00:34:02,739
Whether I'll save her or not, will depend on my mood.

455
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,599
No one can force me to do it.

456
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,970
Qiao Feng, you have committed heinous sins.

457
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,590
We were planning to capture you

458
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,430
to cut you into pieces as an offering to your parents and master.

459
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,280
And you presented yourself at our door.

460
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,859
That's the best that could happen.

461
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:17,519
Qiao Feng, take your own life then.

462
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,959
- Take your own life!
- Yes!

463
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,800
Take your own life!

464
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,399
All of you say that I'm a Khitan

465
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,740
and want to eliminate me.

466
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,080
But at this moment,

467
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,360
I, myself, don't even know for sure

468
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,060
whether I'm a Khitan or a Song.

469
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,580
If I'm a Song,

470
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,780
Mr. Xue, because you have insulted me,

471
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,680
I will never let go of this matter.

472
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,799
If I'm a Khitan,

473
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:17,740
and I decide to treat Song as my enemy,

474
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,599
then I'll kill you first

475
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,919
lest that you save all the Songs I kill in the future.

476
00:35:25,919 --> 00:35:27,820
No matter what,

477
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,280
you were going to kill me anyway.

478
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,100
I beg you one last time.

479
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,600
Please save her.

480
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,700
A life for a life.

481
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,780
If you save her,

482
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,015
I shall never lay a hand on you.

483
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,379
I have been treating and healing people all my life.

484
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:51,299
I only accept sincere requests.

485
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,039
Not threats.

486
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:55,200
The same applies to you.

487
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,720
Brother Qiao!

488
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,600
I don't want to get healed.

489
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm only an ordinary maid.

490
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,759
I'm not worthy of sacrificing your life for.

491
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:10,220
I don't want you to die!

492
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,780
Whether a person's life is precious has nothing to do with status.

493
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,800
I promised to find the best physician for you.

494
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,240
I will keep my words.

495
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,980
Both Brother You's,

496
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,980
I see many old friends here today.

497
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,959
After today, we will be enemies.

498
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,700
I can't help but feel a little upset about that.

499
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,179
I would like to ask for some wine.

500
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,759
All right. Serve the wine!

501
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,770
[Heroes' Gathering Manor]

502
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,360
Most of you are my acquaintances.

503
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,999
Some of you are sect brothers with whom I shared good moments.

504
00:37:58,999 --> 00:38:01,080
Some of you are warriors

505
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,180
who have fought with me

506
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,380
against the Liao Army at Yanmen Pass.

507
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:09,499
I will never forget these memories and sentiments.

508
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:13,479
Since we are in dispute today,

509
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,880
we'll toast to a clean break.

510
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,639
Those who want to kill me

511
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,879
may come forward for a toast.

512
00:38:24,879 --> 00:38:28,899
From now on, we'll break off our relationships.

513
00:38:28,899 --> 00:38:30,760
If I kill you,

514
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,300
I am not ungrateful.

515
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,260
If you kill me,

516
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,820
you are not ungrateful either.

517
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,380
Heroes of the world

518
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,940
will be our witnesses.

519
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,520
Who would like to go first?

520
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,120
- Me!
- Who is she?

521
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,799
How could it be her?

522
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,720
It's Madam Ma.

523
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,400
Why is she here?

524
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,500
My late husband died in your hands.

525
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,359
We are no longer acquainted.

526
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,679
I can't finish this as I have low alcohol tolerance.

527
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:25,980
Life, death, and revenge

528
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,500
are like this wine.

529

00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:24,510
♫ In this life, no matter who is laughing at me ♫

533
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:28,660
♫ I will not go mad or be unreasonable ♫

534
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:33,190
♫ I have crossed seas and mountains of hardships ♫

535
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,530
♫ Everything has it's earnings ♫

536
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,540
♫ All the things that happened in the past are as clear as ink ♫

537
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,310
♫ I wait for it to run dry and then start to tint ♫

538
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:52,500
♫ All worldly desires are like mountains and valleys ♫

539
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,420
♫ Borrowing rain's tears as the water rushes out  ♫

540
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,790
♫ If you come across me in this life,
who cares if it's life or death in the end ♫

541
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,920
♫ I might as well become a river ♫

542
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,450
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

543
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,810
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

544
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:17,970
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

545
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,150
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

546
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,960
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

547
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:35,670
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

548
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,900
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

549
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:45,130
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

550
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:48,700
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

551
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:53,130
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

552
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,220
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

553
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:02,690
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

554
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,170
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

555
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:17,470
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

556
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:28,030
Qiao, I'll drink with you!

557
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:31,500
That day when we were going against the Liao Army, you ran away.

558
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,660
What qualifications do you have to drink with me?

559
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,120
Drinking this wine today is with the heroes that I have favors with so that we can cut off all relations.

560
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:41,900
Me and you? What relations do we have?
