00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:33,033
[Episode 41]

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,159
How could you be rude to the chief?

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,060
This is the new chief you chose after you went through all that trouble?

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,180
When you said he had something important to do, is this what you meant?

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,659
Quan Guanqing, how dare you!

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,640
Brother Quan, who is he?

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,719
- What happened?
- What happened?

20
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,220
A man who only knows to take care of a woman.

21
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,959
A man who wears a mask and dares not to show his true face.

22
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,119
Someone like that had actually become the chief of the Beggars' Sect!

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,380
Think about it!

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,999
Tell me now!

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,540
Quan Guanqing,
[Let fame and reputation sweep the world]

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,140
you have to blame me for being blind,

27
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,839
as I didn't see your true colors.

28
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,339
You took the chance and let this useless brat take the position!

29
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:30,680
And let you kill those who opposed you in the sect and do just as you please!

30
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,440
But since I'm back,

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,240
all of this is over!

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,560
Listen.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,100
As long as I'm here,

34
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,519
I won't allow you to destroy the Beggars' Sect!

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,180
You dare to fight with me?

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,280
Brother Zhuang, you should help me!

37
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,359
Greetings, Master.

38
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,799
Please drop the formalities and rise.

39
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,260
Thank you, Master.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,519
The Mortality Talismans on your bodies have been removed.

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,800
You don't need to worry anymore!

42
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,799
Thank you, Master, for removing the Mortality Talismans on our bodies.

43
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,739
We are indebted to you as you saved our lives!

44
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:08,819
But we have troubled you for days, and you need rest,

45
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:10,959
so we're going back now.

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,959
If you ever need us in the future, we will come right away, Master!

47
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:22,340
- We're always ready!
- All right!

48
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,260
Let us meet again in the future.

49
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,040
Farewell!

50
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,720
I want to head down, too.

51
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,140
Master, do you have something to do?

52
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,200
I can send someone else.

53
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,320
You guys don't know. I'm an orphan.

54
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,160
The monks and the reverends in the temple raised me.

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,860
The Five Commandments of Buddhism have been destroyed.

56
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,100
If I don't go back to Shaolin Temple and receive my punishment,

57
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,280
I would be utmost ungrateful.

58
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,340
I must go back to the Shaolin Temple.

59
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,039
I need to tell the abbot and the masters the truth,

60
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,400
and willingly accept my punishment.

61
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,780
- But Master...
- Grandma Yu.

62
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,540
I'll be leaving Lingjiu Palace.

63
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:38,659
Please take care of all the matters in the palace along with the others.

64
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,500
Thank you for your hard work.

65
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,000
Understood.

66
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,299
Master, if you want to head down,

67
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,079
we can go with you.

68
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,959
So we can serve you, too.

69
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,359
You can't do that.

70
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,159
I'm going back to the temple to receive punishment. If you guys follow me,

71
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,340
it won't do at all.

72
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,239
Thank you all for your concern.

73
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,880
But I've made my decision.

74
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,480
Oh, no!  We were too late.

75
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,479
It's strange. They're members of the Beggars' Sect.

76
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,359
Who could have done such a thing to them?

77
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,999
It looks like an ambush.

78
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,499
Since we saw them, we shouldn't leave their bodies in the wild.

79
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:36,480
Let's bury them.

80
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,639
He's alive!

81
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,360
Get him up!

82
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,320
Are you all right?

83
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,799
I can't live any longer.

84
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,780
I took two stabs to my chest.

85
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,079
I can't live any longer.

86
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,639
Who did this to you?

87
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,300
It pains me to say this.

88
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,039
But it was internal strife within the Beggars' Sect.

89
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,440
The new chief of the Beggars' Sect, Zhuang Juxian is just a puppet.

90
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,360
He only listens to the traitor, Quan Guanqing.

91
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,839
Most of us refused to accept Zhuang Juxian as chief.

92
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,620
So, Quan Guanqing sent someone after us.

93
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,400
I see.

94
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,620
Who is this Zhuang? What is his background?

95
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,439
He's really skilled in martial arts.

96
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,100
Some time ago, the Beggars' Sect held a tournament to select a new chief.

97
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,279
He's a powerful martial artist.

98
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,400
He killed over a dozen of our brethren, and he became the chief.

99
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,959
Hey, don't rush.

100
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,579
I'll inspect your wounds now. You can tell us the rest once you've been treated.

101
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:36,180
Thank you.

102
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,880
I don't think I'll be able to make it.

103
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,680
This is the son-in-law recruitment document from the king of Xixia Kingdom.

104
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,699
Please help me to deliver it to any of the elders.

105
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:54,620
You mustn't deliver it to the bastard Quan Guanqing!

106
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Don't worry.

107
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,779
If you don't manage to recover, I promise

108
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,119
I'll deliver this document to the elders of your sect.

109
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,540
I, Yi Dabiao, will be really, really grateful

110
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,080
in the underworld.

111
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,130
[Annuciation]

112
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,140
The Beggars' Sect is loyal to Song.

113
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,180
He wanted to bring this document back.

114
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,359
Seems like he hoped the younger heroes would try to acquire the Xixia's princess' hand in marriage.

115
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:41,600
If the Song and the Xixia were to form a marriage alliance,

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,980
it would certainly make them invincible.

117
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,940
I think this is what the beggar planned.

118
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,860
But the marriage between the Song and the Xixia Kingdom may not go well.

119
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,539
If the Liao Kingdom, Tibet Empire, Dali Kingdom,

120
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:11,620
and other kingdoms receive news of this, they'll definitely intervene.

121
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,480
I think that's not all they would do.

122
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,219
Everyone wants to marry the princess of Xixia Kingdom and reap the benefits of the marriage alliance.

123
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:24,719
We've been trying to restore Yan for hundreds of years now but to no avail.

124
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:29,180
In the end, the cause of it all lies in the fact that we lack strong support and an ally.

125
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,620
If the Xixia Kingdom were to become in-laws with the Murong Clan of Yan Nation,

126
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,220
with their reinforcements to support us, we would definitely be successful

127
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,079
in our attempt to stage a rebellion and restore our nation in the Central Plains.

128
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,440
You may be right,

129
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,260
but who knows if our young master is willing to do so?

130
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,980
I'll head over there for a moment.

131
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,120
Is something the matter?

132
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,919
During the Spring and Autumn period,

133
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,119
it was a tradition for the Qin and Jin to form a marriage alliance.

134
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,719
After losing his kingdom, Chong'er, the young master of Jin, fled.

135
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:09,070
The Duke Mu of Qin sent soldiers to escort him back to the Jin Kingdom,

136
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,890
and contributed to the success of the duke.

137
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,239
You mean I should go to the Xixia Kingdom to marry the princess?

138
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,280
Young Master, to be honest, as long as it can help us to rebuild the Yan Nation,

139
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,670
you shouldn't mind whether the princess is beautiful or ugly, or if she is wicked or not.

140
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,480
Even if she was as ugly as an old pig,

141
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,290
I would marry her no matter what as long as she's willing to marry me.

142
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,180
No one can compare to our young master

143
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,179
when it comes to appearance, character, talent, and martial arts!

144
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,599
It's clearly written on the document.

145
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,520
The requirement of the candidate is not based on status or title,

146
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,399
but one's character and abilities.

147
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,660
Young Master,

148
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,800
the responsibility of restoring the Murong clan's glory and ambition from over the centuries

149
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,720
lies on your shoulders.

150
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,279
Young Master, you'll be Duke Wen of Jin Kingdom.

151
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,619
The rest of us will be Hu Mao, Hu Yan, and Jie Zitui.

152
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,020
Young Master, you can only achieve great things if you're willing to make sacrifices.

153
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:41,180
Heroes shouldn't put love as a priority.

154
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,799
Young Master, you mustn't let something like love and romance

155
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,980
get in the way of restoring the Yan Nation.

156
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,819
If we can rebuild Yan Nation, you'll be the ruler of Dongxing,

157
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,540
and the princess of Xixia will be the empress.

158
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,000
You could make Miss Wang the Consort of the West Palace.

159
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,100
No one will stop you.

160
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,759
You guys are right.

161
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,640
This is a great chance to rebuild the Yan Nation.

162
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,279
But we have to keep our word.

163
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,939
This document should be handed to the elders of the Beggars' Sect first

164
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:15,240
before we head to the Xixia Kingdom.

165
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,679
Young Master, you're right.

166
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,659
In that case, let us depart for the main branch of the Beggars' Sect now.

167
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:23,800
Along the way, we should send Miss Wang back to the Mandavara Villa first

168
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,000
to prevent her from learning of this and causing us unnecessary trouble.

169
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,620
My cousin is pure and innocent.

170
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,800
I will explain it to her after I marry the princess of the Xixia Kingdom.

171
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,120
Please come inside.

172
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,340
Have a seat.

173
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,200
Here is your tea. Please enjoy.

174
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,599
Cousin, the members of the Beggars' Sect were killed.

175
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:02,759
There's a sinister plot involved.

176
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,920
I need to head to the Beggars' Sect to investigate the matter.

177
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,059
I haven't been able to take care of you these days, and I've put you in fear.

178
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,000
I would like to send you back to the Mandarava Villa first.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,699
When I've settled the matter, I'll come back for you.

180
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:17,859
No, I can't go back.

181
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:20,560
Mother will kill me if she sees me.

182
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
Why would she?

183
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,159
Although my aunt is an impatient person, you are her only daughter.

184
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,919
How could she kill you?

185
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,580
She'll only scold you a little.

186
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,740
No, I want to go to the Beggars' Sect with you.

187
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,940
Cousin, you're a girl.

188
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,600
It's not right if you keep showing up in public with us.

189
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,920
How about this?

190
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,399
Since you don't want to go back, you can stay at my house in the Swallow's Nest for the time being.

191
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:52,500
I'll come back to you when I've settled everything.

192
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,659
All right. It's enough to send me off from here.

193
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:18,539
Master, when will you return?

194
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm not sure about this.

195
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,699
I've to tell the abbot and the other masters about my situation first before I know when I'll be able to return.

196
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,239
Farewell, everyone.

197
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,120
Farewell, Master.

198
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,020
Master will be away for a while.

199
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,830
For the time being, everyone must take extra precautions and guard the Lingjiu Palace.

200
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,520
Yes!

201
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,100
Let's follow him.

202
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,060
But didn't Master say not to follow him?

203
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,939
Although Master is good in martial arts, he's honest and upright.

204
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:16,780
He might be bullied by others.

205
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,699
We'll just follow him discreetly and not let him find out about us.

206
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:22,019
Yes, that's right. Let's follow him.

207
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,620
Let's go.

208
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,879
Your Highness, Song is just up ahead.

209
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,879
Do you have any news about A'Zi?

210
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,879
No.

211
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,259
But according to the information from our men, Miss A'Zi is still with a man named Zhuang.

212
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,620
They've been staying in the main branch of the Beggars' Sect.

213
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,759
In that case, we'll head to Luoyang first.

214
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,320
[Shaolin Temple]

215
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,720
A few months have passed,

216
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,440
I've broken a lot of rules and commandments.

217
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,080
I wonder if the abbot and the other masters will forgive me

218
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,680
and allow me to resume my practice as a monk again

219
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,750
[Shaolin Temple]

220
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,880
What happened? Did you eat meat?

221
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,960
Yes. And not only meat.

222
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,300
You...

223
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,200
Did you drink liquor?

224
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,880
Master, I've broken many other commandments as well.

225
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,640
Kneel!

226
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,740
You're young,

227
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,859
but you broke a lot of rules!

228
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:25,090
Today, if... if I don't beat you up today,

229
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,560
I won't be able to quell my rage!

230
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,700
Does it not hurt?

231
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Martial Brother, since it's a punishment,

232
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,380
you shouldn't go easy on me.

233
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,419
Martial Brother, please beat me harder.

234
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,680
Martial Brother, you're right to hit me.

235
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,040
I...

236
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,080
Martial Brother, I deserve to be punished.

237
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,420
Martial Brother. Martial Brother.

238
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,859
Martial Brother, take a break first before you continue the punishment.

239
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,420
Get off! I'll beat you to death! I...

240
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,879
I've broken a lot of rules, I should receive severe punishment.

241
00:19:17,879 --> 00:19:21,399
Yes, that's right! Severe punishment! I'll punish you...

242
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:25,279
You must carry 100 buckets of manure every day to water my vegetables.

243
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,439
If you carry one bucket less, I'll use this whip...

244
00:19:28,439 --> 00:19:32,079
I'll use this pole to break your legs!

245
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,820
All right.

246
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,900

Look at the poor state of this road. Fix it.

273
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,319
Martial Brother. Martial Brother.

274
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,500
Why do you still have that on?

275
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,080
Come on.

276
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
Martial Brother,

277
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,940
these are the rules. Aren't they?

278
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,460
My words count.

279
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,180
Don't ask so many questions.

280
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,179
Martial Brother, let me help you. Come on.

281
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,320
I'll do it myself.

282
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,560
- Martial Brother, have some water.
- Thank you.

283
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,599
Sorry for offending you these past two days.

284
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,359
Please forgive me for my mistakes in the past. Could you?

285
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,540
I don't understand what you're saying.

286
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,919
I know. You still won't forgive me.

287
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,400
Martial Brother!

288
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,199
What... What do you mean by this?

289
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,220
No.

290
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,959
I meant to save my eyes.

291
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,900
I'll only stop if you promise to forgive me!

292
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,700
Martial Brother, what are you talking about?

293
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,439
I never said I would gouge your eyes.

294
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,599
Yes, you didn't. But they did!

295
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,819
They said that if you don't forgive me in person,

296
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:38,520
they will gouge my eyes out.

297
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,820
- They will gouge my eyes out!
- Martial Brother!

298
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,359
All right, Martial Brother.

299
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,660
- I forgive you.
- Really?

300
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,560
Martial Brother, I've never blamed you.

301
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,300
Thank you!

302
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,420
Thank you so much!

303
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,340
Martial Brother, there is no need for this.

304
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,520
Abbot has tolled the bells to gather everyone.

305
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,260
Something big must have happened in the temple.

306
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,540
Martial Brother, may I go and have a look?

307
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,180
Sure. Hurry.

308
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,100
Xu Zhu?

309
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,620
What are you doing there?

310
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Come here.

311
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,300
Master, didn't I tell you to receive punishment in the vegetable garden?

312
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,839
What are you doing here?

313
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,660
Master, I heard the bells back there.

314
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,579
- So... I came...
- Abbot is here.

315
00:26:22,579 --> 00:26:25,360
- Abbot is here.
- Abbot.

316
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,900
Behave well.

317
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,300
Come.

318
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,080
Stand here.

319
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,479
This is the abbot of Qingliang Temple from Wutai Mountain.

320
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,560
Master Shen Shan.

321
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,399
This is a master from Tianzhu.

322
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,000
Given dharma name, Zhe Luoxing.

323
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:24,640
And a master from the Daxiangguo Temple in Kaifeng, Henan. Master Guan Xin.

324
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,239
Master Dao Qing, from Pudu Temple, Jiangnan.

325
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,820
Master Rong Zhi of Jingying Temple, Changan.

326
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,880
Let's greet each other.

327
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,520
You have all graced our temple with your presence today.

328
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,100
It is indeed an honor for our temple.

329
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,620
We are looking forward to the speeches at the altar that promote Buddhism,

330
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,330
unite all monks, and for us to benefit from each others' wisdom.

331
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,960
I am humbled.

332
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,119
Shaolin Temple is an esteemed place.

333
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,260
I've long wanted to be here.

334
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,239
Decades ago, I came here to pray for precepts,

335
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,120
but I was turned away.

336
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,779
Back then, I had come to pray for precepts because I admired Shaolin Temple,

337
00:28:05,779 --> 00:28:08,639
the place that had dominated the martial arts world for hundreds of years

338
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,519
and the origin of martial arts.

339
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,879
More importantly, Shaolin Temple was said

340
00:28:14,879 --> 00:28:17,359
to emphasize strict discipline and uphold righteousness and fairness.

341
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,419
However, it turned out that there had been lies in those rumors.

342
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,799
If I had known it,

343
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,380
I would not have visited Shaolin Temple back then.

344
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,299
Martial Brother, why do you utter such things?

345
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,359
Shaolin is neither an official government nor a private clan.

346
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,860
So how can you detain outsiders as you wish?

347
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,420
Let me ask you this, Abbot.

348
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:43,239
Shaolin Temple has committed such brutal and unjust acts.

349
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:48,520
Can it still be called a place of benevolence and kindness?

350
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,700
You accused our temple of being aggressive and unjust.

351
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,540
Those are some serious accusations.

352
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,079
This is Master Zhe Luoxing. His younger martial brother, Bo Luoxing,

353
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,940
is being detained in this temple.

354
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,860
Seven years ago,

355
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,679
a senior monk from Tianzhu, Martial Brother Bo Luoxing, came to our temple.

356
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,159
Every monk in the temple was delighted and we greeted him respectfully.

357
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,600
Martial Brother Bo Luoxing said that heretics prevailed in Tianzhu,

358
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,080
and most of the Buddhist scriptures were lost.

359
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,239
Abbot immediately accompanied him to Tripitaka Library.

360
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,879
Younger Martial Brother Xuan Can was ordered by the abbot

361
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,639
to assist and supervise the monks to copy texts.

362
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,479
But unexpectedly, we discovered that Master Bo Luoxing

363
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:42,799
had snuck into the Tripitaka Library every night to peek at the secret martial arts scriptures of our temple.

364
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,160
These secret scriptures have nothing to do with the Buddhist texts.

365
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,439
Shaolin Temple has had a rule for hundreds of years.

366
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,780
Our secret martial arts scriptures are not to be revealed to outsiders.

367
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,199
Martial Brother Xuan Can fought against him

368
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,140
and realized that he had not only read the secret martial arts scriptures

369
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,779
but had also mastered three of the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

370
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,279
Shaolin Sect's martial arts may be unremarkable compared to others,

371
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,359
but our rules dictate that they may not be passed on to non-disciples.

372
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,639
Therefore, I could only ask him to stay in this monastery

373
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,199
and meditate and cultivate the practices of Buddhism.

374
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,879
In doing so, I hoped that would be enlightened

375
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,120
and that further troubles would be avoided.

376
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,279
For the past few years,

377
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,699
our temple has treated Martial Brother Bo Luoxing very well.

378
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:30,879
We have never disrespected him in any way

379
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
apart from asking him to stay within the temple grounds.

380
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,280
One's mastery of martial arts depends on one's own cultivation.

381
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,340
Scriptures and manuals are secondary.

382
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,260
If any of the heroes can enter my Qingliang Temple

383
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,639
and steal the scriptures of our temple,

384
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,459
I will have nothing to say except for admitting that I am incompetent.

385
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:59,339
Now, he just took a look at your scriptures

386
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:02,999
and you decided to lock him up for life?

387
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:06,840
That's ridiculous!

388
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,839
If these were ordinary scriptures,

389
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,960
there would be no problem making them public.

390
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,040
However, the content of our scriptures is highly sophisticated.

391
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,159
It is admired and sought after by many in the martial arts world.

392
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:23,100
If... the scriptures were stolen

393
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,560
and into the hands of the selfish and wicked-minded,

394
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,239
it would be infinitely harmful.

395
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,820
That's definitely not a blessing for the martial arts world.

396
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,180
Zhe Luoxing traveled a long journey from the East to get here.

397
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:40,299
Are you going to forbid him from seeing his martial brother as well?

398
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:42,960
Both of you are pressing hard on this matter.

399
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,399
If I refuse to let him out,

400
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,820
it will make it appear as if Shaolin Temple had lost ground.

401
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,440
Bring Martial Brother Bo Luoxing in.

402
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,320
Welcome, Martial Brother Bo Luoxing.

403
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,860
Welcome, Martial Brother Bo Luoxing.

404
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,620
Younger Martial Brother.

405
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,000
The abbot lied.

406
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,420
Bo Luoxing didn't steal the martial arts scriptures at all.

407
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,700
He only read Buddhist texts.

408
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,499
Martial Brother Bo Luoxing, if you tell any lies,

409
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:59,279
won't you be afraid of falling into the Avici?

410
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,599
I never lie.

411
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,300
Have you ever stolen a peek at the Shaolin Sect's Jingang Fist Technique?

412
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,619
No. I only read the Vajra Verse.

413
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:09,599
Have you ever read the Shaolin Sect's Prajna Palm Technique?

414
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,559
No. I only borrowed the Astasaha.

415
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,279
Then, have you never read the Mo He Finger Technique of the Shaolin Sect, either?

416
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:19,479
That day, when my younger martial brother, Xuan Can ran into you,

417
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:23,339
you had just stolen the scripture and tried to sneak out of the Tripitaka Library, is that not true?

418
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:27,680
I had only borrowed one of the Mahasangha-vinaya.

419
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,500
It looks like... those are martial arts techniques of the Shaolin Sect.

420
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,678
- Yes, they are.
- How did he know those moves?

421
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,460
I wonder why.

422
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,339
I might be rude, but please forgive me for this.

423
00:34:36,339 --> 00:34:39,959
I would like to ask for justice.

424
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,819
Just now, Bo Luoxing performed three techniques.

425
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:48,399
The first appeared to be the "Flawless" in the Prajna Palm Technique.

426
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,639
The second one seems to be the "Waiting Leisurely" in the Mo He Finger Technique.

427
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,819
While the third one seems to be the "Seven Stars Gathering"

428
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:58,120
in the Jingang Fist Technique.

429
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,980
Exactly.

430
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,339
The Buddhism of the Central Plains has really benefited from the Buddhist Kingdom, Tianzhu.

431
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,210
Back then, Master Bodhidharma

432
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,060
brought the martial arts of Tianzhu to the east and introduced them to the Shaolin Sect

433
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,460
The East and West were combined, and all share the same origins.

434
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,319
This can be considered as the realm of the indiscriminate in the martial arts world.

435
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,380
The Buddhist teachings and martial arts of our temple

436
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,399
are indeed passed down from Bodhidharma.

437
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,460
But the Prajna Palm Technique was created by Reverent Yuan Yuan,

438
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:32,240
the eighth generation abbot of the temple.

439
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,280
Mo He Finger Technique

440
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:38,719
was created by a seven-finger dhuta who stayed here for more than 40 years.

441
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,799
While the Jingang Fist Technique

442
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,960
was the result of 36 years of joint studies

443
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,919
of six monks of the eleventh generation of this monastery.

444
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:52,159
You claim that Prajna Palm Technique, Mo He Finger Technique, and Jingang Fist Technique

445
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,959
had all come from Tianzhu.

446
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,999
Then you must be very familiar with the techniques.

447
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,440
It's easy to find out the truth.

448
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,319
I wish to use these three techniques and ask for your guidance.

449
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,999
I will not use any other technique apart from these three.

450
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,119
Please do only use these three techniques as well

451
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,640
when you give me your guidance.

452
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,099
I may know some Tianzhu martial arts,

453
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:18,119
but I can't be proficient in everything.

454
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,260
It is said that the Shaolin Temple has 72 secret arts.

455
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,500
In that case, are you proficient in every art?

456
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:29,499
If I ask you to perform three of the 72 secret arts,

457
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:32,820
can you do it, Martial Brother?

458
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,320
You...

459
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,340
It is a big event and a rare opportunity

460
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,839
for esteemed monks from both Tianzhu and Central Plains to gather in Shaolin Temple to discuss martial arts.

461
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,240
Can I be an uninvited guest and listen to the opinions of both parties?

462
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,940
Who is it?

463
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,820
Since you are a Buddhist monk as well,

464
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,120
please come in.

465
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:01,539
Jiu Mozhi, pays homage to the abbot of Shaolin Temple.

466
00:38:03,663 --> 00:38:06,509
- Who is that?
- Who is he?

467
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,520
Amitabha.

468
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,940
The Tibetan Adviser has come to our temple.

469
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,380
We are trying to resolve a matter right now.

470
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:21,159
So I would like to ask you

471
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,080
to be an unbiased judge in this matter.

472
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,780
Adviser.

473
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,040
Abbot asked me to preside over justice,

474
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,240
I dare not do so.

475
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,880
However, when I was outside earlier,

476
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,959
I heard the Reverent Zhe Luoxing

477
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,040
and the Reverent Xuan Can argue about martial arts.

478
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,479
But I felt that there was something wrong

479
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,880
with both of your arguments.

480
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,000
Please feel free to point it out.

481
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,700
Martial Brother Zhe Luoxing,

482
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,639
you said no one would be able to master every art

483
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,220
of the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

484
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,820
I don't think so.

485
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,140
And Martial Brother, you said that Mo He Finger Technique,

486
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,400
Prajna Palm Technique, and Jingang Fist Technique

487
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,399
are the secret arts of your temple.

488
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,920
Except for the direct disciples of the Shaolin Sect,

489
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,180
it is impossible for outsiders to know of them.

490
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:31,760
There is also something wrong with this statement.

491
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,479
So you mean to say

492
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,259
there is someone who can master all 72 secret arts, Adviser?

493
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,040
That's right.

494
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,680
And which hero might be capable of such a feat?

495
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,120
Well, I do not deserve such high praise.

496
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,320
You are that hero, Adviser?

497
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,860
Precisely.

498
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,140
No way.

499
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,160
This can't be true.

500
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,380
Adviser, you are not from our Shaolin Sect,

501
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:18,579
but you are proficient in our martial arts such as the Mo He Finger Technique, Prajna Palm Technique,

502
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:21,280
and Jingang Fist Technique?

503
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,079
Well, I would like to ask the masters here for advice.

504
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,620
The "Rings of Bell Luo" in Jingang Fist Technique,

505
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,020
the "Purifying Evils" in the Prajna Palm Technique,

506
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,980
and the "Three Entrances To Hell" in the Mo He Finger Technique. This...

507
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,720
What a skill you've shown, Adviser.

508
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,720
You have broadened my horizon.

509
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,159
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

510
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:22,160
I've been studying hard for decades,

511
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,999
and I only learned the true meaning of the saying that there is always someone better than us just now.

512
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,920
Martial Brother Bo Luoxing,

513
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,440
Shaolin Temple is too small for such prestigious guests.

514
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,360
We can't keep guests in a land of little blessings.

515
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,520
Do as you wish.

516
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,440
Hold on.

517
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,700
Based on what the abbot has said,

518
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,119
that means that the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin

519
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,319
was not originally created by the Shaolin Sect.

520
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,440
Then, the word "secret"

521
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,100
should be changed.

522
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,999
Master, while Jiu Zhimo is undeniably skillful,

523
00:42:05,999 --> 00:42:08,580
what he used was not the martial arts of Shaolin Temple.

524
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,200
Nonsense.

525
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,679
Even the abbot has not said anything against that.

526
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,260
How dare you say such a thing?

527
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,340
You have never even learned the three secret arts

528
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,039
performed by Adviser Jiu Zhimo earlier.

529
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,300
How could you know that what he used was not the martial arts of Shaolin?

530
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,880
Foolish. Such foolishness.

531
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,600
Master, it's true.

532
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,360
Although the martial arts he used

533
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,059
were the techniques of our Shaolin Temple, but his inner energy...

534
00:42:32,059 --> 00:42:33,830
Stop it!

535
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,260
Are you scared?

536
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,220
Abbot, why don't you heed my words?

537
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,580
Today, let's disperse this Shaolin Temple.

538
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,160
You have already gained the upper hand, Adviser.

539
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,599
And our abbot has already allowed the Tianzhu monks to leave as they wish.

540
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,160
Why must you still force us so?

Shaolin Temple has not only deceived the public,

568
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,150
they are also hiding women.
