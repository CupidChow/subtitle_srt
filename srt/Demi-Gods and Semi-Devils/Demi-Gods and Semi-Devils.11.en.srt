[Episode 11]

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,999
Where did you learn the Great Energy Dissolving Skill from?

14
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,519
What do you mean?

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,619
Do you think the Duan family practices heterodox skills as you do?

16
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:45,720
Nonsense!

17
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,800
I wonder what would happen to your brain if it had been just a little bit lower?

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,900
Since you insist,

19
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,620
I will write it down.

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,979
Reverend, please look at how exquisite the Six Pulse Excalibur technique is.

22
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,119
Reverend, it has been quite some time.

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,380
I have a bad memory.

24
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,779
Usually, I'm always confused as well like a scatterbrain.

25
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:01,479
I'm not sure if I remember the technique correctly.

26
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,379
But it should be fine. You won't look at it anyway.

27
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,299
You'll be incinerating it before Old Mr. Murong's grave.

28
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,099
If Old Mr. Murong becomes deranged

29
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,759

00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:15,700
I believe he won't blame you.

31
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,160
You brat!

32
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,180
I want to let you live.

33
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,060
Yet, you still refuse to come to your senses.

34
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,620
Fine.

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,660
I'll bring you before Mr. Murong's grave

36
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,660
and incinerate you.

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,520
The technique you remember shouldn't be a fake one!

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,200
All right.

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,679
From now on, I'll try my best to forget the correct technique.

40
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:54,819
I'm sure Old Mr. Murong's soul

41
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,959
can't do anything about it.

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,020
Nothing.

46
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,579
Shopkeeper, what kind of bird is this?

47
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:15,139
This is a leiothrix, also known as a lovebird.

48
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,120
A lovebird?

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,439
You're good-looking and spirited.

50
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,780
I'm sure you're admired by many young women.

51
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,739
Why don't you buy one for your sweetheart?

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,520
Very well.

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,799
All right. Thank you.

00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:44,520
- Take care.

Come in.

57
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,539
Young Master, we'll reach Wuxi tomorrow.

58
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,400
There are few newly-built manors in Wuxi.

59
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,060
Would you like to stop by and take a look?

60
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,400
No.

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,180
We've been out on the road for long enough this time.

62
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,340
We'll return to Swallow's Nest.

63
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,780
Yes, Young Master.

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Young Master, why did you buy a bird out of the blue?

65
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,380
I received a letter from Yan'er a few days ago.

66
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,259
She said she has no one to talk to on the island.

67
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:27,260
I found this bird chirps beautifully.

68
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,679
So I bought it to make her happy.

69
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,819
You bought this bird for Miss Wang?

70
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,060
Yes.

71
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,620
I'm out all year round.

72
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,680
And you know how Aunt is.

73
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,839
It's inevitable that she feels lonely.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,339
Having a living creature as her companion will make her happy.

75
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,239
You're out all year round to make preparations to restore Yan.

76
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:53,459
How could you over-indulge yourself in a romance just because of a letter from Miss Wang?

77
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:57,279
Back then, when Old Master was your age,

78
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,180
he had already challenged the top seven sects consecutively,

79
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,039
spreading the name of the Murong clan across the pugilist world.

80
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,979
And that Qiao Feng. He is only a few years older than you,

81
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,959
but he has already made a prestigious name for himself in the pugilist world.

82
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,580
Second Brother Gong Ye,

83
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,540
are you blaming me for being inferior to Qiao Feng?

84
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,719
Those who do great things must not be bothered by trifle matters.

85
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:25,199
But indulging in a romantic relationship is taboo.

86
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,999
All I know is that Chief Qiao wouldn't rush to return because of a woman.

87
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:34,659
- And he certainly wouldn't use such a toy to please a woman.
- That's enough!

88
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,759
- You...
- Don't...

89
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,700
It's only a bird.

90
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,580
Where are the newly-built manors?

91
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,380
Who is in charge of them?

92
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,419
I, a disciple of the Shaolin Temple, am here on Abbot Xuan Ci's orders

93
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,879
to invite Young Master Murong to Shaolin to discuss important matters.

94
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,900
Excuse me.

95
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,440
Do you know where Canhe Manor is?

96
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,400
I have no idea.

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,260
Sorry to bother you.

I have no idea.

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,039
Then, do you know where the residence of the Murong clan is?

102
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,399
Never heard of it.

103
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,860
The fragrance of lotus wafts over the vast lake.

104
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,240
The playful young girl delays her lotus picking.

105
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,860
In the evening, she rows the boat along the lake.

106
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,500
And wraps her red skirt around a duck.

107
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,860
The blue waves are vast. The weeping willows are reluctant to part.

108
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,679
There are a few thatched huts across the grass, with apricot blossoms fluttering under the oblique sunlight.

109
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,940
Nonsense!

110
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,299
No wonder people love Jiangnan.

111
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:14,459
I didn't expect Jiangnan women to be so strikingly beautiful.

112
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,540
Young Master, you must be teasing me.

113
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,039
If you move an inch again, I'll break your legs.

114
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,060
Miss, do you know where Canhe Manor is?

115
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,640
Canhe Manor?

116
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,299
The name Canhe Manor is unknown to outsiders.

117
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:41,898
Reverend, where did you hear it from?

118
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,519
I am a good friend of Mr. Murong.

119
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,180
I came from Tibet. A land thousands of miles away.

120
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,960
I would like to visit the late Mr. Murong's grave and pay my respects.

121
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,520
Of course,

122
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,060
I would also like to meet Young Master Murong.

123
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,620
That's really unfortunate.

124
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,140
Young Master Murong left a few days ago.

125
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,060
I'm afraid you won't be able to meet him.

126
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,110
Since you are the Old Master's friend,

127
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,390
please have a cup of tea in the manor. I'll inform the manor of your visit.

128
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,660
May I know who you are?

129
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,100
How shall I address you?

130
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,060
I'm a maid who plays the zither and flute for Young Master.

131
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,060
My name is A'Bi.

Sister A'Bi...

133
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,179
You need to use the water route to reach Swallow's Nest.

134
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:29,039
If you would like to go there, I can send you there by boat.

135
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,180
Thank you very much.

136
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,680
This way, please.

137
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,479
Sister A'Bi, he's a bad guy.

138
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,039

[Pleasant Music]

140
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,440
Miss, is this Canhe Manor of Swallow's Nest?

141
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,980
No. Young Master lets me live here.

142
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,340
It's a small place.

143
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,599
It's not suitable to welcome distinguished guests.

144
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,900
But you've mentioned

145
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,640
that you would like to visit Old Master Murong's grave to pay your respects.

146
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,100
But I can't make the call.

147
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,180
So I brought you here to wait while I go and ask Sister A'Zhu.

148
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,340
Who is Sister A'Zhu?

149
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,480
She is who she is.

150
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,440
Please have a seat.

151
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,519
We can't make it to A'Zhu's manor today.

152
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,860
You may stay here for a night.

153
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,899
Tomorrow morning, I'll bring you to Swallow's Nest.

154
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:55,219
In that case, why didn't you bring us to Swallow's Nest directly?

155
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,720
Isn't that the best way?

156
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,499
A'Bi, what is the noise about?

157
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:04,999
May I know your name?

158
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you a relative or a friend of the Murong family?

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,380
I'm an old servant who serves Young Master.

160
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,279
My name isn't important.

161
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,640
Something smells really nice.

162
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,519
I heard you are a good friend of our late Old Master?

163
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,740
May I know what you need?

164
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,360
I'm here

165
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,020
to meet Young Master Murong.

166
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,980
I've mentioned it just now.

167
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,060
That's really unfortunate.

168
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,839
Young Master left a few days ago.

169
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,420
We don't know when he'll be back.

170
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,999
Then where did your young master go?

171
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,220
Look at what a scatterbrain I am.

172
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,739
If I'm not mistaken, it's the Xixia Kingdom

173
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:56,339
or Liao Kingdom.

174
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,739
Or Tibet. Or Dali.

175
00:12:00,739 --> 00:12:02,800
Look at my bad memory.

176
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,060
Forget it.

177
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,379
I guess I can't stay until your young master returns.

178
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:08,800
That's a good thing.

179
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,219
Steward, please bring me to your old master's grave.

180
00:12:12,219 --> 00:12:14,939
I want to pay him a visit as a friend.

181
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:16,279
I can't help you with that.

182
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,159
I can't make the call.

183
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,560
I'm not the steward.

184
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,300
Who is the steward then?

185
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,980
Please ask him to see me.

186
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,880
All right. Please wait a moment.

187
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,940
I'll go and get him.

188
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,140
There are all kinds of people in this era.

189
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,620
A man with hair calls himself a monk?

190
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,360
I have seen the world.

191
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,039
Reverend, don't get angry.

192
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,739
Old Uncle Huang is a scatterbrain.

193
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,519
He thinks he is smart.

194
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,939
But his words often offend others.

195
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,580
Greetings. I am Sun San.

196
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,319
Reverend, we're so grateful that you would like to visit the Old Mr. Murong's grave

197
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,140
to pay your respects.

198
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,539
However, Young Master is not home.

199
00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:05,780
We can't return your kindness.

200
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,060
We apologize for being disrespectful.

201
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,959
I'll inform Young Master of your kind intentions when he returns.

202
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,140
It's so strange.

203
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,180
When the old servant came inside the room,

204
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,159
there was a faint fragrance that belonged to a woman.

205
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,940
When this steward came inside,

206
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,220
I smell the same fragrance again.

207
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,040
Could it be that both the old servant and the steward are women in disguise?

208
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,619
But Adam's apples can't be disguised.

209
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,559
I met your old master by the borders between Tibet and Sichuan.

210
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,459
We respected and admired each other and became good friends.

211
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,180
I didn't expect a talented and capable person like your old master

212
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,980
would pass away sooner

213
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,879
than an unfavorable and mediocre person such as I.

214
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,539
I came to pay my respects to my good friend.

215
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,520
It is not important

216
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,740
if the kind gesture is returned or not.

217
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,779
Since you are Old Master's good friend, you should have known his character well.

218
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,679
Old Master hated visitors.

219
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,139
He said those who came either sought revenge or sought to become a disciple.

220
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,779
Others would try to take advantage and steal.

221
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,399
The monks and the nuns were even more untrustworthy.

222
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,040
Yes.

223
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,039
Now, there are many treacherous people and only a few honest people.

224
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:51,340
It's understandable that your old master stayed away from those kinds of people.

225
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,539
That's right. Old Master's last words were to reject those who came to sweep his grave.

226
00:14:56,539 --> 00:15:01,199
He said most of the monks carry ill intentions.

227
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:07,599
Reverend, of course, our old master certainly wasn't talking about you.

228
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,839
I am Jiu Mozhi, the adviser to the Tibetan ruler.

229
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,340
I only intend to pay respects to my deceased friend.

230
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,320
Steward, you need not worry so much.

231
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,079
But I can't make the call.

232
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,300
What about this?

233
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,820
I'll seek advice from Old Madam and come back to you.

234
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,540
Madam?

235
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,260
What Old Madam?

236
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,780
Just... Old Madam Murong.

237
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,940
She is Old Master's aunt.

238
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,139
Whenever Old Master's friends come for a visit, they'll pay their respects to her first.

239
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,139
Since Young Master isn't at home, we'll have to report everything to Old Madam, of course.

240
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,759
That's good. Inform your old madam that Jiu Mozhi, the adviser to the Tibetan ruler,

241
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,520
wishes to send his regards.

242
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,840
I shall take my leave then.

243
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,960
Reverend, please be patient.

244
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,500
A'Bi,

245
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,579
I heard Old Master's good friend is here.

246
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,420
Yes.

247
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,120
Have they kowtowed to me?

248
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,359
Hurry and kowtow to Old Madam.

249
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,479
If you kowtow and make Old Madam happy, she'll agree to everything.

250
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:50,020
Little girl, what are you saying?

251
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,520
Have they kowtowed to me?

252
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,299
I, Jiu Mozhi, the adviser to the Tibetan ruler, greets Old Madam.

253
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,680
Great.

254
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,098
In this age, there are many treacherous villains and only a few honest people.

255
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,019
Take the kowtow as an example.

256
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:15,499
Those bad guys only come to make trouble.

257
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:20,559
They would lie and say that they kowtowed, but they only made a banging sound on the floor.

258
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,140
They try to take advantage of my blindness.

259
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,719
You're good.

260
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,398
A good boy. You kowtowed and it was a loud sound.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,799
This child, why didn't you kowtow to me?

262
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,420
Old Madam, it suddenly reminds me of my little niece.

263
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,999
She is smart but naughty.

264
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:42,919
She likes to act like a monkey.

265
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,199
Sometimes as a male. Sometimes as a female.

266
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:46,519
She'll play tricks too.

267
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,839
I'm sure you'll love her.

268
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:53,159
It's a pity that I didn't bring her along with me today.

269
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,159
A really good boy indeed.

270
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,639
You know how to make me happy.

271
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,799
Come here. Kowtow to me three times.

272
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,080
I will certainly make it worth your while.

273
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:19,680
Sister A'Bi, you mentioned there is a lady called Sister A'Zhu in the manor.

274
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,099
Is she as beautiful as you?

275
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,959
I'm only an ugly woman.

276
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,440
Sister A'Zhu is 10 times prettier than me.

277
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,900
You're amongst the handful of beauties in the world.

278
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,859
I believe someone 10 times more beautiful than you doesn't exist at all.

279
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,479
Old Madam told you to kowtow to her.

280
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,119
What are you doing spouting nonsense and trying to please me?

281
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,740
Kowtow now.

282
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,540
All right.

283
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,020
The land of Jiangnan is lush and fertile.

284
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,740
It has given birth to many beauties.

285
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,420
I am sure that Old Madam

286
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,319
must have been a true beauty as well when you were young.

287
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,339
I'm willing to kowtow to a beauty.

288
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,380
Good boy.

289
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,240
Great.

290
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,859
Monk, are you here to pay a visit to my nephew's grave?

291
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,839
Mr. Murong and I made an agreement.

292
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,279
If I obtained the scripture of the Six Pulse Excalibur of Dali Temple,

293
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,119
I would lend it to Mr. Murong.

294
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,719
I've not fulfilled my promise.

295
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,580
I feel ashamed.

296
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,960
The Six Pulse Excalibur?

297
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,599
What happens if you obtained it?

298
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,399
And what if you didn't?

299
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,439
Based on our agreement, if I obtained the Six Pulse Excalibur,

300
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:48,259
I would lend it to Mr. Murong and in return, I would be allowed to read some books

301
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:52,040
at the Murong residence's Huanshi Library for a few days.

302
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,799
Now, I've brought the Six Pulse Excalibur scripture with me here.

303
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:58,640
I dare to seek your permission to adhere to the old agreement

304
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,959
and allow me to read scriptures at Huanshi Library

305
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,599
for a few days.

306
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,239
You come with no proof.

307
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,359
What scripture?

308
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,599
Where is it?

309
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,079
Show it to me.

310
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,999
I'll see if it's authentic or not.

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,659
Young Master Duan remembers the contents of the scripture to the core.

312
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:19,299
His presence is akin to obtaining the Six Pulse Excalibur.

313
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:21,399
I wondered what the Six Pulse Excalibur scripture was.

314
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,839
It turns out that you were just joking.

315
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,780
I never say jokes.

316
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,919
The original scripture of the Six Pulse Excalibur

317
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,679
was originally stored in the Tianlong Temple of Dali.

318
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,759
And it had been destroyed by Reverend Ku Rong.

319
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:36,480
Fortunately, Young Master Duan remembers the content well.

320
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,779
Whether Young Master Duan remembers it well or not is his own business.

321
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,519
What has it got to do with you?

322
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,239
To fulfill the agreement,

323
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,820
I'll incinerate Young Master Duan

324
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
before Mr. Murong's grave.

325
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,399
You must be kidding.

326
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,439
How could you burn a person alive?

327
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:55,900
That's right.

328
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,479
You're not honest.

329
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,159
That Six Pulse Excalibur

330
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,319
is such a powerful martial arts technique.

331
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,579
If this kid could master the technique,

332
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,519
would he bow down to you?

333
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,999
If it's true, then ask him to demonstrate it.

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,399
I'm confident,

335
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,439
that you're lying.

336
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,920
That's easy.

337
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,559
Whether it's a lie or not,

338
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,400
just watch and see.

339
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,440
Slow down.

340
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,479
Young Master Duan, Old Madam doesn't believe that you know Six Pulse Excalibur.

341
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,979
How about you show it to her?

342
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:44,319
Like what I just did.

343
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,799
Knock down the remaining lantern.

344
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,599
I have no martial arts skills.

345
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,739
Why did you destroy the lantern?

346
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,319
You're too humble.

347
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,679
You are one of the most skilled in martial arts in the Duan family of Dali.

348
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,299
In the current pugilist world, besides...

349
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,999
Besides Young Master Murong and me,

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,579
I'm sure only a handful can win against you.

351
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,239
Monk, you've been very rude to me this entire journey.

352
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:09,199
You brought me to Jiangnan by force.

353
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,999
I planned not to utter a word to you ever again.

354
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:14,779
But after I witnessed Jiangnan's beautiful scenery

355
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:16,779
and deity-like girls,

356
00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:19,819
most of my resentment has disappeared.

357
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,439
What about this?

358
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,299
Let's consider this matter settled, once and for all.

359
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:25,340
Let's not bother each other again, all right?

360
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,799
Young Master Duan, your refusal to demonstrate your skills will show that I'm lying.

361
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,519
You're indeed lying.

362
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,959
Why bother covering it up then?

363
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,919
Old Madam, he's envious of the Murong clan's powerful martial arts.

364
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:39,559
He wants to steal your technique, the technique that allows you to "fight fire with fire"!

365
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:40,940
You...

366
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,979
What this young man has said makes sense.

367
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:47,100
Monk, what on earth do you want?

368
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,100
Old Madam, Young Master Duan is talking nonsense.

369
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,360
He is trying to fool you.

370
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,760
It's true that I had an agreement with Mr. Murong.

371
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,239
But I've been practicing the Blaze Blade in seclusion

372
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:05,139
and I didn't step out for nine years.

373
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,039
If I didn't master the Blaze Blade,

374
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,740
forget about the Duan family of Dali's Six Pulse Excalibur,

375
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:16,020
it would be impossible for me to escape Dali's Tianlong Temple unscathed.

376
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,720
Monk, you claim you were powerful and skilled in martial arts with great authority.

377
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,399
Why did you become a swindler in Jiangnan then?

378
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,359
Young Master Duan, if you still refuse to make your move,

379
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,160
do not blame

380
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,239
me for being rude.

381
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,159
You've been extremely rude to me already.

382
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,519
What could be worse?

383
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,019
At most, you would probably just kill me. I'm not afraid of you!

384
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,279
Fine.

385
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,740
Take this!

386
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,020
Duan Yu, you would rather die than counterattack?

387
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,079
Greed, anger, and ignorance.

388
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:53,939
You possess each and every one of those.

389
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:57,459
Yet you dare to you call yourself an adviser to a ruler? You don't deserve it!

390
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,179
Fine.

391
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,239
I'll kill this girl first.

392
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,220
Let's see what you will do.

393
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,679
The Six Pulse Excalibur?

394
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,880
It really deserves its reputation.

395
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,059
No wonder Mr. Murong admired it so much.

396
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,519
Ladies, this monk bullies others with his powerful martial arts skills.

397
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,779
Run quickly. I...I don't know martial arts.

398
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,960
But I... I'll cover for you.

399
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:08,180
Young Master Duan, you can't even protect yourself at the brink of death.

400
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,900
And yet you still want to protect those ladies?

401
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
Old Madam.

402
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,159
You two girls,

403
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,799
you don't need to pretend anymore.

404
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,059
Who makes the call in the manor?

405
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,839
Tomorrow, I'll take Young Master Duan

406
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:27,599
to Mr. Murong's grave and incinerate him.

407
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,299
Even in the other world, Mr. Murong will know

408
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:33,580
that I have fulfilled my promise.

409
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,020
Fine.

410
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,259
We believe your words.

411
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:42,000
However, you'll need to travel another day through the water route

412
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,220
to reach Old Master Murong's grave.

413
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,319
It's getting late.

414
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,099
Tomorrow morning, both of us will accompany you and Young Master Duan

415
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,380
to sweep the grave.

416
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,900
Let's go.

417
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,940
Thank...

418
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,759
Thank you, Brother Quan, for sending me home.

419
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,619
We're brothers. Don't mention it.

420
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,499
Madam! Madam!

421
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,220
He is drunk again?

422
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,479
Branch Leader Quan, thank you for bringing my husband home.

423
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,140
It's getting late.

424
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,140
Branch Leader Quan, go home and rest early.

425
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,660
Who is it?

426
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,920
Who is it?

427
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,460
Who is it?

428
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,420
It's you...

429
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,359
- This way.
- Come on.

430
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,200
- Hurry up.
- Come on.

431
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,519
- What happened?
- Hurry up.

432
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,240
Come on. Hurry!

433
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,290
[Xijie Place]

434
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,199
- Hurry, hurry. This way.
- What happened?

435
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,740
Go and take a look.

436
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,600
Elder Bai,

437
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,380
take Madam Cao away from here for now.

438
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,100
No!

439
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,480
I will stay.

440
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,779
I want to know who killed my husband.

441
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,480
I want to know who could have such cruel intentions.

442
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,460
It is Deputy Chief Ma's Throat Locking Skill.

443
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,230
Take a look.

444
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,630
[Let the world know your name]

445
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,060
Chief, it is indeed Deputy Chief Ma's unique and famed Throat Locking Skill.

446
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,839
Based on the injury, he must have killed him in a single move.

447
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:08,179
It must be someone whom Deputy Chief Ma knew well.

448
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,279
Furthermore, it seems that the culprit's skills are superior to Deputy Chief Ma.

449
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,599
This is really strange indeed.

450
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,799
Ma Dayuan created this move himself.

451
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,279
It wasn't inherited, and neither was it passed on.

452
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,879
In the martial arts world,

453
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,160
no one uses it besides him.

454
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,920
If the killer intended to kill,

455
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,760
he shouldn't have used this move.

456
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,979
Unless the killer... "fought fire with fire."

457
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,700
Murong Fu.

458
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,300
Murong Fu did this!

459
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,879
Who else is capable of doing such a thing,

460
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,020
if not Murong Fu?

461
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,799
This is a serious matter.

462
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,760
We must get to the bottom of it.

463
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,220
Madam Cao, don't worry.

464
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,440
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

465
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,300
My condolences.

466
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,319
Let us arrange for Deputy Chief Ma's funeral right now.

467
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,980
Yes, Sir.

468
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,380
This way, please.

469
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,680
Sister A'Zhu.

470
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,759
Sister A'Zhu, a beauty like you

471
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,699
could even act as Old Madam without any flaws.

472
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,260
What is it?

473
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,079
You can't accept

474
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,400
kowtowing to me?

475
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,399
The kowtow was perfectly reasonable.

476
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,859
- But I might be taking it wrong.
- How so?

477
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:27,399
I should have known that Sister A'Zhu

478
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:30,999
was also a rare beauty like Sister A'Bi.

479
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:33,800
But when I actually saw your true looks...

480
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,679
- Well...
- So, I look worse than Sister A'Bi, do I?

481
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,599
You found out that she was 10 times prettier than me,

482
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,340
so you were taken by surprise?

483
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,620
No. Neither.

484
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,379
I am only in awe of Heaven's ability to create humans.

485
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:51,619
He must have put so much effort into creating a rare beauty like Sister A'Bi.

486
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:55,879
Logically speaking, Jiangnan's spiritual energy should have been completely used up.

487
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:59,399
But who would have thought that he also created a beauty like Sister A'Zhu.

488
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:01,959
Both of you are completely different in looks,

489
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,180
yet you are both equally beautiful.

490
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:08,199
I wanted to compliment you, but...

491
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,880
I can't seem to find the proper words to describe your beauty.

492
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,520
A'Bi, this man is glib-tongued.

493
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,978
And yet he says that he can't find words.

494
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,919
You are our guests, but we don't have any good food to serve you.

495
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:25,799
We can only serve you some local seasonal dishes.

496
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,079
Please.

497
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,620
This way, please.

498
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,799
Such exquisite dishes.

499
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,659
Only such fertile lands can produce such characters.

500
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,579
Only such characters can produce such talent.

501
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,119
And only such talent can produce such exquisite dishes.

502
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,679
Look at how Young Master Duan is praising you.

503
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,419
Why don't you play him a song?

504
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:05,359
If you don't mind my mediocre skills,

505
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,160
I would certainly love to play a song for you.

506
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,500
Young Master Duan, try this.

507
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,719
Young Master, come and take a look.

00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,000
Come, Young Master Duan.

510
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,719
Adviser, please help yourself.

511
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,260
Hurry.

512
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,560
Row faster.

513
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,620
Hurry! He found out!

514
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,560
Hurry!

515
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,519
You little brat!

516
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,999
I'll shred you into pieces when I catch all of you!

517
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,939
Don't worry, Young Master.

518
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,240
He won't be able to catch up.

519
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,199
The mechanisms at Tingyu Residence are interesting indeed.

520
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:59,360
This bamboo raft was parked right under your zither,  right?

521
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,199
Yes. That's why I asked you to come and see the zither.

522
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,919
Impressive.

523
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,159
That foolish monk was so mean.

524
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,579
We ought to teach him a lesson. Right?

525
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:09,800
Yes.

526
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,339
We're arriving. Let's speed up.

527
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:13,760

00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,930
[Let your name be heard around the world]

530
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,940
[For Ma Dayuan]

531
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,460
Madam, my condolences.

532
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,160
Chief. Elders. And fellow brothers.

533
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,919
Thank you for arranging this funeral.

534
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,800
On behalf of my late husband,

535
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,359
I am truly grateful.

536
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,759
Deputy Chief Ma was killed viciously.

537
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,039
It angered everyone in the Beggars' Sect.

538
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,760
Rest assured, Madam.

539
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,960
We will get to the bottom of this matter.

540
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,080
[Deputy Chief: Ma Dayuan]

541
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,580
My late husband lived a sincere and honest life.

542
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,840
He never uttered rude words.

543
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,600
He had no enemies in the martial arts world.

544
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,820
I have no idea

545
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,440
who would be so vicious

546
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,600
to take his life.

547
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,939
No one else knows Dayuan's unique move

548
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,660
except for

549
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,640
the Murong clan.

550
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,940
I heard that Reverend Xuan Bei of Shaolin Temple

551
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,039
was killed at Shenjie Temple in Luliangzhou

552
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,540
with his own unique Vajra move as well.

553
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,879
Everyone believed it was Murong Fu's doing.

554
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,519
But no one knows his motive

555
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,519
and the reason why he is stirring up trouble

556
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,760
and causing everyone to panic within the pugilist world.

557
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,019
We still don't know if it was Murong Fu's doing.

558
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,880
Don't jump to conclusions.

559
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,260
My late husband's death is unjust.

560
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,900
I hope Chief and Elders will help us

561
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,680
find out the truth.

562
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,340
And avenge...

563
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,060
my late husband.

564
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,580
Madam, please get up.

565
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,599
I've discussed this with the elders.

566
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,879
Elder Bai will take care of Beggar's Sect temporarily.

567
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,459
I'll head to Suzhou immediately to investigate the matter.

568
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,860
I promise I will find the truth.

569
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,040
Thank you, Chief.

570
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,310
[Let your name be heard around the world]

571
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,559
- Look.
- Sister A'Zhu.

572
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:25,120
What's the matter?

573
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,119
Lower your voice.

574
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,760
What is it?

575
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,720
I... I need to answer nature's call.

576
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,199
Young Master Duan

577
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,559
is asleep.

578
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,399
Go ahead. I'll cover for you.

579
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,060
No. What if Young Master Duan wakes up?

580
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,200
That would be embarrassing.

581
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,479
We're close to Mandarava Villa.

582
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,879
Why don't we head there instead?

583
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,359
Well, why don't we bring Young Master Duan along

584
00:40:56,359 --> 00:40:58,279
lest that he worries about us?

585
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,980
It'll be embarrassing then.

586
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,999
You're so considerate.

587
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,259
Aren't you afraid that our Young Master would be jealous?

588
00:41:04,259 --> 00:41:06,880
He won't be jealous.

589
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,639
We're only ordinary girls.

590
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,180
He won't care much about us.

591
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,620
Young Master Duan.

592
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,199
I feel dazed.

593
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,320
Have I slept for long?

594
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,139
Sisters, there is something inconvenient for me to speak up.

595
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:32,740
Just tell us.

596
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,920
I need to answer nature's call.

597
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,099
Young Master Duan, our relative lives nearby.

598
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,720
Why don't we head over there?

599
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,619
But our relative has a weird temper.

600
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:50,239
She won't meet men she doesn't know.

601
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,319
We have to come back to the raft right after answering nature's call.

602
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,219
- We mustn't cause any trouble.
- I understand.

603
00:41:54,219 --> 00:41:55,760
All right.

604
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,820
Come on.

605
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,340
Almost there.

606
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,759
- Aren't these Dali camellias?
- Hurry up.

607
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,559
I didn't expect that in Lake Tai,

608
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,680
there would be so many of this camellia.

609
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,220
Young Master Duan, this is Mandarava Villa.

610
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,679
It is filled with all kinds of camellia.

611
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,519
Amazing. Camellia is known by another name.

612
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,439
It's called mandarava.

613
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,999
Since this villa is named after it,

614
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,239
I must see what other species of camellias lie here.

615
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,600
- Don't run around!
- Don't run around!

616
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,859
How dare you girls sneak in here again.

617
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:38,059
Madam said to put a cross on your face

618
00:42:38,059 --> 00:42:40,759
and destroy your exquisite beauty.

619
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,319
Greetings, Sister You Cao.

620
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,279
Is Aunt at home?

621
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,460
Madam also said,

622
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,639
"How dare you to bring a man we don't know to Mandarava Villa.

623
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,959
Hurry up and cut off his legs."

624
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,939
Sister You Cao, don't frighten me.

625
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,860
Did she really say that?
