[Episode 29]

14
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,560
Do you really want to come along?

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,599
Then, I'll have to take care of you for the rest of your life.

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,679
Really?

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,900
After I recover from my injury, I'll never return to Xingxiu Sea again.

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,740
I'll stay with you forever.

19
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,480
Of course.

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,079
You are A'Zhu's sister.

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,039
Therefore, you're also my sister.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,159
Don't worry.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,540
I'll take good care of you.

24
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,880
Let's pack things up.

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,099
We are in no place to make a decision. We can't decide anything.

27
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,120
Wait a minute. You...

28
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,420
Go away. Don't touch me.

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,840
Your Majesty, we are outnumbered.

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,399
Therefore, we cannot act aggressively and recklessly.

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,759
I'm asking for Your Majesty's permission

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,359
so that I can lead the elites to blitz Shangjing.

33
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,220
We'll kill the leader of the rebels!

34
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,760
Your Majesty, although Prince of Chu has a great number of troops,

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,480
but they are just rebels he gathered at the eleventh hour.

36
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,799
We need not worry about them.

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,359
Your Majesty should take this opportunity to attack the capital before they secure their footings,

38
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,760
in order to give a true account of the facts.

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,399
Prince of Chu is holding many members of royal families and the officials' families hostage.

40
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,980
If we wage a war, it's hard to keep the morale of the troops high.

41
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,840
Report!

42
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,200
Your Majesty, the Great King of the South Palace has enthroned the crown prince as the emperor.

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,779
- He has issued a fake edict to notify the world about the enthronement.
- Read it.

44
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:01,839
The late emperor has placed Yelv Chongyuan as the crown prince.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,319
After the passing of the late emperor,

46
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,839
Ye... Yelv Hongji tampered with the late emperor's edict

47
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,319
and stole treasures, enraging the entire nation.

48
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,979
- The reigning crown prince...
- Stop reading.

49
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,500
This Nie Lugu...

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,080
I've put up with him for a long time.

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,480
Yet, he forged an edict to mislead the masses.

52
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,080
He has taken our imperial uncle hostage and is forcing the emperor to abdicate.

53
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,799
You're dismissed.

54
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,479
Brother-in-Law, when are we leaving?

56
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,780
No one can stop us if we really want to leave.

57
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,860
Moreover, the war is coming.

58
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,900
We'll get into trouble if we stay here.

59
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,780
Do you think we can become sworn brothers?

60
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,340
Sure.

61
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,859
I'm Xiao Feng, age thirty-one.

62
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:44,240
I, Yelv Ji, am thirteen years older than you.

63
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,580
Then, you'll be my elder brother.

64
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,039
You and I will take a bow before the sky.

65
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,379
The Great Prince of the South Palace started a riot and is taking over the imperial palace.

66
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,379
Other than the grand empress and the empress, the princes, princesses,

67
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,399
and hundreds of the officials' family members are being held captive.

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,719
Elder Brother and I are sworn brothers.

69
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,159
There's a riot going on in Shangjing.

70
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,679
My elder brother is in danger.

71
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,119
I can't just leave him behind.

72
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,099
- But, Brother-in-Law...
- Go get some rest.

73
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:07,559
I'll go and take a look.

74
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,019
If anything happens, I'll make sure you escape safely.

75
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,020
Let me go. I need to save my mother.

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,639
Let me go.

77
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,799
Mother!

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,339
Let me go. I need to save my mother.

79
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,899
Let me go. I need to save my mother.

80
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:30,519
I feel so sorry for my mother.

81
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,720
Her hair has greyed,

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,879
and she has hardly lived a good life.

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,839
If it's decided that we have to start this war,

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,639
I'm ready to sacrifice myself.

85
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,579
Prince of Chu not only started an uprising but also involved our families in this.

86
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:43,399
How can he call himself a man?

87
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,979
I haven't met my son and daughter more than a few times since they were born.

88
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,579
Now, they are being held captive by the rebels.

89
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,540
I let them down.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,759
We are indebted to His Majesty for his kindness.

91
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,800
Tomorrow, we'll give our best in the fight and get ready to die for our country.

92
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,920
[Edict]

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,800
Elder Brother, are you worried about the rebellion?

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,580
The crown prince has the military decree.

95
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,279
He is the field marshal.

96
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,899
Besides, his son, Prince of Chu, is in control of the troops of the South.

97
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,319
Half of the Liao Kingdom's military power is in their clutches.

98
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,739
On the other hand, I only have a small number of royal guards.

99
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,039
We are outnumbered,

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,159
and it'll be hard for us to withstand the attack.

101
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,220
So, it was Prince of Chu.

102
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,359
Do you know him?

103
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,900
We once had an exchange in the Central Plains.

104
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,600
He is an ambitious man,

105
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,959
and his subordinates are the best of the best.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,180
It'll be very difficult to fight them.

107
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,179
Elder Brother, can you...

108
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,119
What it says is justifiable.

109
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,979
After the people of the Liao Kingdom see this, they will certainly grow restless.

110
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,359
If I decide to avoid the war,

111
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:21,260
they will think that I, Yelv Hongji, am in the wrong.

112
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,220
Report!

113
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,040
Your Majesty, the crown prince and Prince of Chu are leading the rebels and are on a warpath.

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,980
They are coming north to ambush Your Majesty.

115
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,280
Elder Brother.

116
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,319
The situation now is that we can only go forward with no means of retreat.

117
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,540
Even if we are doomed to defeat,

118
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,140
we have to fight to the finish.

119
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,400
Guards!

120
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,960
Issue an edict.

121
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,200
Tomorrow, I will take personal command of the armed force.

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,580
Whoever defeats the bad guys will not only get a promotion,

123
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,980
but also will receive a handsome reward.

124
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:26,020
We swear our loyalty to Your Majesty and pledge to fight to the death.

125
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,980
It's time for the decisive battle.

126
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,140
There is a huge number of rebels,

127
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,520
but most of them were coerced into joining the rebellion.

128
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,460
Their morale is low, they are not of one mind.

129
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,900
But you have been fighting along by my side for many years.

130
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,279
You are the brave and skillful warriors of Liao.

131
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,620
You are elites tempered by wars and blood.

132
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,780
Follow me out.

133
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,559
We will fight our way through with a bloody trail

134
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,140
and terrify the mob of rebels to a headlong retreat.

135
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,300
- We swear our loyalty to Your Majesty and pledge to fight to the death.
- We swear our loyalty to Your Majesty and pledge to fight to the death.

136
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,839
Your Majesty, my soldiers have left to join the rebels.

137
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,780
I failed in governing my troops.

138
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,159
I deserve to be sentenced to death.

139
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,480
- This... This... This...
- Why?

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,840
- What's happening?
- This...

141
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,720
Your Majesty, only death can atone for my sins.

142
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,440
You are not the one to blame.

143
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,060
Return to your position.

144
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,960
Thanks, Your Majesty.

145
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,599
Your Majesty.

146
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,319
They are my mother, wife, and children.

147
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,480
I beg Your Majesty for your mercy.

148
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,339
- Leave.
- Thanks, Your Majesty.

149
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,980
Does anyone else want to leave?

150
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,359
It doesn't matter if we lose or win this battle,

151
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:23,100
I will not blame any of you.

152
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,919
We await Your Majesty's command.

153
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,640
We await Your Majesty's command.

154
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,320
Brother, as the ruler of the country,

155
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,560
I can't let the rebels humiliate me.

156
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,319
I need to fight to the very end for the country.

157
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,640
You are an outstanding martial artist.

158
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,850
Escape this place in the midst of the chaos.

159
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,639
I intended to share the wealth with you.

160
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,739
But I can't protect myself now and have even dragged you into this mess.

161
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,240
Elder Brother, why do you say so?

162
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,120
If anything happens,

163
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,039
I will make sure you escape safely.

164
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,240
In the future, we can assemble the men again and we can stage a comeback.

165
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,380
Stage a comeback?

166
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,999
Everyone covets the throne.

167
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,080
But when you are sitting on the throne,

168
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,360
you are given absolutely no leeway.

169
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,779
When you are on the throne, you're surrounded by danger.

170
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:47,940
If you intend to run away from this position,

171
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,920
your only option is death.

172
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,280
Please think twice.

173
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,559
I can't even protect my children and my wife.

174
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,020
What more is there to think about?

175
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,379
The winner will become the ruler, the loser will become the bandit.

176
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,840
The emperor can't live without ambition,

177
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,780
or I'll turn into a laughing stock.

178
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,799
Elder Brother! Elder Brother.

179
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,320
We are sworn brothers.

180
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,120
It doesn't matter if you are the emperor or a commoner.

181
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,740
You'll always be my elder brother.

182
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,460
Now that you are caught up in a crisis,

183
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,740
we shall fight off the rebels together.

184
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,340
Thanks.

185
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,900
Bring the wine over.

186
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,020
Good brother.

187
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,579
- Generals!
- Yes!

188
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:43,259
We shall fight our way out and launch a life-and-death struggle against the rebels.

189
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,100
Yes!

190
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,920
Attack!

191
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,740
Father.

192
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,759
Father, back then, Yelv Hongji failed in his attempt to blitz the Song Nation.

193
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,319
He also tried to rob me of my military power.

194
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,919
But, unfortunately for him, he was eventually defeated by me.

195
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,720
However...

196
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,719
Father, you should not be lenient.

197
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,620
Judging from the current situation, we cannot retreat.

198
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,318
Besides, the late emperor once promised to pass the throne to you.

199
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,599
If he didn't regret it later and decided to pass it to Yelv Hongji instead,

200
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,639
the world would've already belonged to us.

201
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,359
Nie Lugu, you traitor.

202
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,440
Is it going to end like this?

203
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,839
The newly enthroned Liao Emperor and Crown Prince are here in person.

204
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,220
Why are we welcomed by such a brutal scene?

205
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,980
Nie Lugu!

206
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,000
They are all my Liao warriors.

207
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,760
Do you really want to kill them?

208
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,019
Hongji, you usurped my father's throne and have acted as a bogus emperor for a long time.

209
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,540
Your subordinates are considered rebels.

210
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,960
Rebels?

211
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
What an honor.

212
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,040
Surrender now, and my father will spare your life.

213
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,159
We will do what your imperial father did.

214
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,999
We'll pretend to be courteous and make you a crown prince.

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,759
What a shameless man.

216
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,140
He has the audacity to say those words.

217
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,179
Generals, we are ready to die to protect our master's dignity.

218
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,719
We are indebted to our master for his great kindness.

219
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,380
This is the time for us to repay his kindness.

220
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,320
Attack!

221
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Attack!

222
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,380
I beg for Your Majesty's mercy.

223
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,740
Hongji, you should know that your men are Liao warriors.

224
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,879
They shouldn't be sacrificing their lives for you.

225
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,259
You are a man. Be more decisive.

226
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,980
Do you want to surrender? Or do you want to fight?

227
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,139
If you know you're going to die soon, why don't you just cut your own throat?

228
00:19:15,139 --> 00:19:17,079
Then, you don't have to hurt so many others.

229
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,780
Nie Lugu!

230
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,799
I've always been kind to both of you.

231
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,380
Why are you doing this to me?

232
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,860
Kill him.

233
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,860
That's enough.

234
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,559
You are finally surrendering.

235
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,959
Hongji, you should have known by now who is strong and who is weak.

236
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:10,259
I spent so much time talking to you, only trying to vent my anger.

237
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,479
If you don't want more of your subordinates to lose their lives,

238
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,079
you should die now.

239
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,920
You're right.

240
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,740
We are fighting with each other,

241
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,580
and there's no need to involve Liao warriors.

242
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,080
I'll give you the throne.

243
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,700
But you have to promise me

244
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,900
to not hurt Liao warriors and these passionate boys anymore.

245
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Your Majesty.

246
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
Elder Brother.

247
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,600
Brother, take care.

248
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,100
I'll see you in my next life.

249
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,480
Come closer.

250
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,720
Let me take a good look

251
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,680
at how this bogus emperor ruined Liao.

252
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,580
Your Majesty!

253
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,839
Prince of Chu has been sentenced to death.

254
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,399
This is the military decree.

255
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,039
All of you stay put.

256
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,839
The crown prince is here.

257
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,780
Everyone, put down your weapons.

258
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,420
Tell them to lay down their weapons.

259
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,960
Imperial Uncle.

260
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,280
Prince of Chu is greedy for the throne.

261
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,400
He has killed many innocents.

262
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,400
Tell them to lay down their weapons and I'll spare your life.

263
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,060
This is your final chance.

264
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,559
Prince of Chu started chaos

265
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,740
and has now been sentenced to death.

266
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,359
Your Majesty is kind and generous.

267
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,060
I beg Your Majesty for your forgiveness.

268
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,540
Lay down your weapons

269
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,500
and beg His Majesty for his mercy.

270
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
Your Majesty.

271
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,759
All of you are pardoned.

272
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:50,160
Long live Your Majesty.

273
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,060
Congratulations to Your Majesty for quelling the rebellion.

274
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,479
Get up.

275
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,320
Thanks, Your Majesty.

276
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,159
Brother Xiao is a skilled martial artist.

277
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
You saved my life

278
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,720
and saved Liao warriors from having to kill each other.

279
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,439
You also saved the people of Liao from misery and suffering.

280
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,560
This is such a great fortune for Liao.

281
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,980
Yes!

282
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
Issue an edict.

283
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,759
Xiao Feng will now be the Prince of Chu

284
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,119
and be inaugurated as the Great Prince of the South Palace.

285
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,640
He will lead the troops and return to Shangjing.

286
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,700
In the future, he will help me in unifying the Central Plains.

287
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,879
Congratulations, Prince Xiao. You deserve this.

288
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,119
Congratulations.

289
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,659
- Hero Xiao is the perfect candidate for Prince of Chu.
- He deserves it.

290
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:02,599
This is the first time a title has been given to someone besides family.

291
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,759
Congratulations, Prince Xiao.

292
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,539
We owe today's victory to Your Majesty's greatest fortune.

293
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:12,599
As your brother, I only used a little brute force. I deserve no credits.

294
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,200
Moreover,

295
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,339
I don't know how to be an official and I don't want to be an official either.

296
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:20,820
He doesn't want to...

297
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,680
I hope Your Majesty can retract the edict.

298
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,020
Brother Xiao, you saved me twice.

299
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,220
I, Yelv Hongji, will always remember your kindness.

300
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,099
Prince of Chu and the Great Prince of the South Palace

301
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:40,860
are the highest ranks in Liao Kingdom.

302
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,320
If you don't want to accept it,

303
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,120
I can only give you the throne.

304
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,440
I have no other choice.

305
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,999
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty!

306
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,100
I dare not violate your edict.

307
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,420
Thanks, Your Majesty.

308
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,499
It's just that, I'm only a crude and uneducated man.

309
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:01,440
I know nothing about the laws.

310
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,360
If I make any mistakes in the future,

311
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,980
I wish to ask for Your Majesty's forgiveness in advance.

312
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,060
Brother.

313
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,679
Issue an edict.

314
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,439
We'll return to Shangjing to celebrate our victory.

315
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:31,100
Long live Your Majesty.

316
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,479
We're so unlucky.

317
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,540
We lost the Holyword's Pot, too.

318
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,460
- What should we do now?
- What should we tell our master?

319
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,159
Do you think we will be the next one?

320
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,940
Shut up.

321
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,520
Master!

322
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,640
Old Deity of Xingxiu. Endless power.

323
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,299
Omnipotent. Living a long life with the greatest fortune.

324
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,899
Old Deity of Xingxiu. Endless power.

325
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:09,960
Omnipotent. Living a long life with the greatest fortune.

326
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,859
Old Deity of Xingxiu. Endless power.

327
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:15,839
Omnipotent. Living a long life with the greatest fortune.

328
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,639
Old Deity of Xingxiu. Endless power.

329
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,190
Omnipotent.

330
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,600
Living a long life with the greatest fortune.
[Ding Chunqiu, Old Freak of Xingxiu]

331
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,380
Master!

332
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,760
Something's wrong.

333
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,160
Where is Zhai Xingzi?

334
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,659
A'Zi... killed Zhai Xingzi.

335
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:35,879
She also stole the treasure.

336
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,159
She is heading north with her brother-in-law whom we have never heard of.

337
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,839
They are very strong and we couldn't do anything at all.

338
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,640
You're saying that you haven't retrieved the Holyword's Pot,

339
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,520
and also let A'Zi slip away.

340
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,380
Yes.

341
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,039
Scoundrels.

342
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,699
What's the use of me raising you?

343
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:10,319
Master!

344
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,759
Master, please show mercy!

345
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,820
You don't know about this.

346
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,859
Eldest Martial Sister has mastered a powerful skill.

347
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,019
She extinguished Zhai Xingzi's divine flame with just one palm strike.

348
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,399
Exactly.

349
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,079
That was a remarkable skill.

350
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,439
All of us were dumbfounded.

351
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,719
Her brother-in-law...

352
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,359
He's even more powerful than Eldest Martial Sister.

353
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,479
He grabbed our steel staff and just randomly threw it,

354
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,839
and effortlessly stuck it into the mountain wall.

355
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,039
We couldn't even pull it out.

356
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,360
Yes. That's what happened, Master!

357
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,440
A'Zi has limited strength.

358
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,400
She must have borrowed the man's strength to defeat Zhai Xingzi.

359
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,079
Who exactly is he?

360
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,119
Eldest Martial Sister said... Ptui!

361
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,459
A'Zi said her brother-in-law is the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

362
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:04,679
His name is... Qiao Feng.

363
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,039
Yes. Qiao Feng.

364
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,840
Qiao Feng?

365
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,859
You are saying... Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North. That Qiao Feng?

366
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,159
Yes. A'Zi said it herself.

367
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,520
- All of us heard it.
- Yes.

368
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,060
That's weird.

369
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,420
She only went out for a while

370
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,359
and she recruited a powerful brother-in-law.

371
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,899
We don't know if she's telling the truth.

372
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:37,839
But the Holyword's Pot is our sect's treasure.

373
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,179
We can't let it stay out of our possession for too long.

374
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:42,399
Listen here.

375
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,679
Bring a few more guys with you to find out their whereabouts.

376
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,639
If you can retrieve the Holyword's Pot

377
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,599
and redeem your sins by good deeds,

378
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,999
you will be excused from punishments.

379
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,819
Thanks, Master!

380
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:00,220
Having our master with us, we have nothing to be afraid of.

381
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,499
Our master is omnipotent.

382
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,439
They haven't seen how powerful our master is.

383
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,381
If our master is to make a move, they will be terrified.

384
00:30:06,381 --> 00:30:09,999
Yes. They will definitely surrender the pot willingly.

385
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,479
What chief of the Beggars' Sect?

386
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,539
What... Qiao Feng?

387
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:16,159
The moment you show your power, his reputation will turn into nothing but bubbles.

388
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,519
Well said.

389
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,479
Old Deity of Xingxiu. Endless power.

390
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,999
Defeating the Beggars' Sect.

391
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,679
Beating Qiao Feng.

392
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,499
Old Deity of Xingxiu. Endless power.

393
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:30,379
Defeating the Beggars' Sect. Beating Qiao Feng.

394
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Greetings to the Great Prince of the South Palace!

395
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,299
Great Prince Xiao, many of our soldiers heard that you were coming.

396
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,039
They are here to send you their gratitude.

397
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,619
The Great Prince of the South Palace saved the emperor; therefore, he saved our lives too.

398
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,039
Thanks, Great Prince of the South Palace, for saving our lives.

399
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,859
The Great Prince of the South Palace quelled the rebellion and saved dozens of lives.

400
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,839
God bless the Great Prince of the South Palace.

401
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
We wish you a long and wealthy life.

402
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,639
A long and wealthy life.

403
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:08,500
Brother-in-Law, look. You did your best in the Central Plains,

404
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,759
yet you offended many men.

405
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,159
You became the most wicked and evil man in the martial arts world.

406
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,500
Now that you're here, all of them are bowing to you and praising your efforts.

407
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,039
In my opinion,

408
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,739
it's better being the Great Prince of the South Palace than the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

409
00:31:23,739 --> 00:31:26,919
I assassinated Prince of Chu because of a burst of courage.

410
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,799
Not only did I save my brother, but I also saved myself.

411
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:32,039
I didn't expect that the people would benefit, too.

412
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,479
I accepted the title of the Great Prince of the South Palace

413
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,879
because it was hard to turn down the kind offer.

414
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,679
I didn't expect to gain more responsibility.

415
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,039
Brother-in-Law, why are you worrying unnecessarily?

416
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,919
You helped His Majesty,

417
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,319
therefore you helped everyone in the Liao Kingdom.

418
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,820
You only have to enjoy your title.

419
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,539
Great Prince, the soldiers will settle themselves in the barracks.

420
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,620
I'll show you around.

421
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,979
Brother Mo, I am a crude man and have no knowledge of government and military affairs.

422
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:03,159
I might need your help in the future.

423
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,359
Please remind me if I make any mistakes.

424
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,919
Great Prince, I'm humbled.

425
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,639
I'm very honored to be able to serve you.

426
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:12,439
If I can be of any help,

427
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,519
I'll make sure to do my best.

428
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,020
This way.

429
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,819
This is the front yard.

430
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:25,260
The houses on both sides are to house the family members.

431
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,480
Great Prince, this is the main building.

432
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,200
This is the residence of the former Prince of Chu.

433
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,699
Great Prince, if you see anything you don't like, don't hesitate to tell me.

434
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:39,600
I'll tell the housekeeper to redecorate it.

435
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,620
Great Prince, this way.

436
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,120
This is a good place,

437
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,319
but it's too extravagant.

438
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,260
I'm but a crude man.

439
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,519
I can't use such a delicate item.

440
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,740
- Keep it.
- Yes, Great Prince.

441
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,100
Prince, that's Prince of Chu's study.

442
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:17,079
All the documents regarding the military affairs of the South Palace are stored there.

443
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,619
The housekeeper has brought along a few stewards and is ready to report the affairs to you.

444
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:23,720
If you're ready, I'll usher you there now.

445
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,060
This way.

446
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,659
I heard that Great Prince Xiao grew up among the Han people.

447
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,300
He once fought with Prince of Chu

448
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,619
and defeated our troops.

449
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:39,959
Yes, but no.

450
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,159
How so?

451
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,440
I think Prince of Chu rebelled against his superior and he deserved to die.

452
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,959
But this Xiao Feng...

453
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,999
He doesn't have any qualifications to be our Great Prince of the South Palace.

454
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,740
Precisely.

455
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,199
Who is my brother-in-law?

456
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,740
You're in no place to comment on him.

457
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,819
Miss, please spare our lives.

458
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:03,520
Spare your lives?

459
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,339
You should go ask around,

460
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:08,039
and you'll know that I've never spared anyone before.

461
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,959
After hearing what you said just now,

462
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,279
I will make sure to put you in a hellish place.

463
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:17,999
Stop!

464
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:21,680
- Brother-in-Law?
- Great Prince, please have mercy.

465
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,519
Did you poison them?

466
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,600
Brother-in-Law, they were talking behind your back. They deserve to be punished.

467
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,220
Great Prince, please have mercy.

468
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,759
Antidote.

469
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,999
Give me the antidote.

470
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,399
A'Zi, come here.

471
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,299
Why did you hurt them for no reason?

472
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:06,399
I didn't hurt them for no reason.

473
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,020
If they didn't speak evil words and smear your name,

474
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,560
I wouldn't have been bothered.

475
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,240
Moreover, I only want to show them what I've got.

476
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,340
Otherwise, they won't respect you as the Great Prince of the South Palace.

477
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,160
Even if you did that for me,

478
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,199
I don't want you to be so vicious.

479
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,659
They are maids who work for the Prince of Chu.

480
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:28,439
It's understandable for them to resent me.

481
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,780
Is it really necessary to make things difficult for them?

482
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,100
Sure.

483
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,319
All in all, you're the good guy and I'm the bad guy.

484
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,019
It doesn't matter what I do, they all look like mistakes to you.

485
00:35:39,019 --> 00:35:41,779
- I'm leaving.
- A'Zi.

486
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm going back to my room.

487
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,919
The crown prince felt humiliated

488
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,839
and he killed himself on the way here.

489
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,319
I promised him to not pursue this matter,

490
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,740
and will only punish the main leader who worked for Prince of Chu.

491
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,439
You contributed the most to quell this rebellion.

492
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:09,119
I've ordered my men to send rewards to your place in a few days.

493
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,980
Thanks, Your Majesty.

494
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,560
But I've spent most of my life in the martial arts world.

495
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,399
I have no desire for money.

496
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,039
Why don't you distribute the money to the family members of the sacrificed soldiers?

497
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,679
If they didn't fight bravely for the nation,

498
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,020
I wouldn't have had the chance to strike an attack.

499
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,159
I'll listen to you.

500
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,759
You have made a great contribution.

501
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,380
They have prepared a banquet.

502
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,660
[Palace]

503
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,119
Great Prince Xiao, we'll propose a toast to you.

504
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,540
We'll propose a toast to you, too!

505
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,539
Great Prince Xiao, I'll drink a toast, too!

506
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,679
Let's drink!

507
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,059
Your Majesty, cheers!

508
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,560
Bottoms up!

509
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,719
I have issued an edict to inaugurate A'Zi as the Princess of the Liao Kingdom.

510
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,099
If she's not feeling well and needs any expensive herbs,

511
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,839
she can approach the imperial physician.

512
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,940
Thanks, Your Majesty.

513
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,360
Yi Yekun, the leader of the Ministry of Five Kingdoms, is here to greet Your Majesty.

514
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,439
- Who is he?
- Yi Yekun?

515
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,799
- This way.
- What is he doing here?

516
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:22,780
Your Majesty.

517
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,179
You are back.

518
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:27,760
Did anything happen in the Four Dynasties?

519
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,319
He is the newly appointed Great Prince of the South Palace,

520
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,219
also my sworn brother, Xiao Feng.

521
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:41,619
You can be upfront about your intention.

522
00:37:41,619 --> 00:37:45,899
Your Majesty, I have an urgent military affair to report to you.

523
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:50,640
But... I don't think it's appropriate to say this in Brother Xiao's presence.

524
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,099
Why not? Tell me.

525
00:37:53,121 --> 00:37:56,279
I used to follow Prince of Chu in the war against the Song Dynasty.

526
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,599
I met Brother Xiao on the battlefield.

527
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,340
At that time, he was leading all the skilled martial artists of the Central Plains,

528
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,699
and captured Prince of Chu alive.

529
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:10,780
If it wasn't for him, our hundreds of thousands of soldiers wouldn't have had to retreat empty-handedly.

530
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,999
Your Majesty.

531
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,879
I know that Great Prince Xiao saved your life.

532
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,279
But he was raised by the Han.

533
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,879
He also grew up with the Han people.

534
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:38,199
We don't know if he's still in favor of the Han people.

535
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,660
Do you agree with me?

536
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,640
He's right.

537
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,480
How dare you!

538
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,740
Don't you trust the Great Prince of the South Palace I appointed?

539
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,639
Listen here. We'll end this now.

540
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:33,280
From now on, whoever makes a fuss about my brother's background,

541
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,341
will be executed along with all the members of his family.

542
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,360
[Liao]

543
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,639
Elder Brother, you don't have to speak up for me.

544
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,759
I have always had a different background.

545
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,839
It's inevitable for them to have scruples against me.

546
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,860
I appointed you as the Great Prince of the South Palace.

547
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,140
Your job is to take care of the Four Dynasties and blitz the Central Plains.

548
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,159
We need to show them my brother's capabilities.

549
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,020
Sooner or later, you'll have to go south to the Central Plains.

550
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,860
Your Majesty.

551
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,920
Going south is a major event.

552
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,079
It involves the lives of thousands of people.

553
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,660
I am just an impulsive man.

554
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,320
Planning a military strategy is not my forte.

555
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,780
I hope that Your Majesty can retract your order.

556
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,279
I can put this on hold.

557
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,560
But please remember that your main job

558
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,039
is to annex the Southern Four Dynasties.

559
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,559
As they are fighting against each other, we shall take this opportunity to conquer them all.

560
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,799
Yes.

561
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,440
This is how it should be.

562
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,519
Don't you want to know how I found out about the war in the Southern Four Dynasties?

563
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,580
Please enlighten me, Your Majesty.

564
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,320
There are many despicable and shameless men.

565
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,100
I only have to buy a few of them over.

566
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,920
Understood.

567
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,819
I heard that you haven't eaten for the past two days.

568
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:06,319
You only care about the others. Why do you care about me now?

569
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
This is for you.

570
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,880
Take this as compensation.

571
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,860
I'll be able to eat tonight.

572
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:53,179
Brother-in-Law, is something bothering you?

573
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,699
Since I started learning martial arts, I befriended many heroes.
