Do you agree to my conditions?

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,140
What if I don't?

16
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,700
At worst, we'll duel for days and nights.

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,400
By the end of the battle, you'll have grandchildren already!

18
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,780
Yu'er.

19
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,820
- Yu'er!
- Yu'er!

20
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,280
- Yu'er!
- Yu'er!

21
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,740
Ling'er?

22
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,360
Ling'er, is that you?

23
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,860
Ling'er! Ling'er!

24
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,179
- Mother.
- Ling'er!

25
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,720
You brat!

26
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,920
Are you all right?

27
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,880
Have you no shame? How did you end up with that bastard?

28
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,820
I'm going to slap you to death!

29
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,160
I'm disciplining my own daughter. You stay out of this!

30
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,360
Chief Zhong, I didn't expect you to be so generous

31
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,559
as to let your daughter take care of my son.

32
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,820
In that case, she's also part of my family.

33
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,100
Thus, I won't let this be.

34
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,440
How could this be?

35
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,880
- Mother!
- Ling'er!

36
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,140
Third Master Yue, your master commands you

37
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,539
to rescue Miss Zhong right away!

38
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,400
What did you say?

39
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,759
You take me as your mentor and Miss Zhong is my wife.

40
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,259
That makes her your responsibility too.

41
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,199
Yun Zhonghe is tormenting your master's wife.

42
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,219
Wouldn't it be disgraceful and unheroic of you to let this be?

43
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:32,680
Wait!

44
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,960
How many wives do you have?

45
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,459
Don't ask too much! All things considered,

46
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:40,439
if you can't even win against Yun Zhonghe,

47
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,519
you'll be demoted to Fifth Evil, or even the Sixth Evil!

48
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,539
Impossible! Cut the crap!

49
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,680
Madam Zhong.

50
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,519
Chief Zhong and the Nanhai Crocodile have gone after Miss Zhong.

51
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,279
I'm sure they'll get her back soon.

52
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,640
When Miss Zhong comes back,

53
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,640
we will officially propose a marriage between Duan Yu and Zhong Ling.

54
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,839
Rest assured. Whatever Yu'er does,

55
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,020
the Duan family will be responsible for him.

56
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,180
Come with me, Yu'er.

57
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,460
Brother Chun, this matter ends here.

58
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,140
Yu'er still needs to be healed.

59
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,920
We should depart right away.

60
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
Yes.

61
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,320
Let's go, Yu'er.

62
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,139
Don't worry, Baobao.

63
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,380
You heard what my brother said.

64
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,580
We will propose a marriage definitely.

65
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,240
You don't get it at all.

66
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,900
You don't understand at all!

67
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,640
Baobao?

68
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,879
Thanks to Your Majesty's brilliant plan

69
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,180
of feigning one thing while doing something else.

70
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,879
You sent Marshal Hua to dig a tunnel

71
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,519
in order to defeat the Four Evils

72
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,560
while they were caught off guard.

73
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,620
I still don't get it.

74
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,740
Obviously, that was Miss Mu in the stone house.

75
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,900
How did it turn out to be Miss Zhong in the end?

76
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,199
At first, I dug the wrong way and ran into Miss Zhong.

77
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,199
Then, I dragged her into the tunnel.

78
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:57,620
I only intended to prevent her from discovering the secret of the tunnel.

79
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,200
However, later, I heard the conversation between Zhong Wanchou and his wife.

80
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,760
That's when I learned that he plotted to bring down Duan Yu.

81
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,140
I quickly revised my plans and took her to the stone house.

82
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,680
Seeing how abominable Zhong Wanchou was,

83
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,820
I thought of playing a big prank on him.

84
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,759
I immediately took off Miss Zhong's outer robe and put it on Miss Mu.

85
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,040
Then I carried Miss Zhong to Young Master Duan.

86
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,320
[Shenjie Temple]

87
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,380
[Buddha]

88
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,240
Come in.

89
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,380
Grand Martial Uncle.

90
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,180
Hui Zhen told me

91
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,540
that you've been sparring with the masters this afternoon.

92
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,660
Yes.

93
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,779
Martial Uncle said it was a golden opportunity, so he got me to battle especially.

94
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,779
Did you win or lose?

95
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,300
I lost.

96
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,019
The masters of the temple are indeed skilled.

97
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,780
I accept my defeat with a sincere heart.

98
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,340
Grand Martial Uncle,

99
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,799
I'm worried that I'm too slow and dumb

100
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,380
that I might disgrace Shaolin's reputation.

101
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,000
You are neither slow nor dumb.

102
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,620
You are merely too serious.

103
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,340
I often wonder... what my parents were like.

104
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,140
I guess...

105
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,980
they must have been like you.

106
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,999
You fool.

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,800
You little fool.

108
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,420
There's an old saying that goes,

109
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,860
too much wisdom will hurt you

110
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,519
and deep passion will shorten your life.

111
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,520
That is meant for someone like you who is often too concerned for others.

112
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,079
Maybe you'll never know

113
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,720
as long as you're flesh and blood.

114
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,600
Flesh and blood?

115
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,280
I grew up in the temple all my life.

116
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,860
I have never felt or encountered desires.

117
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,639
There is a wide road up ahead.

118
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,780
There are opportunities at every corner.

119
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,980
It's something neither of us can see through.

120
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,320
Remember.

121
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,679
In life, there are circumstances. Both good and bad.

122
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,820
There are all sorts of talented people and states of mind,

123
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,220
yet none of them can determine a person's status.

124
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,500
As long as you are kind-hearted,

125
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,700
even if your abilities are limited,

126
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,560
you, too, can make a difference.

127
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,000
I will remember that.

128
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,019
Why did you summon me in the middle of the night, Brother?

129
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,820
Brother Chun... Guess.

130
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,260
Who sparred with me today?

131
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,080
I have no idea.

132
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,280
Could it be someone who left Tianlong Temple?

133
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,979
It was... Crown Prince Yan Qing.

134
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,660
But Crown Prince Yan Qing is no longer with us.

135
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,399
You probably ran into some impostor.

136
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,760
One can assume his name as one pleases,

137
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,020
but no one can imitate his One-Finger Death Touch,

138
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,400
let alone attain his level of that skill.

139
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,700
This person is leagues above me.

140
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,860
So I brought myself to conclude that he is indeed Crown Prince Yan Qing.

141
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,359
There's no doubt about it.

142
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,639
If he really is Crown Prince Yan Qing,

143
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,039
he must be the most prominent figure in the Duan family.

144
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,720
Then why would he turn on us and bring down our reputation?

145
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,660
He has been disabled for the rest of his life.

146
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,040
I believe that something unthinkable must have happened.

147
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,320
That's why we can't use logical reasoning to understand why.

148
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,940
Besides, I now occupy the throne of Dali.

149
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,590
This will certainly infuriate Crown Prince Yan Qing.

150
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,520
I suppose he wants to ruin all of us

151
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,700
to satisfy his sadistic desire.

152
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,479
Your Majesty, you have been on the throne for a long time.

153
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:28,919
You are beloved and respected by your subjects.

154
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,439
And you have done great deeds for the nation.

155
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,079
Even if Crown Prince Yan Qing is reborn,

156
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,959
he can no longer assume the throne.

157
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,580
Even if Emperor Shang De is revived, he can no longer take your throne.

158
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,479
Let us not dwell on whether he is Crown Prince Yan Qing or not.

159
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,520
We'll just treat him as the leader of the Four Evils.

160
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,079
We must do away with him, Your Majesty.

161
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,840
No.

162
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,860
This throne belonged to him in the first place.

163
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,239
Had he not fallen into our enemy's traps and gone missing,

164
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:05,859
the late emperor would not have assumed the throne and later passed it to me.

165
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:09,520
Now that he has re-emerged,

166
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,480
we should return the throne to him.

167
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,499
I believe that if the late emperor were still alive,

168
00:14:17,499 --> 00:14:19,179
he would do the same.

169
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:21,380
You mustn't, Brother.

170
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,020
This green-robed stranger is the chief of the Four Evils.

171
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,340
If he is in Dali,

172
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,499
there's no telling how much suffering he will cause to our people.

173
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:33,340
If you give him the throne,

174
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,380
I would rather die a thousand deaths than accept it!

175
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,300
Dare I... second his motion.

176
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,019
We see that this man is indeed perverse and vicious.

177
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:48,220
It would be fitting to deem him a brazen criminal.

178
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,959
If this wicked man is not Crown Prince Yan Qing,

179
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,279
then he cannot covet the throne.

180
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,879
But even if he is Crown Prince Yan Qing,

181
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,940
how can you let such a treacherous man

182
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,439
rule over the people of Dali, Your Majesty?

183
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,439
That will cause the kingdom to collapse and fall into chaos!

184
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,720
Please reconsider, Brother.

185
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,180
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

186
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,900
Both of you, rise.

187
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,320
What you said makes sense.

188
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,480
- Ba Sikong.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

189
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,799
Here is my edict.

190
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,260
Have the Hanlin Academy draft an imperial decree on my behalf.

191
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,860
To confer my brother, Zhengchun, as the crown prince.

192
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,719
Brother, your kingdom is prospering and your people are doing well.
(TN: usually crown prince passes to the sons, but he has given it to his brother which doesn't usually happen)

193
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,999
The heavens will bless us with plenty of descendants.

194
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,440
We should postpone the discussion of the naming of the heir to the throne.

195
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
I have made up my mind.

196
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,599
As for Crown Prince Yan Qing, only the three of us know about it.

197
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,599
It cannot be leaked out

198
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,280
to prevent any exploitation by those with malicious intent.

199
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

200
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,299
- Ba Sikong.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,479
Go on. Pass on the decree.

202
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

203
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,040
Look. This is our Dali.

204
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,319
Our way of life is simple, yet the people thrive in harmony.

205
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,980
Though lacking the abundance of the Central Plains,

206
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,159
but no matter who, men and women, young and old,

207
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,239
are able to live peacefully

208
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,880
in a simple and happy life.

209
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,019
I only wish for the people of Dali

210
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:49,799
to continue living happily and peacefully

211
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,100
from generation to generation.

212
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,580
Indeed, Your Majesty.

213
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,819
Congratulations, Your Highness.

214
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,318
It is your merits and capabilities that earned you this conferment.

215
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:14,259
I am flattered.

216
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,139
Dan Chen, how is Wan Li doing?

217
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:20,019
Thanks to your blessings, he has fully recovered.

218
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,800
Good to hear.

219
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,560
I would also like to congratulate Young Master Duan.

220
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,780
We hope to have a cup of wine at Young Master Duan's wedding as well.

221
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,879
The Nanhai Crocodile and Zhong Wanchou teamed up to rescue Miss Zhong.

222
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:34,380
They will surely return with her safely.

223
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,060
My brother has also sent someone to inquire about her.

224
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,720
Once she returns, we'll get on with the proposal right away.

225
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,059
- Gan Baobao presents this to you.
- What is this?

226
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,679
It's Zhong Ling's horoscope.

227
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,560
She... She wanted him to pass it to you.

228
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,999
How clever of them.

229
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:02,900
Someone has presented us

230
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,500
their daughter's horoscope ahead of the proposal.

231
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,420
[She was born in the third month between the imperial and Zhong family]

232
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,280
- It cannot go ahead.
- What cannot go ahead?

233
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,979
You see, Zhong Wanchou carries ill intentions.

234
00:18:18,979 --> 00:18:20,860
We certainly cannot have him as an in-law.

235
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,380
This matter will certainly not do.

236
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,640
I see.

237
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,180
It turns out that this girl, Zhong Ling,

238
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,880
is also your illegitimate daughter.

239
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,640
Reporting!

240
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,939
Your Highness, two eminent monks were sent from Shaolin to deliver a letter.

241
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,540
Madam, I will go to see them in.

242
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,399
Father. Father!

243
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,079
We, the monks from Shaolin, Hui Zhen and Xu Zhu,

244
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:27,160
greet Your Highness.

245
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,580
You have come a long way.

246
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,640
Welcome to my palace. Please come inside and have some tea.

247
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,559
There is no need. Your Highness, our abbot instructed us to present this letter

248
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,959
to Emperor Bao Ding and Prince Zhennan.

249
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,099
If possible, we would like to see His Majesty

250
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,839
over some other pressing matters.

251
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,219
All right. I will take you both to see His Majesty.

252
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:51,800
Amitabha.

253
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,439
Your Majesty, Prince Zhennan and two Shaolin monks seek your audience.

254
00:20:14,439 --> 00:20:16,900
Shaolin monks?

255
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,699
- Let them in quickly.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,040
Right this way.

257
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,340
Greetings, Your Majesty.

258
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,740
Masters, you must be tired from coming a long way.

259
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,880
This is a letter from our abbot.

260
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,770
Please read it, Your Majesty.

261
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,120
[For Dali Kingdom Emperor]

262
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,260
The Abbot of Shaolin once decreed.

263
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,279
"We are all disciples of Buddha and members of a pugilist world

264
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,159
who will heed all commands within the bounds of our teachings."

265
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,359
Reverend Xuan Bei is proficient in Buddhism and also in martial arts.

266
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,460
My brethren and I have always admired him.

267
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,959
I wonder when he will grace us with his presence,

268
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,360
so that we may prepare the place in advance for his arrival.

269
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,759
We are all members of the pugilist world.

270
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,460
There is no need for such formalities.

271
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,879
Both of you look so dejected.

272
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,480
Why is this?

273
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,880
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

274
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,300
Our...Our reverend has passed away.

275
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,320
He passed away?

276
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,280
May I ask when did Reverend Xuan Bei pass away?

277
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,060
Three days prior,

278
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,080
Grand Martial Uncle brought us here to Dali

279
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,840
and stopped by the Shenjie Temple.

280
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
We had planned to rest and recuperate ourselves

281
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,160
while waiting for Your Majesty and Prince Zhennan to summon us.

282
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,359
Little did we expect, yesterday morning,

283
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,199
when... when I checked on him,

284
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,660
I found out that he had passed away.

285
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,420
Was Reverend Xuan Bei afflicted by some hidden weapon?

286
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,780
Hidden weapon?

287
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,040
But... But there were no wounds on his body.

288
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:28,527
And there were no signs of fighting in his room.

289
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,619
Reverend Xuan Bei must have been killed by the Great Vajra in his chest.

290
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,260
It is exactly as you said.

291
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,119
May I ask how you knew about it?

292
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,300
I've heard of Reverend Xuan Bei from Shaolin for a long time.

293
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,400
The Great Vajra is one of the most revered martial art.

294
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,940
Once inflicted, it shatters the opponent's bones.

295
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,000
It is overbearing.

296
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,800
May I ask if that was the case for the Reverend?

297
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
Yes.

298
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,440
Do you have any idea who could have done it?

299
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,240
The Murong Clan has a saying that goes,

300
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,900
"Fight fire with fire."

301
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,360
Have you two heard of it?

302
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:21,179
No... The heavens really is playing a big joke on me.

303
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,420
I'm already engaged to Sister Wan.

304
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,440
But for some reason, all of a sudden she turned out to be my sister.

305
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,380
Now, even Zhong Ling turned out to be my sister, too.

306
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,920
This is terrible! What do I do now?

307
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,319
Oh, Duan Yu. Duan Yu.

308
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,879
If you had honed your martial arts skills,

309
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,819
you could have saved Sister Wan and took her with you out of the stone house.

310
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,600
That way, Zhong Ling would not have fallen into Yun Zhonghe's hands!

311
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,459
Never mind. Instead of dwelling on such troubling matters,

312
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:05,220
I should...

313
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,659
I should put more effort into practicing the techniques Deity Sister passed to me.

314
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:10,180
That's right.

315
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,119
What? How did it end up like this?

316
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,479
This is bad.

317
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:31,759
I could not bear the heat inside the stone house and removed my clothes.

318
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,860
The pages must have been torn apart when I roughly took off my clothes.

319
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,040
Never mind. The scroll is ruined.

320
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,420
There's no way I can practice Sister Deity's techniques now.

321
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,259
But that means all the things Miss Deity said about wiping out the Carefree Sect and whatnot,

322
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,440
all of those don't matter anymore.

323
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,460
That's right.

324
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,540
Besides, I feel as if I am insulting her by potentially having lewd thoughts

325
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,520
whenever I see the nude images on this scroll.

326
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,360
I might as well burn it.

327
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,179
I have heard of someone in this world who goes by the name Murong Bo.

328
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:48,219
Under that name, he developed a profound knowledge of martial arts.

329
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:56,059
It seems that he knows and can perform every secret technique of every sect in the pugilist world.

330
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:01,000
Most interestingly, if he chooses to kill someone,

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,380
he will choose to end their lives with the very technique that earned them their fame.

332
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,020
That leaves us much to ponder then.

333
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,259
How can he master all the martial arts in the world?

334
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:12,380
Indeed, Your Highness.

335
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,780
To study all of the knowledge in the world

336
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,140
is as if to swim through the entire sea. There is no end to it.

337
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,919
I heard

338
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,220
that if Murong Bo cannot learn his foe's ultimate skill

339
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:25,460
and thus cannot kill them with their own technique,

340
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,380
he will absolutely not attack them.

341
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,880
I, too, have heard of this strange man.

342
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,860
The Three Heroes of Luo Clan in Hebei were proficient in flying awls.

343
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,540
Yet all three of them were killed by flying awls themselves.

344
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:41,200
The Taoist Zhang Xu from Shandong is fond

345
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,060
of chopping off his foes' limbs when he kills.

346
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:47,220
He ended up with his limbs chopped off as well.

347
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,914
Just like the saying, "Fight fire with fire."

348
00:27:51,914 --> 00:27:57,219
These very words were quoted from Taoist Zhang Xu's incident.

349
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:59,660
It happened in downtown ​​Jinan.

350
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,340
A lot of people watched

351
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,680
Taoist Zhang Xu get his limbs chopped off as he screamed and rolled on the ground.

352
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,019
If that's the case, then this man must be highly skilled.

353
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,240
I have a personal experience

354
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,520
I will share it with all of you.

355
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,300
Thirteen years ago,

356
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:25,300
I escorted an official who had served his term back to his hometown.

357
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,660
On the way, we ran into four bandits.

358
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,060
They attacked us and tried to rob us.

359
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,159
Forced by the circumstances,

360
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:42,379
I used my Vajra Finger and killed all of them.

361
00:28:42,379 --> 00:28:46,239
At that very moment, along came a mother and a child.

362
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:49,980
The mother appeared to be in her late thirties,

363
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,199
while the boy on horseback

364
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,599
was probably around 11 or 12.

365
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,520
He was good-looking and young,

366
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,960
and seemed well-groomed.

367
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,999
But then I heard the boy say...

368
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,860
What's so great about that?

369
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,820
Just some little martial arts technique.

370
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,899
A young boy ran his mouth at you like that?

371
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:13,060
You don't understand, Your Highness.

372
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,039
It made me very furious when he said that.

373
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,099
But how could I argue with a child?

374
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:27,039
What I didn't know was that woman saw through my skills right away.

375
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,740
She said my Vajra Finger technique was authentic.

376
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,820
From the Dharma Academy in Putian, Fujian.

377
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,220
That I had only mastered a third of the skill.

378
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,939
I was taken aback and horrified by the revelation.

379
00:29:38,939 --> 00:29:42,220
I wanted to ask her for guidance.

380
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,180
So. What happened after that?

381
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,860
You didn't scare the child, did you?

382
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,120
Not at all.

383
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,420
Hold it right there!

384
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,679
What did you say?

385
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,839
The boy was about to confront me,

386
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,540
but the woman restrained him.

387
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,579
Apparently, she told him

388
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:10,320
not to cause trouble on the road.

389
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:16,359
However, I was young and restless back then.

390
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,860
I insisted on arguing.

391
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,340
So I stepped forward.

392
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,739
Hold it right there!

393
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:24,139
He turned around and hit me with a single strike.

394
00:30:24,139 --> 00:30:28,020
That's when I realized that his skills far exceeded mine.

395
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,500
Unexpectedly, the woman said to him...

396
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,839
If you're going to strike,

397
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,379
you must make sure you end his life!

398
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,659
- The boy came straight at me.
- Kill him!

399
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:42,760
I hurriedly used my Cloud Blocking Hand.

400
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,299
However, the boy did not dodge and charged head-on.

401
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,380
I only felt pain in my left chest.

402
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,599
How can such a young child possess such skills?

403
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,819
Fortunately, my body is different.

404
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:02,800
My heart is aligned to the right, rather than the left.

405
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,780
That's how I survived.

406
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,399
The boy was surprised to see that I didn't die.

407
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,960
But the woman stopped him.

408
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,779
She said, "The Murong Clan does not have a letdown of a boy like you.

409
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,499
You haven't mastered your skills, so you are not to fight him anymore."

410
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:24,700
And she took him away.

411
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,219
Thus, my life was spared.

412
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:33,660
That boy should be about the same age as Young Master Duan now.

413
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:39,260
The boy I met was probably not Murong Bo,

414
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,499
but his son, Murong Fu.

415
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:45,120
By looking at the child,

416
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,240
you can tell what his father is like.

417
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,039
I am ashamed.

418
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,799
As I spend my time contemplating on life and death these days,

419
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,900
I have rarely thought of my past honor and shame nowadays.

420
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,540
But when I look back sometimes,

421
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,639
fear still lingers in me.

422
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:05,399
It seems that this person is the one who killed Grand Martial Uncle.

423
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm going to find him.

424
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,099
I want to avenge Grand Martial Uncle.

425
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,459
I'm going to find him.

426
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:13,219
Xu Zhu, this is not a matter to take lightly of.

427
00:32:13,219 --> 00:32:16,399
Don't speak rashly until we get to the bottom of this.

428
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,000
That's right.

429
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,180
Brother Chun.

430
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,479
You will lead a mission to the Shenjie Temple in Luliangzhou

431
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:32,880
to pay my respects to the late Reverend Xuan Bei.

432
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,240
- Tian Shi.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

433
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,680
Write a letter to the Abbot of Shaolin

434
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,519
to say that the Duan family has not forgotten their roots in the pugilist world.

435
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,419
But our ancestors have wished for us

436
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,719
not to allow our descendants

437
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,699
to get involved in the vendettas of the pugilist world.

438
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,720
Regarding the death of Reverend Xuan Bei,

439
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,280
while the Duan family of Dali will not observe and do nothing,

440
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,899
but the Shaolin Temple will have to

441
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:04,780
deal with the vendetta behind the assassination of the Reverend on your own.

442
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,140
We will not intervene.

443
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,079
I understand.

444
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,519
As you command.

445
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,840
Take the monks to prepare.

446
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,740
Yes, Your Majesty.

447
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,200
This way, please.

448
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,420
Brother Chun.

449
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,479
After you attend the wake,

450
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,300
you are to assist them and investigate the murder in secret.

451
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,139
Remember, by no means shall you involve the Duan family in it.

452
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,520
Understood, Your Majesty.

453
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,440
A secret sign?

454
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,620
Could there be more of those from the pugilist world here again?

455
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,999
Sister Wan!

456
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:12,840
I have another matter to report.

457
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,939
What is it?

458
00:34:13,939 --> 00:34:17,179
It is about Yu'er and Miss Zhong's marriage.

459
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,999
I'm afraid it'll have to be called off.

460
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,500
Why?

461
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,760
Miss Zhong is also my daughter.

462
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,420
Karma. It is karma.

463
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,119
Remember that you are the crown prince of Dali.

464
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,239
You ought to mind your behavior in the future.

465
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,039
You should return to check on your consort.

466
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:49,579
Yes, Your Majesty.

467
00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:58,979
Sister Wan? Sister Wan?

468
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,319
Sister Wan?

469
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,060
Sister Wan?

470
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,919
Sister Wan! Please don't leave! Please!

471
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,760
Wan'er.

472
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,579
It's no use.

473
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,460
Let's go.

474
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,300
Aunt Qin?

475
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,119
Aunt Qin? Why don't you come inside, please?

476
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,619
Why should we?

477
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,820
To be killed by your mother?

478
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,960
Sister Wan, don't leave. Please don't leave first.

479
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,979
We can work this out, all right? We can think of something.

480
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,800
There's no way to solve this.

481
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,340
Unless you and I kill ourselves

482
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,919
so that we may reincarnate.

483
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,419
And meet again in our next lives, where we may become husband and wife

484
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:43,260
when we are no longer siblings.

485
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,120
Are you willing to die with me?

486
00:35:57,431 --> 00:35:58,731
Sister Wan...

487
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,059
Mother, let's go.

488
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,560
Sister Wan...

489
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,759
Sister Wan!

490
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,419
Feng Huang'er? I am home.

491
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,199
Feng Huang'er? Open the door.

492
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:37,620
- Talk to me.
- About what?

493
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,320
About how Zhong Ling turned out to be your daughter?

494
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,399
Feng Huang'er,

495
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,119
let me explain.

496
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,279
I know it's all my fault.

497
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,279
You may punish me however you like.

498
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
But could you please open the door so we can talk?

499
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,180
Leave.

500
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,740
I don't want to talk to you.

501
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,800
If you don't leave,

502
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,280
I'll return to Yu Xu Temple.

503
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,639
I was the one who wronged her in the first place.

504
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,119
I do not blame her for blaming me.

505
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,419
Baobao was only 17 when she got pregnant with my child.

506
00:37:31,419 --> 00:37:33,640
What else could she do then?

507
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,380
Prepare my horse.

508
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,079
Absurd. This is absurd!

509
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,460
Madam Zhong has a strong relationship with Chief Zhong,

510
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,979
yet she had an affair with my father.

511
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:01,440
She even gave birth to a daughter!

512
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,180
Sister Wan is cheeky and strong-headed, yet gentle and soft as water.

513
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,720
Miss Zhong is naive and artless, yet she upholds love and justice.

514
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,940
I can't believe that both of them turned out to be my sisters.

515
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,640
Do you want to live or die?

516
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,499
If you become my master, you will be dead.

517
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:39,160
If you become my disciple, you will live!

518
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,579
All right.

519
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:43,619
So you changed your mind. You don't want to be my disciple now.

520
00:38:43,659 --> 00:38:45,460
So you would rather be a bastard instead then?

521
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,019
No way! I've thought it over already.

522
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:51,359
Now, I want you to give me eight hard kowtows so you'll expel me.

523
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:54,780
Then, you will give me eight more kowtows to accept me as your master.

524
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,899
That way, I won't be a bastard!

525
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,059
I won't do it! You might as well kill me.

526
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:03,120
I can't fight back anyway.

527
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,000
You...

528
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,259
You can't fool me!

529
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:14,199
You want me to be a bastard?

530
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,940
In your dreams!

531
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,999
Fine.

532
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,279
Well, since you won't kill me,

533
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:22,180
I'm still your master as we speak.

534
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,160
You're still my disciple.

535
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,959
Let me ask you this. I told you to rescue Zhong Ling.

536
00:39:27,959 --> 00:39:30,219
- How did it go?
- You...

537
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,920
Don't bring that up!

538
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,799
I was fighting Yun Zhonghe when Zhong Wanchou came out of the blue.

539
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:38,999
He saved her when I wasn't paying attention.

540
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,939
But Fourth Brother said that we must go to Wanjie Valley and kill Zhong Wanchou!

541
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,579
If not, we will never be able to hold our heads up in the martial world again!

542
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:48,979
Everyone is going to look down on me!

543
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:50,799
Wait. What sort of reasoning is that?

544
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:52,259
Don't you get it?

545
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:55,139
Look! That little girl is my master's wife.

546
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:57,999
So that makes Zhong Wanchou two generations above me!

547
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:59,419
Who does he think he is?

548
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:01,279
What makes him think he can be two generations above me?

549
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,740
So we must kill him!

550
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,140
You know what else he said?

551
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,119
He said he would take Zhong Wanchou's wife as his own!

552
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,079
Fourth Brother is so thoughtful!

553
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,459
He cares so much for me!

554
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:18,419
Enough talk. Take me there right now!

555
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,260
Baobao?

556
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,860
Baobao, I have always been thinking of you.

557
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,139
I have missed you.

558
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:07,460
Brother Chun, is that really you?

559
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,980
Yes.

560
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,279
- Baobao.
- Brother Chun.

561
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:25,140
I missed you so much.

562
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,300
Do you really mean that?

563
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,879
Quick, go find your mother!

564
00:41:35,879 --> 00:41:37,639
Oh no, Zhong Wanchou is here.

565
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,199
Brother Chun, go hide. Quick!

566
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,300
Go find your mother!

567
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,940
Mother!

568
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,599
- Mother.
- Ling'er!

569
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,679
Ling'er, you're home!

570
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,580
- Mother!
- Ling'er!

571
00:42:03,464 --> 00:42:04,839
You little girl.

572
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,000
Even if you try to run to the edge of the earth,

573
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,140
I'll get you eventually.

574
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,140
Hide!

575
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,860
Wonderful.

576
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,079
First, I'll take that little girl for myself.

577
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,479
Then, I'll kill her father and take her mother, too.

578
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,320
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

579
00:42:44,415 --> 00:42:46,479
Ling'er, let's go.

580
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,619
Get in. Quick! Get in!
