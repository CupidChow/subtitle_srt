[Episode 33]

15
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,920
Why do you still want to leave after entering the cave?

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,839
Time is fleeting.

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,340
I have waited for 30 years.

18
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,260
May I know who... you are?

19
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,000

[Leader of the Carefree Sect, Wu Yazi]

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,540
So you are a little monk.

22
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,000
And you are even a little monk with a mediocre appearance.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,460
I am Xu Zhu. Greetings, Senior.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,580
What is your surname?

25
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,780
I am a monk.

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,620
I no longer use my family surname.

27
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,160
You solved my chess formation today.

28
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,199
It shows that you have extraordinary talent.

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,960
It was not me who solved your chess formation.

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,600
You are saying you were not the one to solve this chess formation?

31
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,940
Then, why did Xinghe let you in then?

32
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,180
Senior, this is what happened.

33
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,060
It was true that I made the first chess move with the intention to save a person.

34
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,660
But for the remaining moves,

35
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,980
someone had used the Sound Transmission Technique

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,080
to guide me in breaking the formation secretly.

37
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,280
As for who the person is,

38
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,460
I really have no idea.

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,740
It was destined.

40
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,780
It was destined.

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,879
You could get in easily

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,760
even with your eyes closed.

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,160
This is sufficient to show

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,100
that you are tremendously blessed.

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,740
Good boy, kneel down quick.

46
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Kowtow.

47
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,820
Kowtow five more times.

48
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,560
This is the rule of our sect.

49
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,260
Get up.

50
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,300
Come over.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,020
Sit down.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,660
Senior, I was born dull-witted.

53
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,760
I did not master the inner energy my master had taught me.

54
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,560
I feel embarrassed.

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,320
Very good. Very good.

56
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,020
You have a shallow skill in Shaolin martial arts.

57
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,340
That's good.

58
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,960
It will save me a lot of trouble.

59
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Senior, what... what is happening to me?

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,940
Why can't I move?

61
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,940
I have dissolved Shaolin's inner energy in you with Divine Art of the Northern Darkness of our sect.

62
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,580
Sir, do we have a grudge?

63
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,200
Why did you harm me?

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,480
Look at how impudent you are.

65
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,040
You didn't even address me as Master.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,020
What?

67
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,660
When... When have you become my master?

68
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,000
You already kowtowed to me

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,080
and performed the discipleship ceremony just now.

70
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,460
You are a very unreasonable old man.

71
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,079
You pulled me into this place.

72
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,140
I listened to you and I kneeled.

73
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,220
I listened to you and I kowtowed.

74
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,580
I listened to you and I came up to you.

75
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,979
How could you cripple my martial arts skills as you wish?

76
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,700
Sir, let me tell you. I am a disciple of Shaolin Temple.

77
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,740
I will never join another sect.

78
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,180
I will never call you master.

79
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,900
You are a young man with integrity.

80
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,960
Very good. Very good.

81
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,760
Mission accomplished.

82
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,780
- Sir?
- Mission accomplished.

83
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,220
"Mission... Mission accomplished"?

84
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,100
It has been 30 years. It has been 30 years.

85
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,380
I have been searching all over

86
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,880
for an intelligent and loyal disciple

87
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,420
to whom I can transfer everything I have learned in these 70 years.

88
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,120
But it has been so hard to even come by one.

89
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,940
They are either intelligent but have a bad character

90
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,480
or have a good character but a poor wit.

91
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,840
It was destined.

92
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,960
30 years ago, I made a public announcement to look for the world's best talent

93
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,060
through the Zhenlong Chess Formation.

94
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,080
I knew I didn't have much time to live

95
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,340
and passed down my martial arts skills one by one.

96
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,740
Hence, I have to look for a disciple

97
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,180
who is young, handsome, and talented.

98
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,640
Sir, I understand how you feel.

99
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,979
Actually, there are many refined and handsome men in the world.

100
00:09:33,979 --> 00:09:37,260
There are already two of them outside. One is Young Master Murong.

101
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,780
The other is Young Master Duan Yu.

102
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,839
What about I get them in to greet you?

103
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,960
Just now, I have transferred to you

104
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,140
my 70 years of inner energy

105
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,020
through the Divine Art of the Northern Darkness.

106
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:02,120
I have nothing left to transfer to another person.

107
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,640
Sir, you are saying

108
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,880
that you have transferred all your inner energy

109
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,980
to me?

110
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,880
Now, try to hit the stone wall with a palm strike.

111
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,960
All right, sir. I will try it now.

112
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,180
Su Xinghe, I knew something strange was going on with this chess tournament.

113
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,999
Tell me. Where did you send that little monk?

114
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,780
You have been kicked out of the sect.

115
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,800
Why should I tell you what is going on in our sect?

116
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,460
Audacious! Don't think about harming people!

117
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,279
Senior, why do I suddenly have such a powerful palm strength?

118
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,700
Have I been possessed by the devil?

119
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,640
Since you have not learned our palm technique,

120
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,620
your current inner energy has only reached one-tenth of its full power.

121
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,799
I have 70 years of extraordinary cultivation.

122
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,520
Don't you understand it now,

123
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,720
foolish boy?

124
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,600
Senior, you have transferred divine martial arts to me?

125
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,100
Are you willing to call me "Master" now?

126
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,620
My disciple, what are you doing?

127
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,080
You have transferred all your inner energy to me.

128
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,420
It is justified

129
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,560
that I regard you as my master.

130
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,340
But I grew up in the Shaolin Temple as a child.

131
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,060
I can't join another sect.

132
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,600
I want to return your inner energy to you.

133
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,120
You no longer possess any of Shaolin's inner energy.

134
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,860
You now possess

135
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,240
the 70-year divine martial arts of the Carefree Sect.

136
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,640
How could you not be my disciple?

137
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,239
Carefree Sect?

138
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,500
Rides on Heaven and Earth,

139
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,879
governs the six elements,

140
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,620
and roams endlessly.

141
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,500
That is carefree.

142
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,960
No matter what,

143
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,620
I still can't call you "Master."

144
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,980
Please forgive me, Senior.

145
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,360
Good boy.

146
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,260
Since you insist not calling me "Master"

147
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,560
and join our sect,

148
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,420
I won't make it hard for you then.

149
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,820
Little Master,

150
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:33,300
I need a favor from you.

151
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,419
Would you agree to do something for me?

152
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,100
As long as it is not a wicked deed,

153
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,280
I will try my best to help you.

154
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,220
What do you mean by wicked deed?

155
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,840
I am a Buddhist.

156
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,199
I can't cause harm to others.

157
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:03,120
What if the person

158
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,179
has harmed and killed countless lives?

159
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:11,120
Would you help me to eliminate him then?

160
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,300
Then, I can persuade him solemnly

161
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,260
to change his way.

162
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,120
What if...

163
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,700
What if he is still obsessed and unawakened?

164
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,420
I will defend the right way by eliminating the devils.

165
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,339
Very good. Very good.

166
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,320
I want you to kill a person for me.

167
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,060
He is one of my disciples.

168
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,060
His name is Ding Chunqiu.

169
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,900
He is known as Old Freak of Xingxiu

170
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,200
in the martial arts world.

171
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,160
Su Xinghe.

172
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,900
Before, your martial arts skills were incomparable to mine.

173
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,020
What? Do you think you can beat me now?

174
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,799
Old Deity of Xingxiu has infinite dharma power

175
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,340
and powerful divine power that can shock the entire Central Plains!

176
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,920
Ding Chunqiu is indeed a wicked man.

177
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,060
Eliminating the Old Freak of Xingxiu will help us gain great merits.

178
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,520
But I have poor martial arts skills.

179
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,119
I am not his opponent.

180
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,580
Poor martial arts skills?

181
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,860
Your current inner energy

182
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,720
is comparable to Old Freak of Xingxiu's inner energy.

183
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,860
But it is still insufficient to kill him with it.

184
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,940
Back then,

185
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,260
this renegade disciple of mine suddenly attacked

186
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,380
and threw me off the cliff.

187
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,320
Fortunately, my disciple, Su Xinghe,

188
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,460
managed to escape from my renegade disciple's ears

189
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,420
by pretending to be deaf and mute.

190
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:12,580
Hence, I could live for another 30 years.

191
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,979
Do you think this matter

192
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:17,820
is a blessing or a curse?

193
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,479
But it is still too early to judge.

194
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,020
However, learning martial arts

195
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,940
may not turn out to be something good.

196
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,160
If I only learned zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting

197
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,879
but not martial arts back then,

198
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:43,420
I might be living a happier life now.

199
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Good boy...

200
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,140
take this painting

201
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,420
and look for the lady in the painting in the Dali Kingdom's Wuliang Mountain.

202
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,380
She is keeping all the martial arts secrets

203
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,380
I have collected over the years for me.

204
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,460
You can learn from those secrets.

205
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,420
Tell the lady that you are my disciple,

206
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,620
and she will guide you.

207
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,640
You can master the skills then.

208
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,380
Sir, are you all right?

209
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,899
I have transferred all my 70 years of inner energy to you.

210
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:30,200
Do you still refuse to call me "Master" now?

211
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,360
Master.

212
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,420
From now on,

213
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,800
you are my third disciple.

214
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,340
You must address Su Xinghe

215
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,800
as Eldest Martial Brother.

216
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,400
Put this ring on.

217
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,420
From now on,

218
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,760
you are the new leader

219
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,640
of the Carefree Sect.

220
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,180
Sir.

221
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,340
Sir.

222
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,080
Senior,

223
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,760
I am very sorry.

224
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,480
Although you have known me for only a short time,

225
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,340
you have treated me with so much kindness

226
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,280
and thought very highly of me.

227
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,160
But I only possess an ordinary talent.

228
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,340
I am not the right fit for the sect leader role.

229
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,440
I will most probably disappoint you.

230
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,680
I hope you will not take it seriously.

231
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,790
What's wrong, Fourth Brother?

232
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,950
Before we were captured, all of us had been poisoned by Ding Chunqiu.

233
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,780
The poison must be taking effect now.

234
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,200
- Second Junior Brother.
- The same is happening to me now.

235
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,100
Run quick!

236
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,820
No... It can't be Master.

237
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,780
Disciple Iron Head, strike him now.

238
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,420
Fourth Brother Feng, are you all right?

239
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,140
Apologies for giving all of you a shock.

240
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,219
We have something to discuss in the sect.

241
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:05,180
Apologies for not being able to see you off.

242
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,440
Little Master, please follow me.

243
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,620
Master, you have...

244
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,580
left me alone in this world.

245
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,500
Master.

246
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,800
My condolences.

247
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,639
Younger Martial Brother, did you know that this gem ring

248
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:07,920
is the emblem of the sect leader?

249
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,880
Tell me.

250
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,540
Did Master take it off from his finger and put it on for you himself?

251
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,080
Yes.

252
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,960
Ding Chunqiu and I have been eyeing this ring for decades.

253
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,180
Yet...

254
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:28,560
Yet, you managed to gain Master's appreciation

255
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,400
in just two hours.

256
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,139
You can keep this ring if you really want it.

257
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:38,820
This ring is useless to me.

258
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,780
Our late master entrusted it to you at his death bed.

259
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,939
How could you shirk your responsibility?

260
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:45,020
I...

261
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,720
Tell me. Did Master entrust this ring to you

262
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,900
and ask you to kill that renegade Ding Chunqiu?

263
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,119
Yes. But I have poor martial arts skills.

264
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,060
It is beyond my ability to shoulder such a heavy responsibility.

265
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,300
Su...

266
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,519
Younger Martial Brother, you are new here. You may not know it.

267
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,040
Our sect, the Carefree Sect, has a rule.

268
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,940
Any disciple with powerful martial arts skills

269
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,620
stands a chance to succeed as the sect leader.

270
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,620
There were three disciples in Master's generation.

271
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,179
He was the second eldest.

272
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:31,460
However, he possessed the most powerful martial arts skills amongst them.

273
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,699
Hence, he succeeded as the sect leader.

274
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,859
But in my generation, Master only accepted

275
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:41,640
Ding Chunqiu and me as his disciples.

276
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,600
He had even changed the rules.

277
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,280
Anyone who wants to succeed as the sect leader

278
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,200
must compete using their skills with each other.

279
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,840
We not only need to compete in martial arts but also in zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

280
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,679
But Ding Chunqiu does not know any of these miscellaneous skills.

281
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,979
Since he would never succeed as the sect leader,

282
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:03,160
he started to plot against Master.

283
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,440
He had not only thrown Master off into the deep valley

284
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,020
but also caused me severe injuries.

285
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,780
In this case, Mr. Ding did not kill you back then because of...

286
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,779
Don't think that he spared my life

287
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,399
because he had a split second of benevolence.

288
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,780
Firstly, he would never breakthrough

289
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,290
the Qi Men Dun Jia and Five Elements Eight Trigrams I had laid down.

290
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,180
Secondly, I told him that...

291
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,020
Su Xinghe,

292
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:55,019
do you think that your Qi Men Dun Jia and Five Elements Eight Trigrams can harm me?

293
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,919
Fine. Just wait and witness

294
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,060
how I will break your formations today.

295
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,680
Ding Chunqiu, although you plotted against Master

296
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,420
and that my martial arts skills are incomparable to yours,

297
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,940
you still have not grasped the most advanced martial arts skills of the Carefree Sect.

298
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,019
Do you want to learn the Divine Art of the Northern Darkness?

299
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,160
Do you want to take a look at Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves,

300
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,739
as well as Six Solar Palms of Tianshan and Minor Formless Skill?

301
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,660
Su Xinghe,

302
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,879
if you hand over these secrets to me today,

303
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:43,940
I, Ding Chunqiu, will spare your life.

304
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,560
How would I have these secrets with me?

305
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,079
However, I know where Master is keeping these secrets.

306
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,939
If you want to kill me, please go ahead then.

307
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,540
The secrets...

308
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,440
The secrets are kept by the shore of the Xingxiu Sea.

309
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,399
Do you think I am clueless?

310
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,359
It is indeed at the shore of the Xingxiu Sea.

311
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,380
Go find it now if you have such capability.

312
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,340
It will take a very long time to locate the martial arts secrets

313
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,560
at this Xingxiu Sea that stretches out over thousands of miles.

314
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,980
Forget it.

315
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,380
Su Xinghe, I can spare your life today.

316
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,620
But from now on,

317
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,020
you must pretend to be deaf and mute for life.

318
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,120
You must never divulge the secrets of our sect to anyone.

319
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,200
If you go back on your words,

320
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,000
don't blame me for not being considerate of my fellow martial brother.

321
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,459
He spared my life so he could force a confession out of me easily.

322
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:50,060
Those martial arts secrets are not at the Xingxiu Sea.

323
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,759
Ding Chunqiu settled down at the shore of the Xingxiu Sea.

324
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,460
He had turned over almost every piece of stone

325
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,580
but still couldn't find the martial arts secrets.

326
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,160
I guess he is here today to ask me about it again.

327
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,240
Since he sensed that there was no hope,

328
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,700
he vented his anger by trying to kill me.

329
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:12,220
Younger Martial Brother, did Master instruct you to find a person

330
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,760
or give you a map?

331
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,380
He gave me this painting.

332
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,320
Take a look.

333
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,820
Isn't this Miss Wang?

334
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,720
Why is there a painting of Miss Wang?

335
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,299
What else did Master say when he passed you this scroll?

336
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,780
Master said that I won't be able to take down Ding Chunqiu with my current martial arts skills.

337
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,459
He asked me to take this scroll to Wuliang Mountain in Dali

338
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:45,340
and look for the martial arts secrets he has collected all these years

339
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,080
and practice my skills further.

340
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,499
Why is the lady in the painting Miss Wang?

341
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,040
Master's actions were always unpredictable.

342
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,079
Younger Martial Brother, Reverend Xuan Nan and a few Shaolin senior monks

343
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,260
have been poisoned by Ding Chunqiu.

344
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,640
If they are not saved in time, I am afraid they will lose their lives.

345
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,220
Now, you are the only person who can save them.

346
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,480
How can I save them?

347
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,780
You might not know that our sect is not only good in martial arts

348
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,820
but also in medicine, divination, zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

349
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,719
If you are willing to, I will teach you how to circulate our qi and blood

350
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:32,140
and the Eliminating Cold Toxin methods now.

351
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,639
You are indeed a wise man.

352
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,580
You are a fast learner.

353
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,800
Mr. Su, why are you smiling?

354
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,380
I am a foolish brother. I dare not smile.

355
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,140
Please forgive me if I have offended you.

356
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:40,380
Mr. Su, can you stop bowing to me from now on?

357
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,760
All right. Let's go out and have a look.

358
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,140
Yes, Leader.

359
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,980
Grand Martial Uncle, are you all right?

360
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,000
- I...
- Master, think of a solution quick.

361
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,319
Grand Martial Uncle, Intelligent Gentleman has just taught me a set of healing methods.

362
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,779
I am very confident about it and would like to try it on my fellow martial brothers.

363
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:43,100
But I would like to seek your permission first.

364
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:47,279
Intelligent Gentleman's teaching is naturally very advanced.

365
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,560
Go ahead and try it.

366
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,940
Yes, Grand Martial Uncle.

367
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,760
Hang in there.

368
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,470
How is it?

369
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,760
I feel better now.

370
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,979
I made it, Grand Martial Uncle. I made it.

371
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:22,900
Grand Martial Uncle, please allow me to heal you.

372
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,920
No. Save the others first.

373
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,520
Yes, Grand Martial Uncle.

374
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,379
Sir, let me heal you.

375
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:40,020
I can't be healed. No, please don't do it blindly.

376
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,040
How is it?

377
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,720
I feel all right.

378
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,380
Grand Martial Uncle, now... I will hit your Baihui acupoint with my palm strength.

379
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,360
Grand Martial Uncle.

380
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,100
Grand Martial Uncle.

381
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,500
Grand Martial Uncle!

382
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,459
Grand Martial Uncle, are you all right?

383
00:34:35,459 --> 00:34:38,480
Grand Martial Uncle, are you all right?

384
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,860
Grand Martial Uncle!

385
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,799
Intelligent Gentleman, what happened to Grand Martial Uncle?

386
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:48,479
Reverend Xuan Nan has lost his martial arts skills

387
00:34:48,479 --> 00:34:50,539
and passed away.

388
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,620
You taught me this method.

389
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,020
You taught me this healing method.

390
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,520
How could this happen?

391
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,799
You deliberately want to harm my Grand Martial Uncle, right?

392
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,319
Why do you want to harm my Grand Martial Uncle?

393
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,540
Leader, please look into this matter.

394
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,719
I would never dare to plot against you.

395
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,739
Someone must have harmed Reverend Xuan Nan secretly.

396
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,680
Then, why did you...

397
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,699
Why did you put on a strange smile in the cave then?

398
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:40,280
Did I smile?

399
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,980
Yes, you did!

400
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,360
I saw you smiling with my own eyes! You indeed smiled!

401
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,360
Leader, you need to be careful.

402
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,220
There is someone...

403
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,879
Look! You are smiling again!

404
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,119
- Master!
- Don't move!

405
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,360
- Master!
- There is poison on him.

406
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,399
It must be Ding Chunqiu who killed Master with his poison!

407
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,759
Master!

408
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,640
Master!

409
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,820
Grand Martial Uncle must have known that he was beyond healing.

410
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,480
That's why he asked me to save the others first.

411
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,660
Grand Martial Uncle...

412
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,620
Grand Martial Uncle was killed by Ding Chunqiu.

413
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:39,280
Intelligent Gentleman was also killed by Ding Chunqiu.

414
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,599
Even the old man in the cave asked me to kill Ding Chunqiu for him.

415
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,360
I will avenge Grand Martial Uncle.

416
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,100
I will avenge Intelligent Gentleman.

417
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,440
I will avenge the old man in the cave.

418
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,780
Ding Chunqiu!

419
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,880
I will kill you, wicked man! Wicked man!

420
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,460
Greetings, Martial Uncle, Leader.

421
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,120
Martial Uncle, the traitor Ding Chunqiu killed our master and Reverend Xuan Nan.

422
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,960
We want to avenge them by killing him. I hope Martial Uncle will preside over the matter

423
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,859
and agree to have him killed to avenge our master.

424
00:37:29,859 --> 00:37:33,359
We will be grateful for your kindness, Martial Uncle.

425
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,400
Martial Uncle, please agree to it.

426
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,259
Get up. Get up.

427
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,140
Please get up.

428
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,519
Everyone, please get up.

429
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,740
I have something to report,

430
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,620
but it is inconvenient to say it in front of a crowd.

431
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,160
It is better to speak inside the cave.

432
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,419
- After you.
- After you, Mr. Kang.

433
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,660
Martial Uncle.

434
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,580
No, I am not your martial uncle.

435
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,379
I am a Shaolin monk.

436
00:38:08,379 --> 00:38:10,880
Martial Uncle, I wanted to report

437
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,679
that my master was poisoned by the Three Smile Carefree Powder.

438
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,339
The poison is invisible to the eyes.

439
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:20,640
When the poison starts to take effect, a strange smile will appear on the victim's face.

440
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,259
However, the victim is unaware of it.

441
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,499
At the third smile, the victim will stop breathing and die.

442
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,820
I am ashamed to say that I saw a strange smile on your master's face

443
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,860
when he was poisoned.

444
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,399
But I was blinded by my pettiness.

445
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:45,780
Thinking back, we might have been able to save his life

446
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,519
if I cared for him sincerely back then.

447
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:51,999
It is impossible to save someone from Three Smile Carefree Powder.

448
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,840
There is no chance of survival.

449
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,580
Is it really as vicious as you said?

450
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,979
But I was standing beside your master,

451
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:13,779
and I did not even notice how Ding Chunqiu poisoned him.

452
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,940
Why didn't Ding Chun Qiu poison me, too?

453
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,540
This Old Freak Ding...

454
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,399
Elder brothers, how is your injury?

455
00:39:30,399 --> 00:39:34,299
Thanks to Little Master's help, I am all right now.

456
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:35,420
That's good.

457
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,219
Mr. Xinghe has passed away.

458
00:39:37,219 --> 00:39:41,119
I am sure they have many matters to deal with now. Let's make a move then.

459
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,720
All right.

460
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,640
Seniors, send my gratitude to Little Master for saving our lives.

461
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,820
- Farewell, everyone.
- Farewell.

462
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,020
Sister Yan, let's go.

463
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,340
Young Master Duan.

464
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,119
It is a pleasure to meet you today. I will have to bid you farewell here.

465
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:11,920
We shall meet again.

466
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
All right.

467
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,379
Young Master Duan, you have helped my young master today.

468
00:41:23,379 --> 00:41:24,890
I'd like to say...

469
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,280
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it, Third Brother Bao.

470
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,300
No, Young Master Duan.

471
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,280
Please stop following us.

472
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,960
Please stop right here.

473
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,259
How could you be so foolish to be infatuated by a woman?

474
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:55,620
Aren't you afraid of causing indignity to the Dali Duan family?

475
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,039
Six Pulse Excalibur?

476
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,920
How do you know the Six Pulse Excalibur?

477
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,780
Duan Yanqing,

478
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,319
even after all those years of hard practice,

479
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:37,640
you are still worse than an ignorant person.

480
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,300
Absurd. Absurd indeed.

481
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,220
Greetings, Prince Duan.

Who is doing all these stupid things?

509
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:46,940
Junior Martial Brother, Miss Wang is here; don't make things hard.

510
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:50,090
Who is here trying to mess up the Assembly of Demi-gods?

511
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:53,540
Are you really disrespecting the 36 Cave Masters and

512
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,090
72 Island Masters?
