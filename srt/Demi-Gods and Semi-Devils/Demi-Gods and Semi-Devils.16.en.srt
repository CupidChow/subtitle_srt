[Episode 16]

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,600
Chief Qiao, think before you act.

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,000
You mustn't act recklessly.

16
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,800
If you incite a war between the Hu and the Han,

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,200
everyone in the martial arts world will go against you.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,300
Incite a war between the Hu and the Han?

19
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,600
After discussing with Brother Sword Beard for days,

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,000
he remained determined to step down from his position as the chief.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
However, after much thought and discussion,

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,200
we still failed to come to an agreement.

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Qiao has extraordinary skills

24
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
and has contributed a lot to the sect.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,500
He is courageous and bold.

26
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,400
He is a rare talent even in this pugilist world.

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,400
That is why he was chosen to inherit the position.

28
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
With him in charge, we are sure that the Beggars' Sect

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,600
will only grow stronger.

30
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,400
However, during the battle at Yanmen Pass,

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,200
he sat out of it for days.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,300
This man is not one of our kind.

33
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,800
His parents were killed by us.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
All will be fine if he never finds out about his past.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Or else, not only will the Beggars' Sect will be ruined in his hands,

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,600
a calamity will fall upon the pugilist world.

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,800
Now, few in the pugilist world

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,600
can be his match.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,900
The Beggars' Sect should not be placed under an outsider.

40
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,200
But this is a grave matter.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,400
Please consider it carefully.

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,800
This was written by Chief Wang.

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm sure you can recognize his handwriting.

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Deputy Chief Ma,

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Training Elder, Disciplinary Elder,

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
and all other elders,

47
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,600
if Qiao Feng betrays the Han

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,400
and helps the Khitans to topple Song,

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
the sect should unite and eliminate him.

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Do not keep him alive.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Do whatever you can to put an end to him.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Merits will go to the one who kills him.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,200
This is indeed my master, Wang Jiantong's handwriting.

54
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,800
Please don't blame us for being rude.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Deputy Chief Ma was the only one

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,300
who knew about Chief Wang's decree.

57
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Until he died suddenly.

58
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,600
Kang Min found this decree.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,800
We had no choice but to make this decree public.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,200
Deputy Chief Ma was fine

61
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,800
until Chief Wang handed over this decree to him.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
That is the first reason.

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,900
Everyone suspects that the Murong Clan

64
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,800
is responsible for Deputy Chief Ma's death.

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Young Master Murong, I really admire you.

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,200
- Come on , let's drink.
- Come on

67
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,400
Come on.

68
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,700
But you have protected him.

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,400
Your actions have put our sect in danger.

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,600
This is the second reason.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
As for the third reason,

72
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,000
although I had intended to investigate it properly before I made a decision,

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,400
everyone has found out that you have Khitan blood in your veins

74
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
and it has created chaos.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,800
It's pointless to keep it a secret now.

76
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,600
Quan Guanqing, you know that I'm a descendant of Khitan.

77
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,600
So you are going to oppose me. Yes?

78
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Yes.

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
The four elders want to kill me because they believe in you.

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
Is that also true?

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,100
But they are not sure and can't make a decision.

83
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,400
And now, they are acting cowardly.

84
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,000
How did you find out about my birth identity?

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This involves other people. I'm afraid I can't tell you that.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,400
But you have to know this.

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,100
A secret cannot be kept forever.

88
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,800
Even if you try your best to hide it,

89
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,600
the truth will eventually be exposed.

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
Moreover, we have Chief Wang's handwritten decree

91
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,600
and Reverend Zhi Guang and the others as witnesses.

92
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,000
Do you think I can make this up?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
The Beggars' Sect has been around for centuries.

94
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,000
We can't hand it over to a Khitan.

95
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,200
Khitan? What does he mean?

96
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,400
What is this about the Khitans?

97
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Fellow uncles.

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,400
My husband has unfortunately passed away.

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,500
For now, we cannot be certain who the murderer is.

100
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,700
But my late husband was sincere and kind.

101
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,000
He had no enemies in the martial world.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I can't think of someone

103
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
who could be so cruel and ruthless to kill him.

104
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,600
As the saying goes, an open door may tempt a saint.

105
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,500
Could it be that he was holding something important

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,000
that led to someone murdering him to keep him silent for their own benefit?

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,900
Are you suspecting me of killing Deputy Chief Ma?

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Madam Ma, I have a small question.

109
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,000
But I'm not sure if I should voice it out.

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
Do you have a question to interrogate me with?

111
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,000
I wouldn't dare to interrogate you.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
However, earlier, I heard

113
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
that Deputy Chief Ma's will was sealed with sealing wax.

114
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,000
But when Elder Xu opened the will,

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
the sealing wax was still intact.

116
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
That means no one

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
would have seen the contents inside until just now.

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,600
That's right.

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
If that's the case,

120
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,300
then only Deputy Chief Ma had read

121
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,300
the leader's letter and Chief Wang's decree.

122
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:47,000
So it's impossible that someone murdered him to silence him.

123
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
May I ask who are you?

124
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Why are you interfering with our sect's issue?

125
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm merely a woman.

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
I wouldn't dare to do that.

127
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
But since you are accusing our young master of murder,

128
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,400
naturally, I have to analyze the matter carefully and logically.

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Who is your young master then?

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Is it Chief Qiao?

131
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,400
No.

132
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
It's Young Master Murong.

133
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,200
I see.

134
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Elder Bai, we have strict rules.

135
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,200
If an elder breaks a rule, how should we punish him?

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,000
If he knowingly violates the rules,

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,400
he'll be doubly guilty.

138
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,800
What if his position is higher than yours?

139
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Our sect's rules are set by our ancestors.

140
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,400
No matter the seniority and the position.

141
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Everybody has to abide by the rules

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
and receives the same reward...

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,100
and the same punishment.

144
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,000
A few days after my husband's passing,

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,400
one day, I accidentally discovered this.

146
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
I'm sure you recognize it.

147
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,200
Fellow elders and brothers.

148
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Please uphold justice for me.

149
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,600
"The first snow is falling upon the Yanmen Pass.

150
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,000
The rage and chaos of the war trample across the sand and land."

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,400
Gain merits by killing and capturing the enemies.

152
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,200
Fight your way to Loulan to repay your country."

153
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,400
I'll give this fan to you.

154
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,200
He is not one of us.

155
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,000
He has no loyalty to us.

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,800
Oh, Chief Wang.

157
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,400
You've made a grave mistake.

158
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,600
Although Chief Wang considered me a loyal follower and his confidant,

159
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,100
he never told me about his secret decree.

160
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,000
If only he had told me earlier...

161
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
Elder Xu.

162
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,900
Chief Wang didn't tell you about this for your own good.

163
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,400
In the Beggars' Sect, only Da Yuan knew about this.

164
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Now, he has been killed.

165
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,100
If you knew about it,

166
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,600
you might have met the same fate.

167
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,900
Even I cannot be certain of where I came from.

168
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,400
But today, all of you are pointing your fingers at me.

169
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,200
I will get to the bottom of this.

170
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I will step down from my position

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,900
as the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

172
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,200
This staff had been passed down to me by Chief Wang.

173
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Although I have not achieved much

174
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
since I took over the position,

175
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,300
I have not made any grave mistakes either.

176
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,000
After I step down today,

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,600
Elder Xu, Training Elder, and Disciplinary Elder,

178
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
please take care of this staff.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,100
If you find a great hero to shoulder this responsibility in the future, give this to that person.

180
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,100
You are right.

181
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,100
We can settle this Dog Beating Staff issue in the future.

182
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,800
Wait!

183
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,000
What do you have to say, Brother Song?

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,600
I don't think Chief Qiao is a Khitan.

185
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
How so?

186
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,600
Our Chief Qiao is a noble and righteous hero.

187
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,800
We went against him just now.

188
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,600
He didn't hold a grudge against us

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
and was willing to step down for the sect's sake.

190
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,400
Tell me!  Would a Khitan do that?

191
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,900
He was brought up by the monks in Shaolin and Chief Wang.

192
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,000
He had been guided by them and his nature has changed.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If he's already changed, he is no longer evil.

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,400
Why can't he be our chief?

195
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Moreover, look at our Beggars' Sect.

196
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,700
Who else here is as heroic and as powerful as him?

197
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,800
I won't accept anyone else to become our chief!

198
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,600
Us too!

199
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,300
Me too!

200
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,200
Someone is trying to frame Chief Qiao.

201
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,800
We can't simply trust their words.

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
This matter happened decades ago.

203
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
With just a few of you speaking nonsense now,

204
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
how do we know if it's true or not?

205
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,100
How can you simply ask the chief to step down?

206
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,200
I swear my loyalty to Chief Qiao.

207
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,400
Even if you have someone else leading the sect and have me killed,

208
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
I won't accept this!

209
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,300
We don't accept this!

210
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,800
All right.

211
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,599
Those who are willing to support Chief Qiao,

212
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
- stand behind me.
- Yes.

213
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,000
Get over here if you trust Chief Qiao!

214
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,600
We'll support Chief Qiao. Let's go!

215
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,800
Yes. We support Chief Qiao!

216
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,600
- I support Chief Qiao too!
- Support Chief Qiao!

217
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
We support Chief Qiao!

218
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,800
- Chief Qiao!
- We support Chief Qiao!

219
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
We support Chief Qiao!

220
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
My fellow brothers.

221
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Chief Qiao is extraordinary and heroic.

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,400
Who doesn't admire him?

223
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
But as citizens of Song,

224
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
how can we take orders from a Khitan?

225
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,300
The more powerful Qiao Feng is, the more dangerous it is for you.

226
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,600
I think you look more like a Khitan.

227
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,900
Yes! You cunning sycophant!

228
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,200
All of you are good men who serve the country.

229
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,800
Do you really want to become the traitors of Song?

230
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
Who are you calling traitors?

231
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
You are the traitor!

232
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,600
Who are you calling traitors?

233
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
- We are not traitors!
- You are!

234
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,200
You are the traitor!

235
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,800
- You are the traitor!
- You are the traitor!

236
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,400
How dare you call us traitors!

237
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,200
How dare you call us traitors!

238
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
You are the traitor!

239
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Yes! You are the traitor!

240
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,600
How dare you call us traitors!

241
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,800
You are the traitor!

242
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,100
How dare you call us traitors!

243
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,800
I've made up my mind

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,100
to step down as the chief.

245
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Maybe there are other reasons.

246
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,200
Maybe someone is framing me.

247
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,600
But nobody will be able to forge

248
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,500
Chief Wang's handwriting.

249
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,900
The Beggars' Sect is the strongest sect in this pugilist world.

250
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,400
We are respected.

251
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
We are awe-inspiring.

252
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,200
If we have internal strife,

253
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,800
we'll become a laughingstock.

254
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,700
Before I leave,

255
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,400
I have a few words for all of you.

256
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,400
If someone attacks any of you from the Beggars' Sect,

257
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
that person will become our enemy.

258
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,200
What if someone kills any of you from the Beggars' Sect?

259
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,600
Whoever hurts any of you,

260
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
it'll be a grudge we hold forever.

261
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,900
A life for a life.

262
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
That's good then.

263
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,600
Madam Ma, with my skills,

264
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
if I want to steal something from your manor,

265
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I will not fail.

266
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,600
And I would not leave any of my personal belongings behind.

267
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,000
As for the person who murdered Deputy Chief Ma

268
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,600
and stole my fan to frame me,

269
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,800
I'll get to the bottom of it.

270
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,900
Brothers, no matter if I'm a Han

271
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,800
or a Khitan,

272
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,000
in this life of mine,

273
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,000
I will never kill a Han.

274
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,200
If I break my vow,

275
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,900
may I end up like this stone.

276
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,000
Big Brother!

277
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,400
Dear elders and brothers,

278
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,700
I shall rely on all of you to avenge my late husband.

279
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,900
I'll take my leave now.

280
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,800
Madam Ma, my condolences.

281
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,500
We'll do our best to avenge Deputy Chief Ma.

282
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,800
Please rest assured.

283
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,060
Elder Xu.

284
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,879
Everyone, I will take my leave now.

285
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,000
Elder Xu.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
My fellow heroes.

287
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,400
I'll take my leave, too.

288
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,100
Farewell.

289
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,100
Elder Xu, my wife and I will take our leave now.

290
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
Xiao Juan! Xiao Juan!

291
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,500
Farewell. Xiao Juan!

292
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,000
Wait for me!

293
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Fellow brothers.

294
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,500
We will have to discuss and make plans

295
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,200
on how to avenge Deputy Chief Ma.

296
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
What a joke.

297
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,600
The Beggars' Sect promised us to meet on Mount Hui.

298
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,300
But you bailed.

299
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,800
It turns out all of you are hiding here.

300
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,000
Elder Xu, we accidentally missed a meeting due to unforeseen events in our sect.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,800
And now, the other party is here.

302
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,000
But I had sent someone to Mount Hui

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,700
to postpone the meeting to a week later.

304
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,800
We agreed on the date and time.

305
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
You can't just delay it.

306
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,200
Even an hour late is not acceptable!

307
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,400
What gives you the right to decide that?

308
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,200
Don't move! Nobody moves!

309
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,100
Step back! Don't move!

310
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,100
Don't move!

311
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Who are they?

312
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Why are they here?

313
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,800
I think they are the First Class Hall of Xixia.

314
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,900
The Xixia Kingdom built up their army because they want to conquer Song.

315
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,200
Yes.

316
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,000
I heard that the leader of the First Class Hall is a prince.

317
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
He was granted the title of East General.

318
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,800
They call him Helian Tieshu.

319
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,400
[Helian Tieshu, General of Xixia]
Arrival of the East General of Xixia, Helian Tieshu.

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
He knows that the Beggars' Sect is one of the pillars of the pugilist world.

321
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,100
As the saying goes, "If you want to destroy something, you have to show them what you are capable of first."

322
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,900
That is why they set a time to meet with Chief Qiao.

323
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
They've planned everything to their benefit.

324
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,700
First, they take us down.

325
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,400
Then, they'll destroy all the other major sects in the central plains.

326
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,500
After that, they'll cross our borders and attack the country.

327
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,800
Or they will use this to threaten our government for more.

328
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,000
What a sinister strategy!

329
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Where is your chief?

330
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Why has he not come to greet us?

331
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,800
Our chief is not here.

332
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,000
In his absence, I'm in charge.

333
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,600
We are only humble members of the pugilist world.

334
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Such a grand courtesy from you

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,700
is too much for us.

336
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,800
Please pay a visit to the officials and imperial court of Song instead.

337
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,800
If you are paying us a visit as a member of the pugilist world,

338
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,600
you will be our guest.

339
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Please dismount from your horse to greet your host.

340
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,700
Since your chief is not here,

341
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,200
our general can't show you the same courtesy.

342
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,600
That's a nice staff.

343
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,500
I can use it to make a sweeper. It's quite suitable as well.

344
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,639
Attack!

345
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,199
Come on! Come!

346
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,539
- Wrong timing.
- What are you doing? Are we going to attack or not?

347
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,039
Come on! Who wants to be killed by me first?

348
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,299
My beloved disciple. Why are you here?

349
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:11,680
Aren't you going to kowtow to your master?

350
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,980
Third Young Master Yue.

351
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,319
The chief of the Beggars' Sect is my sworn brother.

352
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,319
So all of them here are your grand martial uncles.

353
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,525
You mustn't be rude.

354
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,419
Ladies, he is my disciple.

355
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:32,160
The Nanhai Crocodile, Third Young Master Yue.

356
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,380
Third Young Master Yue.

357
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,879
Aren't you going to kneel when you meet your master?

358
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,000
Have you forgotten about the rules of Nanhai?

359
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,260
Greetings, Master!

360
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,260
Very good.

361
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,319
Enough! I'm not going to fight anymore!

362
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:59,200
You can fight them yourself!

363
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,220
Is he out of his mind?

364
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,980
Our general wishes to see the Dog Beating Staff Technique

365
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,740
and the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms of the Beggars' Sect.

366
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,759
Let's see if you beggars are really good

367
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,080
or if you are just good at bragging.

368
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,879
Hurry up and show us.

369
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,879
The Four Evils are quite famous in the pugilist world, too.

370
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,039
But you have accepted Xixia's bribe

371
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,999
and become Xixia's lapdogs now?

372
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,559
All Three Evils are here.

373
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,359
Where is the Overflowing with Evil, Duan Yanqing?

374
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,859
Why should we tell you about our relationship with the First Class Hall?

375
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:37,359
Qiao Feng is not here.

376
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,319
There's no need for our leader to be here

377
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,039
to take on you beggars.

378
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,919
The two of us can handle all of you.

379
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,280
I'll fight you.

380
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,119
I'll fight with him.

381
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,779
We only show our sect's main technique to those who are worthy.

382
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,120
There's no need to use the Dog Beating Staff Technique to defeat a pawn like you.

383
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,640
Take this!

384
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,239
The elder from the Beggars' Sect is using the Twenty-Four Devil Staff Technique.

385
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,799
But he hasn't mastered it.

386
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,159
Besides, he's too short.

387
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,779
You can defeat him by attacking the right side of his lower body.

388
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,599
But the taller one seems to think that the shorter one is very stable.

389
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:28,400
But that's not the case.

390
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,060
Young Master Duan,

391
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,239
the Beggars' Sect chased away your sworn brother

392
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,759
and they've wronged my cousin.

393
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,660
I hate them.

394
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,960
You are a beautiful girl.

395
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,519
Moreover, you have good sight for martial arts.

396
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,900
- You would make a suitable wife for me.
- You wish.

397
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,800
Why would I marry you?

398
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,860
Why not?

399
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,500
So you have a lover, do you?

400
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,279
I'll kill him first.

401
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,080
Then, let's see if you'll marry me.

402
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,599
Elder Wu's Six Combined Sword Technique

403
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,519
and Eight Trigrams are indeed amazing.

404
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,759
But the tall one knows the Snake and Crane Arts.

405
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,900
I'm sure he can defeat him with his bare hands.

406
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,320
Miss Wang...

407
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,400
It seems that the tall one has fallen into the trap I set up.

408
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,099
He might get his left arm cut off.

409
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,820
Are you okay?

410
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,759
Thank you, Miss.

411
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,200
Elder Wu, what an excellent Three Unique Sword Technique.

412
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:29,320
Great!

413
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,200
General, that Han girl over there is peculiar.

414
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,199
We should capture her and force her to tell us everything she knows.

415
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,220
She'll be useful to us.

416
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,479
Good idea. Go and capture her.

417
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,960
Yes, General.

418
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,799
Elder Xu.

419
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,379
Our general wishes to see the Dog Beating Staff Technique and the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

420
00:25:54,379 --> 00:25:56,080
Show us if you know.

421
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,299
If you can't, then we won't waste our time here.

422
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:01,679
We'll take our leave now.

423
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,339
The people of First Class Hall boast

424
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:07,079
that they have the best martial arts skills.

425
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,279
But they are hardly better than the common folk.

426
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,600
You don't deserve to witness the Dog Beating Staff Technique

427
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,280
and the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms.

428
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,799
Yes! You don't deserve it!

429
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,159
You don't deserve it!

430
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,740
Then what should I do to be worthy of seeing them?

431
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,759
This is bad. They've released poison in the air.

432
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,460
You... I'll fight you to death!

433
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,379
You! Bring me those beggars!

434
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,460
As for this lady...

435
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,400
What are you doing?

436
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,360
A'Zhu!

437
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,240
Miss A'Zhu!

438
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,599
Chase after him!

439
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,840
Hurry up! Go get them!

440
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,380
After them!

441
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,979
Don't let them get away!

442
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,620
Stop!

443
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,119
Stop!

444
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,160
Stop! Don't run!

445
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,459
Sir, although our shop is small, but we have lots of good wine.

446
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:54,419
Drink these first. I can get you more if they are not enough.

447
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,580
Fresh vegetables. Come and take a look.

448
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,119
Miss Wang, are you all right?

449
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,900
I've been poisoned. I have no energy left.

450
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,099
What should we do? Where can I find the cure?

451
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,520
I don't know.

452
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,420
Get the horse to keep running.

453
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,180
We'll talk when we reach somewhere safe.

454
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,740
All right.

Where do you live?

460
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,440
Do you need me to send you back?

461
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,320
I don't even know what my surname is.

462
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,540
Where is my home?

463
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,780

Miss Wang.

483
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,159
We ran into danger together today.

484
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,959
I'll do my best to protect her.

485
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,319
If I die for her,

486
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,439
I'm sure she'll remember me sometimes

487
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,119
for the rest of her life.

488
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,240
When she marries Murong Fu in the future and has children,

489
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,879
perhaps she will tell them

490
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,160
of what happened today under the melon trellis.

491
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,560
When that happens,

492
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,279
you'll tell your daughter...

493
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,020
What daughter?

494
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,360
Nothing.

495
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,540
I was just talking nonsense.

496
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,780
It's cold and wet here.

497
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:16,640
We can't stay here.

498
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,959
Miss Wang, I think the rain is getting lighter.

499
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,100
Let's find a safer place.

Miss Wang, we don't know what poison they used.

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,780
If only I can get the cure.

503
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,380
I'm not in pain.

504
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,180
I'm just out of energy.

Miss... Miss Wang! I'm sorry.

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,579
I'm fine. I'm perfectly all right.

00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,439
I'm sorry, Miss Wang.

513
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,960
I am so clumsy.

I don't know.

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,838
Young Master Duan! Come back.

00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,360

522
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,198
Miss Wang, wait here for me.

523
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,879
Excuse me. Excuse me.

524
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,079
Sorry for disturbing you.

525

527
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:27,718
Just ignore us.

528
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:30,399
I'm fine. It's all right.

00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,300
What's wrong?

531
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,300
How could they do that...

532
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,020
in front of us...?

533
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:40,639
What?

534
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,659
Miss Wang, your dress is dirty.

535
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:45,019
And you are all wet.

536
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:47,340
What should we do?

537
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,620
Sister, I'm all wet.

538
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,660
I just want to change into some clean clothes.

539
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,560
How about this?

540
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,699
Will you take this hairpin in exchange for some clean clothes?

541
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:13,140
Will that do?

542
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,520
Go.

543
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,779
Move aside. Sister, hurry up.

544
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,260
Go. Go.

545
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,220
Miss, come with me.

546
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,659
Miss Wang, be careful.

547
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,740
- Miss Wang, be careful.
- Be careful.

548
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,340
Be careful.

549
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,079
What are you looking at?

550
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,399
I'm looking at my wife.

551
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,120
Anything wrong with that?

552
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,599
No. No problem.

553
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,839
Brother, put on your clothes first.

554
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,659
Miss, this is my best dress.

555
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,879
Although, it's a little bit worn.

556
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,280
If you don't mind, please put it on.

557
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,459
Sister, you are willing to help me when I'm in trouble.

558
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,820
I should thank you.

559
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,180
I wouldn't mind.

560
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,479
They must be hiding inside this dye house.

561
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,820
Search it!

562
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,399
Miss Wang! The enemy is here!

563
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:36,639
The enemy is here. The enemy is here!

564
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:38,159
- Anyone over there?
- No.
- Miss Wang!

565
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,199
- Miss Wang!
- Who is it?

566
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,459
It's not good. The enemy is here!

567
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,240
Keep searching!

568
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,660
Miss Wang, I'm sorry. It was rude of me.

569
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,420
But the enemy is here.

570
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,759
Who are you?

571
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,079
Is the girl inside?

572
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,340
Girl? There's no girl.

573
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,620
You can't go inside!

574
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,460
You want to die?

575
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,820
Second Brother Jin!

576
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,960
Second Brother Jin! Second Brother Jin!

577
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,600
Don't go!

578
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,520
Search thoroughly!

579
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,659
Miss Wang. Fine, I won't look at you.

580
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:31,060
Go up!

581
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,240
Hey! Don't come up here!

582
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,860
Don't come up.

583
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,439
Young Master Duan!

584
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,999
Use your left hand's pointer finger to press the pressure point on his lower abdomen!

585
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,820
That's what you get for hitting me.

586
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,339
I beg you. Stop coming up.

587
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,180
I don't want to kill anyone anymore!

588
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,320
Miss Wang.

589
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,459
I... Miss Wang, I...

590
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:18,859
I'm sorry.

591
00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:20,480
Let go of me.

592
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,199
Young Master Duan! Strike his forehead and you'll win!

593
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,860
Let's go!

594
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,700
Go.

595
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,919
What should we do?

596
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,159
They are going to burn the place down.

597
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,239
Miss Wang, wait for me here.

598
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,560
I'll take them by surprise.

599
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,739
Boy! What sort of sinister technique is that?

600
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,559
Young Master Duan, go to his back

601
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,959
and attack the pressure point on the seventh vertebrae of his spine.

602
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,159
Miss Wang, I can't save myself.

603
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,680
I'll wait for you on the path to the other world.

604
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,719
Young Master Duan,

605
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,140
is that the Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves technique?

606
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,580
Yes.

You two...

00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,660
That's great.

635
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,190
But... a brother from the Beggars' Sect is also a good brother of yours.

636
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,630
You have to save them.
