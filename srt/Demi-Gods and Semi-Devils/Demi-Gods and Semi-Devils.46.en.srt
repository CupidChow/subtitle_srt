It's a long story.

86
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,800
After you were injured by Jiu Mozhi, I put you here to rest.

87
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,300
But I was worried about my father,

88
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,800
so I returned to Shaolin Temple.

89
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
I ran into Second Brother there.

90
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,400
Then did you guys see my father?

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,600
I only remember that it was chaos there.

92
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Everyone left respectively.

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,400
I didn't see them.

94
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,500
I fled amid the chaos, too. So I have no idea.

Third Brother, what's the matter?

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,100
At that time, that Duan Yanqing was there too.

But he soon disappeared.

98
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,200
He is an enemy of my clan.

99
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,800
I'm worried he will cause trouble for my father.

100
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,900
You're right.

101
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,400
This is a concerning matter.

102
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,300
I'll go look for Prince Duan right now and assist him.

103
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,500
Elder Brother. Wait.

104
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,400
Let me handle this.

00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,100
I'll deliver an order to my subordinates at Lingjiu Palace.

106
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,200
If they find any news of Prince Duan, they'll set off signal fireworks.

107
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,800
When we see them, we'll go and assist them, all right?

108
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
All right.

109
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Thank you, Second Brother.

110

How is it?

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Elder Brother, the outside of her eye was injured.

112
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,000
If you wish to heal her,

113
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
you'll need a pair of eyes from a live person.

114
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
Really?

115
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,800
I may not be a monk anymore,

116
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,000
but I never lie.

117
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,200
So my guess was right!

118
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,100
However...

119
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
However...

120
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,500
What? Why won't you spit it out?

121
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,700
Mr. Xu Zhu.

122
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,200
You and my brother-in-law are sworn brothers.

123
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,000
That makes us family, right?

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
So you have to heal my eyes.

125
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,600
Or were you just saying that to brush me off?

126
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,200
W-Why would I do that?

127
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
It's because the eyes you need are too precious.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
Who would be willing to give you their own eyes?

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
Oh, I thought it was something harder.

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
Look.

131
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,200
You can just use Miss Zhong's eyes.

132
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,600
Look. I'm your third younger brother's little sister.

133

There's a huge difference between a sister and a friend. Right?

135
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,800
Don't even think about taking Miss Zhong's eyes.

136
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Second Brother knows how to heal your eyes.

137
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
He will definitely think of something.

138
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,800
A'Zi, you can't take Miss Zhong's eyes no matter what.

139
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,400
- Why?
- Because...

140
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Because she is my biological little sister, too.

141
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,800

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,200
Back then, on the mountain, you were all over Miss Wang.

And now you're with Miss Zhong?

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,200
And you said that she's your sister, too?

00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,400
Have you no shame?

146
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,000
A'Zi, what nonsense are you saying?

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,400
You're young, but you've always caused trouble.

148
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,300
You angered Brother Chu Wanli so much that he died.

149
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,400
If you dare lay a hand on Miss Zhong...

What? What about it?

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll tell Second Brother not to heal you.

152
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,500
I'll see what else you can do about it!

153

Playing big brother and giving lectures now.

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,700
I'm your older brother

155
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
of course, I have to keep you in line!

156
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,600
Even my brother-in-law couldn't do that.

157
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,400
What makes you think you can?

158
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,700
We've had a long journey. You must be tired, Cousin.

We will regroup at Xixia.

Understood. We shall make the preparations now.

163
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
Brother Murong, why are you going to Xixia?

164
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,500
No, I won't go back. I want to stay with you.

165
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,200
Miss Wang.

166
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,000
Please return first, Brother Deng.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,900
I need to have a few words with Cousin.

168
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
Cousin, we agreed, didn't we?

169
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,200
You would go back to the Swallow's Nest first.

170
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,500
And once I've settled everything, I'll go back and find you.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm worried about you.

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,500
Cousin, you've always been a bit stubborn and competitive.

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,300
But the matter at Xixia involves the Beggars' Sect's internal strife.

174
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,100
Why must you get involved?

175
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:35,200
Even Uncle-in-law was able to let things go.

176
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,800
What does it matter if Yan is restored or not?

177
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,000
You think I'm less capable than Xiao Feng and the others.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That is why you're looking down on me.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Cousin, why would you think that?

180
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,300
The battle at Shaolin doesn't mean anything.

181
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
Even if you can't restore Yan,

182
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,500
you are still a great hero in my heart.

183
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,500
Do you know why I'm going to Xixia?

184
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,100
I'm going there to win the princess's hand in marriage.

185
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,000
Why would I bring you along with me, then?

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Cousin, you...

187
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800
You said it was not a big deal

188
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
that Xiao Feng and Duan humiliated me in public that day.

189
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,300
You said it did not matter

190
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,700
if Yan was restored or not.

191
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,000
Let me tell you this.

192
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,400
I, Murong Fu, was born for Yan.

193
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,800
If I cannot restore Yan,

194
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,200
then for what reason should I still live?

195
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,200
So that's why...

196
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,300
you're going to Xixia.

197
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,000
That's why...

198
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,800
you were so against me joining you.

199
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,900
In your heart,

200
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,600
I matter less than restoring Yan

201
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,600
and a princess you never met.

202
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,800
Brother Duan, is your wound hurting again?

203
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
Not really.

204
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
He is sighing because he is unhappy.

205
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,300
Miss Zhong, you are by his side now,

206
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,400
yet he still sighs.

207
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,500
That means there is another woman in his heart.

208
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Miss Zhong, please ignore Sister A'Zi's nonsense.

209
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,200
Nonsense?

210
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,800
Well, Brother, do you like Miss Zhong Ling

211
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,000
or Miss Wang more?

212
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,100
Oh, I just remembered that I promised to meet Miss Wang tomorrow.

213
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,600
I'll be sure to tell her everything you said today.

214
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,800
You're going to meet Miss Wang?

215
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,400
When? Where? Why?

216
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
You're lying.

217
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,300
Third Brother, sit.

218
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Be careful.

219
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,800
Third Brother.

220
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,700
Before Young Master Murong and the others left,

221
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,400
I overheard their conversation.

222
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
They were discussing heading to the Xixia Kingdom.

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,100
Miss Wang will be going along, too.

224
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,600
They must already be at least 10 Chinese miles away from here now.

225
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,800
Why would Miss Wang come back and meet Miss A'Zi?

226
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,500
Then, do you know why they are headed to Xixia?

227
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,600
We met a disciple of the Beggars' Sect earlier

228
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,200
and got a recruitment notice from Xixia.

229
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,500
On the notice,

230
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,700
it was written that the princess of Xixia

231
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,300
has come of age to be married.

232
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,600
The Kingdom of Xixia prides itself on its archery and horse riding.

233
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,200
So they are inviting heroes who possess both intelligence and strength

234
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,100
from all around the world to Xixia for the selection

235
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,000
of the princess's husband.

236
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,900
Well, if you knew about this,

237
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,700
why don't you go to Xixia and try your luck, too?

238
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,500
If you keep running your mouth,

239
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,300
I won't heal your eyes.

240
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,300
Miss A'Zi, it's late.

241
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,400
Please take your medicine.

242
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
That's right, Second Brother.

243
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,600
You left something unresolved in Xixia, too, didn't you?

244
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,000
- Greetings, Young Master.
- Fourth Brother Zhu.

245
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Ba Sikong. Why are you here?

246
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,400
How is my father? Is he well?

247
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,600
Don't worry, Young Master.

248
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,200
We ran into some friends from Lingjiu Palace on our way here.

249
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,700
We came to inform you of this.

250
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,800
Prince Duan could not find you before he left.

251
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,900
So he sent me here.

252
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,000
Prince Duan and the others are heading southeast.

253
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
But Duan Yanqing and his men are heading west.

254
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
They won't run into each other.

255
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,000
That's good to know.

256
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Also, Young Master,

257
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,200
we have an important letter for you.

258
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,300
"Dali is located in the south.

259
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,800
Our kingdom is small, and we lack the manpower to defend against our enemies.

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,900
It will be a great support for us if we are able

261
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
to form a marriage alliance with Xixia.

262
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,400
With their help, we will be able to ensure the safety and well-being of our people.

263
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,400
My son, you should fulfill your duties to your kingdom and people

264
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,000
and try your best to win the princess's hand in marriage..."

265
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,000
How did my father know that I was going to Xixia?

266
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Prince Duan learned that Young Master Murong and Miss Wang

267
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
were headed to Xixia to try to win the princess's hand.

268
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
He knew that you would go along as well.

269
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
That is why he sent both of us here to assist you.

270
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,800
He asks that you must marry the Princess of Xixia

271
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,000
to solidify our kingdom's standing.

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,600
I hardly know much about martial arts, to begin with.

273
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
And I've just somewhat recovered from my injuries.

274
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,800
How could I compete with the other heroes?

275
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,600
Prince Zhennan has asked us to send his regards to Hero Xiao and Mr. Xu Zhu.

276
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,900
Prince Zhennan hopes that as Young Master's sworn brothers,

277
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,400
you will assist him in this matter.

278
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,700
We will certainly do our best to help Third Brother.

279
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,000
Do you really think my father is that kind?

280
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,600
He is just afraid that his precious son will lose to both of you

281
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,400
if you guys compete as well.

282
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
Now that you've agreed,

283
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,400
you've done exactly what he wanted.

284
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,900
A'Zi, don't talk nonsense.

285
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,200
Rest assured,

286
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,000
Elder Brother and I will do our best to help Third Brother.

287
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,300
In that case, we thank both of you in advance.

288
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,600
Look at that tree.

289
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,100
You were right, Elder Brother.

290
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,700
Stop.

291
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,600
Stop the carriage.

292
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Stop.

293
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,100
Elder Brother, you guys go on first.

294
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,400
I'll be there shortly.

295
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Let's go.

296
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,300
Sister Wan. Sister Wan!

297
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,800
It really is you!

298
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,200
Sister Wan, wherever have you been?

299
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
I've missed you so.

300
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
Whatever for?

301
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,600
Sister Wan.

302
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Where have you been all this time?

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,200
Sister Wan, you've lost weight.

304
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,000
Sister Wan, why are you dressed in a man's attire?

305
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,900
Do you intend to win the princess of Xixia's hand as well?

306
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,700
The Princess of Xixia will definitely

307
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,400
fall in love with such a handsome "man" as you

308
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
once she lays her eyes on you.

309
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
What about you?

310
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,000
Why are you heading to Lingzhou?

311
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm just there for the commotion.

312
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
Did you really think I didn't know

313
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
that Father sent you a letter telling you to go to Xixia

314
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,200
to marry the princess?

315
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,800
So you came along to see me, right?

316
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Why would I do that?

317
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,800
I... I just wanted to see just how beautiful that Xixia princess was,

318
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,300
to have garnered attention from the entire martial arts world.

319
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,000
And to see if the Crown Prince's Heir of Dali

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,900
was fit to have her hand in marriage.

321
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,800
Sister Wan, why do I hear someone crying in these woods?

322
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,900
Miss Wang?

323
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,800
Miss Wang! Miss Wang!

324
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Miss Wang! What are you doing?

325
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,300
Miss Wang, please get down.

326
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,100
What happened?

327
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Miss Wang.

328
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,800
Miss Wang! Miss Wang!

329
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,700
Miss Wang.

330
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
Miss Wang.

331
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,800
Please eat something.

332
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,900
Why bother?

333
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I would rather die.

334
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,600
At least, then, I wouldn't have to suffer so.

335
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,500
Miss Wang.

336
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,600
Everything is my fault.

337
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,400
Please don't be angry anymore.

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,500
If you're still mad,

339
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,700
I can only kneel and plead for your forgiveness.

340
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,600
What are you doing? Quick, get up.

341
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,600
What would other people think if they saw this?

342
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I won't.

343
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,600
I'll only get up if you forgive me.

344
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,000
What is there to forgive? You are not to blame.

345
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,800
It had nothing to do with you.

346
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,100
Well, I thought it was because I had upset Young Master Murong

347
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,400
somehow, and got you involved.

348
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,600
Next time, if I run into him again,

349
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,100
and he attacks me, I'll run away. I won't retaliate.

350
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
You silly fool.

351
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm only sad for myself.

352
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You had nothing to do with it at all.

353
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Get up now.

354
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,300
Miss Wang, why are you sad?

355
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,400
You should at least let me know why.

356
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,700
I will do my best. Whatever you say, I will do my best to help.

357
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,600
Young Master Duan.

358
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,500
You've always been kind to me.

359
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,600
But you can't help me with this.

360
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,500
Because it was all my own wishful thinking.

361
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,600
I thought Cousin had feelings for me.

362
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
So I never regretted

363
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,600
getting into an argument with my mother because of him.

364
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,200
But he told me...

365
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,000
that he was going to marry the Princess of Xixia.

366
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,220
So he never had me in his heart after all.

367
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,460
All the years we spent together,

368
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,560
could not compare to a woman he never even met.

369
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,660
So I decided to leave him. I ran far away.

370
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:32,080
Hoping... that maybe he would come to look for me.

371
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,860
- But...
- But he never came to look for you.

372
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,880
He headed straight to Lingzhou to ask for the princess's hand in marriage.

373
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:49,880
I look pitiful, don't I?

374
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,520
You had deep feelings for him.

375
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,900
Your reaction is understandable.

376
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,820
Besides, to be able to do everything

377
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,680
for the one you love...

378
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,919
is the happiest thing in the world.

379
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,500
Why would it be a pitiful thing?

380
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,560
I'm sorry, Young Master Duan.

381
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,580
I only realized how you felt today.

382
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,320
Loving someone who does not return your feelings...

383
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,600
is so painful.

384
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,099
How about this?

385
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:45,439
Miss Wang, rest assured.

386
00:25:45,439 --> 00:25:47,940
I will marry the Princess of Xixia instead.

387
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,320
If your cousin can't marry her, he'll return and marry you instead.

388
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,820
You can't do that.

389
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,279
If you do, Cousin will hate you.

390
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:02,040
What difference does it make? He already hates me.

391
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,899
But you've never met the princess.

392
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,879
You don't know how she looks and if her character is good or bad.

393
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:12,320
It's not worth it

394
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,160
for you to marry her for my sake.

395
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:23,860
My father has ordered me to head to Xixia to ask for her hand in marriage.

396
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,080
I'm only following my father's orders.

397
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,660
It has nothing to do with you, Miss Wang.

398
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,280
Young Master Duan.

399
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,600
I cannot repay you in this life.

400
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,580
I hope I can return your kindness and feelings in the next life.

401
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,939
Young Master, Miss Mu and Miss Zhong have settled in the house next door.

402
00:27:37,939 --> 00:27:40,820
Young Master Murong is staying in this inn as well.

403
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,679
As per your orders, we have sent Miss Wang back to Young Master Murong.

404
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,400
Good.

405
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,579
According to Bao Butong,

406
00:27:51,579 --> 00:27:55,179
you might have to take part in a duel.

407
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:57,180
But you have yet to recover from your injuries fully.

408
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,820
And your martial arts are unstable.

409
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,060
If you can't execute the Six Pulse Excalibur

410
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,220
and lose the competition, that's not a big problem.

411
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,379
But what if you lose your life?

412
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:12,820
Even so, I must still compete.

413
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,620
Third Brother, a while ago, you were hesitant to take part in the competition.

414
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,480
Why are you so keen on it now?

415
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,960
Times are different.

416
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,180
Now, I cannot wait for the day of the selection to come.

417
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,819
I hope that I may somehow catch the princess's eye

418
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:35,760
so that Young Master Murong may give up

419
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,679
and change his mind and return to Miss Wang.

420
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,360
You're doing this for Miss Wang.

421
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,120
- Ba Sikong.
- Yes.

422
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,940
Get some good wine in here. Get more of them.

423
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,000
Of course.

424
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,240
Elder Brother. Second Brother. It is a rare opportunity for us to gather together.

425
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,619
I will be departing for Xixia soon.

426
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:03,799
As a farewell for me,

427
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,219
let us drink to our heart's content today!

428
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:08,760
All right.

429
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,740
To be honest, when I first ran away from my home in Dali,

430
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,179
it was only because I didn't want to learn martial arts.

431
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,219
But somehow, later on along this journey,

432
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:30,819
not only did I learn Sister Deity's unrivaled martial arts,

433
00:29:30,819 --> 00:29:35,120
but I mastered the Duan clan's Six Pulse Excalibur, too.

434
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,139
After that, I met Miss Mu.

435
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,880
I was supposed to marry her,

436
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,979
but somehow, she turned out to be my sister.

437
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:49,560
By blood.

438
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,199
And now, Miss Wang is the only one in my heart.

439
00:29:53,199 --> 00:29:56,759
But tomorrow, I will be leaving for Xixia

440
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,640
in hopes of marrying their princess for the sake of Miss Wang.

441
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,040
Second Brother. Second Brother.

442
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,000
Why do you think things always can't seem to go

443
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,300
as I wish them to?

444
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,400
Third Brother. Oh, Third Brother.

445
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,300
Third Brother, there are seven states of suffering in life.

446
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:45,800
Not being able to achieve your desires is one of them.

447
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,580
I am suffering from that too.

448
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm afraid I can't help you.

449
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,720
Elder Brother.

450
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,520
All I wanted was to bring the Beggars' Sect to glory.

451
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,160
But instead, I was framed for killing Deputy Chief Ma.

452
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,740
When I tried to avenge my parents,

453
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,760
I mistakenly took the life of the woman I loved the most.

454
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,180
Sister A'Zhu...

455
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,460
For over half of my life,

456
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,780
I had been defending Song against Liao.

457
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,020
But now...

458
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,940
I have become the ruler of Liao's South Court.

459
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,020
The Hans call me a Khitan.

460
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,199
The Liaos regard me as a spy.

461
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,999
I have always been honest and righteous.

462
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:07,660
But why can't things ever seem

463
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,430
to go as I wish?

464
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,700
Elder Brother, I thought a drink would help you to relax.

465
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,900
But instead, it brought up your sad memories.

466
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,960
I want to let both of you know

467
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,900
that these matters no longer bother me.

468
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,760
Being able to meet both of you

469
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,860
and become sworn brothers with you guys

470
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,160
is the happiest thing that has happened to me.

471
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,680
Come. Let's get a larger pot of wine.

472
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,060
Elder Brother is forthright and carefree.

473
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:54,940
I have no regrets about meeting both of you in my life.

474
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,620
Cheers!

475
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,439
If Young Master Murong needs anything from me, I will gladly assist you.

476
00:33:40,439 --> 00:33:42,499
But why must you resort to violence?

477
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:46,039
Tell me. What did you say to Cousin last night?

478
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,239
Nothing much.

479
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:53,099
I ran into Miss Wang by coincidence, and we had a chat.

480
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:56,299
And I told her I would try to get you to change your mind.

481
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:57,799
Change my mind?

482
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,119
You may have fooled my gullible cousin, but you can't fool me.

483
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,320
What did I do?

484
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,420
Why are you still pretending?

485
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:06,439
You want to marry the Princess of Xixia for your own sake.

486
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,239
But you're afraid of competition, so you came up with these lies to trick me.

487
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,220
I am not a gullible child.

488
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,399
I won't fall for your deceitful lies.

489
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,760
Young Master Murong.

490
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,699
Dali may not be the largest kingdom,

491
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,959
but the role of the princess's husband

492
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,420
is definitely not that important in the eyes of the Crown Prince's heir of Dali.

493
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,959
I have a word of caution for you today.

494
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,039
Fortune and wealth may vanish in the blink of an eye.

495
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,119
Even if you do marry the Princess of Xixia,

496
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,438
and wage war in the Central Plains, and take the lives of many,

497
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,560
there is no guarantee that you will be able

498
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,999
to restore Yan and become emperor.

499
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,759
You try to justify your words and claim the moral high ground,

500
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,718
but in the end, you're only doing this for your own selfish desires.

501
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,578
You don't believe me. Fine.

502
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:47,719
But no matter what, I can't let you marry the Princess of Xixia.

503
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,099
And I definitely can't let Miss Wang be in despair and take her own life

504
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:53,440
because of you!

505
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,139
The more you try to stop me, the more determined I am.

506
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,500
What can you do then?

507
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,779
Then I can only do my best to stop you.

508
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:03,540
All right.

509
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,439
Cousin, ome out.

510
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,300
Miss Wang?

511
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,079
Lies and deceit are unbecoming of an honorable man!

512
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,599
There is no need for me to be honorable towards someone like you.

513
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,680
- Young Master Duan! Young Master Duan!
- Cousin.

514
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,699
Young Master Duan! Young Master Duan!

515
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:31,059
Cousin, why are you here?

516
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,639
He tried to warn you out of the kindness of his heart.

517
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,879
But in return, you did this to him!

518
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,139
Didn't you hear that he would do everything to stop me?

519
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,359
That day on Shaoshi Mountain, he humiliated me.

520
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,039
He ruined my reputation in the martial arts world.

521
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,280
I can't allow him to live!

522
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,719
Cousin, is winning that important to you?

523
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,599
Young Master Duan!

524
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,979
Young Master Duan, are you all right?

525
00:35:53,979 --> 00:35:56,359
Since you care so much about him, you might as well go with him!

526
00:35:56,359 --> 00:35:58,620
Why bother to pretend and stay by my side?

527
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,320
Do you still not believe my feelings for you

528
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,640
even after all this time?

529
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,880
We've been together for so long.

530
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,360
Even if I had wronged you in some way,

531
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,760
can't you forgive me just this once?

532
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,279
Cousin, don't marry the Princess of Xixia.

533
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:27,160
After we save Young Master Duan,

534
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,039
I promise you I will never see him again.

535
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,439
We'll return to the Swallow's Nest and live together forever.

536
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,920
Doesn't that sound wonderful?

537
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,059
Murong Fu, do you still remember that you are a descendant of the royal family of Yan?

538
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:51,519
Do you still remember Old Master Murong's dying wish?

539
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,859
Never was anything achieved without sacrifices.

540
00:36:54,859 --> 00:36:59,959
Back then, it took us great effort and sacrifices to build the Yan Nation.

541
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:02,460
My father gave me the name Fu

542
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,420
so that I would always remember the legacy of my ancestors

543
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,580
nd to restore Yan

544
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,200
and reclaim what was ours.

545
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,080
Cousin.

546
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,320
The fate that ties us together no longer exists.

547
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,300
I have yet to restore Yan.

548
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,520
I must marry the Princess of Xixia.

549
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,660
So you are determined to marry the Princess of Xixia...

550
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,260
and I no longer have a place in your heart.

551
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,380
In your heart,

552
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:55,260
I can never compare to your duty of restoring Yan.

553
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,559
Young Master Duan did so much for me.

554
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,500
Yet, I always ignored his feelings.

555
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,120
And I even dragged him down.

556
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,440
Cousin, I hope you get what you wished for.

557
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,660
Marry the Princess of Xixia...

558
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,280
and become the emperor of Yan.

559
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,120
Young Master Duan,

560
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,240
I... will now repay your feelings and kindness towards me.

561
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,660
Cousin!

562
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,360
Cousin.

563
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,519
The heavens are always watching you.

564
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,100
Who's there?

565
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,320
Young Master Murong, you have committed such despicable sins.

566
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,060
Are you afraid of karma?

567
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,379
You forced Miss Wang to jump into the well to take her own life.

568
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Yet you made it sound as if you were only granting her wish.

569
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,340
Young Master Murong,

570
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,900
you are cruel and heartless indeed.

571
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,399
That is my personal matter.

572
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,640
What does it have to do with you?

573
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,379
It shall concern me if you commit such misdeeds.

574
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,120
Furthermore, you intend to marry the Princess of Xixia.

575
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,920
That no longer makes it your personal affair.

576
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,180
I knew Tibet had other intentions as well.

577
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,160
I see you have come for the young prince.

578
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,520
Since you already know, there is no need for me to hide this from you.

579
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,859
The young prince is my disciple.

580
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:27,540
He may not be the most skilled in martial arts,

581
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,400
but he is qualified to marry the Princess of Xixia.

582
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,240
I am certain of that.

583
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,519
Young Master Murong, your father and I were close acquaintances.

584
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,359
We respected each other.

585
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,179
For your father's sake, I will tell you

586
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:50,740
why I am so certain of it.

587
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:56,540
Anyone who intends to compete with the young prince...

588
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,560
for the princess's hand,

589
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,840
will be eliminated by me.

590
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,320
You...

591
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,500
Young Master, don't worry.

592
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,620
I will not harm your life.

593
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,380
But I must warn you...

594
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,000
to leave Xixia immediately

595
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,099
to avoid getting caught in the crossfire.

596
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,960
And if I don't?

597
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,560
I will not harm your life.

598
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,080
However, I will...

599
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,900
gouge your eyes out

600
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,260
and chop off one of your arms and one of your legs.

601
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,839
A crippled man will not be able to marry the Princess of Xixia.

602
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,279
Young Master Duan.

603
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
Sister Deity.

604
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,200
Young Master Duan.

605
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,780
Miss Wang?

606
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,599
It's me.

607
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,740
Why are you here?

608
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,180
I thought you were harmed by my cousin.

609
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,399
Fortunately, you're all right.

610
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,260
I'm fine.

611
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,639
What about Young Master Murong?

- Since you are here, why don't you also participate?

635
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,120
No. Elder Brother and I are here for Third Brother.

636
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,420
Since you are here, why don't you try?

637
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,240
May I ask Xu Zhu where you were the happiest in your life?

638
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,310
My Second Brother was the happiest

639
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,990
in some freezing ice-cold room.
