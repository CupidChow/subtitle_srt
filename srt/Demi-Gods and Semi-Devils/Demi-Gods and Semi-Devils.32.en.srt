00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:33,039
[Episode 32]

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,720
Whoa!

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,099
So you are Young Master Murong's subordinates?

15
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,580
The Shaolin Sect was suspicious of my young master, which upsets me greatly.

16
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,740
I don't see a need to take part in any more Heroes' Gatherings.

17
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,079
I might as well spar here!

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,839
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,260
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

20
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,799
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

21
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,039
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

22
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,860
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

23
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,340
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

24
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,800
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,600
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,420
Out of my way, little monk!

29
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,080
You!

30
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,159
My master is tired and needs rest.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,499
So give him some space. Now scram!

32
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,079
This pavilion is for everyone.

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,900
- Why must we give it up to you?
- Fourth Brother.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,360
Don't bother with them.

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,020
Grand Martial Uncle.

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,040
Grand Martial Uncle, what brings you here?

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,800
Reverend, please come in.

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Master, that's the monk who raises ice silkworms.

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,680
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am.

40
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,040
I remember it well. It's him.

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,420
Grandmaster.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,659
What happened to this young monk?

43
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,580
It hurts me to say this.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,579
On this stretcher is my martial nephew.

45
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,639
Due to our negligence,

46
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,479
he ran away from the monastery a year ago and did many misdeeds.

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,920
Until we finally found him and brought him back.

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,660
May I know who I'm talking to?

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,560
I am Ding Chunqiu.

50
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,340
You are the Head of the Dharma Academy, renowned for your Universe in the Sleeve, yes?

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,280
It's an honor to meet you at last.

52
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,100
Hey. You there.

53
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,380
How did you get that helmet on your face?

54
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,099
I've traveled all over the world, yet I've never seen such a guise.

55
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,780
It was forced upon me.

56
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,440
Who pulled such a prank on you?

57
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,339
A fine man like you doesn't deserve that mask.

58
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,619
Come here. I'll take it off of you.

59
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:41,620
No! No...

60
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
Brother-in-Law, you're here.

61
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,420
Sit down.

62
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,579
I'm here to ask you about the man with the iron mask.

63
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:29,039
Did you force him to wear the mask?

64
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,279
How could you do such a thing to him?

65
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,339
Brother-in-Law, don't be mad.

66
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:39,419
The man with the iron mask is just a slave they brought here to keep me entertained.

67
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:42,479
You even made him practice the Xingxiu Sect's venomous techniques?

68
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,180
You could've gotten him killed!

69
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,900
He should be honored that I had him practice that.

70
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,479
It shows that I think highly of him.

71
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,580
So what if he dies? I couldn't care less. His death doesn't matter.

72
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you want to hit me?

73
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,340
Is that what you want?

74
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,199
You're going to slap me because of a slave?

75
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,240
That's a life!

76
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,740
How could you be so indifferent?

77
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,959
I promised your sister to raise you well

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,079
so you wouldn't be led astray!

79
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,079
Your sister used to make fun of people and pull pranks on others, too.

80
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,799
But unlike you, she was thoughtful and considerate.

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,340
Why can't you learn from her?

82
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,119
You keep going on and on about my sister.

83
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,559
If you hate me so much, why bother about me then?

84
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:39,139
Why don't you just leave me to the Xingxiu Sect and leave me be to fend for myself?

85
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,820
Get out!

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,500
[Xue Manor]

87
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,200
Reverend Xuan Nan of Shaolin and my acquaintances seek the Divine Physician Xue's assistance.

88
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
Let's go inside.

89
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
Amitabha.

90
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,160
Greetings.

91
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,820
One of my companions is injured and requires the Divine Physician's immediate treatment.

92
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,580
He's better off left for dead.

93
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,280
It has nothing to do with us.

94
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,300
How cruel of you to say that.

95
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:16,435
[Zither Maniac, Kang Guangling]

96
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,700
Is your injured companion a monk?

97
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,759
Indeed, one of my disciples is injured.

98
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,660
You demon...

99
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
Elder Brother!

100
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,120
Stop! Stop!

101
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,100
[Respected]
(TN: used when someone has died)

102
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,560
Stop!

103
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,540
Stop it.

104
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,500
You got it all wrong.

105
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,480
- Reverend Xuan Nan.
- Physician Xue.

106
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,920
We're all on the same side. Please, stand down.

107
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,199
We'll explain.

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,519
We are a group known as the Eight Friends of Hangu.

109
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,719
This is the eldest among us, Kang Guangling.

110
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,239
I'm the fifth. You know our mentor.

111
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:26,220
They call him the Intelligent Gentleman.

112
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,880
The Intelligent Gentleman is deaf and mute.

113
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,439
All of his disciples, too, are also deaf and mute.

114
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,380
Every martial artist knows that.

115
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,820
But all of you are neither deaf nor mute.

116
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,760
That's very strange.

117
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,280
Ding Chunqiu has a hand in this.

118
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,440
Everyone, let me explain.

119
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,180
Our founder once took in two disciples.

120
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,319
The older of them was Su Xinghe, who is my mentor,

121
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,480
and the younger was Ding Chunqiu.

122
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,580
Their martial arts skills were almost on par with each other.

123
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,100
But my mentor was only interested in the fine arts,

124
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,159
while Ding Chunqiu was focused on martial arts.

125
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,239
As the years passed, the gap between their mastery of martial arts widened.

126
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
He devoted half his life to mastering music and Go.

127
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,180
It's no wonder that Ding Chunqiu, who focused entirely on martial arts, would surpass him by far.

128
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,279
Ding Chunqiu excelled in martial arts so much

129
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,240
that he managed to wound our founder gravely and threw him into the ravine.

130
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,300
At the moment of such distress,

131
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,720
he unleashed the Qimen Dunjia Arts,

132
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,800
leading the duel to a deadlock.

133
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,520
At his dying breath,

134
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,280
our founder passed down the ultimate technique of our sect to our mentor.

135
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,199
Ding Chunqiu coveted our divine martial arts.

136
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,660
He tried to extort them from our mentor.

137
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,540
But he never said a word.

138
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,140
So, Ding Chunqiu had absolutely no way,

139
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,479
but to force our mentor into a deal, in which he had to vow never to speak a single word

140
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,620
if he were to be spared the worst.

141
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,360
So my mentor wrote a letter

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,700
in which he dismissed and disavowed us as his disciples.

143
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,880
Since then, he has been feigning to be deaf and mute.

144
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,519
I see.

145
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,619
We may have been dismissed,

146
00:11:12,619 --> 00:11:15,960
[Eight Friends of Hangu]
but we will never forsake his teachings.

147
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Thus, we are collectively known as the Eight Friends of Hangu.

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,280
To honor the guidance and teachings taught to us by our mentor by the Hangu Pass.

149
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,660
Martial Nephew Muhua, all you have to do is heal that monk, Hui Jing,

150
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,400
and I shall spare your lives.

151
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,139
There's only one person in the world whose words I heed.

152
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:40,860
I will only heal whoever he tells me to heal.

153
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,260
You can easily kill me if you wish.

154
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,159
But to ask me to heal someone, you will need to beg our master for that!

155
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:54,460
So, you heed no one but Su Xinghe. Am I right?

156
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,479
Only a beastly scoundrel like you

157
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,280
would show the idea of killing our mentor and then the rest of us!

158
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,240
You've been poisoned. Hold your breaths!

159
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,059
You scoundrel Ding! Kill us if you want,

160
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:23,839
but don't even think of forcing me to heal someone for you!

161
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,639
I'm going to ask you eight times, Muhua.

162
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,739
Will you heal this monk?

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,319
Each time you refuse,

164
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,580
I will kill one of your martial brethren.

165
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,679
I don't mind you killing me.

166
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,739
If worse comes to worst, the eight of us will die together!

167
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,160
You will die together?

168
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,801
I won't let you die.

169
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,679
But when I ask my eighth time

170
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,200
and you still refuse,

171
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,940
I might go and kill someone who calls themselves Intelligent Gentleman,

172
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,719
Su Xinghe.

173
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,079
You...

174
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,559
Don't you dare to lay a finger on my master!

175
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,420
Why wouldn't I dare to?

176
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,219
The Old Deity of Xingxiu acts according to the whims of his temper.

177
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:25,399
And you! You picked on my disciple.

178
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,479
So his master will have to fight back!

179
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,799
You...

180
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,720
What's with the "you"?

181
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,460
Fine.

182
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,960
I'll do as you say.

183
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,260
But after I heal your monk,

184
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,460
you are not to harm any of my friends,

185
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,060
my brethren, or my master!

186
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,500
A'Zi, I know you're still mad at me,

187
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,520
but you made a mistake in the first place.

188
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,840
I had to make you understand.

189
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,820
The Han are human.

190
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,599
And so are the Khitan.

191
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,260
We cannot bully the weak.

192
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,820
Neither can we toy with people's lives.

193
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
Do you understand?

194
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
I don't hear any movement inside.

195
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,480
Could it be...

196
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,140
Your Highness.

197
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,400
Take a look at this.

198
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,740
[Don't come and find me, A'Zi]

199
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,320
Seriously, A'Zi.

200
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,379
She hasn't fully recovered her skills, yet she fled to the Central Plains.

201
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,640
She's asking for trouble.

202
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,420
Get me my horse. I'm going to find her.

203
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,940
No, Your Highness.

204
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,319
This is no small matter for someone of your rank.

205
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,919
You can't just enter Song territory on your own.

206
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,119
Besides, our relations are complicated.

207
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,319
We can't leave an opportunity for them to exploit.

208
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,679
If this creates unnecessary trouble,

209
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,140
that would be even harder to deal with.

210
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,279
Rest assured, Your Highness. I'll send someone to follow her discreetly right away.

211
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,199
Princess left without telling us.

212
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,499
If you go and find her yourself,

213
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:47,720
she will likely refuse to show herself in your presence out of spite.

214
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,959
We have plenty of spies in Song.

215
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,479
I'll get them to find her.

216
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,359
Give us a few days, and we'll find out where she is.

217
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,760
All right. Do as you must.

218
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,260
She must be found.

219
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,820
Rest assured, Your Highness.

220
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,759
This one's gross!

221
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,700
Take it back.

222
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,720
That stinks.

223
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,199
Have a look, Miss.

224
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,519
These just came in today.

225
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,199
This necklace is light in texture.

226
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,219
This handkerchief is made of fine silk.

227
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,260
It's selling well.

228
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,700
Please buy one, Miss.

229
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,340
Come on, buy one.

230
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,700
Princess.

231
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,959
- Princess.
- Princess.

232
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,800
Please come home with us now.

233
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,760
- Where's my brother-in-law?
- The prince is preoccupied with military affairs.

234
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,259
He simply could not leave.

235
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,660
So he sent us to pick you up.

236
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,680
He can't even take a break to pick me up.

237
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,720
Why should I go back?

238
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,299
Does he want to lock me up just like last time?

239
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,719
Princess, you know how busy His Highness is.

240
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,279
Please don't make things harder for us.

241
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,719
Please just return with us.

242
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,639
Well, sorry.

243
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,460
It is in my blood to be deliberately provocative.

244
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,519
Go back and tell my brother-in-law

245
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,839
that if he doesn't apologize and pick me up in person,

246
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:29,720
I'll never go back.

247
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,140
Farewell.

248
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,300
Princess.

249
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,119
The Old Deity of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss

250
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,599
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

251
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,919
The Old Deity of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss

252
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,439
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

253
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,719
The Old Deity of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss

254
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,119
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

255
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,399
The Old Deity of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss

256
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

257
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,879
[The Intelligent Gentleman, Su Xinghe]

258
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,179
The Old Deity of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss

259
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,599
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

260
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,959
The Old Deity of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss

261
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,399
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

262
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,140
The Old Fairy of Xingxiu shall live in eternal bliss...

263
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,719
We, the Eight Friends of Hangu, are here to visit you, Master.

264
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,799
We are infinitely delighted to see you in great health, Master.

265
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,099
Master, Reverend Xuan Nan of Shaolin is here to visit you, too.

266
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,040
Here you are, Reverend Xuan Nan.

267
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,460
So Mr. Deaf and Mute is neither deaf nor mute after all.

268
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,960
I've sinned. I've sinned.

269
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,120
Amitabha.

270
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,259
Your Zhenlong Go Formation is profound and ingenious.

271
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,240
Even I cannot solve it.

272
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,580
You are a meticulous young man.

273
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,560
The moves you made were of advanced levels.

274
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,060
How could you not work out another move?

275
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,920
What a pity.

276
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,079
The rest of you may get up as well.

277
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,020
Yes, Master.

278
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,119
Speaking about Zhenlong,

279
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,439
I witnessed it in the cave at Wuliang Mountain the other day.

280
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,339
This Intelligent Gentleman must have something to do with Sister Deity in the cave.

281
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:04,559
I should ask him about it discreetly later.

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,680
This round of Zhenlong has huge implications.

283
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,079
Bailing, come and take a look.

284
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,119
If you managed to solve it somehow,

285
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,900
it would be wonderful.

286
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,380
Yes, Master.

287
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,659
Second, you're the Go expert.

288
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,420
What is Zhenlong?

289
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,620
Zhenlong is a difficult puzzle in Go.

290
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,799
It is often a way to deliberately tease players

291
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,439
rather than a battle between two opponents.

292
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,760
Therefore, no matter how hard you try,

293
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,840
it is often extremely difficult to deduce how to play next.

294
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,140
You're going to die in vain! Why take the trouble?

295
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,239
That old scoundrel set up all of this

296
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,260
just to torment his victims to death.

297
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,959
Fan Bailing, you've walked right into the trap.

298
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,500
What did you call our master just now?

299
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,399
The Deaf Mute Old Man is neither deaf nor mute for today.

300
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,780
Surely you know why.

301
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,839
Wonderful, wonderful!

302
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,359
You broke your vows and sought your own doom.

303
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,980
You can't fault me.

304
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,840
It took our master

305
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,439
three years of hard work to perfect this Zhenlong game.

306
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,999
Then, he sincerely invited all Go enthusiasts to solve the puzzle.

307
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,999
What an old fool I am.

308
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,759
I delved into it for over 30 years,

309
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,680
yet I could not solve it.

310
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,340
So, today, I sincerely invited all of you here to assist me.

311
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,580
It will be a wish come true if any of you manages to solve it.

312
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,179
Our master watching from the heavens will also find closure.

313
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,079
Amitabha.

314
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,239
Such is the Intelligent Gentleman's intent

315
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,999
that I believe that even his late master would be delighted to know.

316
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,560
Ding Chunqiu!

317
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,759
This man is my martial junior.

318
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,399
But he betrayed our master.

319
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,860
He made him die with a grudge.

320
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,499
I had wanted to follow after my master,

321
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:42,000
but my late master had unfulfilled wishes.

322
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,840
Therefore, I survived to this day,

323
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,460
enduring this humiliation.

324
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,490
All these years,

325
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:55,960
I had honored a pact with my junior

326
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,280
not to speak a single word.

327
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,380
I feigned to be deaf and mute.

328
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,420
Even my disciples, whom I just took in,

329
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,780
I had to force them to be deaf and mute.

330
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,060
It has been 30 years.

331
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,820
No fruit had been borne.

332
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,260
No one has ever been able to solve this Go puzzle.

333
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Young Master Duan, whom I had a match with earlier,

334
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,280
is a handsome and intelligent young man.

335
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,080
His moves had been spectacular as well.

336
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,219
But he failed to place the last piece and lost.

337
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,159
Forgive my ineptitude.

338
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,360
I am truly humbled to be in your care.

339
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,740
I sense another great talent on his way.

340
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,140
I am so overjoyed!

341
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,479
Young Master Murong, you're here to solve the Zhenlong puzzle.

342
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,880
I hope you don't mind if I play on your behalf.

343
00:25:53,680 --> 00:26:00,139
I received an invitation to solve your puzzle, Intelligent Gentleman, during my journey.

344
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,359
I could not resist dropping by to meet these fellow heroes.

345
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,460
Amitabha.

346
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,740
Young Master Murong?

347
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,620
Was Young Master Murong the one who placed that white chess piece?

348
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,959
If Young Master Murong is here,

349
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
what about Miss Wang?

350
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,239
Young Master.

351
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,479
What took you so long?

352
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,879
The Old Freak of Xingxiu held us back on our way.

353
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,360
We didn't expect to see him here.

354
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,559
Both of them are as close as ever.

355
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,400
There's no chance for me.

356
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,199
Well, there was never a place for me in her heart.

357
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,319
Even when she was alone with me,

358
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,500
her cousin was all that was on her mind.

359
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,440
Young Master Duan.

360
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,440
Are you doing well?

361
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,100
Do I look well to you?

362
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
What about you?

363
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,440
Young Master Duan, you're here too?

364
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,899
Young Master Murong,

365
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,119
you're good at martial arts, but as for chess...

366
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,940
Not so much, I guess.

367
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,820
You might not be able to win against me.

368
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,059
Young Master Murong, I don't see the need to play this anymore.

369
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,059
Since you don't care about the Go game, why bother to mess around here?

370
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,319
The Zhenlong Go formation is unsolvable, to begin with.

371
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:51,839
I was just curious enough to drop by.

372
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,699
I thought I would try it out to find out what was so peculiar about this game.

373
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:57,680
Now that I have, I don't want

374
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,220
to waste any more of my energy on this utter nonsense.

375
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,400
Young Master Murong,

376
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,419
you can't even break free from being caught up with me.

377
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:10,960
How can you win this challenge?

378
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,899
In terms of tactics and acumen,

379
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:29,040
I still have the upper hand.

380
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,099
Murong Fu, Murong Fu.

381
00:29:31,099 --> 00:29:35,839
Do you want your family's reputation to crumble under your feet?

382
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,980
I'm out of luck.

383
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,580
It's all in vain.

384
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,279
All my best efforts remain short-lived illusions in the end.

385
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,040
It is all fate.

386
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,720
What more can I do?

387
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,900
You can't do that!

388
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,340
- Young Master!
- Young Master!

389
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,980
Cousin!

390
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,200
What an impressive execution of the Six Pulse Excalibur.

391
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,540
Young Master!

392
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,620
Cousin.

393
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,239
It's all right if you can't solve the puzzle.

394
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,440
You don't have to kill yourself over it.

395
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,079
Young Master, this game fascinates the mind.

396
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,319
I think there's an illusion to it.

397
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,999
You mustn't delve too deeply into it.

398
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,439
Luckily...

399
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,519
just now....

400
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,999
Young Master Duan staved off your fan.

401
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,260
I got caught up in the moment just now.

402
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,560
It was as if I was possessed.

403
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,300
The Dali Duan clan's Six Pulse Excalibur surely lives up to its name.

404
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,999
You pulled me out from my moment of loss.

405
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,020
I can't thank you enough, Young Master Duan.

406
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,160
Well, if it isn't one of the Dali Duan clan.

407
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,580
Pray tell, is it Duan Zheng Chun?

408
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,719
Our boss is the true member of the Dali Duan clan!

409
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,280
The rest are all impostors!

410
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,999
So my disciple is here, too.

411
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,919
The Four Evils are here to meet the Intelligent Gentleman.

412
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:23,759
As per your invitation for a game of Go.

413
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,260
Welcome.

414
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,720
Another one?

415
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,700
That was an excellent move.

416
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,400
Let's see if you can solve it

417
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,700
and break free from the formation.

418
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,300
Mr. Duan, your first few moves took you ahead.

419
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,600
But your last was caught in a ruse.

420
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,400
A dead end. There's no way out.

421
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
You and your Shaolin Sect are orthodox indeed.

422
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,510
So tell me how would you solve it?

423
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,800
A Go formation is neither honest nor devious,

424
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:56,200
contrary to what it seems. You cannot solve it with honest moves.

425
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,200
And neither can you do it with only unorthodox means.

426
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,000
Neither good nor evil, you say.

427
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,900
Never mind then.

428
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,400
You know what they say?

429
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,000
It's easy to turn from good to bad,

430
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,200
but hard to turn back to good.

431
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,000
One misstep, and you'll regret it for eternity.

432
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,400
By the time you look back, it's too late.

433
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
As a royal heir of the Duan clan of Dali,

434
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I have fallen so far in the martial arts world.

435
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,000
I am ashamed to face my ancestors.

436
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,400
Ancestors?

437
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,000
Even if you die and go to the other world,

438
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,700
you wouldn't be able to face your ancestors.

439
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,000
If you know you are ashamed,

440
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,200
why don't you end it all now?

441
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,600
That's what a hero would do.

442
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
Why don't you just kill yourself?

443
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,700
Kill yourself!

444
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,200
Mr. Duan, no!

445
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,400
Boss, catch that monk!

446
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,400
It's too late.

447
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,200
Duan Yanqing, hurry up and end it all!

448
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,800
Indeed.

449
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,400
What's the point of living in this world any further?

450
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,000
I might as well end it all.

451
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,200
This Go challenge is driving people insane.

452
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,600
If I could think of a way to distract him,

453
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
I might be able to save him.

454
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,600
I can't solve the game, but I can cause a commotion.

455
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,000
I... I'm going to solve it!

456
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,200
You fool!

457
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,000
You played in vain.

458
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,800
You killed a large chunk of your own white pieces.

459
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,900
I know of no such move anywhere in this world!

460
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,400
You brat.

461
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,100
You ruined my plans!

462
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,200
Old Freak of Xingxiu! You wanted to take advantage of this ruckus.

463
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,100
I won't let you have it your way!

464
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,800
Mr. Duan has been eliminated.

465
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,000
My late master has willed that anyone in the whole world is eligible to play.

466
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,600
Your move, although whimsical

467
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,000
it still counts as valid.

468
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,800
However, you eliminated a large number of your own pieces with that move.

469
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,600
If the black pieces close in on you,

470
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,400
how will you deal with it?

471
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,600
Amitabha.

472
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,800
Senior, I'm not good at Go.

473
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,900
I saw that Mr. Duan was disoriented by the game.

474
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,000
That is why I made a move to distract him.

475
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I will not make another move in this game.

476
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm so sorry, Senior.

477
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,500
Stop!

478
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,800
My master designed the Zhenlong Go formation

479
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,200
to invite chess masters from all over to solve it.

480
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,200
It's not a big deal if it can't be solved.

481
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,000
But if anyone deliberately messes it up

482
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,500
and put all of his effort to waste,

483
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,600
even if that person were to bring thousands of troops,

484
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:43,000
I will fight to the death with that person!

485
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,200
- But Senior...
- Play on!

486
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,000
My master's efforts are not something you can toy with.

487
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,200
Lower left, 3-9.

488
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,600
Who was that?

489
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Who's teaching me to play?

490
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,300
Who spoke to me?

491
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,000
Forget it. I'll just do as told.

492
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,800
Lower left, 2-8.

493
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,200
Upper right, 5-6.

494
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,600
Even I can figure out these few moves.

495
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,000
But everything is hard at first.

496
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I never expected the first move.

497
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,600
Cousin? This is just a game of Go.

498
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,000
Why do you care so much?

499
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,200
Upper left, 7-8.

500
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Little monk, you are indeed gifted.

501
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,800
30 years have passed

502
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,600
since my master set up this formation,

503
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,000
and no one has ever been able to solve it.

504
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,500
Until today, when you came and solved it.

505
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,200
Senior, I did it?

506
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,800
I am truly grateful to you.

507
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,400
No, no, Senior. You got it all wrong.

508
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,800
Actually, it wasn't me. It was...

509
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,200
This is a secret. Don't tell anyone.

510
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,500
Otherwise, your life will be at risk.

511
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,900
Actually, Senior, I only got lucky.

512
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,400
You're flattering me.

513
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:11,200
Young Monk, please.

514
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,200
That's the gateway to my sect!

515
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,000
How dare you try to tread on it, you bald brat!

516
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Now that you're inside,

517
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,600
why do you want to go out?

518
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,800
Our time in this world is transient.

531
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,800
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

532
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,800
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

533
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,200
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

534
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,800
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

535
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,090
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

536
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,800
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

537
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,200
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

538
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,600
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

539
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,200
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

540
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,400
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

541
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,600
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

542
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,200
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

543
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:17,500
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫
