[The Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils]

14
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,933
[Episode 15]

15
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,300
I revolted to save the hundred-years achievement of the Beggars' Sect

16
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,380
and the glorious future of the Song Dynasty.

17
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,559
But the person who told me about your true birth identity was too afraid to die to show up.

18
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:48,300
Just kill me with one shot.

19
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,700
Tell me.

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,140
What's the matter with my true birth identity?

21
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,060
No one trusts me now.

22
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,740
It would be better for you to kill me.

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,240
You're a man who isn't afraid of death.

24
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,419
Yet you're so hesitant to explain the matter.

25
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:08,200
Yes.

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,819
I'm not afraid of death. What else is there to be afraid of then?

27
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,300
Qiao, just kill me with one clean move,

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,300
lest that I have to witness the Beggars' Sect falling into the Hu people's pockets

29
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,959
and the great Song Dynasty perishing in the hands of the barbarians.

30
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,640
Why would the Beggars' Sect

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,060
fall into the Hu people's hands?

32
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,920
- Explain it clearly.
- I just told you.

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,680
No one trusts me now.

34
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,200
They'll only say I'm afraid of death and spreading lies.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,020
I don't want to die with a bad name.

36
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,380
Chief Qiao, Quan Guanqing is full of schemes.

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,659
He talks nonsense to get you to spare his life.

38
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,980
- Disciplinary disciples! Execute him!
- Here!

39
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,039
Yes, Sir!

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Wait.

41
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,520
You said you knew about my true birth identity and that it's related

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,300
to the survival of our sect.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,460
Yet you wouldn't tell the truth when I asked.

44
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,360
Instead, you started a revolt.

45
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Your death is inevitable.

46
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,180
Just go.

47
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,560
You'll no longer belong to the Beggars' Sect.

48
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,040
Qiao Feng, you're so calm.

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,139
Chief, we received updates from Yi Dabiao in Xixia.

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,559
[Beggars' Sect, Elder Xu]
Greetings, Elder Xu.

51
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,919
Although Elder Xu is a senior, Chief Qiao is still the Chief of the Beggars' Sect. How could he...

52
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,520
Miss Wang, it's too early to say so. Let's wait and see.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,900
Elder Xu, what brings you here?

54
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,100
My apologies.

55
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,860
This isn't an urgent matter to be discussed now.

56
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,639
Ma Dayuan's widow, Kang Min, will be arriving soon.

57
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,580
She has something to say to everyone.

58
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,560
Everyone, how about we wait for a few moments for her?

59
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,940
Sure.

60
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,959
Miss Wang, it's a critical moment for the Beggars' Sect.

61
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,819
I'm not good at martial arts, but I can manage qinggong pretty well.

62
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:13,480
Shall I escort you away from here, first?

63
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,519
Thank you. But this matter is related to my cousin.

64
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,860
I want to stay and find out more.

65
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,980
Chief Qiao, why did you stab yourself with knives?

66
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,259
Welcome, Tan Gong and Tan Po of Taihang Mountain's Chongxiao Cave.

67
00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:53,260
Sorry for not welcoming you properly.

68
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,539
Chief Qiao, who's so bold to stab you with knives?

69
00:05:58,539 --> 00:05:59,980
I did it myself.

70
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,679
You did it yourself?

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Are you tired of living?

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,300
I'm fine. My skin is thick.

73
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,860
It won't harm the nerves and the bones.

74
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,039
What kind of lies is this?

75
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,140
I get it. You smart boy.

76
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,399
You knew Tan Gong had obtained the extremely effective medicine for injuries

77
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,620
made from the Northern Cold Jade and Dark Ice Toad.

78
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,960
And you wanted to try it.

79
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,880
It's good medicine.

80
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,179
What the heck? Xiao Juan.

81
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,219
[Zhao Qiansun]
Xiao Juan.

82
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,419
Senior, what pranks are you playing with?

83
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,660
I was wondering who it was.

84
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,140
It turns out to be you.

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,640
Xiao Juan, have you been happy lately?

86
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,540
The Five Heroes of Mount Tai are here.

87
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,739
What brings all five of you here?

88
00:07:24,739 --> 00:07:27,240
Greetings, Fourth Uncle Wu. All the seniors.

89
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,280
My father is here, too.

90
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,720
[Stern Faced Judge, Shan Zheng]
Chief Qiao, I, Stern Faced Judge, Shan Zheng, came uninvited.

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,380
Sorry for bringing any inconvenience.

92
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,020
Senior Shan, they are the Tan couple of Taihang Mountain's Chongxiao Cave.

93
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,300
I wonder if you know them?

94
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,700
I have long heard of your fame.

95
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,120
Nice to meet you.

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,000
This is...

97
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,300
Me? My name is Shuang Wai.

98
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,420
- My nickname... is Stern Bum Judge.
- You...

99
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,520
- What did you say?
- Master Shan, don't listen to his nonsense.

100
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,359
He's a lunatic. Don't take him seriously.

101
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:14,220
It's an honor to meet so many senior masters today.

102
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,620
May I know what you are here for?

103
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,679
Chief Qiao, your sect is the greatest sect in the martial arts world.

104
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,100
For hundreds of years, your sect's fame has spread all over the world.

105
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,480
- I feel happy for your sect.
- I'm flattered.

106
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,900
Chief Qiao, you're the greatest sect in the martial arts world.

107
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,479
For hundreds of years, your sect's fame has spread all over the world.

108
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,160
I also feel happy for your sect.

109
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,059
Bo Shan.

110
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,100
Father.

111
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,739
Tell Chief Qiao more about it.

112
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:55,979
If someone wants to learn from my son, just go ahead.

113
00:08:55,979 --> 00:09:00,639
Bo Shan, tell Chief Qiao more about it.

114
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,719
If someone wants to learn from my son, just go ahead.

115
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,960
Are you looking for death?

116
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,859
I'm not looking for death. I just can't figure it out.

117
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:12,620
It's more than enough to have four useless sons.

118
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,480
Why bother to have another one?

119
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,300
Father, he...

120
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,580
Master Tan, please introduce this senior to everyone

121
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,710
lest that we fail to show our courtesy.

122
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,679
I'm Zhao Qiansun. Greetings, Chief Qiao.

123
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,680
He's my senior.

124
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,820
Sir, I have never met you.

125
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,100
May I know how I have offended you?

126
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,620
You didn't offend me, of course.

127
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,500
But you offended Xiao Juan.

128
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,780
That's much worse than offending me.

129
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,540
Xiao Juan?

130
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,380
When did I offend Xiao Juan?

131
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,500
This is Xiao Juan.

132
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,359
Xiao Juan is her maiden name.

133
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,979
Besides me, no one can call her so.

134
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,980
Now I know it then.

135
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,059
Please forgive me if I have offended you.

136
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:29,999
But I never speak badly behind anyone's back.

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,399
I wonder how have I offended Madam Tan?

138
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,580
You don't know? I'll tell you then.

139
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,440
When I asked Xiao Juan if she had been happy lately,

140
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,079
your five precious sons appeared out of nowhere and interrupted my conversation.

141
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,979
Brother Shan, why didn't you ask around about who Xiao Juan is?

142
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:53,260
And who I am?

143
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,780
How could you interrupt our conversation?

144
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,860
Senior, what are you doing?

145
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,240
Don't you feel shameless in front of so many friends?

146
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,339
Back then, you left me and married the bastard, Tan Gong.

147
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,460
How could I not feel sad and hurt?

148
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,940
My heart is broken into shreds.

149
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,380
Why should I care about my dignity then?

150
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,399
Senior, stop mentioning the past.

151
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,500
The Beggars' Sect has an important matter to discuss today.

152
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,820
Be good and obedient.

153
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,859
Smile at me and I'll listen to you.

154
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,800
- Greetings, Young Master.
- Please rise, my brothers.

155
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,919
That's great, Young Master.

156
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,879
Fourth Brother and I didn't hear any news.

157
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,119
Hence, we planned to break into Shaolin to rescue you.

158
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,719
But now, you're already back.

159
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,279
I didn't kill Reverend Xuan Bei.

160
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,900
Hence, Shaolin wouldn't give me a hard time.

161
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,259
Brothers, why are you so panicked?

162
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,860
- Something happened to the Beggars' Sect.
- What?

163
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,400
With Qiao Feng around, what could have happened to the Beggars' Sect?

164
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,540
Everyone, the father and sons of the Shan family of Mount Tai,

165
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,299
the Tan couple of Taihang Mountain,

166
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:08,940
and this brother have come to pay a visit today.

167
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,959
All of us are honored to have your presence.

168
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,599
I have retired for years and no longer bother with worldly matters.

169
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,679
But there is an important matter today.

170
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,339
I have to exercise my seniority

171
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,639
and invite everyone to discuss it together

172
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,360
before any other matters.

173
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,980
Please welcome Mrs. Ma.

174
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm the widow of Ma. My maiden surname is Kang.

175
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,720
Greetings, Chief.

176
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,540
Greetings, Sister-in-Law.

177
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,119
Kang Min, tell us about the matter from the beginning.

178
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,020
My husband died an accidental death.

179
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,400
I can only blame it on my miserable life.

180
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,419
I hope Chief can help me to find the murderer

181
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,179
and avenge my late husband.

182
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:55,340
Unexpectedly, when I buried my late husband

183
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,440
and went through his belongings,

184
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,640
I found a will sealed with sealing wax.

185
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,740
I could see my late husband's handwriting

186
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,260
on the cover of the will.

187
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,299
When I saw it was written in a solemn tone,

188
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,120
I went to the chief immediately.

189
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,959
Fortunately, Chief and the elders

190
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,640
had gone to Jiangnan to avenge my late husband.

191
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,430
Hence, you haven't seen the letter yet.

192
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,580
What do you mean, Madam?

193
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,519
Is the will related to me?

194
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,199
The content is about an important matter of the sect.

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,479
Hence, I went to visit Elder Xu in Zhengzhou at once

196
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,999
and sought his advice.

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,280
I'll let Elder Xu explain further.

198
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,760
It revolves around vendetta.

199
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,640
It's hard on me, too.

200
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,820
This is Ma Dayuan's will.

201
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,439
"I'm protecting this letter under Chief Wang's will before he passed away.

202
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,359
This letter is supposed to be incinerated upon my death.

203
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,199
Otherwise, it's akin to destroying my remains.

204
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,220
I won't be able to rest in peace.

205
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,999
If I die an accidental death,

206
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,580
this letter should be handed to the elders of the sect.

207
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,259
It's a matter of great importance. Things have to be done as instructed."

208
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,599
It's indeed Dayuan's handwriting on the cover.

209
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,899
When Kang Min passed me the letter,

210
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,959
the sealing wax was unbroken.

211
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,080
I'm worried about further delays.

212
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,479
Hence, I didn't wait for the elders before opening the letter.

213
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,279
In fact, Stern Faced Judge Shan was also there.

214
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,879
He can be the witness.

215
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,599
What Elder Xu said is true.

216
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,919
I was at Elder Xu's residence in Zhengzhou at that moment.

217
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,919
I saw with my own eyes when Elder Xu opened the letter.

218
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,160
There are two letters in the envelope.

219
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,999
One letter was written by Chief Wang.

220
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,719
He mentioned if things go out of control,

221
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,639
we can ask the Shaolin Sect and the other comrades of the martial arts world for help.

222
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,859
As for the other, the strokes of the handwriting are sharp and strong.

223
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,239
It wasn't written by Chief Wang.

224
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,579
I saw that it was addressed to Brother Sword Beard.

225
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,320
That's indeed very strange.

226
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,120
Only good friends address each other that way.

227
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,020
When I checked the signature, I was shocked.

228
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,559
Brother Shan was curious and took a look, too.

229
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,000
He felt strange as well.

230
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,079
Brother Shan, how could you do this?

231
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,199
This is a secret letter of the Beggars' Sect.

232
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,919
You are not one of them.

233
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,720
How could you infringe on their privacy?

234
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,340
Zhao Qiansun, stop your nonsense.

235
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,299
I only saw the ending and the signature. I didn't see the content.

236
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:52,139
A person who peeks at other people's letters

237
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,179
isn't a gentleman but a petty man.

238
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,879
- A despicable scoundrel.
- You...

239
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,519
Senior, everyone is listening to Elder Xu for the serious matter.

240
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,619
Can you and Elder Shan stop arguing?

241
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,879
- How could you...
- You...!

242
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,718
What my senior said is none of your business.

243
00:17:09,718 --> 00:17:11,260
You...!

244
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,139
Everyone, I can't tell you who actually wrote this letter now.

245
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:26,118
I have been in the Beggars' Sect for over 70 years.

246
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:30,339
I have lived aloof for 30 years. I didn't engage in any fights or feuds.

247
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,679
I only have little time left to live.

248
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,479
I don't have any descendants or disciples.

249
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,620
I don't have any intention of personal interests.

250
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,800
Will you trust me if I tell you something?

251
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,319
When I read the letter,

252
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,159
I felt doubtful because it was a big issue.

253
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,979
I was afraid I had misinterpreted it.

254
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:07,359
Hence, I passed the letter to Brother Shan to have a look.

255
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,559
Brother Shan has a good relationship with the person who wrote the letter

256
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,199
and recognized his handwriting.

257
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,479
I asked Brother Shan to verify the authenticity of this letter.

258
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,679
What Elder Xu said is true.

259
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,359
I have known this person for years.

260
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,799
I also keep multiple handwritten letters of his at my residence.

261
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,779
Hence, I invited Elder Xu and Madam Ma to my residence

262
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,839
to verify it against the old letters.

263
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,759
We found the letterhead and the envelope were exactly the same.

264
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,900
I believe this letter is authentic.

265
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,299
I heard the Tan couple of Taihang Mountain

266
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,060
has a connection with the person who wrote the letter.

267
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,520
Hence, I went to Chongxiao Cave to seek their advice.

268
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:00,119
Mr. Tan and Madam Tan told me the twists and turns of what happened.

269
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,159
Madam Tan mentioned she has a senior

270
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,239
who is a witness to this matter,

271
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,599
which is Mr. Zhao Qiansun.

272
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,200
Mr. Zhao Qiansun, please tell everyone whether the content of the letter is true or not.

273
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,540
It's true.

274
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,340
It's a short letter with deep connotations.

275
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,959
Forty years ago, we studied and practiced together.

276
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,100
It was just like yesterday.

277
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,919
Looking back, although I have grown old now,

278
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,139
the look and the smile are still the same as they were in the past.

279
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,979
Senior, please tell us what happened back then.

280
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,560
I remember it clearly.

281
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,499
You had two braids with red strings.

282
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:52,619
Master was teaching us the trick in martial arts called Replace the Real with the Fake.

283
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:56,059
Senior, stop mentioning the past letters and matters.

284
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,699
Elder Xu is asking you about the battle in Luanshi Valley in Yanmen Pass.

285
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,239
You were involved in it personally.

286
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,820
What happened back then? Please tell everyone.

287
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,180
Out... Outside Yanmen Pass, before Luanshi Valley...

288
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,920
I... See you around.

289
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,700
Zhao Qiansun, why are you running away again after so many years?

290
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,140
Amitabha.

291
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,580
Reverend Zhi Guang.

292
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,759
We have not met for over 30 years.

293
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,799
You still look fresh and healthy.

294
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,299
Your presence here today is a blessing to the Beggars' Sect.

295
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,039
I can't appreciate it too much.

296
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,679
Together, Elder Xu of the Beggars' Sect

297
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,599
and Judge Shan of Taihang Mountain invited me here.

298
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,799
How could I refuse them?

299
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Reverend Zhi Guang was also at the battle.

300
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,700
Let him tell you about it.

301
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,140
There was too much killing. There was too much killing.

302
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,440
I feel shameful about it.

303
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,479
Everyone, it has been over 30 years since the Battle in Luanshi Valley.

304
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,719
Why bother to bring up the past?

305
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,839
Because there is a major change

306
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,980
in the sect due to a letter.

307
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,100
Better to reconcile with enemies, not to make more.

308
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,500
It's not worth mentioning it.

309
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,200
In my opinion, just destroy this letter.

310
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,800
Wipe out the traces and forget about it.

311
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Our deputy chief died tragically.

312
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,200
If we don't get to the bottom of it, Deputy Chief Ma will be aggrieved.

313
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,400
Our sect will also be in danger of falling apart.

314
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,200
I hope Reverend Zhi Guang will tell us everything you know

315
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,100
so we can make a decision.

316
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,200
All right, then.

317
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,700
I did something wrong back then.

318
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,900
I don't have to hide from it.

319
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,600
I'll tell you as it is.

320
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,400
Reverend Zhi Guang, we did it for our country and our people.

321
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
How can it be considered as wrongdoing?

322
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
What is wrong is wrong.

323
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,900
Let's stop deceiving ourselves and others.

324
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,000
Thirty years ago, heroes of the Central Plains received a piece of news

325
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,700
that a group of warriors from the Khitan Kingdom would be attacking Shaolin Temple

326
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,500
to snatch all the martial arts manuals that had been kept at Shaolin Temple for hundreds of years.

327
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,800
The Khitan warriors were quite ambitious, weren't they?

328
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,600
If the martial arts secrets of Shaolin Temple were taken

329
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,400
and mastered by their army,

330
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,600
the Song Dynasty wouldn't be able

331
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,000
to win against them on the battlefield.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,800
That's right.

333
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
We knew how critical it would be.

334
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,700
We heard that the Khitan warriors would pass by Yanmen Pass.

335
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,900
Hence, everyone rushed to Yanmen Pass to attack them there.

336
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,000
Even if we couldn't wipe them out,

337
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,200
it would at least jeopardize their plot.

338
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,300
Chief Qiao, if you were to receive such news,

339
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,800
what would you do?

340
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,100
I would lead my sect to stop them.

341
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,600
Hence, in your opinion,

342
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,200
it was the right decision to ambush the Khitans back then?

343
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I admired the heroic acts of the seniors.

344
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,800
I wish I could be born 30 years earlier

345
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,800
and fought together with them without hesitation.

346
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,600
What Chief Qiao said is very true.

347
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,800
It was exactly the same as we thought back then.

348
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,800
We separated into groups.

349
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,400
This gentleman and I were in the first batch.

350
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,500
There were 21 of us.

351
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,800
Our batch was made up of the best martial artists of that time.

352
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
I wasn't a monk back then.

353
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,800
I didn't deserve a position amongst the heroes.

354
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,500
I was only contributing a small effort

355
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,600
in helping my country to eliminate the enemies.

356
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
Then... what happened next?

357
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,400
Did you manage to get there in time?

358
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,000
Yes, we did.

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,600
Traveling nonstop,

360
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,800
we managed to get to Yanmen Pass.

361
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,400
This matter was related to the survival of Song

362
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,000
and the lives of tens of millions of our people.

363
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,800
But we weren't absolutely confident in winning the battle.

364
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Our only advantage was

365
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,100
the enemies were in the open while we were in the dark.

366
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:31,900
In that case, what do you think should be done, Chief Qiao?

367
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,700
The enemies were in the open, while we were in the dark. There can never be too much deception in war.

368
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,400
At such a moment, we should disregard martial arts etiquette and rules.

369
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,600
Well said.

370
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,400
We had the same thought back then.

371
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,200
Under the command of our respective leader,

372
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,400
we laid in ambush with hidden weapons on both sides of the mountain path.

373
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,100
After one night, a group of Khitan warriors

374
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,800
indeed walked past as the news said they would.

375
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,000
And we wiped out all 19 of them.

376
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,200
We were overjoyed yet confused.

377
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,500
Why were the Khitans so weak?

378
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,300
Could it be fake news?

379
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,700
Or could it be a trap set by the Khitans to lure us into it?

380
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,000
We were thinking about whether we should continue with the ambush.

381
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,800
We didn't expect...

382
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
No!

383
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
Did the barbarian Khitans kill the leader?

384
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,800
What happened next was even more unpredictable.

385
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
It was inconceivable.

386
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,400
He captured our leader and Chief Wang

387
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,000
and killed everyone else.

388
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,300
Logically speaking, he should have charged forward.

389
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
But who knows...

390
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,300
But who knew... the Khitan carved many Khitan scripts

391
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,000
on the stone wall with his blade.

392
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,400
Then, he jumped off the cliff and committed suicide.

393
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,000
What's more surprising was that he left a baby behind.

394
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Wasn't the child dead?

395
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
I thought the same, too.

396
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,400
I only realized later that the child fell to the ground after the Khitan's wife died.

397
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,000
His breath was only blocked out temporarily.

398
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,800
He didn't die.

399
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,400
Grieving over his wife and his child,

400
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,500
the Khitan man jumped off the cliff, holding the bodies of his wife and his child.

401
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,800
When the child felt the shock, he woke up,

402
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
he burst out crying...

403
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,500
The Khitan couldn't bear to let his son die with him in the valley.

404
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,400
Hence, he threw the child up.

405
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,200
Coincidentally, the child landed in Chief Wang's arms

406
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,000
and didn't get hurt.

407
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,900
Such wit and martial arts skills

408
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,800
were quite awesome.

409
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,000
I saw how my brothers died tragically.

410
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,800
I initially wanted to leave the child in the wild and let him fend for himself.

411
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,700
But the child burst into tears.

412
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,400
His small face got red from crying,

413
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,200
and he stared at me with his bright, black eyes.

414
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
My heart softened for a moment

415
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
and I couldn't bear to be so vicious to him.

416
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
The Khitans killed countless Han people.

417
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,200
Did they ever go soft on our babies and women?

418
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
They killed them, why can't we?

419
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,600
- That's right.
- Why can't we kill theirs?

420
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
What happened next?

421
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,500
I was afraid the Khitans reinforcement would arrive soon.

422
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,600
Hence, I took the baby and returned to Yanmen Pass.

423
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,400
The leader and Chief Wang

424
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,800
were worried that the Khitan warriors would attack Shaolin Temple.

425
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,200
They immediately rushed back to Yanmen Pass and checked on it.

426
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,700
They found that there were only 17 remains

427
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,800
of our martyred brothers.

428
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,700
There was one remain less.

429
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,400
We thought he must have fallen into Luanshi Valley during the fight.

430
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,600
I felt that the Khitan characters carved on the stone wall

431
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,600
carried deep meaning.

432
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,200
So I copied the script down

433
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
and found someone to translate it into Chinese.

434
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
I was shocked at what it revealed.

435
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,600
If the words were true,

436
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,800
then what we just did was a grave mistake.

437
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:02,700
To verify whether the carved words were true or not,

438
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,400
we could only wait and see if there were any other Khitan warriors

439
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,500
who would come to Shaolin to snatch the secret manuals.

440
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:15,400
The three of us rushed back to Shaolin Temple nonstop.

441
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,800
We saw that many heroes had arrived there.

442
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,500
As this involved the lives of tens of millions of people,

443
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,300
everyone wanted to do something about it.

444
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,900
However, from the ninth day of the ninth month to the twelfth lunar month,

445
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,800
there was no sign of the Khitans.

446
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Could it be fake news?

447
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,400
Hence, we went to look for the messenger to ask him.

448
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,200
But we couldn't find him at all.

449
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,800
Only then did we realize that it was fake news.

450
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,200
It turned out that we had been fooled.

451
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,800
Based on what you said,

452
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:46,000
those who died in the battle of Yanmen Pass suffered an unjust death.

453
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,400
Yes, indeed.

454
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,600
Not long after, the Khitan cavalry invaded us.

455
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
And we stopped struggling with the matter.

456
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,700
But later, it was a tricky matter on what to do with the child.

457
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,100
Since we had harmed his parents,

458
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,400
we couldn't cause any more harm to the child.

459
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,800
But if we were to raise him up ourselves,

460
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,600
we were afraid he would take revenge.

461
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,900
We discussed it for quite some time.

462
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,000
At last, the leader gave some taels

463
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,600
to a farmer family at the foot of Shaoshi Mountain and asked them to adopt him.

464
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,300
He requested them to claim him as the child's biological parents.

465
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,500
Even if the child had grown up,

466
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,000
he can't know that he was adopted.

467
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,400
The farmer had no children.

468
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,100
So he agreed to it happily.

469
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:35,500
How would they know that the child was a Khitan?

470
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,800
Reverend Zhi Guang,

471
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,700
what is the surname of the farmer?

472
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,900
The farmer...

473
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,600
is called Qiao Sanhuai.

474
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,880
Nonsense!

475
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,640
Chief Qiao!

476
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,340
I'm a Han!

477
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,800
Amitabha.

478
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,140
I'm Qiao Feng from the foot of Shaoshi Mountain.

479
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,060
Qiao Sanhuai is my biological father!

480
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,400
Chief Qiao! You can't do that!

481
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,679
Chief Qiao, take it easy.

482
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:59,759
There is no feud between you and my family.

483
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,239
Please let my son go.

484
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,920
Chief Qiao,

485
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,759
Reverend Zhi Guang is well-respected in the martial arts world.

486
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,060
You can't hurt him.

487
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,680
You want nothing more than me stepping down as the chief.

488
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,620
Why bother to cook up stories to frame me?

489
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,440
What have I done wrong?

490
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,940
Why do you have to push me to the corner?

491
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,560
Chief Qiao, both the Hans and the Khitans are common people. There is no difference between the two.

492
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,279
You're a Khitan. Why do you call yourself a Han?

493
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,319
You don't even dare to claim your own biological parents.

494
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,020
How could you regard yourself as a hero?

495
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,360
Who are you calling a Khitan?

496
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,719
I don't know if you're really a Khitan.

497
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,199
I'll never forget the battle of Yanmen Pass

498
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:49,120
and how that person looked like, even if another hundred years pass!

499
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,079
Coincidentally, that person looked exactly like you.

500
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,040
I was the missing corpse back then.

501
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,100
Because I was afraid of the Khitans,

502
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,140
I sneaked away after I awakened from unconsciousness.

503
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,099
I'm a walking dead.

504
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:58,000
The only concern I have in this world is Xiao Juan.

505
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,839
It's none of my business whether you're the Chief of the Beggars' Sect or not.

506
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,519
Why would I frame you?

507
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,319
I admit that I killed your parents.

508
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,540
What good is in it to me?

509
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:53,900
You already know what happened after that.

510
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,220
When you were seven...

511
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,819
If you come any nearer, don't blame me for my ruthlessness!

512
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:06,339
Call me Big Brother. Follow us from now on.

513
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:07,919
We'll have a great life together.

514
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,080
Shut up! Even if I fall off and die, I won't do bad deeds with you.

515
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,079
Jump and I'll believe you.

516
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,360
Watch me then.

517
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,040
- Go ahead.
- I'll be reborn to be an upright man 20 years later.

518
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,440
A Shaolin monk saved you.

519
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,219
Later, he taught you martial arts every day. Am I right?

520
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,159
Master, please accept a bow from your disciple.

521
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,080
How did you know?

522
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,279
Actually, the Shaolin monk

523
00:37:39,279 --> 00:37:44,900
was entrusted by the leader to raise you up

524
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,160
so you wouldn't go astray.

525
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,220
Because of this, the three of us had a dispute.

526
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,079
I advocated that you live a smooth farm life instead.

527
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,140
But the leader said that we had harmed your parents.

528
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,400
So we must raise you into a hero.

529
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,079
The will on the stone wall of Yanmen Pass is still there.

530
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:11,660
Go and take a look one day.

531
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,839
When you were 16,

532
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,519
Chief Wang officially accepted you as his disciple.

533
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,919
- You're Qiao Feng?
- Yes.

534
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:22,139
- Why do you practice martial arts?
- I want to carry out righteousness.

535
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,399
How?

536
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,639
A true hero should serve his country and his people.

537
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,479
Reverend Xuan Ku has a unique insight indeed.

538
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,060
Good.

539
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,119
You'll become a disciple of the Beggars' Sect

540
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,839
and my disciple today.

541
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,439
Many coincidences occurred after that.

542
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,379
You have outstanding talent and have always strived for progress.

543
00:38:42,379 --> 00:38:45,620
You're indeed remarkable.

544
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:50,119
But if it weren't for the continuous guidance from the leader and Chief Wang,

545
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,260
it wouldn't be so easy for you.

546
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,700
If what you said is true,

547
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,359
then Chief Wang wasn't the person who saved my life

548
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:01,800
but the person who killed my parents.

549
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,520
The hero who secretly helped me back then

550
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,519
didn't mean to help me at all.

551
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,279
He only did it out of guilt

552
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,319
and wanted to atone for his sin.

553
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,280
At first, Chief Wang was quite wary of you.

554
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,520
But when he saw your speedy progress in martial arts,

555
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,980
your heroic manner,

556
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,280
and your kindness,

557
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,720
he started to like you more.

558
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,580
Later, your great achievements and fame

559
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,279
had brought the Beggars' Sect to its glory.

560
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,180
The chief position was within your grasp.

561
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,640
But Chief Wang couldn't make up his mind.

562
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,479
He gave you three difficult challenges.

563
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,399
You solved all of them and attained seven great achievements.

564
00:39:52,399 --> 00:39:56,959
At his death bed, he passed Dog-Beating Stick down to you

565
00:39:56,959 --> 00:39:59,960
and officially appointed you Chief of the Beggars' Sect.

566
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,799
For hundreds of years, no one besides you succeeded as chief with such difficulties.

567
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,440
After you took over as the chief,

568
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,939
you've been righteous and fair.

569
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:25,120
The Beggars' Sect was prosperous in your hands.

570
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,340
And you had also jeopardized the Khitan's plots many times.

571
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,020
We realized we had been worried needlessly.

572
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,080
I thought this matter wouldn't be brought up again.

573
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,660
I wondered who brought it up again today.

574
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,100
Thank you, Reverend Zhi Guang, for recounting the past

575
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,520
so everyone could feel it as if we were there.

576
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,359
This letter was written by the leader to Chief Wang.

577
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:02,020
In the letter, he tried his best to persuade Chief Wang

578
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,959
not to pass his position to Chief Qiao.

579
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,919
Chief Qiao, why don't you take a look yourself?

580
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:11,840
I'll have a look.

581
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,380
I'll see whether it's true or not.

582
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,880
What are you doing?

583
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,860
Now that you already know about your true birth identity,

584
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,160
I'm sure you would want to avenge your parents.

585
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,220
Now, Chief Wang has passed away.

586
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,420
And I won't tell you the name of the leader.

587
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,959
I was involved in the ambush.

588
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,459
I'm willing to bear all the sins alone.

589
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:05,820
Kill me or cut me up.

590
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,300
Go ahead as you please.

591
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,240
Yes, I was involved too.

592
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,260
You must also count me in.

593
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,979
You may take action anytime you like.

594
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,160
Chief Qiao, please reconsider it.

595
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:45,140
Don't be reckless.

596
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:47,319
If you stir things up between the Hu and the Han,

597
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,379
all the people of the martial arts world of the Central Plains will become your enemy.

598
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,820
Stir things up between the Hu and the Han?

599

"Gain merits by killing and capturing the enemies.

I am giving you this fan.

630
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,300
He is not one of us. He has no loyalty to us.
