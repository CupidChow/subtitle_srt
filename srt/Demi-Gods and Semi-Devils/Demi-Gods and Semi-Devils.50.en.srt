[Episode 50]

13
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,100
Brother-in-law.

14
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,900
Brother-in-law, what happened?

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
Brother-in-law.

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,600
Hurry up.

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,900
Hurry.

18
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,700
Run. I've been poisoned.

19
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,800
Hurry.

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,100
What happened to you?

21
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,600
We're being chased.

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,800
I can't use my internal force now.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Just leave me.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, we leave together.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
They won't harm me.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,600
You should run now.

27
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,500
Brother-in-law, it's my fault.

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,900
I made a mistake. I poisoned you.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,100
- What?
- The empress gave me a potion.

30
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,200
She lied to me and said that

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
if I made you drink it,

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,400
you'd be in love with me forever and ever.

33
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,800
- Run.
- I poisoned you.

34
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
I will die with you.

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Run now!

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,400
Don't move!

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,100
Let go of my brother-in-law!

38
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,600
Pardon us, Your Highness.

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,800
We were just following orders.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,200
Release her. It's me you're after.

41
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,400
I will go with you.

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
Let her go.

43
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,600
Please.

44
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
Let's go.

45
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Brother-in-law!

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,300
Brother-in-law, I'll find someone to save you.

47
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,800
Any wine?

48
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Prepare wine for King Xiao!

49
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,700
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Yes?

51
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,700
After a few days of imprisonment,

52
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,000
King Xiao remains as headstrong as ever.

53
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
I knew it.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
This brother of mine is boisterous and obstinate.

55
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,400
Once he has made up his mind,

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,200
no one can persuade him otherwise.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
Did he grow suspicious?

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
Not at all. King Xiao was just drinking in the cage.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,100
Everything seems normal.

60
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,800
Keep him company and give him wine every day.

61
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,100
Don't let him grow suspicious.

62
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,600
Noted.

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,500
I hereby announce that

64
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,600
I will personally lead the army tomorrow at noon

65
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,500
to fulfill the dream of our ancestors.

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,200
The Song Dynasty shall fall.

67
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Duly noted, Your Majesty.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,700
His Majesty has been nothing but kind to you, King Xiao.

69
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,800
You shouldn't let him down anymore.

70
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
I hope you can change your mind

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,800
and help His Majesty to accomplish historical feats.

72
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,560
That's how you should repay his kindness.

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Here, here.

74
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
His Majesty knows me very well.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,800
I am not easily swayed.

76
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Why is he so sentimental that

77
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,400
he sent you guys to persuade me?

78
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,700
I...

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
His Majesty still cares about the brotherhood you two share

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,500
and he still hopes that you can come back to him.

81
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,400
Brotherhood, you said?

82
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,500
Wine and food and some brainwashers here.

83
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,200
His Majesty is trying to buy more time, isn't he?

84
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,600
He incarcerated me but I'm still yet to receive my sentence.

85
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,900
I suppose he wants to conquer Song himself

86
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,000
and brandishes it in front of me.

87
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,800
He will tell me how even without my help,

88
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,000
he can still devour Song.

89
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,400
If His Majesty manages to conquer Song without much resistance,

90
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,400
he will release me and we'll meet at Bianliang.

91
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,100
If he loses the war,

92
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,000
the first person he will want to kill will be me.

93
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,300
Let's go.

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,000
We have an assassin!

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
Assa...

96
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,800
As expected from the renowned Mr. Xiao.

97
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,300
One flick of the hand and everyone dies.

98
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,000
Fire!

99
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
The ones in there, listen carefully.

100
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,100
All eyes are on Xiao Feng.

101
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,600
If he moves an inch, kill him straight away.

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
All right.

103
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Hurry up. Lock the door.

104
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,400
Lock the door!

105
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Hurry!

106
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,200
The emperor wanted me to ask you,

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
what you would do if someone

108
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,100
came to free you from a pinch?

109
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
In that case,

110
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,500
I, Xiao Feng, will replay his kindness with my life.

111
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Really?

112
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,800
It's me, Brother-in-law. I'm A'Zi.

113
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,000
I told you I would come and save you.

114
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,200
No need to bring me alcohol next time.

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,000
Anyway, I will take your word for it.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,800
Fine. Hurry up.

117
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,000
Open this cage and we'll leave together.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,700
There are so many people outside.

119
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,400
Let's flee using another method.

120
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Where's the key?

121
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,800
Stay in there.

122
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
A'Zi, what are you doing?

123
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,500
Brother-in-law, didn't we agree that

124
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,300
we would spend the rest of our life together?

125
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,700
Stop fooling around, A'Zi. Let's get out now.

126
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Don't worry. I have a brilliant idea.

127
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,700
Don't move.

128
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
After them.

129
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,300
Hurry up. Over there.

130
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,800
- Brother!
- Third Brother.

131
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Thank you for rescuing me.

132
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
- Are you injured?
- I'm fine.

133
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,100
Brother Qiao, you owe your life to A'Zi.

134
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,500
What? The Liao Emperor imprisoned my eldest brother?

135
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,000
He was poisoned and they caught him.

136
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
I managed to escape.

137
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Brother, please save him.

138
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Please save him. Send out the troops.

139
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,300
If you do, he'll be safe. Please.

140
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
A'Zi, calm down.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
The Song-Liao relationship is fragile.

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
One wrong move and a chain reaction might occur.

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,500
If I send out the troops all of a sudden,

144
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,300
they might kill him straight away before I can rescue him.

145
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,500
What should we do? What should we do?

146
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,200
We need to devise a meticulous plan.

147
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,699
Not only did Sister A'Zi travel south to look for me,

148
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,399
she also went to the Lingjiu Palace to look for Second Brother.

149
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,000
She even sought help from the elders of the Beggars' Sect.

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,100
Everyone came to save you.

151
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,500
I told you I would save you.

152
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,500
It's a Jurchen bullhorn.

153
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,300
Yes. Wanyan Aguda is here, too.

154
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,800
You even asked Brother Aguda to come here?

155
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
They are fighting the Liao army by the East Gate now.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,300
King Xiao, the enemies are abound here.

157
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,600
Let's leave first.

158
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,200
Let's go.

159
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
Big Brother!

160
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Second Brother.

161
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
It's only right that I come to help you when you're in danger.

162
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Thank you, Brother.

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,900
Chief Qiao!

164
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,700
Elder Wu. Chief Qiao.

165
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,200
As per the request of the entire Beggars' Sect,

166
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,600
I shall return the Dog-beating Stick to you, Chief Qiao.

167
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,200
Stand up, Elder Wu.

168
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,700
Chief, I appreciate your offer

169
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,400
but I cannot be the Chief of Beggars' Sect.

170
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,100
Chief, we were misled by dishonest men.

171
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,000
We exiled you just because you aren't a Han.

172
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,200
We received a missive from the Dali Duan family several days ago

173
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,000
and we were told that you were incarcerated

174
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,200
because you tried to stop Liao from invading Song.

175
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,700
All Elders are moved by your moral integrity, Chief,

176
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,000
so we used the Bamboo Trinket

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,300
and mobilized all fighters of the Central Plains to come to your rescue.

178
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Everyone, you forgave my previous deeds

179
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
and traveled far to save me.

180
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,100
I will never forget the generosity you showed today.

181
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,800
Chief, you're too humble.

182
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,900
What happened in the past was all due to misunderstandings.

183
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,900
You forsook your own safety for the millions of lives on the Central Plains.

184
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,400
We should be the ones thanking you, Chief Qiao.

185
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,000
- I agree!
- Thank you, Chief Qiao.

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,900
Thank you, Chief Qiao.

187
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
Brother Qiao, the recon soldier came and reported that

188
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,000
Yelv Hongji and his army are stationed 10 Chinese miles in front of Yanmen Pass.

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,500
Their invasion is imminent.

190
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh no! Since His Majesty is leading the army, they will go all out.

191
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,800
The Yanmen Pass is in danger.

192
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
I need to be there to stop them.

193
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,400
Heroes and warriors,

194
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I thank you for your help.

195
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,000
I have to leave now.

196
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,400
Thanks again for rescuing me.

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,400
Big Brother, let me join you.

198
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,100
Big Brother, I want to join you too.

199
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,300
Together with Chief against the Liao!

200
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
All right then, let's go.

201
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
Go!

202
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
The Liao Emperor is leading the army.

203
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,500
They sure look imposing.

204
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,200
Yanmen Pass doesn't have a lot of guards.

205
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,800
How can they defend themselves?

206
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
The Liao deployed all of their elite soldiers.

207
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,600
It seems blood will be shed again.

208
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,100
No need to fear him.

209
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,600
If we all came, we didn't plan to go home alive!

210
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,000
We will give our all to fight

211
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,200
and show them what the Song people are made of.

212
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Yes!

213
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,400
We learn martial arts to protect our family and our nation.

214
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
When else should we fight if not now?

215
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,700
Let's fight with all our might.

216
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,900
Kill one and it will be an even trade.

217
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,400
Kill two and it will be a victory.

218
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,000
Even if our blood will smear the desert and our body will lay here,

219
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
we fear nothing.

220
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,100
- To hell with them!
- To hell with them!

221
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,700
Heroes, settle down.

222
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,800
Don't worry, Big Brother.

223
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,800
The 72 Islands and 36 Caves under the Lingjiu Palace are sending backup here.

224
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,600
They will arrive shortly.

225
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,300
My dear brothers.

226
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,300
Please help me contain our forces.

227
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,200
Don't let them fight recklessly.

228
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Big Brother, what do you mean?

229
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,000
- Big Brother.
- Do not forget.

230
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Great Prince of the South Palace?

231
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Shouldn't he be locked up in the South Palace?

232
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,700
Why did Chief charge into the Liao camp alone?

233
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,800
- Let's help him!
- Elder Wu.

234
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,000
Be patient.

235
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,700
Without his order, we are to stay put.

236
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Did he decide to surrender to them

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,200
upon seeing their immense military forces?

238
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If Chief was a coward,

239
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,600
then he would never cross the Liao Emperor and be imprisoned.

240
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,400
If anyone says that again,

241
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
I'll fight you.

242
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,300
Silence!

243
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
- Your Majesty.
-  Did you come for revenge?

244
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,700
No.

245
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,800
I know you have your reason to do what you did, Your Majesty.

246
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,239
The Khitan blood flows within me

247
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,359
but the Song raised me.

248
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,179
You don't want me to witness the war between the Song and the Liao, and that's why you imprisoned me.

249
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,059
In this case, why did you come here?

250
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,180
I was lucky to have rescued you several times, Your Majesty.

251
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,199
You do not mind my lowly origin

252
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,240
and decided to call me your brother.

253
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,199
You granted me half of the land

254
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,580
and gave me a good job with a high salary.

255
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,999
Your intention was kind

256
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,080
but through my cozy life,

257
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,880
I saw incessant conflicts.

258
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,900
The elderly lost their children.

259
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,930
The wives lost their husbands.

260
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,140
The children lost their parents.

261
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,360
It happened to the Liao...

262
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,880
and it also happened to the Song.

263
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,340
Once I conquer all nations, everyone in Liao

264
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,840
will live a peaceful and affluent life.

265
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,640
If you had been less of a warmonger,

266
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,140
we would have all been living in peace now.

267
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,480
Liao and Song would be able to enjoy peace.

268
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Victory can only be forged by bloodshed.

269
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,319
The end justifies the means.

270
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,400
In that case, pardon my means.

271
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,019
Great! Nice one, Hero Xiao!

272
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,039
Kill him! Kill the Liao Emperor.

273
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,240
Kill him!

274
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,839
Without Big Brother order, we will stay put!

275
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,440
Brother,

276
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,500
you once saw how I captured the Prince of Chu alive.

277
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,540
Can we speak properly this time?

278
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,359
You have been captured by me.

279
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,000
According to the Liao rules,

280
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,720
you can only free yourself with money.

281
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,720
I haven't said what I want from you yet.

282
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,620
What do you want?

283
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,500
On behalf of the Song and Liao citizens,

284
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,560
I want you to promise that...

285
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,660
as long as you're alive,

286
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,520
you will never send any soldier across the Song-Liao boundary.

287
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,180
My brother.

288
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,860
Even if you kill me now,

289
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,259
millions of my men will trample the Yanmen Pass.

290
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,360
I am always full of myself.

291
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,519
I call myself a hero.

292
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,890
A hero...

293
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,800
serves the nation and the people.

294
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,300
As long as I'm alive,

295
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,180
I cannot watch you attack the Song empire.

296
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,320
Can you stop putting me in a tough spot?

297
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,839
Expanding our territory is Liao's duty.

298
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,059
You have Liao's blood within you

299
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,150
but you called our enemy your father.

300
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,800
That's infidelity.

301
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,659
You threaten your brother, that's disrespect.

302
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:28,420
You called yourself a hero.

303
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,720
Is that the hero's code for you?

304
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,260
My brother, you and I are brothers by name.

305
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,399
We live and die together.

306
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,540
You own half of what I own.

307
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,280
It's yours.

308
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,260
During that brotherhood ritual,

309
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,720
we swore an oath.

310
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
Together, we share everything.

311
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,640
Your life is mine.

312
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,480
My life is yours, too.

313
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,120
Brother.

314
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,260
Take care.

315
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,960
Big Brother.

316
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,919
I saved the Liao Emperor twice.

317
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,559
He and I call each other brothers.

318
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,740
He gave me half of the land.

319
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,999
He appointed me as the Great Prince of the South Palace.

320
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,980
Heroes and warriors, listen carefully.

321
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,200
My brother, Yelv Hongji, gave me his words that

322
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,199
as long as he's alive,

323
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,380
he'd never send any soldier across the Song-Liao boundary.

324
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,720
I am a Khitan.

325
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,140
I am the Great Prince of the South Palace.

326
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,840
However, I defy orders repeatedly.

327
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,580
That's disloyalty. I forgot my Han upbringing

328
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,640
and chased after wealth and status in Liao,

329
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,100
that's infidelity.

330
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:08,920
I killed my peers due to personal vendetta

331
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,320
and murdered my wife.

332
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,940
That's cruelty.

333
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,870
I threatened my brother,

334
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,380
that's disrespect.

335
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:29,359
I am a sinner, disloyal, cruel, and disrespectful.

336
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,300
I have no right to be your brother anymore.

337
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,159
From now on, you don't owe me anything.

338
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,200
May this reunion be our last.

339
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,399
I hope that you will think of the innocent

340
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,519
and stop waging wars.

341
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,240
No more bloodshed!

342
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,359
Brother!

343
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,000
- Big Brother!
- Big Brother!

344
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Big Brother.

345
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,040
Retreat!

346
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,660
Big Brother.

347
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,840
Big Brother.

348
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,839
Brother-in-law!

349
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,400
Brother-in-law! Brother-in-law.

350
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,520
Are you okay?

351
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,920
Tell me you'll be fine.

352
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,340
You won't abandon me, right?

353
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,040
You can't die here, Brother-in-law.

354
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:39,379
Brother-in-law, you promised Sister A'Zhu that you'd look after me.

355
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,839
Did you forget about that?

356
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,479
You don't want me anymore?

357
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,140
Open your eyes!

358
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,920
Brother-in-law...

359
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,240
Why...

360
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,020
A'Zi!

361
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,920
A'Zi!

362
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,260
Miss A'Zi.

363
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,679
Miss A'Zi! Miss A'Zi.

364
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:28,079
A'Zi.

365
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,760
Isn't he the Chief of the Beggars' Sect, Zhuang Juxian?

366
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,880
What chief? He's a laughing stock.

367
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,959
A'Zi, I heard you came to rescue someone.

368
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,320
I was worried about you so I came here straight away.

369
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,479
How are you? Are you all right?

370
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:45,259
Did anyone bully you? I'll kill that person now.

371
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,900
I am now with my brother-in-law.

372
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,639
I can never be happier.

373
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,920
He won't ask someone to bully me anymore.

374
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,940
Leave. Leave now!

375
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:01,560
I don't want to see you anymore!

376
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,980
You don't want to see me anymore?

377
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,379
Yes. You gave me your eyes.

378
00:32:13,379 --> 00:32:17,340
My brother-in-law said I am indebted to you.

379
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,360
But I hate owing you anything.

380
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,520
A'Zi.

381
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,519
- A'Zi.
- A'Zi!

382
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,159
Don't do it.

383
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,360
A'Zi.

384
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,000
Take back your eyes.

385
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,620
We don't owe anyone anymore.

386
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,919
- Big Brother!
- A'Zi!

387
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,320
I used to pierce you with poisonous needles

388
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,000
because I wanted to be forever with you.

389
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,200
Now, we're forever together.

390
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,760
Your Majesty, frequent wars over these ten years

391
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,859
have taken a heavy toll on our army.

392
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:53,480
If we hadn't waged wars every year,

393
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,739
the Prince of Chu would have never been able to take advantage of our opening.

394
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:01,880
The sacrifice of King Xiao was not for the Song Dynasty

395
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:06,520
but also for the Khitans.

396
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,820
Really?

397
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,820
Bring me wine.

398
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,500
My brother, I will use this wine to commemorate you today.

399
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,879
A gentleman never takes his words back.

400
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:30,040
I will never step foot in Song territory

401
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,940
to help you fulfill your dying wish.

402
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,439
- Take care.
- Take care.

403
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:47,259
What are you staring at? Let's go.

404
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,779
- Have mercy.
- You again?

405
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:54,220
Take this.

406
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,420
Okay. Leave now.

407
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,300
Eat it.

408
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,599
- This again?
- I won't eat it.

409
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:09,619
Your Majesty, you're patrolling in civilian clothing.

410
00:36:09,619 --> 00:36:11,680
We can't spend lavishly.

411
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,400
Patrolling in civilian clothing?

412
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,119
The Yan nation has just been rebuilt.

413
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,979
We need to reorganize everything from the ground up and recuperate.

414
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:23,320
No lavish spending, indeed!

415
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,410
[Yan Nation]

416
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,720
[Yanzi House]

417
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,760
Delicious.

418
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,160
I want to eat this, too.

419
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,540
The revival of Yan has always been an unrealistic goal.

420
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:38,500
But I have never seen him this happy before.

421
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,380
Dear cousin, if you don't want to wake up,

422
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,840
then please live in your dream.

423
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,939
Chief You could never get A'Zi.

424
00:37:58,939 --> 00:38:01,419
A'Zi could never get Brother Xiao.

425
00:38:01,419 --> 00:38:04,780
Brother Xiao could never get A'Zhu.

426
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,219
The one who sought vengeance

427
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:12,100
sacrificed himself to end civil unrest.

428
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,700
The one who sought a relaxed life

429
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,280
became a wise ruler.

430
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,159
The one who sought great achievements

431
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,240
caved under his obsession and went insane.

432
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,119
The one who sought to be a monk

433
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,720
was still bound by material gains.

434
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,479
As the saying goes, life is ever-changing.

435
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:42,880
Everything can be considered as your training.

436
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,119
From now on,  I shall let go of my desire

437
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,540
and face the real world.

438
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,100
What will happen, will happen.

439
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,560
What will be gone, will be gone.

440
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,840
Joy and justice,

441
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,799
appreciate them while you can.

442
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,679
Improve yourself

443
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:08,520
and make this world a better place.

444
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,640
Back then, I longed for Buddhist texts and wisdom

445
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,400
but I was bestowed great martial arts.

446
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,439
I yearned for romantic relationships

447
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,940
but moral codes still bound me.

448
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,719
I once had an authentic, profound brotherhood

449
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,519
but at the end, Big Brother died

450
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,480
and Second Brother went somewhere else.

451
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,340
As my parents showered me with love,

452
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,799
all I wanted was to become a worry-free heir

453
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,320
and enjoy life.

454
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:14,459
But now, I witnessed the death of my parents

455
00:40:14,459 --> 00:40:18,460
and I have to become the ruler responsible for my citizens.

456
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,359
If what I seek still eludes me,

457
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,560
then I shall accept whatever will come to me.

458
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,380
Perhaps, every form is but an illusion.

459
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,899
Perhaps life and death, reunion and parting,

460
00:40:36,899 --> 00:40:40,319
love and hate, joy and sadness,

461
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,420
they are all kleshas and uncertainties.

462
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,819
Perhaps, true fulfillment is

463
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:53,059
to do what you want to do

464
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:57,200
for the rest of your life.

Have you let go of him?

471
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,300
Long ago.

472
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,719
If you have truly let go of him, you won't even know who I was referring to.

473
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,360
As observant as always, Bhikkhuni.

474
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,860
He was once my lover

475
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,560
but he killed the one who loved me the most.

476
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,780
Please take me in, Bhikkhuni

477
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,600
so that I can be emancipated from this pain.
