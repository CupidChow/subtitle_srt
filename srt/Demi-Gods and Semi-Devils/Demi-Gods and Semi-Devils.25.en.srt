She's lying underground all by herself.

I can't bring her past the Pass

to hunt, shepherd the sheep, ride horses, and sing out loud anymore.

21

The promise we made together cannot be fulfilled anymore.

No.

23

Madam Ma doesn't know him.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,119
She is the widow of an uncultured man.

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,460
And he is a prince.

32
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,959
What grudges could there be between them?

33
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,900

Mother, this is the place.

37
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,939
That lowly woman is not very good at martial arts. But she's cunning.

Mother, are you okay?

Young lady,

51
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,119
you'd better stop using such a vicious hidden weapon after this.

52
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,300
If you meet someone who is more powerful in martial arts,

53
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,860

54
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,980

Please kill me.

56
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,559
Even if I kill you, it won't revive my pitiful Zhu'er.

57
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:41,419
You said that Duan did something guilty that ruined the life of a child.

You were right.

60
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,059
But if you want to uphold justice, you should kill Prince Duan and me.

61
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:53,720
Why did you kill my A'Zhu?

62
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,020
I asked Prince Duan yesterday

63
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,460
about the one guilty thing that he did.

64
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,700
A'Zhu and A'Zi are both my daughters.

65
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,159
I didn't dare to bring them home.

66
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,060
So, I gave them to others.

Do you think this is what we do?

Prince Duan said that God took pity on him and brought him a child with no parents.

71
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,960
He was talking about A'Zi?

72
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,500
Not me.

73
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,800
Why would he talk about you?

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,060
Are you a child he abandoned, too?

75
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,280
Why did he admit that until now,

76
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,820
he still continues to do evil deeds?

77
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,679
He loves to seduce women.

78
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,220
He has many different women by his side.

79
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,240

80
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,700

Everything is wrong.

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,380
So, you are here.

84
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,100
I was confused about why you dug two holes.

85
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,460
So, you want to be buried together with my sister.

86
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,900
You really do love her.

87

00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,460
Please don't go to him again.

89

You already killed A'Zhu by accident.

Can you stop trying to find him?

91
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,679
I won't make it difficult for him.

92
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
I fell into an insidious trap and I killed A'Zhu.

93

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,779
Chief Qiao, the deed has been done.

You can't change the outcome.

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,580
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

97
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,680
A'Zhu had a dying wish.

98
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,140
She asked me to take good care of her sister.

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,860
If you run into any problems in the future,

100
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,239
I will do my best to help you.

101
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,380
Just order me around.

102
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,599
Thank you.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,819
With a powerful backer like you, I'm sure A'Zi can have an uneventful life.

104
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,679
She'll be able to overcome all difficulties.

105
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,620
I don't want a backer like you.

106
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,279
I have my invincible master and I have many seniors.

107
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,140
You can't even take care of yourself now.

108
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,440
If I ask you for help, you'll only make it worse.

109
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,959
A'Zi, don't be so rude.

110
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Chief Qiao, on behalf of A'Zhu, please don't blame her.

111
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,879
My surname is Xiao, not Qiao.

112
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,919
Mother, look at him. He doesn't even know his surname.

113
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,900
He's just a scoundrel.

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,760
A'Zi!

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,720
I'll take my leave now.

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,940
It was my fault.

117
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,140
Why did I give away my daughter to others?

118
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,580
It was your fault.

119
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,260
Why did you tear apart a good husband and wife?

120
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Who are you? Why are you here?

121
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,239
My mother suffered because of you, little fox.

122
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,760
What did she do to you?

123
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,678
Yes.

124
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,800
You use the double blades.

125
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,999
You are the Xiuluo Knife, Qin Hongmian.

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,119
Sister Qin.

127
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,280
I am Qin Hongmian.

128
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,599
But how dare you call me sister, little wench.

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,620
Yes, I've misspoken.

130
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,559
You are way younger than me.

131
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,679
And you are so beautiful.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,960
No wonder Duan is so obsessed with you.

133
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,100
Little Sister Qin,

134
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,319
Duan really misses you every day.

135
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,919
He's very worried about you.

136
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,999
And your daughter is so beautiful.

137
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,820
I really envy you for your good fortune.

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,080
Sister Ruan, we saw each other and felt like we were familiar.

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,740
Now, we've settled this grudge.

140
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,999
Now, my hatred for so many years has been dissolved.

141
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:24,319
But I want to ask you.

142
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,279
Do you know where that lowly Miss Kang is now?

143
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,439
Little sister,

144
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,999
you want to find her?

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,060
I want to kill her.

146
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,900
At first, Duan and I were living a great life.

147
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,900
But because of that wench,

148
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,439
Duan was seduced by her.

149
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,639
I really don't know where she is.

150
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,899
If you manage to find her, please help me to stab her a few more times, too.

151
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:52,020
Naturally.

152
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,320
Sister, if you happen to see Duan,

153
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,100
slap him twice hard on behalf of me.

154
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,679
The first slap is for me.

155
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,420
The second slap is for my daughter.

156
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,580
I won't be seeing that heartless dead man.

157
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,759
If you see him, help me slap him twice, too.

158
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,239
One is for me.

159
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,519
And the other one is for A'Zi.

160
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,720
No. Two slaps are not enough.

161
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,019
Slap him twice more for not taking care of his daughter

162
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,560
and for leaving us to fend for ourselves.

163
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,380
Sister, don't be too upset.

164
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,279
After I kill that wench, I'll come back at once to accompany you.

165
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,279
We'll get going now.

166
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,940
Be careful.

167
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,560
Mother, why did we come back?

168
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,820
Wan'er, you are too careless.

169
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,420
There's a pair of shoes under the bed in the bedroom.

170
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,620
The right shoe has the word "Shan" embroidered on it.

171
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,819
And the left shoe has the word "He". Isn't that your father's pair of shoes?

172
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,700
Moreover, the shoes are covered in wet mud.

173
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,320
It means that your father was nearby.

174
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,840
So, that woman lied to us.

175
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,039
That's right.

176
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,239
She won't let us meet that heartbreaker.

177
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,319
My father has no conscience.

178
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,739
Mother, you don't need to see him again.

179
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,660
I just want to see him once.

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,820
But I don't want him to see me.

181
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,260
So many years have passed.

182
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,500
Your father has gotten old.

183
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,900
But I have gotten old, too.

184
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Okay.

185
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,759
We'll stay here.

186
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm sure he will be here soon.

187
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,020
Madam.

188
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,620
Why are you here?

189
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,900
Where's Duan?

190
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,679
He ordered me to send you a message.

191
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,820
He has an emergency.

192
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,079
He can't come back tonight.

193
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,559
What emergency?

194
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,999
When will he come back?

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,219
He just said that after he settled the issue, he'd come back to Mirror Lake.

196
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,220
Please don't worry about him.

197
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,860
Farewell.

198
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,319
He always says that he'll be back soon.

199
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,519
But every year, he'll be gone for three to five years.

200
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,400
Now that he's finally coming back...

201
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,940
Mother.

202
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,040
A'Zi, your qinggong is better than mine.

203
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,399
Tail him in secret.

204
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,519
Leave some markings for me along the way.

205
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,799
I'll follow you.

206
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Tail him? Okay.

207
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,239
If that's the case, I'll write "Duan" on the corner of the wall with an arrow for you to follow.

208
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:56,879
Good girl.

209
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,759
You are so besotted.

210
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,300
Let's go.

211
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,319
A'Zi will leave markings along the way.

212
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,939
It won't be hard for us to locate Duan Zhengchun then.

213
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:16,100
Let's go after them then.

214
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,880
Why is he here?

215
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,180
Does he know that Kang Min has framed him?

216
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,119
Come.

217
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,620
Let's drink again.

218
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,100
Make it double to symbolize our union.

219
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,840
Come.

220
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,399
Both of you are so agitated. Don't ruin my plan.

221
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,120
Sorry about this.

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm here all by myself.

223
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I think about you day and night. And I miss you every day.

224
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,720
I still can't forget about you.

225
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,239
But what about you?

226
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,599
You've long forgotten about me.

227
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,679
You didn't even visit me.

228
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,299
I thought and worried about you every day when I was in Dali.

229
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,919
I wanted to fly here to embrace you

230
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,340
and love you properly.

231
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,340
Sorry.

232
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't need you to court me now.

233
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,359
I just miss you.

234
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,559
I just want to know if you are doing well

235
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,900
and if you are happy.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,719
I can only live well if you are.

237
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,300
Only then will I be able to live a good life.

238
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
My precious Xiao Kang.

239
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,339
You must have heard about the death of my husband.

240
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,759
But you didn't rush here to check on me.

241
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,399
I'm here now, right?

242
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,180
Or else, why would I rush here from Dali?

243
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,680
How will you help me settle down this time?

244
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,780
Let's enjoy today while we can.

245
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,740
No need to worry about the future.

246
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,980
So, you are still not willing to bring me to Dali.

247
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,479
There's nothing fun about Dali.

248
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,620
It's humid, hot, and dirty over there.

249
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,860
You'll fall sick if you go there. You can't get used to it.

250
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,259
So, you are here this time to give me an empty dream again.

251
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,620
I'm not giving you an empty dream.

252
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,800
Soon, I'll give you the dream life you are waiting for.

253
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,400
Duan, let's drink again. Okay?

254
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,839
I don't want to drink anymore. I've had enough.

255
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:54,220
I don't care.

256
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,519
I want you to get drunk.

257
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,280
- I really don't want to drink anymore. Don't.
- Come on.

258
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,560
Duan, let me tell you a story. Okay?

259
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
Sure.

260
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,360
When I was young, my family was poor.

261
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,739
But I wanted to wear a new dress.

262
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,979
My father couldn't afford it.

263
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:25,100
I always thought that it would be good

264
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,818
if I could be like my neighbor, Sister Jiang.

265
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:31,219
After Chinese New year, she would have new flowery tops, new trousers, and new shoes.

266
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:33,260
There's nothing special about flowery clothes.

267
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,820
No.

268
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,240
I like to wear flowery clothes.

269
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,139
And I had been plagued by my longing for flowery clothes.

270
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,080
Just like my longing towards you.

271
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,300
I can't cure it.

272
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,840
And I've been plagued by it until this very day.

273
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,700
I don't know if I'll be able to cure it.

274
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,299
At what age did you manage to wear flowery clothes and shoes?

275
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:06,999
It was in December.

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,999
My father came back and told me this.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,040
Xiao Min, look! What is this?

278
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,119
Be good, Xiao Min. At the end of this month,

279
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,219
I'll sell our chickens and goats in the market to get ready for Chinese New Year.

280
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:21,479
And then, I'll buy a flowery fabric home so that you can have new clothes, okay?

281
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:24,220
- Okay.
- I was ecstatic.

282
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,639
Children from poor families look forward to the new year.

283
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,319
Because the new year is the only time they have money to buy fabric and make new clothes.

284
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:36,220
But a few days before the new year...

285
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,880
Xiao Min, don't be scared. They are wild wolves. I'll go and chase them away.

286
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,799
Xiao Min, it's okay.

287
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,359
The wolves are gone.

288
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,140
But they took away our chickens and goats.

289
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,399
I had waited a year for my flowery clothes.

290
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,260
And my hope was crushed

291
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,800
just like that.

292
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,100
No wonder A'Zhu is afraid of her.

293
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,919
She's such a cold woman.

294
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,039
I blamed my father for it.

295
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,439
But what could I do?

296
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,639
I had less than half a month until the new year.

297
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,979
My neighbor, Sister Jiang, was wearing new clothes again.

298
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:29,319
She wore a new yellow quilted top with red flowers.

299
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,359
And green trousers with yellow flowers.

300
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,440
So beautiful.

301
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,600
The more I looked at it, the angrier I got.

302
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,119
On the night of Chinese New Year's Eve,

303
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,860
I was tossing and turning. I couldn't sleep.

304
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,639
After that, I secretly sneaked into Uncle Jiang's house.

305
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:49,719
Sister Jiang was already asleep.

306
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,700
Her new top and trousers were on top of her.

307
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,140
So beautiful.

308
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,599
I looked at them longingly by the door for a long time.

309
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,620
In the end,

310
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,639
I finally mustered up my courage and entered her room.

311
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
I took away her new clothes.

312
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,580
You... You stole her clothes?

313
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,239
I thought that you only knew how to steal a man's heart.

314
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,900
Why would I steal her clothes?

315
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,479
I took out the scissors from the sewing basket.

316
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,900
And snip by snip, I cut her new top into pieces.

317
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,100
As for that pair of new green trousers,

318
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,940
I cut the trousers into strips so that they couldn't be sewn back.

319
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,280
You don't know

320
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,279
that the feeling of cutting up those clothes into pieces

321
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,800
was even better than having new clothes to wear.

322
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,639
I was delighted.

323
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,479
Let's not talk about the past.

324
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,080
Hurry up and sleep.

325
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,779
Duan, do you know why I told you this story?

326
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,820
I want you to know my temper.

327
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,139
If there is something that I long for but can't have it

328
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:11,580
while someone else is lucky to get it instead,

329
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,800
I'll definitely destroy it.

330
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,479
Duan, come and carry me.

331
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,480
Coming.

332
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,420
What's wrong, Duan?

333
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,220
Hurry up and come here.

334
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,959
I'm out of energy.

335
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,180
This is weird. Why do I feel so weak?

336
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,560
Have you been poisoned by the Ten Fragrances Drug Mist?

337
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,479
If that's the case,

338
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,859
even if you have excellent martial arts skills, your whole body will be weak.

339
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:59,579
How do you know about the Ten Fragrances Drug Mist?

340
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,720
Can it be...

341
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,700
that when I poured the wine for you,

342
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,720
I accidentally dropped the poison inside?

343
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,200
Look at me.

344
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,460
When I see you, I lose my mind.

345
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,560
I don't know what to do.

346
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,560
Duan.

347
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,280
Don't blame me.

348
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,300
I see.

349
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,719
It's okay.

350
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,320
Let me ask you then.

351
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,799
Are you going to take me as your wife?

352
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,759
Okay.

353
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,919
I'll bring you to Dali tomorrow and make you into my concubine.

354
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,519
Do you know? I... I am the Crown Prince of Dali.

355
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,479
My brother doesn't have a son.

356
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,519
When he passes away,

357
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,079
he'll pass down the throne to me.

358
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,679
You'll enjoy great wealth after this.

359
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,199
If you become the emperor,

360
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,039
can I become the empress?

361
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,279
Of course. You can be anything you want.

362
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,079
You can even become the empress dowager.

363
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,680
No need to appease me.

364
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,760
I am an unlucky widow.

365
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,119
How can I become the empress?

366
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,439
I told you my story just now.

367
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,680
You understand, right?

368
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,359
Why are you sweating so much?

369
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,639
Come.

370
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,560
Let me wipe it off for you.

371
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,039
Duan,

372
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,559
you have to take care of yourself.

373
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,399
If anything happens to you,

374
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,240
I'll have more things to worry about.

375
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,599
Do you still remember?

376
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,839
That night, I gave you my body.

377
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,479
I asked you that if you betrayed me one day,

378
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,699
what would you do?

379
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:59,779
What did you answer?

380
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:01,400
Do you still remember?

381
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,960
I... I said that

382
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,600
you could tear off my flesh

383
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,160
bite by bite.

384
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,599
It has been so many years.

385
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,359
You still remember what you told me.

386
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,040
You really have a good conscience.

387
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,439
Today, I've prepared a special game.

388
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,619
I want to tie you up.

389
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:33,300
Let's play something new, okay?

390
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,559
Go ahead.

391
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,119
Just tie me up.

392
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,919
After all, no matter what

393
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,359
beauty will always be my weakness.

394
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm glad that I can die by your hand.

395
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,680
Good. I'll tie you up then.

396
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,959
I've always been very obedient.

397
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,479
What I hate the most is your legs.

398
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,580
One step, and you'll be gone.

399
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,719
But back then when we met, my legs brought me to you.

400
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,341
Although my legs have committed a grave mistake, they've contributed a lot too.

401
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,159
The next one is your hands.

402
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,460
Such gentle hands.

403
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,399
Every day, I hope that this pair of hands

404
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,960
can caress my face.

405
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,099
But how can such gentle hands

406
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:44,960
caress other women?

407
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,399
Hitting and scolding someone are signs of love.

408
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,820
I bit you because I love you to death.

409
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,079
Today, for the sake of our past relationship,

410
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,279
I'll give you a quick death.

411
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,980
Ma Dayuan!

412
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,600
Xiao Kang,

413
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,679
do you really want to kill your husband?

414
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,479
If people in the Beggars' Sect

415
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,999
want to punish you for killing your husband,

416
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,239
who can help you then?

417
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
Who will say that I will kill my husband?

418
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,119
You are not my husband.

419
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,240
If you were,

420
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,019
I would love you and cherish you.

421
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,260
I wouldn't hurt you.

422
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,319
Duan, it's because I can't have you,

423
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,959
so I have to destroy you.

424
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
This is my nature.

425
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,960
I can't help it.

426
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,679
Yes.

427
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,439
That day, you lied to that lady to kill me with Qiao Feng's hands.

428
00:27:02,439 --> 00:27:04,780
Is this why you did it?

429
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,919
Qiao Feng is really useless.

430
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,960
He couldn't kill you and he let you escape.

431
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,980
Duan.

432
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,940
Let me bite you one last time,

433
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,119
and I'll give you a quick death.

434
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,019
Bite me.

435
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,220
I like it a lot.

436
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,080
Kang Min, I never thought that you still harbor feelings towards this old lover.

437
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,199
No wonder it's taking you so long to settle this.

438
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,039
You are really loyal, Xiao Kang.

439
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,059
Now that you have a new lover, you are going to kill your old lover?

440
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:36,719
Besides Murong Clan, nobody else

441
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,580
can master Brother Dayuan's ultimate technique.

442
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,359
Are you the elder of the Beggars' Sect?

443
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,359
I don't know you.

444
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,440
Why do you want to kill me?

445
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,839
My hands and legs are like jelly.

446
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,399
I feel weak.

447
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,719
Shijing, hurry up and kill him.

448
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,559
We have to leave at once.

449
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,939
I don't want to stay in this room anymore.

450
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,380
Xiao Kang, why are you still so weak?

451
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,439
Duan, you are about to die.

452
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:07,959
Why are you so talkative?

453
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,319
Duan?

454
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,160
You wench!

455
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,200
Stop. Why are you hitting her?

456
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,880
Duan Zhengchun, I hit her to tell you that she is mine.

457
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,399
I can hit her and scold her as I please.

458
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,959
She's such a beauty. Why did you hit her?

459
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:25,359
How can you hit her?

460
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,920
Even if she belongs to you,

461
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,099
you should lower yourself to take good care of her and cherish her.

462
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:33,919
Look at how he treats me

463
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,839
and look at how you treat me.

464
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,439
Aren't you ashamed?

465
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,460
You wench. I'll teach you a lesson later.

466
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,659
Duan, you are loved by women.

467
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:47,260
Why did she try to kill you then?

468
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,719
I don't want to talk too much with you.

469
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,379
Prince Duan, today of next year will be your death anniversary.

470
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,500
Who is it?

471
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,519
Shijing, go and check it out.

472
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,799
Is he here?

473
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,500
Shut up!

474
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,399
Who are you?

475
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,000
If you don't answer me, I'll have to attack you.

476
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Are you human or ghost?

477
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,400
Throat Locking Skill.

478
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,780
- Ma Dayuan!
- Ma Dayuan.

479
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,160
Brother Dayuan, don't blame me.

480
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,859
It was Kang Min's idea.

481
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,319
She goaded me to kill you.

482
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,079
So what if it was my idea?

483
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,039
Ma Dayuan, you were useless when you were alive.

484
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,659
Now, you are disturbing us after you are dead.

485
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:22,519
I'm not afraid of you.

486
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,960
Brother Dayuan. Spare me, Brother Dayuan.

487
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,319
Spare me. She saw Chief Wang's will.

488
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,839
She wanted you to expose the secret of Qiao Feng's family background.

489
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,159
But you wouldn't do it.

490
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,179
That's why she decided to kill you.

491
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:36,079
Ma Dayuan, come and choke me to death.

492
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,319
I really hated how useless you looked.

493
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,360
You were just a coward who couldn't do anything.

494
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,780
He's so fast.

495
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,839
Madam Ma doesn't know martial arts. Go and save your father.

496
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,260
Please stop!

497
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,439
Sorry for disturbing you.

498
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,719
If you don't mind, I would like to be your friend.

499
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,800
No need to do that.

500
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,539
I'm old and useless now.

501
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,119
If you chase after me for another two hours,

502
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,640
I think I'll lose to you.

503
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,360
Stop following me.

504
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,779
His qinggong is superb.

505
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,359
What a pity that I can't see his face.

506
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,160
Forget it.

507
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,479
I wonder how Duan Zhengchun is now.

508
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,238
I've hit the pressure point of Ruan Xingzhu and Qin Hongmian.

509
00:34:15,238 --> 00:34:17,100
I have to release them.

510
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,138
Have mercy on me. Have mercy on me.

511
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:31,200
Kill me.

512
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,839
Who did this?

513
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,319
That wench.

514
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,778
She looks so young. Not even 15 or 16.

515
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:43,059
But she's so vicious.

516
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:45,718
She cut off the tendons of my hands and legs.

517
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,580
She even laughed

518
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,119
and said that I could neither live nor die.

519
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,020
You are talking about A'Zi?

520
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,399
That's her name.

521
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,899
This is how that wench called her.

522
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:04,959
I kept asking her to kill me. But she wouldn't give me quick death.

523
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,299
Where's Duan Zhengchun?

524
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:09,200
Duan Zhengchun's subordinates came here

525
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,279
and took them away.

526
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,000
And A'Zi took away her mother, too.

527
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,380
Why did you kill Brother Ma?

528
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,999
I'm like this today because of you.

529
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,419
You arrogant and supercilious man.

530
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:33,799
I want to see how you'll end up.

531
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,539
We first met during the succession ceremony

532
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:41,599
of the chief of Beggars' Sect.

533
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,659
We don't know each other.

534
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,199
What did I do to you?

535
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,999
You bastard.

536
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,879
Didn't you see me during the Flower Festival in Luoyang?

537
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,620
Lord Qiao!

538
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,759
Long time no see.

539
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,039
Madam, look.

540
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,240
The flowers today are so beautiful.

541
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,620
That woman. Who's she?

542
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,759
She is Deputy Chief Ma's new wife.

543
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,639
They say that she's young and beautiful.

544
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,679
She's really extraordinary now that I see her.

545
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,619
No wonder Deputy Chief Ma likes her so much.

546
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,639
So beautiful.

547
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,159
Madam, come and smell them.

548
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,999
These flowers are so fragrant.

549
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,480
This one.

550
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,639
- This wine is not bad.
- Let me fill you up.

551
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,779
Yes.

552
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:28,620
Who is he?

553
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,899
He's Lord Qiao. The disciple of Chief Wang from Beggars' Sect.

554
00:36:31,899 --> 00:36:33,499
He's a hero.

555
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:36,319
A few days ago, he barged into the Liao Army's camp all by himself

556
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,199
and caught the marshal.

557
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,040
Everyone says that he'll be the next chief.

558
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,959
Look at you. You are so young.

559
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,879
Why aren't you drinking?

560
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,319
You have to hold your liquor better.

561
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,580
You should learn from me. Bottoms up.

562
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,780
Why are you hiding?

563
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,079
Little Bean, you are so big now.

564
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,439
Why are you looking at flowers?

565
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,780
Let's go. Let's go and eat.

566
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,300
Look. Little Bean has grown up so much.

567
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,959
Who do you think you are?

568
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,999
It would be fine if you didn't see me at all.

569
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,759
You saw me.

570
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,719
But you ignored me.

571
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,799
You were the boss of the Beggars' Sect.

572
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,119
And you were a good man. A hero.

573
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,079
During the Flower Festival, you were the best man.

574
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,439
And I was, of course, the best woman.

575
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,879
Even if everyone was besotted with me,

576
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,120
how could I feel good

577
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,620
if you didn't look at me?

578
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,139
There were indeed a few women.

579
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:48,199
But I was focused on drinking.

580
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,299
I didn't look at the men or women.

581
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:52,700
Don't you have eyes?

582
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,439
There was once a woman.

583
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,700
She was even more stunning than you.

584
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,260
But I didn't pay attention to her.

585
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,599
Who was she?

586
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,460
She was Duan Zhengchun's daughter,

587
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,020
A'Zi's sister.

588
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,740
That wench of Duan Zhengchun.

589
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,920
I won't allow you to disrespect her.

590
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,619
Looks like Chief Qiao is infatuated with this girl.

591
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:38,059
Now that you can't be the chief of Beggars' Sect,

592
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,759
you want to become the royal son-in-law of Dali.

593
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,159
I thought that no woman would ever enter your eyes.

594
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,479
You killed your husband just because

595
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,839
I didn't look at you?

596
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,480
Who would believe such a lie?

597
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,560
I'm about to die anyway.

598
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,379
Why would I lie to you?

599
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:08,260
What can I do

600
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,340
about you looking down on me?

601
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,319
But God was on my side.

602
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,459
I found out about your secret from Chief Wang.

603
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,459
I asked Ma Dayuan to expose you

604
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:23,059
so that you couldn't be the chief of Beggars' Sect

605
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,879
and lose your footing in the Central Plains.

606
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,279
I wanted to put your life in jeopardy.

607
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,300
Just because Brother Ma wouldn't do as you said,

608
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,319
you killed him.

609
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,759
Of course.

610
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,079
Not only did he not want to expose you,

611
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,160
he even asked me to not mention it ever again.

612
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,019
He was always so obedient.

613
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:47,020
When had he ever been so harsh to me?

614
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,720
Of course, I would make him pay.

615
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,980
After a few days, during the Mid-Autumn Festival,

616
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,919
Bai Shijing came to my house.

617
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,700
That pervert...

618
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,519
looked at me again and again.

619
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,039
So, I sacrificed my body to make him become obsessed with me.

620
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,999
I asked Bai Shijing to kill that useless Ma Dayuan.

621
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,040
But he wouldn't.

622
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,060
So, I told him that I would accuse him of rape.

623
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,779
I told him that if he killed Ma Dayuan,

624
00:40:19,779 --> 00:40:21,659
I would become his.

625
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:23,299
If he wouldn't kill him,

626
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,580
I would kill myself in front of him.

627
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,800
He didn't want me to die.

628
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,700
So, he killed Ma Dayuan.

629
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:42,100
You destroyed a tough man like Bai Shijing just like that.

630
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,719
After that, I asked Bai Shijing to expose you.

631
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,599
But he was loyal to you.

632
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,679
When I continued to force him,

633
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,200
he said that he would commit suicide.

634
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,599
So, I let him off the hook.

635
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,340
I went to Quan Guanqing.

636
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,199
After sleeping with him for three days,

637
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,879
he was at my beck and call.

638
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,159
He confidently told me that he would take care of everything.

639
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,539
Of course, I knew

640
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,539
that Quan Guanqing couldn't take you down all by himself.

641
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,119
So, I went to Elder Xu.

642
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,479
As for the rest, you know how it turned out.

643
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,259
So, Bai Shijing was the one who stole my fan.

644
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:24,880
No.

645
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,159
It was Quan Guanqing who convinced Elder Chen

646
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,960
to steal it from your room when you left.

647
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,119
How did you see through

648
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,719
A'Zhu's disguise as Bai Shijing?

649
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,799
I was really shocked that day.

650
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,359
She disguised herself as Bai Shijing,

651
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,719
but I couldn't tell at all.

652
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,640
Unfortunately for her,

653
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,999
when I talked to her

654
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,039
about my flirtatious conversation with Bai Shijing during the Mid-Autumn Festival,

655
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,759
she had no idea how to answer me.

656
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,659
That's how I saw through her.

657
00:41:58,659 --> 00:42:03,260
The recent moon is so white and round.

658
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,840
Yes.

659
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,239
Today is the 15th of this month.

660
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,039
Of course, the moon is round and white.

661
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,600
Do you like the sweet or salty mooncake?

662
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,719
For beggars like us,

663
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,679
we are not picky about our food.

664
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,580
That's how I knew

665
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,799
that the person was you.

666
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,000
Back then, I wanted to kill Duan Zhengchun.

667
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:44,780
So, I framed you for it.

668
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,519
A'Zhu's death is on you, too.

669
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,160
She was the one who wanted to trick me.

Senior, you did good, you have let us understand and see more of this world.
