If anything happens to you here,

the Khitans won't let it go that easily.

The last thing I want to see is a bloody dispute.

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,300
I'll see you again if I have a chance in the future.

We'll drink our fill for three days

Don't send me off.

21
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,100
Just go now.

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,000
What's wrong with bidding farewell to such a heaven-blessed talent?

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,800
This man has excellent martial arts skills

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,600
enough to take the leader of his enemy's head among thousands of troops.

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,400
He's loyal, brave, benevolent, righteous, and can see the whole picture.

00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,400
What a rare talent that holds such leadership potential.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
If I could recruit such a brave general,

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,600
it'll give us even more advantages

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
for Liao's great cause in unifying the nations.

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,400
What's even rarer is that this person is a descendant of Khitan.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,700
As long as I can enlighten him with reason and move him with my affection,

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,200
he will definitely be of great use to Liao.

When I have a drink with him,

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,600
he'll scold me if I don't drink all of it.

73
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,900
Mr. Duan, the Brother Qiao you mentioned,

Yes.

This is the place we both met and drank.

77
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,000
We drank all day that day.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,000
Those were the happiest days of my life.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,900
But what a pity.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,600
It's a pity that after that...

81
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,800
What happened after that?

82
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,100
I traveled around after sneaking out from my house.

83
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,400
I would go anywhere that was interesting.

84
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I thought a life of freedom and without restraints

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,800
could not get better than this.

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,400
But...

87
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Ever since I met Miss Wang,

88
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,200
I no longer feel free and unrestrained.

89
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Others say I'm wealthy.

90
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,100
But my wealth didn't stop my mother from becoming a nun

91
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,000
nor allowed me to help Brother Qiao.

92
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,800
After going through so many things,

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,500
I think in Miss Wang's eyes,

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,600
I may been even less than a Swallow's Nest attendant or a maid.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,100
Let alone that Young Master Murong.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,700
Master Xu Zhu, what do you think is the purpose of life?

97
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,000
Mr. Duan, all the things that didn't go your way

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,600
are all part of life practice.

99
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,600
Good! Well said.

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,000
Life practice.

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Mr. Duan, did I say it wrongly?

102
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,400
No, you didn't.

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
My uncle always said

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,800
a Buddhist who's free from human desires and passion

105
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,800
is relieved from all kinds of sufferings in this world.

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,600
Master Xu Zhu, may I ask you something?

107
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you have any sufferings in your life?

108
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,599
Actually, I grew up in Shaolin Temple.

109
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,300
I only want to be a good monk.

110
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,600
There isn't any pain or suffering.

111
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,000
But I do have a problem,

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
which is I am too slow and dumb.

113
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm slow in memorizing scriptures and practicing martial arts.

114
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,800
My peers always say

115
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,200
that I won't be able to cultivate anything in this life

116
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
and in the next life, too.

117
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,700
Wonderful!

118
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,900
My uncle also says that I'm a fool.

119
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,200
You see, I've always wanted to be a carefree person,

120
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
while you've always wanted to be a monk devoted to Buddha.

121
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,300
It seems like both of us

122
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,800
have to free ourselves from this world.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,400
Only then can we achieve inner peace and true happiness.

124
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,800
All right then.

125
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,100
Waiter, here's the money.

126
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,800
All right.

127
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,500
Mr. Duan, are you all right?

128
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm fine.

129
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,300
Are you... you drunk?

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,200
Yes, I'm drunk.

131
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,000
I unknowingly came to this place somehow.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This place used to be the forest

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
where Brother Qiao and I competed in qinggong.

134
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,800
Along the way, we gradually became sworn brothers.

135
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
But now, Brother Qiao has lost the love of his life,

136
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
and I haven't heard from him since.

137
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,000
And I couldn't get what I wanted as well.

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,800
The person I like doesn't like me.

139
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,000
I wanted to be a carefree person but I couldn't.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,700
Master Xu Zhu, don't you find me ridiculous?

141
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Amitabha.

142
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Mr. Duan, the seven hardships in life may come in different forms,

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
but they are fundamentally the same.

144
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,200
From noblemen to common folks,

145
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,400
no one is without worries.

146
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,500
I'm sure you know this.

147
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,600
So how is it ridiculous?

148
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,259
My uncle once told me that we don't necessarily understand

149
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,400
the principles of Buddhist texts just because we have memorized them.

150
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,600
We must experience their true meaning ourselves.

151
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Only then can we understand them.

152
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,000
I thought knowing was seeing through,

153
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,500
and seeing through was to let go.

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
But in the end,

155
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
I realized the more I know,

156
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,400
the more confused I get.

157
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Mr. Duan,

158
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,800
what do you mean by "the more you know, the more confused you get"?

159
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,600
Just like when I used to be ignorant.

160
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,500
I couldn't understand what Father and Uncle meant.

161
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,200
So I just stayed out of it

162
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,600
and didn't bother to think of the true meaning

163
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
of the Dali Duan family,

164
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,400
nor did I know what love was.

165
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
When I met Miss Mu, I liked her very much.

166
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,800
I like Ling'er's innocence very much, too.

167
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,100
But in the end, I realized the more I knew,

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,800
the harder it was for me to do whatever I wanted.

169
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,200
And I became more cautious of my actions and hesitated more.

170
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,000
Mr. Duan has indeed given it considerable thought.

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,400
Abbot Xuan Ci of Shaolin Temple once told me

172
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,200
that a person is not born free.

173
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,600
He can't choose his parents.

174
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,900
Let alone his life and death.

175
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,800
Only our state of mind can be cultivated by ourselves.

176
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,200
If we see restraint as normal,

177
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,500
we won't feel inadequate or unsatisfied.

178
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
If we see restraint as normal,

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,600
we won't feel inadequate.

180
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,200
"If we see restraint as normal,

181
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,800
we won't feel inadequate or unsatisfied."

182
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,400
- Thank you, Master.
- Please don't.

183
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Mr. Duan, I can't accept this.

184
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
Why not?

185
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,200
One can be regarded as a teacher for correcting a single word.

186
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,400
Well, you've said much more than that.

187
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,800
Even if I give you the ceremony of making you my master, there's nothing wrong with it.

188
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you, Master Xu Zhu.

189
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,200
I don't deserve it.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How marvelous!

191
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,600
Please get up.

192
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
By the way, Mr. Duan,

193
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,600
Shaolin Temple has decided to hold a martial arts meeting.

194
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,000
The martial artists of the Central Plains will gather at Shaolin Temple then.

195
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,800
The purpose is to clarify the matter of the death of Deputy Chief Ma.

196
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,800
It may be able to help to prove Chief Qiao's innocence.

197
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,800
That's great.

198
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,400
I meant to head to the Beggar's Sect to explain this matter.

199
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,000
Master Xu Zhu, thank you for your company.

200
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,700
I'll be taking my leave.

201
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
Farewell.

202
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
We just captured this Khitan.

203
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,400
He said he came bearing gifts for you.

204
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,900
I'm Shi Li.

205
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,500
After my master and Master Xiao went separate ways, he missed you greatly.

206
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,200
So he ordered me to bring you gifts

207
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,400
and invite you to Shangjing.

208
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
You've had a long journey. Get up first.

209
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,000
These gifts consist of 5,000 taels of gold,

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,800
50,000 taels of silver,

211
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,600
1,000 bolts of brocade,

212
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
1,000 dan of fine wheat,

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
1,000 cattle,

214
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,000
5,000 sheep, and 3,000 fine horses.

215
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,200
In addition to that, there are all kinds of clothing and accessories.

216
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,800
My master was afraid some of the livestock might be lost during the way,

217
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,900
so he prepared an additional one-tenth of the cattle, sheep, and horses.

218
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,800
Thanks to my master and Master Xiao blessings,

219
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,700
I didn't run into any bad weather or wild beasts.

220
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,000
So we only lost a small amount of livestock.

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,600
He's very thoughtful.

222
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
If I don't accept these,

223
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,600
I'll disappoint your master's generosity.

224
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
But if I accept everything, I would feel uneasy.

225
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,900
My master repeatedly told me that if you refuse to accept them,

226
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,800
I'll be punished when I return.

227
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,200
Report!

228
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,000
- Dust and smoke are billowing in the distance! There seems to be an enemy attack!
- This is bad.

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,600
This Khitan claims he came bearing gifts for us,

230
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
but it's actually a sneak attack!

231
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,700
Everyone, calm down! This isn't an enemy attack!

232
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Those are just the livestock my master gave Master Xiao arriving.

233
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,000
Go take a look.

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Yes!

235
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Brother Xiao, if what this man says is true,

236
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,200
then that friend of yours has really spent a fortune.

237
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,200
They're all livestock.

238
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,000
They're all over the mountains and plains! They're all livestock!

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,500
- I've never seen such well-fed cattle!
- They're all livestock!

240
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,300
Those are all cattle and sheep!

241
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:31,700
Brother Wanyan, in that case, let's slaughter the sheep and cattle to entertain our distinguished guest.

242
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,200
Agreed.

243
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Let's share the gold, silver, and brocade with everyone.

244
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,700
Brother Xiao, you really know the customs of our people.

245
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,200
We share everything with each other.

246
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,600
They won't be surprised by your generosity.

247
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,000
Exactly!

248
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,300
This is only a little something to repay the Jurchens' kindness

249
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,700
towards my sister and me.

250
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,919
All right.

251
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,700
Brother Xiao, since you've said that, I won't hold back.

252
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,600
Slaughter the cattle and sheep. Entertain our guests!

253
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,439
Slaughter the cattle and sheep to entertain the guest!

254
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,999
You've recovered a lot.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,200
You're out of danger now.

256
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,800
But you should still avoid going out for the next few days.

257
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Otherwise, it'll be bad for your injury

258
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
because of the cold wind.

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,200
Physician, can you keep this from my brother-in-law for now?

260
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,700
When I was ill, he only kept me company for a few days.

261
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,000
Now that I've recovered,

262
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,800
won't I be alone then?

263
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,000
- But...
- Don't tell him.

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,600
Please, I'm begging you.

265
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,300
Well...

266
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,200
All right then.

267
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,000
Since you're not well,

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,800
please lie down and have a good rest.

269
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,300
I'll write a prescription

270
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,600
and let them get your medicine.

271
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,900
Physician, is she doing all right?

272
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,600
She's better than before.

273
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,100
But Miss A'Zi had a serious injury,

274
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,400
and she lost a lot of her vitality and strength.

275
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,000
It'll take a while for her to recover.

276
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,800
- She'll need more time and rest to recover fully.
- Thank you.

277
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,700
It's my responsibility.

278
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,800
She doesn't seem to be recovering well even though she consumes ginseng every day.

279
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,900
Brother Xiao, our people always use tiger bones, tiger tendons, and bear bile

280
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,600
to treat traumatic injuries.

281
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
These three medicinal ingredients are effective in treatment.

282
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
Why don't you try it?

283
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Tiger bones and tendons?

284
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
We have plenty of that here.

285
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
As for bear's bile...

286
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,000
Didn't we see a bear in the mountains last time?

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,600
Why don't we have them inform me if they see it again?

288
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Of course. That won't be a problem.

289
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,600
A bear is worth a lot of prey.

290
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,500
I'll tell them to hunt the bear with you.

291
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,000
It's all right.

292
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That bear looks dangerous.

293
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
I can go myself.

294
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
I can't watch over many people anyway.

295
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,300
Just help me watch over my sister.

296
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,310
[Dazhi Branch]

297
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,400
I gathered all of you here today,

298
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,200
mainly to discuss who we, the Dazhi Branch, should nominate as the chief of the Beggar's Sect

299
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,400
for the sect's upcoming meeting.

300
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,800
Brothers, please choose a wise and courageous candidate.

301
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,600
If we're talking about wise and courageous,

302
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,400
we should nominate our Branch Leader Quan.

303
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,200
He's right.

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,200
Brothers, you must not nominate me as the chief.

305
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,500
Others will say I exposed Qiao Feng because of personal interests.

306
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,300
Branch Leader Quan, those who are capable should not pass the responsibility to others.

307
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,800
The elders of the sect may be good in martial arts,

308
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,200
but no one can be compared to you

309
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,100
when it comes to intelligence.

310
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,800
Branch Leader, Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom's heir is here.

311
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,800
Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom's heir?

312
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,000
He said he is an old acquaintance of yours

313
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
and you'll know once you see him.

314
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
In that case, invite him in.

315
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Yes, sir.

316
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,000
I didn't know you would be visiting.

317
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,200
I apologize for not receiving you.

318
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,500
It's all right.

319
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,200
I'm here under my father's orders

320
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
to deliver a message to your sect.

321
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,000
I wanted to go to the headquarters.

322
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,200
But I wasn't able to meet the elders.

323
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,000
After asking around, I found out that Dazhi Branch was just nearby.

324
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,400
I had no choice but to come here instead.

325
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,000
Many things have happened within the sect lately.

326
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,600
So the elders are away.

327
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,400
May I know what news you have brought for us, Your Highness?

328
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Some time ago,

329
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,200
my father witnessed something strange at your sect's late

330
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,800
Deputy Chief Ma's residence in Xinyang.

331
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,500
He witnessed the death of Elder Bai Shijing of your sect.

332
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,700
This matter is of great importance to your sect,

333
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,800
and it also involves other heroes of the martial arts world.

334
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,400
He had meant to inform your sect of this.

335
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,800
However, my father had been ill.

336
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,400
When he recovered slightly and felt better,

337
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,600
he wrote a letter and entrusted me to deliver it to your sect.

338
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,380
[Letter to the Elders of the Beggar's Sect]

339
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,600
Sorry to trouble Your Highness to deliver this letter.

340
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,800
I guess both of them are watching from Heaven.

341
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
I had no idea His Highness actually witnessed

342
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
how Elder Bai and Madam Ma

343
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,500
was brutally killed by the traitor Qiao Feng.

344
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,119
Branch Leader Quan, you don't have any solid proof. How can you make a verdict?

345
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,639
Brother Qiao is not the one who murdered Elder Bai Shijing and Madam Ma.

346
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,819
It was someone else who killed Deputy Chief Ma of your sect.

347
00:22:56,819 --> 00:22:59,139
Father has written it clearly in the letter.

348
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:03,679
After the elders have read it, they'll know the details.

349
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,959
Our sect will hold a meeting soon.

350
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,320
The elders will be attending then.

351
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,200
I'll definitely hand this letter to the elders.

352
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,799
Thank you so much.

353
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,699
I'll be taking my leave then. No need to send me off.

354
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,959
This Quan Guanqing looks cunning.

355
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,239
He doesn't look like a good man.

356
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,419
I don't think he likes Chief Qiao either. Could he...

357
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,660
This person was the one who exposed Brother Qiao's heritage.

358
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,519
He has such a treacherous mind. But he's a coward.

359
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,420
I handed over the letter to him in front of everyone.

360
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,539
I think he wouldn't dare keep my father's letter a secret.

361
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:50,000
You can say we've more or less got revenge for Brother Qiao.

362
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
Young Master.

363
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:05,399
Su Xinghe invites talented chess players

364
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,399
to gather at Tianlong Diya Valley on the Eighth Day of the Second Month

365
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,260
at Leigu Mountain, Henan.

366
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,199
This is great.

367
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,279
If time permits, I'll be there at the appointed time.

368
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,520
But how did you know that I could play chess?

369
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,760
Leigu Mountain is not far from here, right?

370
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,039
He is the heir to Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom, Duan Yu.

371
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,879
Young Master admires Mr. Cong Bian a great deal.

372
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,259
We express our thanks and will be there.

373
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,780
What great skills.

374
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,939
Fourth Brother Zhu, who is this Mr. Cong Bian?

375
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:56,199
Since you seldom mingle around in the martial arts world, you wouldn't know him.

376
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:58,900
He's a master in the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

377
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,659
He's deaf and a mute. But it's said he's highly skilled in martial arts.

378
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,860
He's both deaf and mute.

379
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,839
But he claims to be Mr. Cong Bian.

380
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,159
I assume he considers his skills

381
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,879
to be superior to people without disabilities.

382
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,259
That's right. He may be deaf and mute.

383
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,959
But he's literate in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

384
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,639
He usually doesn't mingle around with people of the martial arts world.

385
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,460
Since he has sent an invite and you've already accepted it,

386
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,139
why don't we stay for a few more days and take a trip to Leigu Mountain?

387
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,440
Let's go then.

388
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,959
Miss A'Zi, it's time to eat.

389
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,279
Come and have your meal.

390
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,400
Careful.

391
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,819
Brother Wanyan, where's my brother-in-law?

392
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:05,560
It has been days since he checked on me.

393
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,319
To tell you the truth,

394
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,100
after Brother Xiao learned of our tribe's secret remedy,

395
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,320
in order to collect bear bile, he went hunting bear by himself.

396
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,160
Hunting bear?

397
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,359
I wanted to send some men to accompany him. But he refused.

398
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,520
How could this happen?

399
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,699
He may be skilled in martial arts, but he is still only human!

400
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:27,159
Brother Wanyan, I've recovered. I don't need any bear bile!

401
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:29,239
Find him and bring him back quickly!

402
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,219
Sit down and calm down first.

403
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,060
The physician said you still need to rest.

404
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,800
You mustn't agitate yourself.

405
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,059
Can't you see that I'm all better?

406
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:38,800
Put down the dagger. Put it down!

407
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,080
Take me to him.

408
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,979
All right. I promised Brother Xiao not to let anything happen to you.

409
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,300
Fine. I'll take you there.

410
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,060
Give the dagger to me.

411
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,279
Hero Xiao!

412
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,759
Brother-in-Law!

413
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,780
Brother Xiao!

414
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,300
Brother Xiao!

415
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,180
Where are you, Hero Xiao?

416
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,239
Brother-in-Law!

417
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,260
Brother Xiao!

418
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,380
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

419
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,780
- Let's look over there.
- Okay.

420
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,919
Brother Xiao!

421
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,420
- Hero Xiao!
- Brother-in-Law!

422
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,940
Brother Xiao!

423
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,880
Brother-in-Law!

424
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,580
- Brother Xiao!
- Brother Xiao!

425
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,719
Brother-in-Law!

426
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,719
- Brother Xiao!
- Hero Xiao!

427
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,560
Brother Wanyan!

428
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,460
Brother Xiao!

429
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,499
Why are you here? We're here searching for you.

430
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:34,580
Brother-in-Law!

431
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,220
Look who's here.

432
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,039
Brother-in-Law!

433
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,000
Brother-in-Law.

434
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,800
Why are you here?

435
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,320
Are you all right?

436
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,080
You're injured.

437
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,920
Where's your wound?

438
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,599
This isn't my blood.

439
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,159
Didn't the physician tell you to rest?

440
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:55,080
Why did you come here?

441
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,479
I'm sorry.

442
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,820
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

443
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,980
I shouldn't have lied to you.

444
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,759
Lied to me? What did you lie about?

445
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:05,879
I'd already recovered.

446
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,939
I don't need any secret remedy or for you to hunt bears.

447
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,100
You've already recovered?

448
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,499
She has indeed recovered.

449
00:28:18,499 --> 00:28:20,939
She even tried to kill herself with a knife and forced me to search for you.

450
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:23,280
I think she's all right now.

451
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,020
You're here in time.

452
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,420
I just hunted a bear. It's in the forest.

453
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,260
You can carry it back home.

454
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,220
That's incredible!

455
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,339
All four of you go to the forest and carry the bear back.

456
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:40,080
Yes!

457
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,600
As for you, we'll talk when we return.

458
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,520
Go back.

459
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,560
Brother Wanyan, I've kept watch for days and finally hunted this bear.

460
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,340
Brother-in-Law.

461
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,340
Tell me. Why did you lie to me?

462
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,720
I grew up without my parents.

463
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,960
My master brought me up.

464
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,180
Ever since I got injured, you treated me so well.

465
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,680
In this world, no one treats me this nicely except you.

466
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,140
Actually, I recovered half a month ago.

467
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,519
Half a month ago?

468
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,639
I didn't dare to tell you. If I told you, you'd ignore me.

469
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:44,200
When that time comes, I won't be able to keep up with you, and I can't win against you in a fight.

470
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,519
I would rather not move like this.

471
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:48,519
That way, you can keep me company every day.

472
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,740
You want me to accompany you every day?

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,819
I injured you seriously, and you still want me to accompany you every day?

474
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,519
Why did you have to injure me so seriously?

475
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,140
If you didn't use poison needles, would I...

476
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,300
I injured you so badly, don't you hate me?

477
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,079
Why would I want to hate you?

478
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,279
I just wanted you to stay with me.

479
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,320
Now, you're with me every day.

480
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,700
I can't be happier.

481
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,420
It makes me so happy thinking about it.

482
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,079
Brother-in-Law, why don't you guess the reason I want to use the poisonous needles on you?

483
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,320
How would I know what you're thinking?

484
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,380
I won't tell you if you can't guess.

485
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,539
Since you don't have to hunt for bears and I'm all recovered,

486
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,759
why don't you take me out to have some fun?

487
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,500
I've been pretending to be ill for half a month.

488
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,440
No.

489
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,519
Take me, Brother-in-Law.

490
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,299
Brother-in-Law, take me out!

491
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,679
Let's go.

492
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,600
Hurry up!

493
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,660
Brother-in-Law, we've been to the north and east.

494
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,879
Let's head to the west.

495
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,519
There's only a prairie in the west.

496
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,840
There's nothing to see there.

497
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,639
Prairie is pretty good.

498
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,279
It looks like the ocean.

499
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,839
I've never seen a real ocean.

500
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,540
Xingxiu Sea is only a swamp.

501
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,599
A small lake.

502
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,820
Since you want to go to the west, we'll go to the west then.

503
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,520
After you're fully recovered, I'll take you to the borders of Goryeo (Korea).

504
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,279
You can see the ocean from there.

505
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,800
There's no need to wait until I'm all better. I can go now. Let's go!

506
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,400
Let's go!

507
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,600
Why are there so many people?

508
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,300
What are they doing?

509
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,459
Let's go and take a look.

510
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,240
You don't even know what they're doing. Don't make trouble for others.

511
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,660
It's not easy for me to come out for fun.

512
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,139
Don't worry. I won't give you trouble. Let's go.

513
00:32:06,139 --> 00:32:07,800
Wait a minute.

514
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,160
That looks like my sworn brother's subordinate.

515
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,100
So, it's you!

516
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,120
Yes, it is I, Shi Li!

517
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,460
His name is Shi Li.

518
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,560
Greetings, Master Xiao.

519
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,159
My master is not far ahead.

520
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,439
He always talks about you and misses you a lot.

521
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:38,159
What brings you here today?

522
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,859
Please go and see my master.

523
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:44,199
The two of us are just wandering about in this area.

524
00:32:44,199 --> 00:32:45,639
Is my brother just nearby?

525
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,799
Please lead the way then. I'll go meet him.

526
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,279
- Go and report that Master Xiao of Changbai Mountain is here.
- Yes!

527
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,020
Master Xiao, you're here just in time.

528
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,079
Tomorrow morning, there's going to be a lively occasion here.

529
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,359
What kind of occasion?

530
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,879
It's Martial Arts Day tomorrow.

531
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,359
The positions for the Commander of Royal Guards for Yongchang and Taihe Palace are vacant.

532
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,479
Our Khitan soldiers will show their martial arts skills

533
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,519
and see who's lucky to fill the positions.

534
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,159
I guess we really came at the right time

535
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,740
to see Khitan's martial arts.

536
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,719
Captain, you'll be showing your skills tomorrow.

537
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:17,219
So let me congratulate you in advance for taking the post then.

538
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:19,260
I dare not.

539
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,500
As long as my brother-in-law teaches you some skills,

540
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,999
you'll definitely get it.

541
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,139
If Master Xiao is willing to teach me, it's all that I could ask for.

542
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:29,819
As for the commander position, I'm not lucky enough, nor do I want it.

543
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:31,840
Master Xiao, this way, please.

544
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,920
Master Xiao, please come in.

545
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,780
My brother...

546
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:50,039
Master Xiao, my master has instructed me to let you spend the night here.

547
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:52,240
He'll see you soon.

548
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,200
Please have a good rest.

549
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,120
Please come in.

550
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,439
Master Xiao, my master will arrive soon.

551
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,879
Please wait a while.

552
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,280
All right.

553
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,639
Brother!

554
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,040
Elder Brother!

555
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,220
- Brother!
- My good brother!

556
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,640
- Elder Brother.
- I missed you so much!

557
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,339
It has been a long time. How have you been?

558
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,060
How are you doing?

559
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,560
I'm doing well.

560
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,499
This is my sister, A'Zi.

561
00:35:07,499 --> 00:35:09,220
Greetings, Elder Brother.

562
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,200
What a beautiful girl.

563
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,820
Long live Your Majesty!

564
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,439
Your Majesty?

565
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,240
Liao Emperor.

566
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,800
You're...

567
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,660
Yelv Hongji.

568
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,579
I had no idea, Your Majesty.

569
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,779
I have very much offended you and deserve to be punished.

570
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:36,680
Please forgive me.

571
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,379
Brother, rise quickly. Rise now.

572
00:35:40,379 --> 00:35:41,719
You too, young girl.

573
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,660
Today, we're brothers.

574
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,500
So drop all formalities.

575
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,559
Everyone, rise!

576
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,400
Thank you, Your Majesty!

577
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,519
Guards!

578
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,060
Yes, Your Majesty!

579
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,519
Send my order to prepare for a feast!

580
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

581
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,660
His Majesty has given an order.

582
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,800
Prepare a feast!

583
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,500
Brother! Come here.

584
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,100
Let me introduce you to some people.

585
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,999
The Great Prince of North Court. The Privy Councilor of the North Court.

586
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,420
- Hero Xiao, we drink to you.
- I drink to you.

587
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,120
Cheers!

588
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,200
General Pishi. The Privy Councilor of the South Court.

589
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,359
Hero Xiao, a toast to you.

590
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:53,900
I drink to you.

591
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,580
Hero Xiao, you can really hold your drinks.

592
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,600
Hero Xiao, let's drink.

593
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,120
- Cheers!
- Come.

594
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,700
Cheers!

595
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,319
Cheers!

596
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,740
Come.

597
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,679
Cheers!

598
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,440
Drink more, Hero Xiao.

599
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,539
- Brother.
- All right.

600
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,579
Come, let us all drink to Hero Xiao!

601
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,879
Come, everyone!

602
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,679
Let's drink to Hero Xiao!

603
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,260
I'll drink to all of you.

604
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,159
Come! Everyone, let us thank Hero Xiao.

605
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:36,719
Thank you, Hero Xiao, for saving His Majesty.

606
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,519
Cheers!

607
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,999
You can hold your drinks well!

608
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,740
Great!

609
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,440
Good drinker!

610
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,799
Brother Xiao, you're considered the number one hero in the Liao Kingdom.

611
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:00,600
No, he's not.

612
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,440
He's the second-best at most.

613
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,099
If he's the second, who's the first then?

614
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:10,139
The number one hero is naturally Your Majesty.

615
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,620
My brother-in-law may be capable,

616
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:14,759
but he still needs to follow your orders.

617
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,600
Who's number one if not you?

618
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,080
Well said. Very well said!

619
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,439
In this case, I must grant you a high-ranking title then.

620
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:30,020
Let me think about what title I should give you.

621
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:33,740
Your Majesty, I'm a person of little education.

622
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,780
Wealth and rank aren't for me.

623
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,959
Fine.

624
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,459
What if I make you a senior official

625
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:43,399
who only eats meat and drinks without doing anything?

626
00:38:43,399 --> 00:38:45,840
Is there such a post?

627
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,300
Report!

628
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,879
- Your Majesty, the rebels have staged a rebellion in Shangjing.
- What?

629
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,039
- Rebels
- This...

630
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,660
- What?
- Rebels?

631
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,320
Cavalry General, hear my orders.

632
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,640
Yes, Your Majesty!

633
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,160
Lead your men back to the capital city

634
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,730
to gather military intelligence and report back to me immediately.

635
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:31,400
Yes, Your Majesty!

636
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,739
General Pishi, Great Prince of the North Court, lead your men to prepare for battle!

637
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:43,079
Yes, Your Majesty!

638
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,779
The Privy Councilor of North Court, barricade the route ten li from here.

639
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:49,119
Report immediately if there are any signs of disturbance.

640
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,900
Yes, Your Majesty!

641
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,339
The rest of you reach out to tribes nearby and other ministries

642
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,939
to collect army provisions and prepare for battle!

643
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,480
Yes, Your Majesty!

644
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,320
Report!

645
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,820
It's bad news!

646
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,099
Our scouts have reported that it was the Great Prince of the South Court who rebelled.

647
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:07,839
He has occupied the palace and captured Empress Dowager, Empress,

648
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,579
the princes, princesses, and families of the officials.

649
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:12,120
- What?
- All of them are captured?

650
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,640
- This....
- What?

651
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,770
How can this be?

652
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,130
- This....
- What do we do?

653
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,159
This place is heavily surrounded.

654
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,059
A fly can't even enter, let alone a human.

655
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,120
Do you blame me?

656
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,560
If I hadn't been so willful and insisted on coming here,

657
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,719
you wouldn't be trapped here and fall into this mess right now.

658
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,540
Why would I blame you?

659
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,400
After your sister died,

660
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,040
my heart has felt numb.

661
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,039
Coming to the northern frontier was also only to fulfill my promise back then.

662
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,020
If it was not for the sake of taking care of your injury,

663
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,720
I would have long gone with your sister.

664
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,139
You can't do that. You can't abandon me.

665
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:36,960
You can't leave me alone.

666
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,639
I grew up in Xingxiu Sect.

667
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,199
My master only taught me how to kill people.

668
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,820
But he never taught me how to be nice to people.

669
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,339
If I want to live, I must be more ruthless than everyone else.

670
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,839
You're a pitiful child, too.

671
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,880
That Old Freak of Xingxiu has indeed caused great harm to many people.

672
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,139
Back then, I didn't know why my sister liked you so much.

673
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:13,820
I didn't know until I met more people.

674
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,679
It turns out that someone who's righteous and values relationships

675
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,480
like you is rare in this world.

676
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,340
Brother-in-Law, do you know why I wanted to attack you with the poisonous needle?

677
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,979
That's right. Why?

678
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:36,199
I wanted to paralyze you.

679
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,999
Paralyze me? Why?

680
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:42,240
You won't be able to leave me that way.

681
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,340
What a childish idea.

682
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,519
What else can I do?

683
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,899
What if you hate me one day and abandon me?

684
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,180
Do you really want to follow me?

685
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,640
Yes.

686
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,280
Then, I'll have to take care of you all my life.

♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

704
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,920
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

705
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,240
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

706
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,760
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

707
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,200
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

708
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,300
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

709
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,660
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

710
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,310
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

711
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:20,030
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

712
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,050
Relay my orders.

713
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,260
Tomorrow, I will go to fight myself.

714
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,730
Any who does well will be promoted,

715
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,450
and rewarded heavily!

716
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:47,220
Long live the Emperor!
