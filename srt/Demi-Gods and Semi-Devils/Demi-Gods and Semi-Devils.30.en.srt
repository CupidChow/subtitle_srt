[Episode 30]

13
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,859
Brother-in-Law, is there something bothering you?

14
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,179
Ever since I started to practice martial arts, all my friends were heroes.

15
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,420
In the martial arts world, I saw many cases

16
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,439
of those being secretly framed, ambushed, and poisoned.

17
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:54,539
But I never thought of using money to bribe others.

18
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,860
Although I'm a Khitan,

19
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,319
I grew up in the Southern Four Dynasties.

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,460
But today,

21
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,340
His Majesty wants me to bring down Song and make it the first priority.

22
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,639
I'm not willing to do so.

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,158
But you're the Great Prince of the South Palace now, of course, you need to serve him.

24
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:15,199
In my opinion, the people of the Central Plains treated you badly.

25
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,479
You should just attack and catch them all, so you can let your rage out.

26
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,599
I have seen two countries engaged in a war before.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,520
No matter who the winner is, countless common people died and got injured.

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,319
How can I put them in danger because of my own resentment?

29
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,600
So what do you plan to do now?

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,059
His Majesty granted me the Great Prince of the South Palace title out of kindness.

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,080
If I resign now,

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,079
I'm afraid I would disappoint him.

33
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm thinking to plan about it later

34
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,800
after I reach Nanjing and settle down.

35
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,719
That's good.

36
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,559
Even though everything here is fine,

37
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,799
but after you became the Great Prince of the South Palace,

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,300
you're always busy going to court meetings and training those soldiers.

39
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,159
You don't have time to accompany me anymore.

40
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,420
I think Brother Wanyan's place is far more comfortable.

41
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,079
Are you feeling better now?

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,800
Do you want to follow me to Nanjing?

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,339
I'll feel better as long as I'm with you!

44
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,979
Not only Nanjing, but I can also go anywhere.

45
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,539
All right. We'll depart tomorrow.

46
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,980
All right!

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,500
What's wrong? You don't look happy now.

48
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,479
I'm useless.

49
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,439
I can't even pull the string of a light bow.

50
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,199
Don't worry. You'll get better.

51
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,159
If you really can't get better, I'll teach you the ways to practice inner strength.

52
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,439
It'll definitely increase your strength.

53
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,460
You need to hold your promise.

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,020
Quick! Quick!

55
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,640
Move faster!

56
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,719
What happened?

57
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,879
Your Highness, our fellow companions are back from a raid.

58
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,040
Greetings to the Great Prince of the South Palace.

59
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,300
Our raid today was most successful, thanks to Your Highness.

60
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,640
We present you with the most beautiful girl and the best treasures; please accept them.

61
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,680
Kneel down!

62
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,819
Your Highness, I came from Zhangjiacun.

63
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,139
Your Highness, please allow me to go home to my parents.

64
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,839
I beg you, Your Highness!

65
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,260
- Kneel down!
- Faster!

66
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,640
Kneel down!

67
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,359
I have something to report to the king!

68
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,099
This is an important matter and you mustn't let other people know.

69
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,100
Your Highness, please allow me to report it in person.

70
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,920
Tell me about it.

71
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,680
Your Highness, I have something for you.

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,480
Go to hell!

73
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,199
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't do anything weird.

74
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Who are you?

75
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:24,520
Qiao Feng, you killed my father and my uncle.

76
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,199
I wish I could burn you alive and tear you into pieces!

77
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,040
Who are your father and your uncle?

78
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,480
I don't want to live anyway.

79
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,540
I want to let you know,

80
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,159
as the son of the You family from Heroes' Gathering Manor,

81
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,140
I'm not afraid of death!

82
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,060
Qiao Feng, we'll get our revenge in the next life.

83
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,660
Father!

84
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,600
You are the son and nephew of the You Heroes.

85
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,140
What is your name?

86
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,320
My name is You Tanzhi.

87
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,540
You don't need to kill me.

88
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,500
Even if I die today, I refuse to die by your hands.

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,190
Come with me.

90
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,200
I...

91
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,419
Little brat, you want to harm my brother-in-law with your lowly tricks?

92
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,180
How ridiculous!

93
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,960
Can you leave all these people and treasures to me?

94
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,060
Of course. Wild beasts are scarce here.

95
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,639
Do you wish to use them as live targets?

96
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,340
The Prince of Chu loved to do so.

97
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,420
But we have only women today.

98
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,060
They can't run fast. If you would like it,

99
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,559
we'll catch more men for you in the future, Your Highness.

100
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,260
No need for that.

101
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,319
Bring your companions back and get your rewards.

102
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,960
- Thank the prince for his kindness!
- Thank you, Your Highness!

103
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,599
It's our honor to be rewarded by Your Highness.

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,300
Come with me!

105
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,740
I'll let you go today.

106
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,140
Next time, stay far away from the border.

107
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,400
Don't get caught again.

108
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,838
I can save you this time, but I can't save you twice.

109
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:37,999
Leave now.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Thank you, Your Highness!

111
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,039
Let's go!

112
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,819
Hey, you. If you want to kill me, just do it already.

113
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,220
If you want to take your revenge, you can come find me anytime.

114
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,080
Let's go.

115
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,880
Brother-in-Law, the brat wanted to hurt you.

116
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,420
Why did you let him go?

117
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,799
That day, I forced his father and uncle to kill themselves.

118
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,320
I had no such intention, but I already owe him this blood debt.

119
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,340
There's no need to hurt him anymore.

120
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,760
The scoundrel carries this book with him all the time.

121
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,159
It must have brought lots of advantages to him.

122
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,859
The scoundrel didn't kill me because he looked down on me.

123
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:16,799
He is a ruler in the Liao Kingdom now.

124
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,900
It will be even more difficult for me to take my revenge now.

125
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,459
But I finally found him.

126
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,700
Who was the girl beside him?

127
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,100
She looks delicate and beautiful.

128
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,680
Did she follow him because he forced her to do so?

129
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
Go!

130
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,061
You...

131
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,360
What do you want to do? Who are you?

132
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,500
Go!

133
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,400
Move faster!

134
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,959
What took you guys so long?

135
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,439
You spent so long to capture a fool.

136
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,540
I've waited for a long time.

137
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,940
Little brat.

138
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,360
It's you, Miss.

139
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,480
What should we play?

140
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,340
The weather looks nice.

141
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Let's fly a kite!

142
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,119
Help!

143
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,199
Please let me go!

144
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,340
Let go of me!

145
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,159
Miss, please don't do this to me!

146
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,061
Fly him!

147
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:04,119
Please let me go, Miss!

148
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,920
Go!

149
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,240
Great!

150
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,919
Turns out you can fly people like a kite!

151
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,860
Fly him higher, higher!

152
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,180
Miss!

153
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,760
Try to fly him lower, close to the ground!

154
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,480
Go!

155
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,379
Why are you so useless?

156
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,480
You fell so soon.

157
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,319
Treat his wounds.

158
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
Yes.

159
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,260
You did a good job. You'll be rewarded well.

160
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,959
Thank you, Princess. Do you want to play anything else?

161
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,439
I've had enough fun today.

162
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,359
Bring him over here tomorrow.

163
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,279
He wants to hurt Prince Xiao.

164
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,380
I won't let him die easily.

165
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,340
Did I die?

166
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,980
The girl looks pretty

167
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,940
but she is wicked.

168
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,240
He killed my father. He is my sworn enemy.

169
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,040
But he is really strong and powerful.

170
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,839
I can't even beat his servants.

171
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,140
How will I get my revenge?

172
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,000
Water...

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,880
Somebody help!

174
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,240
Somebody help!

175
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,441
- Get up!
- What are you doing?

176
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:45,180
- Stay still.
- Where are you taking me?

177
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,420
Go inside!

178
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,940
Princess, I've brought him here.

179
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,679
Why are you looking at me?

180
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,140
Are you upset?

181
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,619
I have to think properly about what I should play with you.

182
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,519
What are you doing? Hurry! Men!

183
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,220
Get up!

184
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,680
Beat him!

185
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,599
Let me go and I'll let you live. How about that?

186
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,760
Miss, you look beautiful. I want to be with you!

187
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,560
- I want to... I want to look at you every day!
- How dare you!

188
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,440
You dare to say those frivolous words to me!

189
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,320
I want to... I want to...

190
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,820
Miss!

191
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,200
Stop!

192
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,640
Shi Li, come here.

193
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,920
- Go on now.
- Yes.

194
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,640
What do you want to do?

195
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,900
Keep it away from me!

196
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,860
Take it away from me!

197
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,100
What do you want to do?

198
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,079
Get up. Don't pretend to be dead. Get up!

199
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,680
You...

200
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,260
What more do you want?

201
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,040
What more do we want?

202
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,719
We're taking you to Her Highness, of course. So she can have fun.

203
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,760
Get up! Get up!

204
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,400
Princess, I've brought him here.

205
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,840
Get him up!

206
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,039
You did a great job. Good job.

207
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,460
Shi Li, reward them with 50 taels.

208
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,839
Reward the blacksmith with taels, too.

209
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
Thank you, Princess!

210
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,280
Why are you looking at me?

211
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,480
You look beautiful.

212
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,899
- I want to look at you.
- You still dare to talk like that?

213
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:46,359
I put this iron mask on you

214
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,920
so you can never bite me again.

215
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,299
Miss, do you mean to let me serve you by your side?

216
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,219
Bah, you're a bad guy!

217
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:59,699
If you stay by my side, won't you always be thinking of ways to hurt me?

218
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,280
No! No, I won't hurt you!

219
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,679
I won't hurt you!

220
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,180
My only enemy is Qiao Feng.

221
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,580
You want to hurt my brother-in-law.

222
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,460
Then what difference is that to harming me?

223
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,640
It's impossible.

224
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,420
Little brat, do you want to die?

225
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,860
Of course, I don't want to die,

226
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,559
But... with the helmet I'm wearing now,

227
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,160
I look neither human nor ghost.

228
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,980
It makes me no different from being dead.

229
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,239
Do you know the reason I put this iron helmet on you?

230
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,500
You're really dumb. You're helpless.

231
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,700
I saved you. But you aren't even grateful.

232
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,839
Prince Xiao gave an order to chop you into pieces.

233
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,260
I think you aren't all that bad, so it would be a shame to kill you.

234
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,020
So I secretly hid you without telling him.

235
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,900
If you run into him, your life is at stake.

236
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,600
Then...

237
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,040
Miss, you put this iron helmet on me for my own good?

238
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,119
Thank you, Miss!

239
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,279
I'm truly grateful! I'm truly grateful!

240
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:25,999
So if you ever see Prince Xiao again, you must not speak.

241
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,359
You can't let him recognize your voice, do you understand?

242
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,999
- Understood.
- Otherwise, not only will you die,

243
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,399
but I'll be in trouble too.

244
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,020
Yes. I understand. Yes, I won't speak. I'll listen to you.

245
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,720
Thank you, Miss!

246
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,179
Shi Li, get some new clothes for him and give him a bath too.

247
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:45,199
He is covered in the scent of blood. It smells horrible.

248
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:47,280
Yes, Princess.

249
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,300
Come on.

250
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,900
With the way I look right now,

251
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,520
can I still be considered human?

252
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,700
His Highness has arrived!

253
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,400
Brother-in-Law!

254
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,599
- Brother-in-Law, you're here!
- You look good.

255
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,000
What are you playing?

256
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,200
I just got a new toy. Let me show it to you.

257
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,900
I'm really happy that you're here.

258
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,700
There are lots of people to keep you company and play with you, aren't there?

259
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes, but they don't make me happy when we play.

260
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,300
I need you to keep me company.

261
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
Brother-in-Law, this way.

262
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Bring him in.

263
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,600
What is he wearing?

264
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,200
Brother-in-Law, this is the Iron Headed Man, a tribute

265
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,600
from the Gaochang Kingdom in the western region.

266
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,800
His name is Iron Clown.

267
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,300
He was born with a vicious face.

268
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
He looked more like a ghost or a demon than a human.

269
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,800
That's why they put this helmet on him

270
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
so he wouldn't frighten others.

271
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,300
Brother-in-Law, can you take off his iron helmet?

272
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,000
I want to know just how scary he looks.

273
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,600
He is already frightened.

274
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,800
Don't force him to take off his iron helmet.

275
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,200
But that's fun!

276
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,000
If I see a turtle on the road,

277
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,400
I'll definitely catch it and take off its shell.

278
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,200
I want to know if it can live without its shell.

279
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,600
A'Zi, why do you always want to do things that harm others?

280
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
I love doing things like that.

281
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,400
Otherwise, you wouldn't come and see me.

282
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,200
I am the Great Prince of the South Palace now.

283
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,400
I am busy with many matters daily.

284
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,900
Yet I'm here to see you now, aren't I?

285
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,200
You're just trying to dismiss me.

286
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,900
If I were Sister A'Zhu, you would definitely keep me company all the time.

287
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,300
Don't say such childish words.

288
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,500
Should I get you some people around your age to keep you company?

289
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,700
I'm not a child. I just want you to keep me company.

290
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,000
If you didn't want to come, then why did you bother to come?

291
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,900
I came to see if you were feeling better.

292
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,100
Have you eaten the bear bile?

293
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm not happy.

294
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,090
I won't feel any better even if I were to eat a hundred bear biles every day.

295
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,300
It looks like you are feeling better.

296
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,400
Have some good rest.

297
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Brother...

298
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,199
The provisions for this month have been distributed.

299
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,600
As you ordered,

300
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,900
I've told all the teams not to make trouble at the borders

301
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,000
and avoid unnecessary conflict.

302
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,600
That's good.

303
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,000
When two countries are neighbors,

304
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,400
opening up the market for trade and barter is much better than fighting and killing.

305
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,800
Your Highness, that may be true, but we, the Khitans,

306
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
have been living in a cold and harsh climate area for a long time.

307
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,300
We're not as wealthy or as blessed with bountiful resources as Song.

308
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,400
How could we win against Song without strong soldiers?

309
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
Uniting the nations and leading an army are His Majesty's greatest wishes.

310
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,300
Now, we have a great warrior like you.

311
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,000
It is a great fortune for our nation!

312
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
That's enough.

313
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you need anything else?

314
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
Yes. One more thing.

315
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,000
Your Highness, there is one matter that requires you

316
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,300
to settle in person.

317
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,200
A while ago, we had some conflict with the Song soldiers

318
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,200
because of Prince of Chu.

319
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,400
In the end, we agreed to settle it peacefully.

320
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,400
Song has sent an ambassador, Shen Yaochen, to discuss the details.

321
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,700
They'll reach Nanjing today.

322
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,600
All right. Get some people to arrange a place for them and treat them well.

323
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,200
I won't attend the meeting.

324
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,600
You can't do this, Your Highness!

325
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,400
He was a spy hired by the former Prince of Chu.

326
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,000
He has delivered important military information to Liao as well.

327
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Your Highness, you need to attend the meeting to show your stance.

328
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,300
I've prepared generous gifts on your behalf.

329
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:58,400
Please have him continue to collaborate with us.

330
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,200
All right. I'll leave it to you.

331
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,200
Young Master.

332
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,200
Fourth Brother, how is it?

333
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,600
Is this a letter from the family?

334
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,100
I dare not hide the information.

335
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,000
I got some urgent military information in Dali.

336
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
There has been a major change in the Liao Kingdom.

337
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Prince of Chu rebelled together with the crown prince.

338
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,600
Xiao Feng...

339
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,400
I mean, Brother Qiao,

340
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,800
helped Yelv Hongji to put down the rebellion.

341
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,700
He was granted the title of the Great Prince of the South Palace and is currently guarding Nanjing.

342
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,300
How is this so?

343
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,400
Why would my brother...

344
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,320
[...told to guard Nanjing]

345
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Mr. Shen, you've had a long journey.

346
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,400
Here is a toast to you.

347
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Have a drink, sir.

348
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,800
All right.

349
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,300
Mr. Shen, I wish you good fortune, prosperity,

350
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,000
and a good future.

351
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,800
Good!

352
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
Prince Xiao.

353
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,800
I feel good indeed when I drink with you Liao people.

354
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,500
A toast to you.

355
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,600
Maybe you don't remember me,

356
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
but I still remember you.

357
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,000
At the Yanmen Pass that day,

358
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,600
you were the one who fought enemies with General Han,

359
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
right?

360
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Back then in Song,

361
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,100
you were only a lowly martial artist.

362
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,400
But today, you're the Great Prince of the South Palace.

363
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,400
You have certainly made great progress

364
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,400
in a short period of time.

365
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,000
I really admire you.

366
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,400
Come.

367
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,200
Let me give you a toast.

368
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,700
Mr. Shen, Prince Xiao can't drink a lot

369
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,600
and he has a lot of matters to deal with.

370
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,200
I'll give you a toast on his behalf.

371
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
No way!

372
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,400
I... I want to drink with Brother Xiao.

373
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,100
Mr. Shen, slowly now...

374
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,200
Go away!

375
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,500
Brother Xiao,

376
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,200
you and I are actually the same.

377
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
Let's not talk about the responsibilities and duties of the role one holds.

378
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,400
Let's put it another way.

379
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,200
Now, two countries are at war.

380
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,200
With the gold and silver we get,

381
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,100
we can live a comfortable life

382
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,000
no matter who wins in the end.

383
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,600
Report!

384
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Speak.

385
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
Someone leaked military information,

386
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,400
the vanguard team is under siege and we lost many soldiers.

387
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Young Master is in danger, too.

388
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,600
Where are the reinforcements? When will they get here?

389
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,400
They have been blocked.

390
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,600
I'm afraid... it's too late.

391
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,500
General. Young Master, he...

392
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Leave now.

393
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,800
When one receives a wage from the imperial court,

394
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,700
he should be loyal to His Majesty.

395
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
He is a soldier.

396
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,100
He should make himself a role model

397
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,500
and fight to the last moment.

398
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,800
There's nothing left to say.

399
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,600
But, General...

400
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,200
Sound the drums.

401
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,900
Give them a cheer and send them off!

402
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,600
People prioritize themselves first.

403
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,800
That has always been the case since ancient times.

404
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Here. Drink up.

405
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,200
We're peers now, after all.

406
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,800
You're the one who leaked the military information at Yanmen Pass.

407
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,400
I don't really remember.

408
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,800
But soldiers die here and there.

409
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,100
What does it matter?

410
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,000
Come.

411
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,000
Your Highness, you can't do this!

412
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,800
Your Highness!

413
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,800
I will never be the same as someone like you.

414
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,300
Mr. Shen.

415
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,600
Young Master.

416
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,600
Young Master, is something bothering you?

417
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
I didn't expect Brother

418
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:25,750
would become the Great Prince of the South Palace in the Liao Kingdom.

419
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,600
But it makes sense. He is a Khitan, after all.

420
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,800
The martial arts world of the Central Plains refused to accept him.

421
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,900
Maybe he can live a more comfortable life in the Liao Kingdom.

422
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,500
But...

423
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,400
But in the eyes of the heroes of the Central Plains,

424
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,200
they may regard this as another crime of his.

425
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
You always wanted to prove his innocence.

426
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,000
Now, I think it's even more difficult.

427
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
If you did something, then you did it. If you didn't do it, then you didn't.

428
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,500
What does it matter if he did become the Great Prince of the South Palace?

429
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,000
That may be so, but Master Qiao is skilled in martial arts.

430
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
If he sides with the Khitans,

431
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,100
it would be extremely bad for Dali and Song.

432
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,000
When you inherit the kingdom in the future,

433
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
you might meet him on the battlefield.

434
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Even so, he is my brother.

435
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,200
Young Master,

436
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,200
I know you've always valued friendship a lot.

437
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,800
But as the heir of the Dali Kingdom,

438
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,700
you have your duties and responsibilities.

439
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,200
If that day does come where you need to fight for your nation,

440
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,100
you mustn't put friendship before your family and country.

441
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,880
Your Majesty, I have sinned!

442
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,039
What do you mean?

443
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,718
I made the Great Prince of the South Palace angry

444
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,039
and I don't know what to do.

445
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,759
Why did you say so?

446
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,499
Your Majesty, a while ago, the Great Prince of the South Palace held a welcome banquet for Mr. Shen.

447
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:24,000
But somehow Prince Xiao got angry during the banquet

448
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,200
and even stabbed Mr. Shen's hand.

449
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,800
Your Majesty, Jeaven can prove my loyalty to Liao.

450
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I have been most respectful to Prince Xiao as well.

451
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,500
As both of us were from Song, I said a few more words to him

452
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,600
to indicate a gesture of kindness.

453
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,600
But I didn't expect that Xiao Feng

454
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,300
would react so badly and harm me!

455
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,800
Your Majesty,

456
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,300
I still have the same words.

457
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,000
Xiao Feng was raised in Song.

458
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,800
He is different from us. His loyalty is doubtful.

459
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,600
And now, he even holds military authority.

460
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,400
We can't be sure that he won't become someone like the Prince of Chu in the future...

461
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Do you want to rebel?

462
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,200
I dare not.

463
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,600
My brother is a hero!

464
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,100
How could you compare him to the Prince of Chu?

465
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,600
I don't need you to make such remarks about him here.

466
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,400
I've said this before.

467
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,700
If someone brings up Xiao Feng's heritage against him again,

468
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,800
I'll kill his entire family!

469
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,200
Your Majesty!

470
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Even if you want to repay him for saving your life,

471
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,000
you can't surrender the country to him!

472
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,800
We won't stand to have a foreigner

473
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,200
become the emperor of our kingdom, Your Majesty!

474
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Even if you're going to kill me today,

475
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,600
I still want to say it out loud.

476
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,400
If we aren't wary of Xiao Feng,

477
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
he'll surely become a great threat to us, Your Majesty!

478
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,800
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty.

479
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,400
Please reconsider!

480
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,800
Shi Li!

481
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,700
Princess.

482
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,600
Why hasn't my brother-in-law come to see me?

483
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,400
Princess, Prince Xiao is busy with military training today.

484
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,000
He is now at the training ground.

485
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,600
Military training again!

486
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,800
He would rather spend his time with the barbarians than with me!

487
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,700
All right then. He didn't allow me to practice martial arts,

488
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,600
but I'm still going to practice!

489
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,200
Shi Li, prepare me a horse. I want to go out.

490
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Yes, Princess.

491
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,200
- Princess.
- Your Highness.

492
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,100
Iron Clown, come over here.

493
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,400
I want you to come over here. Didn't you hear me?

494
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,900
I need a loyal servant to do me a favor.

495
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,600
But Khitans are clumsy and they might mess things up.

496
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,000
Come with me. As for the rest of you, stay put.

497
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,400
Come on.

498
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,000
Yes, Princess.

499
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,000
Iron Clown, you mustn't tell anyone

500
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
about anything you saw today.

501
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,300
You mustn't mention my name as well.

502
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,400
Can you remember this?

503
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
I can't mention any of this. All right, Miss.

504
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,400
Yes, Miss.

505
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,900
Later, if you see a strange insect,

506
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,800
don't touch it and don't scare it.

507
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,200
This spot will do.

508
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,900
Go inside!

509
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Miss, what sort of pot is that? It's amazing.

510
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I can't believe it brought out such a big centipede!

511
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,700
What did I tell you just now?

512
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,400
Come on. Let's go.

513
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,200
Yes, Miss.

514
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,000
- Princess.
- Take him away and set things up in his quarters.

515
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Yes, Princess.

516
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,400
Come on.

517
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,100
Miss took me outside today.

518
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,500
I guess I was wrong about her before.

519
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,000
Miss, why are you...

520
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,200
Check it out!

521
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,500
Isn't it huge?

522
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,600
- Miss, what are you doing?
- Rooster!

523
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,200
Princess, I've caught the rooster.

524
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,200
- Give it to Iron Clown.
- Here.

525
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,000
Okay.

526
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,600
Iron Clown, put the rooster into the pot.

527
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,100
Take it out so we can have a look.

528
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,400
Usually, a centipede would be eaten by a rooster, but this centipede killed the rooster instead.

529
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,100
That's good! I finally did it!

530
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,400
I have finally succeeded in this martial art!

531
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,400
You caught the centipede because you want to practice martial arts?

532
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,000
Miss, what is the technique that you are practicing?

533
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,600
I need someone to help me to practice this technique.

534
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,200
Are you willing to help me?

535
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,300
If I succeed, I will reward you well.

536
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,800
I don't need any reward.

537
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,000
Miss, please tell me what to do.

538
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,200
Great!

539
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,100
We'll begin now!

540
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,400
- Iron Clown.
- Yes!

541
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,300
Put your finger...

542
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:15,200
into the tile pot and let the centipede bite you.

543
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,600
You mustn't move while your finger is inside.

544
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,400
Just let it suck your blood.

545
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,000
The more, the better.

546
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,200
What's wrong?

547
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,000
You're not willing to do so?

548
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,800
No.

549
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,200
But... But...

550
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,600
But the centipede is extremely poisonous

551
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,000
and you're afraid to die, aren't you?

552
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,200
Let me ask you. Are you a human or a rooster?

553
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm not a rooster.

554
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,900
A rooster will die when bitten by a centipede.

555
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,300
But you're a human, of course, you won't die.

556
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,200
And you said that you would do anything for me.

557
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,600
The centipede will only suck a little bit of your blood.

558
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:10,700
