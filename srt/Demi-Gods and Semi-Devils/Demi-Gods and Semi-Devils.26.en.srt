00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,010
♫ Suddenly entering and leaving the red dust of
the rivers and lakes with a thought ♫

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:14,920
♫ Looking around everywhere are lonely smiles ♫

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,640
♫ Looking for the path of fallen flowers and remnant snow ♫

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,770
♫ Greed and betrayal, deliberate or unintentional ♫

5
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,380
♫ After many years, things are different ♫

6
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:39,530
One side of the martial arts world is like a dream,
a group of heroes fighting for power ♫

7
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,670
♫ A piece of the world, walking with horses,
talking about life with a smile ♫

8
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:53,640
♫ Ruling the world, with lonely brothers
turning against each other ♫

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,740
♫ Both honored and disgraced, tasting the warmth and cold,
making it hard finding a place to return ♫

10
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,260
♫ Ruling the world, with lonely brothers
turning against each other ♫

[The Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils]

13
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:32,980
[Episode 26]

14
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,660
Her death is on you, too.

15
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,639
She lied to me, not the other way round.

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,320
I only beat her in her own game.

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,540
You're so cruel.

18
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,460
You murdered your husband.

19
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,759
You killed your lovers.

20
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,200
Now, you want to kill the man who refuses to take a look at your face.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,940
I'm such a beauty.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,119
Why don't you want to look at me?

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,540
Let me ask you one last thing.

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,099
Who was the leader that wrote to Chief Wang?

25
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,080
Qiao Feng. Look at both of us.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,040
Which one of us is pleading now?

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,119
Everyone who knew his name has died.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,380
Now there is only me and him.

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,039
It's not that difficult for you to find out his name.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,260
You only have

31
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,040
to give me a hug,

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,200
and take a good look at me.

33
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,200
Then, I'll reveal his name.

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,540
Tell me.

35
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,879
At that time, why didn't you look at me directly?

36
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,940
Do you hate me?

37
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,260
If you don't hate me,

38
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,320
give me a kiss.

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,399
Stop fooling around.

40
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,720
If you don't want to kiss me,

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,040
why are you still hugging me?

42
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,219
Qiao Feng! Why are you so shameless?

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,539
My sister died because of you, and now you're kissing my father's lover.

44
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:40,199
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

45
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,079
You too, hideous woman. You're still alive?

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,739
Do you really think men will still be interested in you?

47
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:47,079
What did you say?

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,119
You called me a hideous woman.

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,079
You should take a look at the mirror yourself.

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,279
You want a mirror?

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,140
Sure.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,400
Enough.

53
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,660
Why are you so uptight?

54
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,720
Do you really like her?

55
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,279
Her death is nothing worth fussing about.

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,060
What do you know?

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,199
What I was asking her

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,839
was a question she alone in this world could answer.

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,079
If you didn't interrupt us,

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,300
she would've already given me the answer.

61
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,640
Well, I am sorry to have ruined your plan!

62
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,020
You should've stayed with your father.

63
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,479
My father's men are always glaring at me.

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,919
I told my dad to execute them, but he refused to do so.

65
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,159
So why would I want to go back?

66
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,919
Then, you should return to your master's side.

67
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,500
I stole a scripture from my master.

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,719
If I go back to him, he will surely kill me.

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,119
I'll go back when I'm done with my training.

70
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,179
Up to you. You do you.

71
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:30,439
I would've already taken my revenge if it wasn't for you.

72
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:33,600
Because of me?

73
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,239
I know.

74
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,340
You must be angry at me because I caused Madam Ma to be so angry she died.

75
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,319
I didn't expect the famous Qiao Feng would be affected by what I did.

76
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,500
It's so much fun.

77
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,720
What? Do you want to kill me?

78
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,060
You have already killed my sister anyway.

79
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,320
It won't matter if you kill me as well.

80
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,360
Where are you going?

81
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,199
Where are you going?

82
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,019
I promised your sister that I would head north beyond the Yanmen Pass.

83
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,359
North beyond the Yanmen Pass?

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,719
After all, I can't stay in the Central Plains anymore.

85
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,399
You'll pass by the Yanmen Pass on your way, right?

86
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
I'm going to meet my mother. So, we'll take the same route.

87
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,199
You'll be on your own. Don't follow me.

88
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Why?

89
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,959
A young girl and a man.

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,039
It'll be inconvenient for us to find accommodation.

91
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,219
What a joke. I don't think it will cause any inconvenience.

92
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:35,839
Why would you think so?

93
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,319
Moreover, didn't you and my sister go through the same thing?

94
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,279
She was engaged to me.

95
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,119
It was different for us.

96
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,599
I always thought my sister was a demure lady.

97
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,739
I didn't expect you to repeat what our parents did.

98
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:52,499
You hadn't gone through the ceremony to become husband and wife, yet you acted like a couple.

99
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,280
Shut up!

100
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,479
All you ever talk about is this nonsense.

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,539
Your sister remained chaste until the day she died.

102
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:05,799
I had not done anything immoral to her.

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,020
I always respected her.

104
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,579
Who are you trying to scare? You killed my sister nonetheless.

105
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,639
Young Master, it's bad.

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,660
Madam Wang's boat is headed here. Straight to us.

107
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,340
Aunt?

108
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,079
She has always hated the Murong family.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,479
Why is she here all of a sudden?

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,580
I've no idea.

111
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,319
I think... I think she's here for Miss Wang.

112
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,879
In order to leave the Mandarava Villa, we upset Madam Wang's subordinates.

113
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,460
Young Master, what should we do now?

114
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,079
A'Bi, don't panic.

115
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,239
Since Aunt is coming, we can only welcome her.

116
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:50,599
I'll bring along my men to the dock to welcome her.

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,000
Please inform Cousin and tell her to come, too.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,580
Yes.

119
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,399
Which busybody told him about my arrival?

120
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,960
Aunt.

121
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,800
This way.

122
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,879
People at the manor saw your boat and notified me about your arrival.

123
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,219
We are honored by your visit, and I apologize for the inadequate hospitality.

124
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:20,359
Please have some rest, and I'll serve you some tea.

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,599
The Mandarava Villa has everything.

126
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not here for the tea.

127
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,199
Where is Yuyan?

128
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,420
I'm going to take her home.

129
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,081
- Mother.
- How dare you show yourself?

130
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,119
You are a young unmarried lady.

131
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,558
How can you stay with a man all day long?

132
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,519
Don't you worry about being the center of gossip?

133
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,880
Come home with me. Stop bringing shame to the Wang family.

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,540
Aunt, Cousin and I grew up together.

135
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,020
She is family. It's been a long time since she last visited me.

136
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,100
Why not let her stay for a few more days?

137
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,119
Murong Fu, Yuyan grew up at the Mandarava Villa.

138
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:01,439
She doesn't know how wicked others can be.

139
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,999
Of course, she thinks you're a good person.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,940
But I think differently.

141
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,599
I know exactly what you're scheming.

142
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,079
Indeed.

143
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,019
You claimed that the Murong Villa has a vast collection of treasured books.

144
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:19,759
But if you are to compare it,

145
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,319
the Huanshi Library's collection is nothing

146
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,860
compared to that of the Langhuan Jade Cave.

147
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,399
It's also rare to see you acting so diligently and eager to please me.

148
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,739
It's such a shame that my daughter has taken a fancy to you.

149
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,679
However, I don't like you.

150
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,279
With your limited intelligence and talents,

151
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:41,459
don't you ever think about visiting the Langhuan Jade Cave for the books.

152
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,959
Mother, how can you talk to Cousin like that?

153
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,399
Why?

154
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,279
Did I say anything wrong?

155
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:00,319
Since you were little, have you seen anything from the Murong family that is better than that from our Wang family?

156
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:04,479
He is a young man, yet he's so arrogant.

157
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,900
He got a few compliments from the men of the martial arts world,

158
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,000
and he thinks he is a famous man.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,399
And all of you, too.

160
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
It has been so many years since the fall of the Yan nation.

161
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,919
Why do you still stand by the descendant of the fallen dynasty

162
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,199
as he continues to dream of being an emperor?

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,000
It's just wishful thinking.

164
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,719
Aunt, you are the older generaton.

165
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,140
Of course, you can reprimand me.

166
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,259
But no one can smear the name the Murong family spent hundreds of years building.

167
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,010
Whether we can successfully reestablish Yan or not,

168
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,890
we don't need any opinions from outsiders.

169
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,279
Aunt, do know your place and refrain from making impertinent remarks.

170
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,160
Come home with me.

171
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,020
Aunt, Cousin is all grown up now. She can think for herself.

172
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,319
Why don't we listen to what she has to say?

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,299
I'm teaching my own daughter, and I don't need your opinion.

174
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,341
Get out of my way.

175
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:10,359
Aunt, Cousin ran away from home because of me.

176
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:13,819
I hope that you won't blame her before you understand the entire incident.

177
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
Mother, Cousin is your biological nephew.

178
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,999
Why do you hate him so much?

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,879
How dare you take the side of this man?

180
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,379
A girl is born to leave her family. Sure enough.

181
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,359
So have you made up your mind to not come with me?

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,339
Mother, I don't want to stay at the Mandarava Villa forever.

183
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,279
I don't want to spend my whole life reading books and looking at the flowers.

184
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,860
I don't even have friends.

185
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,499
I only want to stay by the side of the man I like.

186
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:01,799
I want to see the world through my own eyes.

187
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,899
Even if it may be dangerous, I want to live life the way I want.

188
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,880
So this is the daughter I brought up.

189
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,600
She is doing all of this...

190
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,180
because of a man.

191
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,820
All right.

192
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,680
Don't ever come back to the Mandarava Villa.

193
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,680
I will wait and see what happens to you.

194
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,900
Let's go.

195
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,860
Mother. Mother!

196
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,960
- Let's go.
- Mother!

197
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,559
Brothers, do you think it was inappropriate for me to upset my aunt in public?

198
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,999
Yes.

199
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,740
Miss Wang is a young girl who longs for romance.

200
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,919
We can understand why she refuses to go home.

201
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,279
But Young Master is a man of foresight,

202
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,519
how can you be as willful as her?

203
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,280
You made Madam Wang look bad in front of others.

204
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,519
Brothers, how has my aunt been

205
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,060
to our Murong family all this while?

206
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,080
She hasn't been very friendly to us.

207
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:28,639
That's not entirely accurate.

208
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,559
She is more than just unfriendly.

209
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,039
She loathes us.

210
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,119
Exactly.

211
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,719
When my mother was still around,

212
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,900
I thought the town wasn't big enough for two of them.

213
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,759
They are both strong-headed women.

214
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,319
Hence, they didn't get along well.

215
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,860
After my mother passed away,

216
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,959
I have always treated her with respect.

217
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,019
Swallow's Nest has helped the Mandarava Villa a lot.

218
00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:55,030
But what I got in return is her being so hostile against me.

219
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,250
Although Cousin has taken a liking to me,

220
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,750
Aunt refuses to let me into the Mandarava Villa.

221
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,359
Exactly.

222
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,940
It can only get worse.

223
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:10,059
So if one wants to acquire the treasured books of Langhuan Jade Cave,

224
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,500
a gesture of conciliation is not enough.

225
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,039
Instead of persuading Aunt, we should start with Miss Yuyan.

226
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:21,159
Although Aunt is stubborn, she is old too.

227
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,279
Sooner or later, the Wang family will belong to our Murong family.

228
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,479
So this was what you had in mind, Young Master.

229
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,719
We have misunderstood you.

230
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,399
I knew it.

231
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,879
Young Master is not one who gets distracted by romance.

232
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,119
There is a reason behind everything he does.

233
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,559
The Wang family doesn't have many descendants.

234
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,099
Whoever marries Miss Wang will definitely get the Langhuan Jade Cave, too.

235
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:51,180
Besides, Miss Wang has a vast knowledge of martial arts.

236
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,999
She will definitely be of big help to Young Master in the future.

237
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,199
Young Master puts the Yan Kingdom before everything else.

238
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,500
You have my utmost respect.

239
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,179
Unfortunately, we haven't gotten any reply from Liao.

240
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:06,839
We thought the Prince of Chu was a hero.

241
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,799
After we helped him, he would be tempted to join us.

242
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,979
Unexpectedly, he despaired because of the battle at Yanmen Pass.

243
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,279
He refused to show up.

244
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,619
We tried probing, but there was absolutely no response from him.

245
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,959
If that's the case, we should let this matter go.

246
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,999
Although I intend to reestablish Yan,

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,859
I don't need an alliance that is reluctant to fight along my side.

248
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,279
In the martial arts world of the Central Plains,

249
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,759
there are the prestigious Shaolin and the Beggars' Sect.

250
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,979
We are the outsiders,  it'll be difficult for us to achieve anything.

251
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,079
There's no hope for us to work with the Liao Kingdom.

252
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,679
In the Dali Kingdom, there's the Duan family.

253
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,300
It's even less likely for us to work with them.

254
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,159
If we want an alliance, we can only approach the Xixia Kingdom and the Tibetan Empire.

255
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,479
But I don't have anything to offer them.

256
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,360
It won't be easy to convince them.

257
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,879
As far as we know, both these kingdoms have princesses of marriageable age who have yet to be betrothed.

258
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:15,099
Have you ever thought about forming an alliance through marriage, Young Master?

259
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,870
[Cangbei Guesthouse]

260
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,180
Your dishes are here.

261
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,200
Beef.

262
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,920
Chicken.

263
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,639
Wine.

264
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,580
Enjoy your food.

265
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,159
This way, please!

266
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,199
Miss, can I take your order?

267
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,100
Waiter, what's your specialty?

268
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,879
Of course, we have a specialty dish.

269
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,520
But price-wise, it's not that cheap.

270
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,319
Is this enough?

271
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,120
Yes. This is surely enough.

272
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,199
Our store's specialties are sweet and sour carp, braised pork, and braised beef.

273
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,278
All right. I'll have three servings of each.

274
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,039
Miss, do you want to sample all the dishes?

275
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,519
Just serve it. Don't ask so much.

276
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,100
- Hurry up!
- Yes. Right away.

277
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,519
Three servings of sweet and sour carp.

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,039
Three servings of braised beef.

279
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,860
Three servings of braised pork knuckles.

280
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,580
Miss, your food is here.

281
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,119
- Here.
- Nice. Put this one here.

282
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,779
As for this one, give it to that man over there.

283
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,479
And, this one, leave it on this table.

284
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,439
Set up the table, and serve a bottle of good wine, too.

285
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,919
Is there anyone else coming?

286
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,439
Why do you talk so much?

287
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,359
Do you want me to cut off your tongue?

288
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,199
You want to cut off my tongue?

289
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,900
I'm afraid that you don't have the capability to do so.

290
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,900
Sir, the young lady ordered this for you.

291
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,380
What is this? This is so unpalatable.

292
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,799
I wonder who will actually eat this.

293
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,280
Is this for pigs?

294
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,359
There are wine and meat. Why aren't you eating?

295
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,880
You prepared this for me?

296
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,740
Thanks, Junior.

297
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,920
Thanks. Please come again.

298
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,319
Waiter.

299
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,900
- Come here.
- How can I help you?

300
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,580
Send this bowl of wine to that man over there.

301
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,919
What's wrong?

302
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,980
Hurry up. He's waiting for you.

303
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,399
Miss, but for what you have done to the wine, how can anyone drink it?

304
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:00,400
Are you saying that my hands are dirty?

305
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,919
No. I don't mean it.

306
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,259
What about this? You take a sip of this wine,

307
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,159
and I'll give you this silver ingot.

308
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,199
One sip of this wine for one silver ingot?

309
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,119
This is too good to be true.

310
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,939
I'll drink it even after you washed your feet in it, let alone your hands.

311
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,799
- What's going on?
- Get up.

312
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,320
Get up. What's going on?

313
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,540
Send help. Bring him to the physician.

314
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,359
Help. Hurry up.

315
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,620
Help me carry him!

316
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,919
Carry him out.

317
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,360
Hurry up!

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,399
Didn't you say that I wasn't capable enough to cut off your tongue?

319
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Look at yourself.

320
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:53,079
Am I capable enough?

321
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,540
He was only joking.

322
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,439
And now, you turned him into a mute for the rest of his life.

323
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,799
You're too vicious.

324
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,559
What has that got to do with you?

325
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,439
Why? Didn't you say that you didn't want to care about me?

326
00:21:05,439 --> 00:21:07,700
Why are you interfering with what I do?

327
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,660
Second Martial Brother,

328
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,540
let me serve you a bowl of wine as a gesture of respect.

329
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,319
Why don't you say anything?

330
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,280
Are you afraid that the wine is poisoned?

331
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,439
You're so impressive, Second Martial Brother.

332
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,279
You easily relieved the effects of the poison.

333
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,980
Let's go.

334
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,559
See you around.

335
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,759
What do you mean?

336
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,719
Our master is furious. He wants you to come back with me.

337
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,799
Just because our master is furious, you're forcing me to go back with you?

338
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,719
Are you trying to kill me?

339
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,679
Since you refuse to come with me, pass me the thing.

340
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,199
I'll bring it to our master.

341
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,660
At least, I won't go back empty-handed.

342
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,900
What is that "thing"? I don't understand what you're saying.

343
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,639
Junior, I'm not attacking you because we come from the same sect.

344
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,319
Don't overstep your bounds.

345
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm very cautious with my bounds.

346
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,879
But, Second Martial Brother,

347
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,980
I have promised this brother here that I would go to Jiangnan with him.

348
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,639
We'll bring souvenirs for Master when we get back.

349
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,199
Who is this brat?

350
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,559
How can you speak like that?

351
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,199
Don't be rude.

352
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,300
He is my brother-in-law.

353
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,279
We are very close to each other.

354
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,599
You took our master's... You little brat!

355
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,199
Do you really want me to attack you?

356
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,099
Brother-in-law, he's going to kill me. Help me!

357
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:03,230
You brat!

358
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,880
Brother-in-Law!

359
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,639
Second Martial Brother, why did you poison yourself?

360
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,280
It's so much fun.

361
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,580
Come back. Don't go yet.

362
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,119
Brother-in-Law, you're so amazing.

363
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,380
Were you worried about me just then?

364
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,559
Second Martial Brother has been gone for so long and he's not back yet.

365
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:22,639
Yes.

366
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,839
Were we given the wrong information?

367
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,919
Did he let A'Zi that brat slip away again?

368
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,599
Even if he didn't manage to get hold of Junior,

369
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,039
it's almost time for him to come back, too.

370
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,600
Eldest Martial Brother, could she have plotted something

371
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,110
and lured Second Martial Brother into her trap?

372
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,920
- Third Junior.
- Yes, Martial Brother.

373
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,439
Bring your men there.

374
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,359
A'Zi has always been a scheming and intelligent girl.

375
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,819
If we let her slip away again, it'll be even more difficult to track her down in the future.

376
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:46,760
Yes, Senior.

377
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:48,959
I'll send my men to capture her.

378
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,079
Eldest Martial Brother, you really have good foresight.

379
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,320
You must be the reincarnation of Zhuge.
(TN: Zhuge Liang, an amazing strategist in Chinese history)

380
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,759
Eldest Martial Brother is both brave and astute.

381
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,079
A'Zi, that prat, is bound to lose to us.

382
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,519
Yes. That's right.

383
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,720
Eldest Martial Brother is really a composed man.

384
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,240
A'Zhu,

385
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,620
I should have listened to you.

386
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,380
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,160
I'll leave Yanmen Pass and head to the north now

388
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,020
to fulfill my promise to you.

389
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,020
A'Zhu...

390
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,120
Brother-in-Law, I finally caught up with you.

391
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,720
Wait for me.

392
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,279
You fought off Second Martial Brother for me.

393
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,039
I'm here to express my gratitude.

394
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,260
You don't have to thank me.

395
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,479
He started it first.

396
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,580
I wasn't trying to help you.

397
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,679
Brother-in-Law, slow down.

398
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,079
Wait for me.

399
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,860
Brother-in-Law!

400
00:26:13,881 --> 00:26:17,740
Brother-in-Law, you promised my sister you would take care of me!

401
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,599
So many of them are bullying me now.

402
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:24,859
I'm only a young girl. What should I do when I'm all alone? You don't care about me at all!

403
00:26:24,859 --> 00:26:26,399
I'm in a foul mood.

404
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,700
Stop following me.

405
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,800
You're in a foul mood?

406
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:32,719
I can stay with you and cheer you up. Then, you'll definitely feel better.

407
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:37,119
If you keep following me and creating troubles like what you did just now, I'll have to take care of you.

408
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,059
Isn't it even better if you can take care of me and guide me when I do something wrong?

409
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:43,900
My parents left me when I was little.

410
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,039
I know nothing, and no one cares about me.

411
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,700
Now, even my sister has left me.

412
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,220
Do you really want to come along?

413
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,800
Let's make things clear beforehand.

414
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,039
If you hurt another person for no reason,

415
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,919
I won't forgive you.

416
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,439
What if the person attacks me first?

417
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,130
Besides, I only kill bad guys.

418
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,820
You don't have to decide who's good and who's bad.

419
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,720
When you're with me, no one can hurt you.

420
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,639
So you are not allowed to harm anyone from now on. Do you understand?

421
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:25,739
Sure. I won't hurt anyone. You'll protect me from all harm.

422
00:27:25,739 --> 00:27:28,900
Brother-in-Law, you're only my brother-in-law and you are already so controlling.

423
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,140
If A'Zhu were still alive and married to you,

424
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,340
wouldn't you have been even more... controlling?

425
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:44,399
Brother-in-Law, do you want me to sing for you?

426
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,660
No.

427
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,879
Then, do you want me to tell you a joke?

428
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,799
No.

429
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,140
- Why don't you tell me a joke?
- No.

430
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,699
- I'll give you a riddle, then?
- No.

431
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:56,839
Then, do you want me not to play the flute?

432
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,620
No.

433
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,379
Look at you. You say no to everything. It's really hard to get along with you.

434
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:05,399
You insist on me playing the flute for you.

435
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,220
Then, I'll give you what you want.

436
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,460
She's there!

437
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,279
The girl is too arrogant.

438
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,340
She hurt our Second Martial Brother, and now she is heedlessly playing her flute to lure us into her trap.

439
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,740
I think she is plotting something against us.

440
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,620
We have nothing to fear. There are so many of us here.

441
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,220
Juniors, please be careful.

442
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,799
Don't fall into her trap.

443
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,519
I will never let her slip away this time.

444
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,320
- After her!
- Yes.

445
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,520
Did you play the flute to cue your comrades to ambush me?

446
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,359
Third Martial Brother, Fourth Martial Brother, Seventh Martial Brother, and Eighth Martial Brother.

447
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:02,759
Nice to see you again.

448
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,799
What a coincidence. You're gathering here, too.

449
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,260
Junior, we didn't expect to bump into you here.

450
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,999
I heard that you injured Second Martial Brother.

451
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,799
Is Second Martial Brother injured?

452
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,520
Is it bad?  Who hurt him?

453
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,679
Why are you still pretending?

454
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,040
He said that you told someone to hurt him.

455
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,159
What are you talking about, Eighth Martial Brother?

456
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,060
You were the one who sent your man to hurt Second Martial Brother.

457
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,159
How can you be so vicious?

458
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,359
Aren't you afraid that our master will find out about this?

459
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,439
You hurt him, not me.

460
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,519
Wait.

461
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,080
You said you hurt him, not me.

462
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:42,100
Martial Brothers, did you hear that? He admitted that he killed Second Martial Brother.

463
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,279
Did you use the San Yin Centipede Claw?

464
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,879
Who told you that Second Martial Brother is dead?

465
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,359
He's still alive.

466
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,860
His injury was not caused by San Yin Centipede Claw.

467
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,399
Wasn't he injured by the San Yin Centipede Claw?

468
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,679
Then, I'm sure he was hurt by the Marrow Sucking Palm.

469
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,559
That's your expertise.

470
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,239
You're really impressive.

471
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,439
You even dared scheme against Second Martial Brother.

472
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,599
You...

473
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,080
Third Martial Brother, bring the brat back with us so that our master can decide what to do with her.

474
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,040
How dare you speak such nonsense.

475
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,679
Let's not get into a fight.

476
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,399
Junior has always been an obedient girl.

477
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,319
Why don't you come with us?

478
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,220
Third Martial Brother, I've always obeyed you.

479
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,879
I'll do what you say.

480
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,719
That's great. Let's go.

481
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,680
Let's go. Please go ahead.

482
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,420
Go ahead.

483
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,980
Go ahead? Why should we go ahead?

484
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,680
You should come with us too.

485
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,040
You go first. I'll be right there.

486
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,519
No. You can't do that.

487
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,840
We should go together.

488
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,559
It's a good idea to go with you.

489
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,100
But my brother-in-law doesn't want to let me go.

490
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,679
Brother-in-Law?

491
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,340
Suit yourselves.

492
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,840
Can't you see that my brother-in-law is just right there?

493
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,540
Oh, right. You're too tall. He can't see you either.

494
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,520
Stop right there!

495
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,460
Brat, come with us.

496
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,679
You look so calm.

497
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,560
Could it be that you activated the Holyword's Pot?

498
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,040
What is a Holyword's Pot?

499
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,679
Hand it over!

500
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,220
Hand over what?

501
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,680
The Holy... Are you crazy?

502
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:22,900
You know what I mean!

503
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,540
I've already gifted it to my brother-in-law.

504
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Brother-in-Law!

505
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,740
Brother-in-Law! You are so amazing.

506
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,460
Eighth Martial Brother, if you can pull out your weapon,

507
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,159
I'll go back with you.

508
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,639
Your martial arts skills are impressive.

509
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,020
We truly respect your skills.

510
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,719
That... The pot is our sect's treasure.

511
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,940
It won't be useful in someone else's hand.

512
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,279
Please return the pot to us.

513
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,500
We'll be very thankful for your kindness.

514
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,679
It's not with me.

515
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,119
Hold on!

516
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,739
Leave the Holyword's Pot with us, or you will be in huge trouble!

517
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:12,439
You've spent a long time arguing, and I still have no idea what a Holyword's Pot is.

518
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,100
Show me.

519
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,640
Brother-in-Law, didn't I pass it to you just now?

520
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,660
It's all up to you now.

521
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:24,339
You passed so many things to me just now. How would I know which one you're talking about?

522
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:26,359
It's a delicate small pot.

523
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,199
It's one of our sect's three treasures.

524
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,079
We use that to practice the Great Energy Dissolving Skill.

525
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,760
Eighth Junior, you talked too much!

526
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,740
The Great Energy Dissolving Skill?

527
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,419
- Give it to me.
- Brother-in-Law, didn't I already give it to you?

528
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:46,819
It's a tiny silver pot.

529
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,420
Forget it.

530
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,199
If you have no intention to change your attitude, there's no need for me to cover up for you.

531
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,039
The pot is useless to me. I won't keep it with myself.

532
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,760
It's up to you whether you believe it or not. I've got to go now.

533
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,860
Brother-in-Law, wait!

534
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,080
Brother-in-Law!

535
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,020
Where are you going?

536
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,920
Surrender the Holyword's Pot.

537
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,640
Sir, your meal is served.

538
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,039
Thanks.

539
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,959
Enjoy your meal.

540
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,199
We caught A'Zi!

541
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,340
We caught A'Zi!

542
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,599
Second Martial Brother,

543
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,159
Eldest Martial Brother sent me here to tell you that we have already captured A'Zi, the brat.

544
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,959
That brat.

545
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,559
I'll make you pay for what you did.

546
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
Let's go!

547
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,739
Junior, you got caught, after all.

548
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,880
I'm back.

549
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,399
Eldest Martial Brother has superior power.

550
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,520
It was an eye-opener for us.

551
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,839
Junior, you are quite something.

552
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,240
So many of us were running up and down just for you.

553
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,119
We even came all the way from the Xingxiu Sea to the Central Plains.

554
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,839
Even Eldest Martial Brother is here.

555
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,120
It seems like I really am something.

556
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,079
But if you count my protector in,

557
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,279
you really are no match for us.

558
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,159
You have a protector?

559
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,559
I wonder who he is.

560
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,899
My brother-in-law. You'll be shocked if you find out who he is.

561
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:11,360
People call them Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North.

562
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,319
My brother-in-law is the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

563
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,679
Qiao Feng of the North, the man whose name sounds across the entire Central Plains!

564
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,159
Now I know why.

565
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,879
I won't mind losing to him.

566
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,979
We'll be in huge trouble if the Beggars' Sect gets hold of the Holyword's Pot.

567
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,999
Eldest Martial Brother,

568
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,340
Qiao Feng is no longer the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

569
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,359
You just came from the West, and may not know what's going on.

570
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,980
Something big happened in the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

571
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,639
Qiao Feng was long expelled from the sect.

572
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,199
Was he really expelled from the sect? Really?

573
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,919
It must be true.

574
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,300
This is what all the martial artists said.

575
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,480
They said that he isn't a Han, but a Khitan.

576
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:49,199
All of the heroes of the martial arts world of the Central Plains want to kill him.

577
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,000
I heard that he killed his father, his mother, his friends, and many others.

578
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,420
He perpetrates every conceivable evil and is more wicked than me!

579
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,239
Why did your sister marry someone like him?

580
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,559
Are there no other men left in this world?

581
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,639
Why she married him... I've no idea.

582
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,720
But he killed my sister.

583
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,799
Then, it seems like you aren't on good terms, either.

584
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,719
The Beggars' Sect can easily outnumber us.

585
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,879
It won't be easy for us to fight them.

586
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,919
However, since Qiao Feng has been expelled from the sect,

587
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,439
what else is there for us to be afraid of?

588
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,359
Yes. That's right!

589
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,960
Junior, you stole our master's pot and handed it to an outsider.

590
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,460
How should we punish you?

591
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,759
Yes. I violated the rules.

592
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:38,819
But, Eldest Martial Brother, don't you want to retrieve the pot?

593
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:40,959
It's one of our sect's three treasures.

594
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,500
Of course, we have to retrieve it.

595
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,559
But my brother-in-law

596
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,159
is an extremely stubborn man.

597
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,999
I was the one who handed the pot to him.

598
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,439
If I am the one who asks for it from him,

599
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,839
he'll definitely return it to me just like how I gave it to him.

600
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,159
It will be different if someone else approaches him.

601
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,520
Eldest Martial Brother, although you are good in martial arts, the most you can do is kill him.

602
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,679
But it would be extremely difficult

603
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,399
if you want to retrieve the pot.

604
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,119
So, according to what you said, what should we do?

605
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,679
Release me.

606
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,879
I'll go to the Yanmen Pass alone.

607
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,679
Then, he will return the pot to me.

608
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,199
I'm only trying to atone for my sin.

609
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,180
You have to promise to spare me from the punishment after this.

610
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,420
What you said makes sense.

611
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,039
However, Junior, you

612
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,239
are humiliating Eldest Martial Brother.

613
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,919
When I let you go, you will flee

614
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,199
with your brother-in-law.

615
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
Then, where can I find you?

616
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,319
About the pot, we will definitely get it back.

617
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,180
As long as we don't leak any news,

618
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:51,370
I am sure that Qiao Feng won't leave so soon.

619
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,300
Junior, show me what you've got.

620
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,259
If you can beat me, you will be the Eldest Martial Sister of the Xingxiu Sect.

621
00:39:00,259 --> 00:39:05,039
I'll obey you and accept whatever punishment you impose on me.

622
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,879
Martial Brother, are you kidding me?

623
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,679
I am all tied up. How am I going to attack you?

624
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,999
Why? Are you plotting against me?

625
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:15,740
Am I right?

626
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,239
All right.

627
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,400
I'll let you go.

628
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,199
Eldest Martial Brother's power is phenomenal.

629
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,639
We are really impressed.

630
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,379
This is something we haven't seen before and haven't heard of before.

631
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:40,279
In this world, save our master,

632
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,119
Eldest Martial Brother is unrivaled.

633
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,200
What Qiao Feng of the North and Murong of the South?

634
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:47,479
They don't even deserve to carry

635
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,759
- our eldest brother's shoes!
- Yes. That's right.

636
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,620
Junior, now you know how powerful we are.

637
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,000
Unfortunately, it's too late for you to regret now.

638
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,520
You are quite calm.

639
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,400
Junior, take this!

640
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,620
Don't fret. I'll help you.

641
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,560
Brother-in-Law!

642
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,040
Use the power of the palm strike and fight back.

643
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,860
Eighth Junior!

644
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,239
You!

645
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,519
You haven't exhausted your power.

646
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,520
You have been fooling with me.

647
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,259
Did Master teach you the best skills of the sect?

648
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,839
Zhai Xingzi.

649
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,620
Eldest Martial Brother.

650
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,039
Why are you on your knees? You finally admitted your defeat?

651
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:42,739
Zhai Xingzi, you have lost the match. Hurry up and apologize to Junior.

652
00:41:42,739 --> 00:41:45,039
How dare a mediocre person like you try to show off your skills?

653
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,219
You have embarrassed the Xingxiu Sect! You useless thing!

654
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,499
Junior spared your life, and you were still trying to be a hero. Why don't you talk?

655
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:55,260
Zhai Xingzi, 10 years ago, I knew you were a pathetic failure of the Xingxiu Sect!

656
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,559
Today, Junior eliminated the useless guy of the sect.

657
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,119
It's a great contribution to the Xingxiu Sect.

658
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,060
Yes. That's right.

659
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,179
Eldest Martial Brother, why don't you talk?

660
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:09,880
Could it be that you still refuse to admit your defeat?

661
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,020
I admit defeat.

662
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,460
I'm not your eldest martial brother.

663
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,079
You are our eldest martial sister.

664
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,279
Amazing!

665
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,519
Eldest Martial Sister has incredible skills in martial arts.

666
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,600
From now on, the Xingxiu Sect will have a new heir!

667
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,359
We will be known by the whole world!

668
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,300
Yes.

669
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,879
You should defeat Qiao Feng of the North and Murong of the South!

670
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:32,120
Then, the Xingxiu Sect will be peerless in the Central Plains!

671
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,679
Yes. Our eldest martial sister will be peerless! Eldest Martial Sister, all the best!

672
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,880
- Quiet.
- Eldest Martial Sister is peerless!

673
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,060
Quit the nonsense.

674
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,479
According to the sect's rules, after we have a new heir,

675
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,399
what do we do to the former one?

676
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,079
Eldest Martial Sister! Please!

677
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:51,239
I want to show you some mercy.

678
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,820
But I can't disobey the sect's rules.

the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful ♫

694
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,980
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

695
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:35,700
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

696
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,920
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

697
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,250
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful ♫

698
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:48,820
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

699
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,180
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

700
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,360
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

701
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,750
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful ♫

702
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:06,290
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

703
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:15,010
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

704
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:20,960
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

705
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,370
I am Xiao Feng, around 31 years old. And you are?

706
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:33,780
I am Yelv Hongji. I am 13 years older than you.

707
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,010
- Then you are my older brother.
- We are brothers, let's bow to the heavens to seal it.

708
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:39,730
- Okay.
- Great.

709
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:49,230
Brother.

710
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,930
Big Brother!
