[Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils]

12
00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,959
[Episode 42]

13
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,219
Adviser has got the upper hand.

14
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,359
And our abbot has already allowed

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,639
the Tianzhu monks to leave if they wish.

16
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,820
Why are you still forcing us so aggressively?

17
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,959
The reason why I came to the Central Plains by myself

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,879
is to witness the paragon, Shaolin Temple.

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Today, after hearing your remarks

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,720
and seeing your behavior,

21
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,900
it's about the same as the Tianlong Temple of the Dali Kingdom in the south.

22
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,820
I am greatly disappointed.

23
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,779
Reverend Ku Rong from Tianlong Temple at Dali

24
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:16,400
has a deep bond with Abbot Ben Yin.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,939
All of the Shi disciples respect him.

26
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,840
Monks have developed a passive attitude towards rivalry.

27
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,339
Adviser, you mentioned that Shaolin is inferior to Tianlong.

28
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,620
It does not bother us.

29
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,880
I heard that Reverend Xuan Du had mastered the Flower-Pinched Finger dexterously.

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,360
If I can witness it today,

31
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,380
it shall be my great fortune.

32
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,940
- Grand Martial Uncle!
- Grand Martial Uncle!

33
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,679
- Martial Uncle!
- Grand Martial Uncle!

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,759
- Grand Martial Uncle!
- Did you get hurt?

35
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,900
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

36
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,880
Grand Martial Uncle, take this.

37
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,119
Grand Martial Uncle, don't use your inner energy.

38
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:16,119
Otherwise, the wound will bleed.

39
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,760
You have mastered the Flower-Pinched Finger well, Tibetan Adviser.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,960
I accept defeat.

41
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,840
Grand Martial Uncle, what he used was neither the Flower-Pinched Finger

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,639
nor the martial arts of the principles of Buddhism.

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,999
Don't speak nonsense, Xu Zhu.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,759
You said that the Flower-Pinched Finger I used

45
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,579
was not a martial arts skill of Buddhist principles?

46
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,383
Are you belittling the top martial arts of Shaolin?

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,999
Grand Martial Uncle was using the real Flower-Pinched Finger.

48
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:56,199
It's the genuine martial arts of Shaolin and Buddhist principles!

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,079
While yours is neither the Flower-Pinched Finger nor the martial arts of the principles of Buddhism!

50
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,479
Admit it! Yours is not.

51
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,959
Your Shaolin martial arts is obviously inferior.

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,499
Just admit it. Don't find any excuses.

53
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,999
True. Just surrender. Don't make excuses.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,239
I'm not making excuses!

55
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,919
What he used wasn't the Flower-Pinched Finger.

56
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,099
Master, he wasn't using the real Flower-Pinched Finger or the martial arts of the principles of Buddhism.

57
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:17,479
Come back if you can't defeat him.

58
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,039
- That's right.
- Masters.

59
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,960
He wasn't using the martial arts of the principles of Buddhism...

60
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,679
He's still arguing.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,559
- Because he can't win against Adviser.
- That's right.

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,919
Come back now.

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,919
- Xu Zhu, come back.
- Right.

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,120
How do you know if he was using the real technique or not?

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,839
Abbot. Master. What he was used wasn't the Flower-Pinched Finger

66
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,620
or the martial arts of the principles of Buddhism.

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,139
Grand Martial Uncle, he...

68
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,359
It's not the martial arts of the principles of Buddhism!

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,860
It's not, Martial Grand Master!

70
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,559
Please listen to me.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,540
He wasn't using Shaolin's martial arts!

72
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,320
Why won't you believe me?

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,799
It's not the Flower-Pinched Finger.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,920
No, it's not Shaolin's martial arts.

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,200
Why won't you believe me?

76
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,720
It's not.

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
It's not Shaolin's martial arts.

78
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,600
Why does Xu Zhu know the Flower-Pinched Finger?

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,840
How did he know?

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,980
It's amazing.

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,920
Where did he learn it from?

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,920
- Xu Zhu is so skillful.
- Indeed.

83
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,480
- I never knew he was this good.
- Indeed.

84
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,820
You're right.

85
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,220
So skillful.

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,940
Little monk, you have good skills.

87
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,499
Now, tell me whether my Prajna Palm

88
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:30,720
is from your Shaolin's martial arts.

89
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,100
This little monk has skills.

90
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,079
I didn't know Xu Zhu was so skilled.

91
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:00,180
Little monk, you're not using Shaolin's martial arts, are you?

92
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,519
- He's not using the martial arts of Shaolin or of the principles of Buddhism.
- That's right.

93
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,860
The reason why I came to the Shaolin temple

94
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,820
was to challenge Shaolin's martial arts.

95
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,479
How can you use such unorthodox skills to fight me?

96
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,320
Amitabha. You've misunderstood me.

97
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,439
I'm dull, I've only learned basic skills like Veda Palm

98
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,099
and Arhat Boxing after joining the temple.

99
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:31,699
I dare not compete with you.

100
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:34,160
Sorry to offend you.

101
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,200
It's good that you know your place.

102
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,420
Since you know you can't win me,

103
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,240
retreat then.

104
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,880
Yes.

105
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,600
Xu Zhu.

106
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,060
Abbot.

107
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,700
You're the successor of the third generation.

108
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,099
Adviser has traveled here from afar, it's rare to have such a chance.

109
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,899
You may use Arhat Boxing and Veda Palm of Shaolin Temple

110
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,460
to seek advice from Adviser.

111
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,720
- Why did Abbot ask him to fight?
- Why?

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,759
- Why is it him?
- Agree. It's useless to say anything now.

113
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,999
- Can he do it?
- Yes.

114
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,040
Amitabha.

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,780
Will Xu Zhu be beaten to death?

116
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,880
Let's see.

117
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,000
Amitabha.

118
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,480
Little monk, are you convinced now?

119
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,799
- Xu Zhu!
- Xu Zhu!

120
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,759
- Are you all right, Xu Zhu?
- Are you all right?

121
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,039
- Are you all right, Xu Zhu?
- Xu Zhu, are you all right?

122
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,420
Is it because of the protection from the Divine Art of the Northern Darkness?

123
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,120
I didn't get hurt even after receiving his punch.

124
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,040
He is still fine after taking my punch?

125
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Nimble Shadowy Legs?

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,400
It's Tara Finger!

127
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
Burning Wood Sword Skill from Bodhi Temple.

128
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,800
So fast.

129
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Palm of Thousand-Hands Tathagata.

130
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,700
It's truly amazing.

131
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,900
He claimed that he is well-versed with the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

132
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
He's indeed not bluffing.

133
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,500
Xu Zhu was able to deal with him with only Black Tiger Steals Heart,

134
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,000
that's impressive.

135
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Paramita Hand from Lohan Hall.

136
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
The Hand of Stele.

137
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Indra Grip.

138
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,700
The martial arts of Shaolin are truly extensive, profound, and robust.

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,100
Watch out, Master.

140
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,300
Don't hurt him.

141
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

142
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
What's going on?

143
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,800
- Who are they?
- No idea.

144
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,300
You? Why did you come?

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
Why are you dressed like this?

146
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,400
- Master.
- Master.

147
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,599
They called him "Master"? What's going on?

148
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,000
What's that? Master?

149
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,500
- Who are they?
- Master? I'm curious too.

150
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,200
The Shaolin Sect has not only deceived the public,

151
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
but you are also hiding women in your temple.

152
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Women?

153
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,100
What does he mean?

154
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,400
- They are women?
- Gosh.

155
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
It's sinful.

156
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,400
How could such a thing happen?

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,400
Martial Brothers, please proceed to the dining hall for a meal first.

158
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,300
We shall deal with this matter later.

159
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,600
Aside from the Martial Brothers from Xuan's generation,

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,200
the rest of the monks of Shaolin will return to your rooms.

161
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Xu Zhu. Hui Lun. Both of you stay here.

162
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,100
Ladies, please stay here for now as well.

163
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,500
Yes.

164
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,600
Who are you?

165
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,200
Murong Fu.

166
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,700
I see. It's Young Master Murong.

167
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,100
I'm the disciple of the Beggars' Sect.

168
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,900
Our chief, Zhuang Juxian is heading towards Shaolin Temple soon with Reverend Xuan Ci

169
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,600
to compete for the position of martial art world's leader for the sake of the martial arts world's unity.

170
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,700
He especially invites all heroes to witness it.

171
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,200
I take my leave.

172
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,800
How bold of this Zhuang Juxian.

173
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,000
He must be skilled

174
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,700
as he dares to compete with Abbot Xuan Ci.

175
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,800
But the Beggars' Sect has internal strife.

176
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,200
Instead of uniting his sect, he is seeking to challenge Shaolin.

177
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,400
It's not wise.

178
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,800
That's not the case.

179
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Yi Dabiao said he was just a puppet, didn't he?

180
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,100
All of the internal matters are under the control of Quan Guanqing.

181
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,000
The sect members are not convinced by him as he's inexperienced.

182
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's why Quan Guanqing came up with this method

183
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,800
to help him establish his reputation through this battle.

184
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,700
Third Brother makes sense.

185
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,900
Young Master. What's our plan now?

186
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,200
We were already headed to the Beggars' Sect to deliver the letter.

187
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,800
Why don't we visit Shaolin Temple first to check Zhuang Juxian out?

188
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,790
[Shaolin Temple]

189
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I see.

190
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,200
If it weren't for your peculiar experience,

191
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,700
you wouldn't have been able to withstand the Tibetan Adviser's superior skills.

192
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Abbot,

193
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm overwhelmed with ignorance and sinful acts.

194
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,400
I was not able to resist the temptation of evil and desire,

195
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
and committed the sins of murder,

196
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,300
lust, and consumption of meat and alcohol.

197
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,399
And I even broke the sect's rules

198
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,000
by learning heterodox martial arts skills.

199
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,900
Because of me, these four ladies came to Shaolin Temple...

200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,600
and tarnished the reputation of the Shaolin Temple.

201
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
I've committed the most heinous sins. I cannot be punished enough.

202
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,500
But I still wish to seek benevolence

203
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,200
from Buddha and Abbot.

204
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,000
All Martial Brothers,

205
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,200
Xu Zhu's experience is indeed unconventional.

206
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,900
This concerns the reputation of the Shaolin Temple,

207
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,600
I can't decide on my own.

208
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,900
I ask for your opinions so that we may discuss it together.

209
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,300
Abbot, although Xu Zhu has made grave mistakes,

210
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,200
he has made great contributions too.

211
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
If he hadn't subdued the Tibetan Adviser,

212
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,200
our sect would no longer have a place in the martial arts world.

213
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,700
That monk intended to ruin Shaolin's reputation on purpose.

214
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,800
Xu Zhu alone rescued our reputation from such a vast affront.

215
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,900
I suggest having him seek repentance to offset his sins.

216
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,400
Then, have him meditate and cultivate his skills at Dharma Academy.

217
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,300
And from now on, he may never leave the temple

218
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,100
or concern himself with matters of the outside world.

219
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,500
I believe that would suffice.

220
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
With his current achievement in martial arts,

221
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
he is qualified to study at Dharma Academy.

222
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,600
But he has learned heterodox skills.

223
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:27,000
Would Dharma Academy accept someone like him?

224
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,100
Martial Brother Xuan Can, have you thought about this?

225
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,200
What's your thought in this case, then?

226
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Xu Zhu has both sin and contributions.

227
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,000
Reward him for his contribution and punish him for his sin.

228
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,300
These four ladies didn't come here and disguise themselves under the command of Xu Zhu.

229
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,000
We shall come clear with Jiu Mozhi and the rest about the truth.

230
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,600
Whether they believe it or not,

231
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,900
we have no guilt in our hearts.

232
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,500
And neither should we bother about others' speculation.

233
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,800
But Xu Zhu has betrayed the sect

234
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,200
and learned other skills,

235
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,900
perhaps Shaolin Temple can't shelter him anymore.

236
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,600
Xu Zhu has violated the rules several times.

237
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Supposedly, his skills should be abolished and he should be expelled from the sect.

238
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,000
Nevertheless, his former martial art skills had already been abolished by others.

239
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,700
The skills he currently owns aren't from our sect.

240
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,800
We don't have the right to abolish them.

241
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,200
Abbot, all Grand Martial Uncles, Martial Uncles, and Master.

242
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I beg of you to show mercy on me

243
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,800
and give me the chance to turn over a new leaf.

244
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,600
Regardless of any punishments, I'm willing to accept them.

245
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
Please...

246
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Please don't expel me.

247
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,000
I beg of you.

248
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,900
Please.

249
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
Please.

250
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,900
Xu Zhu.

251
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,700
Abbot, may I have a word?

252
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,600
Currently, we still have six big matters waiting to be settled.

253
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
If Xu Zhu is expelled at this moment,

254
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,000
then it would complicate matters.

255
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Regarding the six matters you've mentioned,

256
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
firstly, Jiu Mozhi hasn't left yet.

257
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Secondly, Bo Luoxing has stolen the martial arts scripture.

258
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,000
Thirdly, the new chief of the Beggars' Sect, Zhuang Juxian, intends to become the new leader

259
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
of the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

260
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,200
Younger Martial Brother, what are the other three matters?

261
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,600
Xuan Bei, Xuan Nan, Xuan Ku.

262
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,500
Their lives.

263
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,300
- Amitabha.
- Amitabha.

264
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,900
I'm the abbot of this temple,

265
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,800
I am ashamed

266
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,200
that I was not able to manage any of these matters well.

267
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,900
However, the martial skills Xu Zhu currently possesses are all from the Carefree Sect.

268
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Do we have to depend on another sect

269
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,800
to deal with a matter of our own?

270
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,600
Abbot, what should we do, then?

271
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,100
We inherited the sect from our seniors.

272
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,300
Today, we're encountering such tribulations.

273
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,000
I think we should follow the right path and stand by our principles.

274
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,600
It's better to die with honor than to survive in disgrace.

275
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,400
If all of us could pull our weight together

276
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
and save the reputation of Shaolin,

277
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,400
it's because of the benevolence of Buddha.

278
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,800
If evil prevails yet our sect declines,

279
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,200
each of us shall forsake our life to protect the temple and sect.

280
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,800
As such, we will have no guilt then.

281
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,500
Shaolin Temple has been offering blessings to the people for thousands of years.

282
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,100
We have done good deeds and formed benevolent ties.

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,500
I believe that even if we were to fall, for now,

284
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,800
we will be able to restore Shaolin once more.

285
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,000
- Brilliant opinion, Abbot.
- Brilliant opinion, Abbot.

286
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
- We're willing to obey it.
- We're willing to obey it.

287
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,900
Martial Brother Xuan Ji, tomorrow morning, you'll lead the precepts meeting

288
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,800
to give everyone an account.

289
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,300
- Understood.
- Martial Brother Xuan Can.

290
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,400
Please inform Tibetan Adviser and the prestigious monks

291
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,800
to come to Yan Wu Hall to be the witnesses tomorrow.

292
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Understood.

293
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,600
Xu Zhu. Today, you have done the sect a great favor.

294
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,700
But for now, we must prioritize

295
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,600
the temple's reputation above all matters.

296
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Please be rest assured, Abbot and Grand Martial Uncles.

297
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,700
Tomorrow, I won't beg or show signs of cowardice before the people

298
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,400
lest they look down upon our disciples.

299
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,060
Really?

300
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,819
The new chief of the Beggars' Sect personally penned a letter to compete with Shaolin Temple

301
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:46,399
for the position of the leader of the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

302
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,460
This issue has stunned the martial arts world.

303
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,659
- Ding Chunqiu from Xingxiu Sect and Murong Fu have already departed for the Shaolin Temple as well.
- How about A'Zi?

304
00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,359
Our men have confirmed that Miss A'Zi is with those from the Beggars' Sect.

305
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:58,039
They have held Miss A'Zi.

306
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,239
They might be doing so to force you to show up as well.

307
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,239
If they came prepared, we might not get the upper hand

308
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:05,380
due to the minimal number of our people.

309
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,660
Since we're at the Central Plains,

310
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,900
we can't avoid meeting old friends now.

311
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,020
Listen, Eighteen Cavalries of Yanyun.

312
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,559
Depart to Shaolin right now and save A'Zi.

313
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,550
- Yes!
- Yes!

314
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:20,640
[Shaolin Temple]

315
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,510
[Yan]

316
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,530
[Xuan]

317
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,040
Adviser to the Tibetan Ruler.

318
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,680
Every Martial Brother.

319
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,239
Xu Zhu, the disciple of Shaolin Temple,

320
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,359
committed the four sins of murder, lust, consumption of alcohol, and meat.

321
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,180
Furthermore, he has studied another sect's martial arts

322
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:00,600
and become the leader of another sect.

323
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,220
Xuan Ji, the chief of the Discipline Hall of Shaolin Temple

324
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,860
will punish him according to the rules

325
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,300
with no mercy.

326
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,260
Xu Zhu.

327
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,599
Do you admit to your sins, as mentioned by Abbot?

328
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,420
I admit them.

329
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,440
I'm bearing heavy sins.

330
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,460
And I have nothing further to explain.

331
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,039
I'm willing to take the punishment.

332
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,800
Xu Zhu has committed the sin of murder, lust, and consumption of meat and alcohol.

333
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,220
You will be punished with a hundred beatings before the public.

334
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:37,200
Do you willingly and sincerely accept your punishment?

335
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,320
I do.

336
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:46,700
You have acquired heterodox martial arts without the permission of the abbot and your master.

337
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,719
You are to abolish your Shaolin martial arts.

338
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,179
From now on, you're no longer a disciple of the Shaolin Sect.

339
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,640
Do you accept?

340
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,140
I do.

341
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,039
Grand Martial Uncle is most benevolent.

342
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,999
What a pity. What a pity.

343
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:06,679
Since you're the leader of the Carefree Sect

344
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:09,439
and the master of Lingjiu Palace at Piaomiao Peak,

345
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,460
you must leave the sect and secularize.

346
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,719
You will no longer be a follower of Buddha.

347
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,279
From now on, you're no longer a monk of the Shaolin Sect.

348
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:23,159
Do you willingly and sincerely accept this punishment?

349
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,020
Abbot of Shaolin Temple,

350
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,700
all Grand Martial Uncles,

351
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,710
Martial Uncles,

352
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:41,020
and Master,

353
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,860
every one of you has been most kind to me. I'm indebted to all of you.

354
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,540
Sorry for not being a filial disciple.

355
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,120
I have forsaken your teachings.

356
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,399
Sorry for not being a filial disciple.

357
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,480
I have forsaken your tutelage.

358
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,999
Sorry for not being a filial disciple.

359
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I have forsaken your tutelage.

360
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,280
Abbot. Martial Brother Xuan Ji.

361
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,739
I reckon this little monk has learned from his mistakes

362
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,660
and he intends to repent.

363
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:33,599
Why don't you offer him a chance to turn over a new leaf?

364
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,680
You're right, Martial Brother.

365
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,840
But the world is vast.

366
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,280
There may be other places for him.

367
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,580
Xu Zhu.

368
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,740
We don't have any ill intention

369
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,340
by terminating your path to return to Buddha

370
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,240
as we expel you.

371
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,039
There are thousands of temples in the world.

372
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,980
If you truly intend to seek refuge in Buddha,

373
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,599
I hope you can join another temple

374
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,979
to make your vow to purify your mind and body and achieve enlightenment.

375
00:28:10,979 --> 00:28:13,420
Even if you don't practice as a monk,

376
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,320
you should work hard to practice the six paramitas.

377
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,140
You can still achieve Buddhahood.

378
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:32,300
I'll hold Abbot's words close for my entire life.

379
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,660
Hui Lun.

380
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,319
Yes.

381
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,479
As Xu Zhu's master,

382
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,719
it was your negligence in guiding him that lead to this trouble.

383
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:54,220
You will be punished with 30 beatings.

384
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,039
And you will go into isolation and seek repentance in Disciple Hall for three years.

385
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,400
Do you accept your punishment?

386
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,920
I... I do.

387
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,280
Grand Martial Uncle.

388
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,219
I wish to accept these 30 beatings for Master.

389
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,140
If so, Xu Zhu will be punished with 130 beatings.

390
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,620
Disciples who are in charge, bring the rods.

391
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,020
Yes.

392
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,600
Abbot!

393
00:29:42,325 --> 00:29:46,472
Abbot, heroes from various sects have requested to see you.

394
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,240
Martial Brothers, there are guests coming to visit.

395
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,719
The internal discipline matters will have to be dealt with later.

396
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,760
Xu Zhu, rise.

397
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,040
Yes.

398
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,879
- Master.
- Martial Brother Xuan Ji.

399
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,079
Lead all the disciples of Shaolin Temple to welcome the guests with me.

400
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,980
[Shaolin Temple]

401
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,120
Prince Duan.

402
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,539
Reverend Xuan Ci, how are you?

403
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,200
Greetings to Prince Duan.

404
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,220
Why didn't Young Master Duan come along?

405
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm clueless about his whereabouts.

406
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,979
Perhaps he has fallen into the hands of villains like before.

407
00:30:55,979 --> 00:31:01,839
Since Adviser is here, I would like to seek your advice.

408
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,759
Regarding Young Master Duan's whereabouts, I kind of know a little.

409
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,960
However, it's pitiful.

410
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,780
What a pity.

411
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,840
What do you mean?

412
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,260
When I first saw him, I could tell that he was outstanding.

413
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,500
He's the great blessing of Shannan.

414
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,779
Yet he fell for a pretty lady.

415
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:30,079
Since then, he will follow her wherever she goes.

416
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,780
His ambition has diminished.

417
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,520
Isn't this pitiful?

418
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,099
But it's also because of your profound Duan family's code of ethics.

419
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,820
Like father like son.

420
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,910
- That's true.
- What he says isn't wrong.

421
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,820
My unfilial son tends to go against the conventional rules.

422
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,100
I wonder where he is now.

423
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,459
If you do know, please, kindly tell.

424
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,160
Prince Duan.

425
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,919
Prince Duan.

426
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,719
Third Brother is invigorating and with strong health.

427
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:12,879
There is no need for you to worry.

428
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,959
Young man, have you seen my son recently?

429
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,240
Father!

430
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,119
- Father.
- Yu'er.

431
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,080
I'm here. Are you well, Father?

432
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,830
I've been well.

433
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,860
Second Brother?

434
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,939
You have someone you love now, don't you? Why did you become a monk again?

435
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,980
Since Young Master Duan is here,

436
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,719
Young Master Murong and Miss Wang must be here, too.

437
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:50,020
Young Master Murong, since you're here,

438
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,480
why don't you come in to pay your respects?

439
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,340
- Where is he?
- Where is he?

440
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,000
Has he come?

441
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,420
Young Master Murong and Old Freak Ding are fighting now.

442
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,220
Once he kills Old Freak Ding,

443
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,320
he'll come to Shaolin Temple to pay his respects.

444
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,679
Ding Chunqiu has shown his greatness,

445
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,919
and Young Master Murong is barely holding on now.

446
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,240
Do you all want to take a look?

447
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,719
Miss Wang is in trouble. I have to save her.

448
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,880
Yu'er.

449
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,359
How dare Old Freak Ding come to Shaoshi Mountain?

450
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,619
Today, all of us should unite and avenge Martial Brother Xuan Nan.

451
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:50,220
- Revenge!
- Revenge!

452
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,080
They are guests.

453
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,880
We shall greet them before the fight.

454
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,439
Friends, let us go and take a look

455
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:03,340
at the battle of martial skills of the Xingxiu Sect and the Murong Clan.

456
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,820
- Sure.
- Very well.

457
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:19,760
[Shaolin Temple]

458
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,020
You're so amazing, Master.

459
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,239
- Hurry up. Over there.
- Faster. Faster.

460
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,280
It's over there.

461
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,000
Old Fairy of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe.

462
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,600
Old Fairy of Xingxiu possesses infinite strength.

463
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Holding the realm in awe and dominate the Central Plains.

464
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,000
Old Freak of Xingxiu.

465
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,600
It seems that you've recruited many disciples within these months.

466
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,800
Not really. They're not his disciples.

467
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,200
They're just evildoers of heterodox sects

468
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,000
who serve as his cronies.

469
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,700
- You!
- You!

470
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,399
They're just masters of none.

471
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
It's futile even if they're large in numbers.

472
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
All right then.

473
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,700
I'll show you true martial arts.

474
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,800
Old Fairy of Xingxiu has joined the fight personally,

475
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,100
he'll definitely ace all duels.

476
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,900
You clowns should abandon your weapons

477
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,300
and beg for his mercy now.

478
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Miss Wang, it's dangerous here.

479
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,000
Let me carry you away from here.

480
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,200
- Come on.
- I'm not hurt.

481
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
And my acupoints have not been sealed.

482
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,300
Besides, my cousin is skilled in martial arts.

483
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,900
He is more than capable of protecting me.

484
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,100
Young Master Duan, please return.

485
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,000
No way.

486
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,500
What if trouble arrives later?

487
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,800
Old Fairy of Xingxiu descends to Shaoshi Mountain.

488
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,900
With a touch of his fingers, Shaolin Temple will collapse immediately.

489
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,700
And you'll have nowhere to escape.

490
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,800
[Beggars' Sect]

491
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,300
Master, let me give you a massage.

492
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,700
A'Zi.

493
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,600
[Beggars' Sect]

494
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,800
You must be the chief of Beggars' Sect, Zhuang Juxian.

495
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,600
Why do you wear a mask? Are you afraid of showing your real face?

496
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
Not at all.

497
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Firstly, his identity is suspicious.

498
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,400
Secondly, he doesn't have the confidence to win.

499
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,000
If he loses to Shaolin,

500
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,700
he can easily retreat and avoid embarrassment.

501
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,500
Brother Zhuang, it's crowded here.

502
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,800
Did Ding Chunqiu and his useless cronies come, too?

503
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Yes. There are quite a few of them.

504
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,000
That's great.

505
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,400
It saves my effort to travel long to Xingxiu Sea to get even with him.

506
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,200
[Xingxiu Leader]

507
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,800
What's wrong with Miss A'Zi's eyes?

508
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,600
When did she become the leader of the Xingxiu Sect?

509
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,400
My daughter is the disciple of Ding Chunqui.

510
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,200
She's weird and stubborn.

511
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,800
She isn't that skilled in martial arts and her eyes have been blinded.

512
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,700
I can't believe she dared

513
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,600
to usurp her master's position and agitate Ding Chunqiu.

514
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm afraid this won't end well.

515
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,200
With the few of us,

516
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,200
it will be difficult to fight Xingxiu Sect.

517
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,400
Xingxiu Sect has more in numbers.

518
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,800
We can't fight head-on.

519
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,900
If the situation worsens, we can only try to attack amid the chaos

520
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,800
and shield her to leave first.

521
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,200
An impersonator? How shameless.

522
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
The leader of the Xingxiu Sect is the Old Fairy Ding.

523
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,600
How could a Duan be the leader of the Xingxiu Sect?

524
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
- Show yourself.
- I'll crush her.

525
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,700
Right. Crush her.

526
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,000
If you dare impersonate the chief, show yourself then!

527
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,000
Listen, disciples of Xingxiu Sect.

528
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,600
According to the sect's rule,

529
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,000
the position of chief should be held by one who is capable.

530
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Whoever is the most skilled will be the leader.

531
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,200
Half a year ago, I dueled with Ding Chunqiu.

532
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
I had beaten him up.

533
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
He knelt to kowtow eighteen times

534
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,000
and handed over the position to me respectfully.

535
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,600
Why? Didn't he tell you?

536
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,400
No.

537
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:43,600
Ding Chunqiu, as the chief disciple of the sect,

538
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,600
how could you act so boldly?

539
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,400
You're disgracing your master and ancestors.

540
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,000
And you have withheld information from everyone.

541
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,300
How could a mere blind girl who's around sixteen years old

542
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,000
be the leader of the Xingxiu Sect?

543
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,400
Old Freak Ding is truly a hard nut.

544
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,800
How would he lose to her?

545
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,700
Little A'Zi, it's true that the leader of the sect

546
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,600
should be someone capable.

547
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:17,300
But if you covet this position,

548
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,600
you must first be capable enough.

549
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,100
How about this? You will only need to withstand three of my attacks.

550
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
Go!

551
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,400
This...

552
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,800
I'm dueling with A'Zi.

553
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,000
Why are you interfering?

554
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,800
How do you know the Xingxiu Sect's Corrosive Poison technique?

555
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,200
How could the chief fight at the cost of a disciple's life?

556
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,500
Isn't this the same as Old Freak Ding?

557
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,600
If Chief Qiao were here, how would this...

558
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,700
A'Zi!

559
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,600
It's Dragon Capturing Skill.

560
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,400
The distance between Old Freak Ding and that lady was so far.

561
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,900
How was he able to capture her with just a beckon?

562
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,000
His strength is really...

563
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
No.

564
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,800
There's a hidden weapon in his hand.

565
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:10,120

Abbot Xuan Ci, Shaolin, and the Beggars' Sect.

591
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,600
We have always been the same in the martial arts world.

592
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,000
But today... we need to find out who is better.

593
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,800
The better... is the leader of the martial arts world.

594
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,200
And the loser needs to listen to the winner.

595
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,400
Anyone in the world

596
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,700
who doesn't like how it is, they can challenge the winner.

597
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,000
Amitabha.
