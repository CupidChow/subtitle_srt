[Episode 5]

13
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,459
I really can't be your disciple.

14
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:37,879
I already have a master.

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,239
Nonsense!

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,719
Where's your master then?

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,719
Are his martial arts stronger than mine?

18
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,799
You have no idea what my master is capable of.

19
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,219
The Xici Commentaries of Yijing. Hexagram sequences.

20
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,239
Do you know them?

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,959
Explain Darkening of the Light and Before Completion to me then.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,680
You don't know these amazing techniques, do you?

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,959
So... Old hero,

24
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:11,319
I appreciate your offer but I'll seek your guidance after you have bested my master.

25
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,879
To hell with you!

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,380
Third Master Yue!

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,479
Did you hear that?

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,839
My brother is calling me.

29
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,399
I don't want to waste more time.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,260
Tell me where your master is and where we should spar.

31
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,220
This...

32
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,839
Speak!

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,079
I... I have no right to speak on behalf of my master!

34
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:42,719
Also, once you leave, they will kill us straight away.

35
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,360
How am I supposed to inform my master?

36
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,119
Saw that?

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,839
One neck won't satisfy my appetite.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,919
I want a second neck.

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,059
If you're slow on your feet, I'll break your neck.

40
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:24,800
Retreat!

41
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,380
My dear disciple, did you see how powerful my martial arts technique is?

42
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,299
Be my disciple now and I'll teach you straight away.

43
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,640
Third Master Yue!

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,079
Why are you so annoying?

45
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,099
My dear disciple, stay here and wait for me.

46
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,399
Don't go anywhere.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,100
Got it?

48
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,160
[Unofficial Soldier Manor]

49
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,560
Chief Qiao, General Han is waiting for you. Let me show you the way.

50
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,140
Here, please.

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,260
Yes!

52
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,680
Chief Qiao is here, Sir.

53
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,039
General Han.

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,841
Chief Qiao, we've finally met.

55
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:17,440
I heard something's afoot by the border so I came to help with my sect.

56
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,078
[Commander Han, Defender of Song]
Besides, Reverend Xuan Bei also brought his disciples and other heroes along.

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,399
They are in the city center now.

58
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,940
Wonderful news.

59
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,959
Truth be told, the sudden aggression from Liao caught us off guard.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,959
So I have requested backup from the imperial court,

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,999
but the Liao army is strong and well-equipped.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,520
Prince of Chu came to supervise, too.

63
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm afraid that we won't last until the backup's arrival.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,239
Do have a look, Chief Qiao.

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,079
Within several days, the Liao army has advanced several hundred li. (Li, known as the Chinese mile, is about 500 meters)

66
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,799
They have been stationed in Yanmen Pass.

67
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,679
Their cavalrymen attacked recently and we could only play defensively.

68
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,379
Chief Qiao, do you want to have a look with me on the second floor?

69
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
I'd love to, General Han.

70
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,500
Here, please.

71
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,140
Wait!

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,890
Here.

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,260
My hand!

74
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,080
Yes. Take it over there.

75
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,840
Okay.

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,580
Come, have this.

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,580
Have a look, Chief Qiao.

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,219
The Liao Army has the number and gear advantage.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,739
In this case, we won't last for three days.

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,159
Catch the ringleader and you get the whole gang.

81
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,999
To halt the Liao's advance, we need to take down their commander.

82
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,360
I know.

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,500
We did come up with the same idea.

84
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,799
However, the Prince of Chu is a powerful foe.

85
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,280
None of us can fight him.

86
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,259
Secondly, after you assassinated Yelv Bulu with your team,

87
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,759
the Liao Army reinforced their guard.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,019
Whenever the Prince of Chu leads an army, there will be four to five decoys.

89
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:33,019
It's hard to locate him, let alone capture him.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,660
Let's find a way to lure him out then.

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,340
Mister, have a seat here.

92
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,839
Thank you, Young Master.

93
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,039
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Mister, why is everyone here in a hurry?

95
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,039
You must be a foreigner, Young Master.

96
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,679
The land beyond the Pass belongs to the Liao now.

97
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,359
Most people have fled the place.

98
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,520
You can hardly find help here.

99
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,359
They are all refugees.

100
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,999
The Liao Army is aggressive in their maneuvering.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,479
We don't know when they might arrive.

102
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,899
The only way to survive is to get into the city.

103
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:40,219
That said, why is the city so calm and collected?

104
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:45,419
Because it's protected by ramparts and we have General Han here.

105
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:49,079
Everyone living by the Pass knows him.

106
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,520
If he hadn't fended off the Liao for the past couple of years,

107
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,470
this city would have been long gone.

108
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,759
Find a place to settle down and gather more information about the city.

109
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,739
Our priority is to find out both Song's and Liao's military deployment.

110
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,319
Don't act alone unless it's necessary.

111
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,540
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

112
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,599
And you, Young Master?

113
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,999
I have something to do.

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,399
Let's split up here.

115
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,839
Once I'm done, I'll meet up with you.

116
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,639
The Heartbreak Grass is still in my body.

117
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,120
That antidote must be a fake one.

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,719
If you die here, I'll disfigure myself with my sword.

119
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,158
I will not let anyone see my face again.

120
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,240
You shouldn't! Why did you take such a cruel oath?

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,019
I have been an orphan since I was young.

122
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:59,439
My master adopted me and raised me alone.

123
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,999
She taught me martial arts

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,799
and told me that all men would only betray me.

125
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,060
So, when I was 14, I decided to cover my face with a veil.

126
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,659
I never left the mountain and never met anyone.

127
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:20,579
This spring, the junior of my master, Gan Baobao, wrote me a letter.

128
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,520
Isn't she Zhong Ling's mom?

129
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,560
Yes. She is my martial aunt.

130
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,440
Get Zhong Ling off your mind!

131
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,059
Listen carefully. You are my husband.

132
00:09:34,059 --> 00:09:36,739
You can only think and care about me.

133
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:41,419
For you, girls other than me are pigs, dogs, animals!

134
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,159
But it's impossible.

135
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,300
My mom, your master, they are all girls.

136
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,060
I can't treat them like animals.

137
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,759
You're right.

138
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,500
What did Madam Zhong say in the letter then?

139
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,319
I don't know either.

140
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,679
I just know that my master was very upset.

141
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,839
She cried for several days.

142
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,719
She wouldn't eat anything.

143
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,039
All she said was two women ruined her life.

144
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,779
That's why my Master and I left the mountain to kill those two witches.

145
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,220
My master asked me to take a harsh oath before we left.

146
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,359
Heavens be my witness,

147
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,959
I, Mu Wanqing, swear with my life that

148
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,639
after I leave the mountain, I shall kill whoever sees my face.

149
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,980
If not, I shall marry him.

150
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,679
If he refuses to marry me

151
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,079
or abandons me after marriage,

152
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,820
I shall kill that heartbreaker.

153
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,499
If I break my oath and my master finds out, she'll kill herself.

154
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:43,439
But that's a weird oath.

155
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,719
Who would do this to themselves?

156
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,519
My master is a woman of her words.

157
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,799
After we left the mountain, we went to Suzhou to kill that witch, Wang.

158
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,320
We didn't expect her to have a lot of minions with her.

159
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,460
We were outnumbered and we got separated like that.

160
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,480
And so, I came to Dali to look for Martial Aunt Gan.

161
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,899
She said that I could stay in her place.

162
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,839
Once my master arrives, we'll kill Wang together again.

163
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:16,319
Unfortunately, Granny Rui and her cronies arrived before my master did.

164
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:18,659
You already know the rest of the story.

165
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:24,539
I thought you were just an ingrate, like all other men.

166
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:29,439
But who would have thought that you, who borrowed the Black Rose, would come back to me.

167
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,800
I'm not someone heartless either.

168
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,159
If you treat me nicely,

169
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,800
I'll be grateful for it.

170
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,159
It's okay, Miss Mu.

171
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,939
Back then, you were forced to do it.

172
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:52,300
So, it's not like you broke your oath intentionally...

173
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
An oath is an oath!

174
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,119
If you do not wish to marry me, tell me now.

175
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:06,739
I'll kill you with my arrow so that my oath remains intact.

176
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,400
Tell me. Will you marry me or not?

177
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,819
Miss Mu, I'm about to die.

178
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,479
What's the point of discussing this?

179
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,039
As long as you don't mind, I can marry you.

180
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,640
Really?

181
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,359
What's wrong?

182
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,060
Does it still hurt?

183
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
Dear Disciple!

184
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,459
Dear Disciple! Dear Disciple!

185
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,860
Why are you here!

186
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,159
My brother was right.

187
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,299
Be quick and you win the battle, be slow and you lose your life.

188
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:53,019
If you see something good, grab it.

189
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:54,380
My boss is stronger than me.

190
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,260
I have to obey his orders.

191
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,220
Come, call me "Master" now.

192
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,799
Your boss blew the whistle just now to have a duel with you?

193
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:10,820
How do you know?

194
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,639
You must have won, right?

195
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,799
You hit him so hard that he fled. Am I right?

196
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,039
We haven't seen each other for many years.

197
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,700
I thought we could fight for 120 rounds.

198
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,299
However, after a few punches and kicks, I was already on the ground.

199
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:31,520
Boss was like: "Third Master Yue, you have improved a lot."

200
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,460
No, no!

201
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,719
You have to remember that you're Second Master Yue, not Third Master Yue.

202
00:13:37,719 --> 00:13:41,139
My brother must have forgotten about it.

203
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:44,199
Little kid, do you not know how to ask someone to be your master?

204
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,959
I can teach you.

205
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,679
Kneel down.

206
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,719
And then, very sincerely,

207
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,239
you ask me to take you in as my disciple.

208
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,759
Of course, since it's only the first attempt, I'll say no.

209
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,479
And then, you'll kowtow to me and ask me again thrice.

210
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:06,579
After that, I'll say yes reluctantly.

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,599
Memorize it.

212
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,279
This is the rule of the Nanhai Sect.

213
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,359
You'll do the same thing when you find an apprentice in the future.

214
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,719
Don't ever forget it.

215
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,780
Kneel down now!

216
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,620
Hurry up!

217
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,540
Can you change the rule?

218
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,199
What?

219
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,239
I mean, can you change the rule?

220
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,759
Of course not.

221
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,260
Hurry up!

222
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,199
So, Second Master Yue, I have a question.

223
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,559
If you change the rule, then are you a bastard of the world?

224
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,579
Of course! Hurry up!

225
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,620
Great. Wonderful.

226
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,759
In this case, I won't kowtow to you.

227
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,750
I won't beg you so that you can be my master.

228
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,570
If you force me to be your apprentice,

229
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,250
then you're the most stupid bastard in the world.

230
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,119
I can break your neck now, you know?

231
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,479
Break it then.

232
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,039
I can't fight back anyway.

233
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,079
If you kill me, who will you be?

234
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,479
The stupidest, dumbest bastard in the world!

235
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,080
That's right.

236
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,839
What are you doing?

237
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,040
You will be my disciple.

238
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,980
But now, there are several people waiting for me on the opposite mountain.

239
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,159
I don't have time to play with you.

240
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,119
Think hard and clear how to beg me to be your master.

241
00:15:47,119 --> 00:15:50,219
If not, your wife's life...

242
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,720
I will...

243
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,120
Husband Duan.

244
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,220
Miss Mu!

245
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,720
Miss Mu!

246
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,900
Here then.

247
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,480
You. You are my disciple's wife.

248
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,479
- I won't harm you for the moment.
- My son...

249
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:33,840
Stop wailing already!

250
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,579
I've been waiting for half a day.

251
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,039
Your mom is here?

252
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,079
No, your mother!

253
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,940
She's No Evil Left Undone, Second Madam Ye.

254
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,680
I'm Third Master Yue, also known as, Malevolent Deity and Evil Devil.

255
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,639
Our ranking will swap one day!

256
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,419
What's the First Evil and the Fourth Evil called then?

257
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,600
[Second Madam Ye, No Evil Left Undone]
Boss is called Overflowing with Evil.

258
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,039
The Fourth Devil is called "Thoroughly Cruel, Utterly Evil."

259
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,120
So, Third Sister, where is the Fourth Devil?

260
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,639
You're ranked third.

261
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,279
You don't have the right to call me Third Sister.

262
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,359
If you continue, I will show you no mercy.

263
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,759
Show me then.

264
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,580
So what? You wish to fight?

265
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,080
Come at me. Anytime.

266
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,019
My baby. Don't cry.

267
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:21,480
Mommy's here.

268
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,920
Shut up!

269
00:17:22,921 --> 00:17:26,479
- There, there.
- Boss wants me to tell you to wait for him here.

270
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,459
If he doesn't return within seven days,

271
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:31,879
we'll head to Zhong Wanchou's abode in the Wanjie Valley.

272
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,100
Mommy is with you.

273
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,339
- Did you hear me?
- You are my baby, my love.

274
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:39,039
- Hush.
- Show me your baby then.

275
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,959
What is there to look at.

276
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,599
Third Sister, you're weird.

277
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,799
You keep stealing someone elses child.

278
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,759
You steal from this house in the morning, then return him to another house in the evening.

279
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,919
You know. I can help you to strangle him to death.

280
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,480
Come!

281
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,420
My, my. Third Brother.

282
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,660
Why are you attacking my baby?

283
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,320
My baby. You're adorable.

284
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,199
Once I have had enough of you, I'll find you a nice home tonight. Okay?

285
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,859
This lady here has quite dazzling eyes.

286
00:18:16,859 --> 00:18:20,239
It's as if they can talk.

287
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,399
What?

288
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,119
Are you saying that I shouldn't kidnap someone's child?

289
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,599
Third Sister!

290
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,400
My dear disciple!

291
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,399
Oh no!

292
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,999
I have to find that evil man quickly and ask him to be my master.

293
00:18:38,999 --> 00:18:41,960
Or else, Miss Mu will be in danger.

294
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,619
But he insists on teaching me that neck-breaking trick of his.

295
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:50,100
I don't want that.

296
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,720
Xin...

297
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,660
Branch Leader Xin.

298
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,620
Branch Leader Zuo is here, too.

299
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,780
Chief Sikong.

300
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,519
Don't... Don't come near me!

301
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,140
The Sacred Envoys are here.

302
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,199
Greetings, Sacred Envoys.

303
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,300
Sacred Envoys?

304
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,040
You may stand up.

305
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,759
Who are you?

306
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,640
Why are you here?

307
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,439
Do you mean me?

308
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,250
I'm Duan Yu.

309
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,800
I visited the Sword Lake Palace with a friend some days ago

310
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,990
and we bumped into Chief Sikong Xuan. And Mr. Zuo, too.

311
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,799
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

312
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,480
I really wanted to be the mediator

313
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,960
but somehow I made everything worse.

314
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,799
Later, Chief Sikong Xuan asked me to retrieve the antidote.

315
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:30,700
And then, I met a villain on my way.

316
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,799
His name is Third Master Yue, the Nanhai Crocodile.

317
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,519
He said I had great potential and wanted to take me in as his disciple.

318
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,559
He brought me here without giving me the chance to say no.

319
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,860
Is he telling the truth?

320
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,679
He is telling the truth.

321
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,339
He doesn't know any martial arts yet he's messing around.

322
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:54,139
And you said the two persons impersonating my sister fled to this mountain peak.

323
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:55,920
Where are they?

324
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,859
Young Master Duan, have you seen two girls with a black cloak dressed like us?

325
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,199
I'm Sikong Xuan. Welcome, Sacred Envoys.

326
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:28,359
Not at all.

327
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:35,019
I've been here for several days and I haven't seen someone who dressed like you, Sacred Envoys.

328
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,000
- Sikong Xuan.
- Yes.

329
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,310
You've worked under the Lingjiu Palace.

330
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,759
Yes, for eight years.

331
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,679
And you couldn't tell us apart?

332
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,919
How careless.

333
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,699
And here we thought you could help Madam Tonglao.

334
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:51,499
I suppose you won't find the antidote to the Mortality Talisman this year either.

335
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,900
I...

336
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,879
Have mercy, Sacred Envoys.

337
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,300
Have mercy!

338
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,539
You two. Bring Young Master Duan back down.

339
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,920
I will leave capturing those two impersonators to your sect.

340
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,720
If the Four Evils have issues with it,

341
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,210
ask them to find me at the Lingjiu Palace, Piaomiao Peak.

342
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,639
Sacred Envoy Fu!

343
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,679
Please write to Madam Tonglao and tell her that I've failed her terribly.

344
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,840
Master!

345
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,220
Master!

346
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:45,530
Master!

347
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,040
Bring me down there.

348
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,480
You can't imprison me for no reason!

349
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,600
You, shut your mouth.

350
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,659
If you keep yelling, don't blame us for showing any mercy.

351
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,879
Whatever will be, will be.

352
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,490
I shall submit myself to my fate!

353
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,560
[Unofficial Soldier Manor]

354
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,479
Thank you for your help, fellow heroes.

355
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,919
It is only right.

356
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,819
General Han, based on what you said,

357
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:35,340
we cannot confront the Liao Army directly.

358
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,559
In that case, we can create a scene

359
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,599
when they let their guard down.

360
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,139
Once the Liao Army has been alerted, they will consult the Prince of Chu.

361
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:46,780
And then, we just have to trail them to locate the Prince of Chu.

362
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,959
Chief Qiao, do you have another idea?

363
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,139
In fact, I do have another idea.

364
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:56,239
But I can't do it alone.

365
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,960
- I require all of your assistance.
- Definitely.

366
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,919
As long as it's within our capacity, you can ask us to do anything, Chief Qiao.

367
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,879
- Yes, go ahead.
- Chief Qiao.

368
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,640
Just give us the word.

369
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,019
Chief Qiao, please.

370
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,359
Is any of you an expert in flintstones?

371
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,020
Me.

372
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,759
May I know your name?

373
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,799
I'm just a nobody.

374
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,199
I heard that the Liao Army is invading and so I came to help.

375
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,799
May I know why you need flintstones, Chief Qiao?

376
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,159
As the saying goes, "Full stomach

377
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,239
before fighting an army."

378
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,099
To sow panic among the Liao Army, the best way

379
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,960
is to burn their food.

380
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,599
And then, my sect mates will attack during the chaos

381
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,299
with machines and assassination tools.

382
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,399
That way, the Liao Army will think that

383
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,439
our backup has arrived.

384
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,040
And so, I plan to invade at night.

385
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,159
Oh well. I'm stuck here anyway.

386
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,079
Too many things have happened recently.

387
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,559
I might have neglected the task from Sister Deity.

388
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,060
I should probably learn the Divine Art of the Northern Darkness

389
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,700
like she asked me to.

390
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,559
This technique goes against the techniques from other sects.

391
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:20,519
If you have learned another technique before,

392
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,839
discard it away and focus on this technique.

393
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,279
Should you mix them up,

394
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,699
their contradictory nature will result in shocks and internal bleeding.

395
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:32,159
Your meridian system will be destroyed.

396
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,700
It is very dangerous.

397
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,500
I don't know any martial arts anyway.

398
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,400
How convenient.

399
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,380
Who's there?

400
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,460
Quick!

401
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,860
Come, have some meat.

402
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,580
Fire! Fire!

403
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,990
Quickly. Over here!

404
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,320
I'm coming!

405
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,030
This way!

406
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,370
- Over there.
- Quickly!

407
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,680
Tip the water out!

408
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,660
- What's happening?
- No idea.

409
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,440
Quickly. The fire.

410
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,430
Hide!

411
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:11,420
Water is needed over here.

412
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,480
This side. Extinguish the fire!

413
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,599
A human has four seas. One in the stomach, the sea of sustenance.

414
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,239
One in the Penetrating Vessel, the sea of 12 standard meridians.

415
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,719
One in the chest, the sea of qi.

416
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
One is the brain, the sea of essence.

417
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,180
In less than a day, the sustenance we ingest

418
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,559
will be secreted out of our body.

419
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,879
Drain someone's power using your Shaoshang Point and store it in your sea of qi.

420
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,579
The more you store, the more it grows.

421
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:45,159
Just like the Grand Northern Darkness Lake

422
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,280
can hold a great fish of a thousand miles.

423
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,660
[Wave-like steps]

424
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,919
Great!

425
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,039
This step technique is like a riddle!

426
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,520
It's so fun!

427
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,759
Coward.

428
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,559
The Crimson Toad hasn't appeared for a long time.

429
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,759
It croaked tonight suddenly.

430
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,080
I wonder if it's a good or bad sign...

431
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,839
The Crimson Toad is the most venomous creature.

432
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:45,419
It is aggressive and its poison is potent.

433
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,519
I heard that if you see a Crimson Toad,

434
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,519
its poisonous fog will blind you.

435
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,359
The poison then strikes your brain and paralyzes you.

436
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,119
I'm sure before you can see clearly how it looks, you'll be dead already.

437
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,159
Senior Yu,

438
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,340
Sacred Envoy Fu is a man-hater

439
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,319
but she treats the kid inside so nicely.

440
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,999
She even calls him Mr. Duan.

441
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,320
How friendly of her.

442
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,519
I mean, a young lady

443
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,159
treats a handsome man in such a coquettish way...

444
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,060
What else can it be?

445
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,939
Are you saying that Sacred Envoy Fu is into him?

446
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,039
I see.

447
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,219
Sacred Envoy Fu was just being courteous to me.

448
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:37,820
You can keep me here until my young face is no more

449
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,030
and it still won't serve any purpose.

450
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,320
That way!

451
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,799
Bring more water!

452
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,300
Coming!

453
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,330
I'm coming!

454
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,420
- I need two more people.
- I'm here!

455
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,680
Quickly!

456
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,280
Check that side.

457
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,640
What's happening?

458
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,220
Calm down. Don't panic.

459
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,320
There. Don't let them run!

460
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,480
Go! Kill them!

461
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,399
There are people behind the wagons.

462
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,900
Surround them!

463
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,120
Go!

464
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,260
Your Highness!

465
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,420
What's happening?

466
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,799
[Nie Lugu, Prince of Chu of Liao]
How did it come to this?

467
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,559
Powerful heroes invaded our camp.

468
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,579
Some brutes are all it takes to make you soil your pants?

469
00:33:13,579 --> 00:33:16,140
Where did the Liao bravado go?

470
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,239
Our invasion will be a successful one.

471
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:42,619
Even if the Song's backup is here, I am not afraid,

472
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:45,279
let alone some local pugilists.

473
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,000
Your Highness, if you fight,

474
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,719
I'm sure they will fall like flies.

475
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:52,519
However, pugilists are a reckless bunch.

476
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,940
You are of noble stature.

477
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,620
You don't need to fight them yourself.

478
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,619
Although we lost some of our resources, it is not a huge loss.

479
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,298
If something were to happen to Your Highness, then it'd be a different story.

480
00:34:15,298 --> 00:34:16,599
That's right.

481
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,359
They are strong.

482
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,578
Some of our good men died in their hands.

483
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:24,399
Thank god we already planted decoys in the camp.

484
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,919
Retreat first, Your Highness.

485
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,099
Better safe than sorry.

486
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,479
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms?

487
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,140
You're Qiao Feng.

488
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,820
Don't move! Don't move!

489
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,060
This step technique...

490
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,779
It starts from Darkening of the Light, then Grace

491
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:07,239
After Completion, Clan, crossing all 64 hexagrams,

492
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:09,960
and ends at Innocence.

493
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,039
That's a full cycle.

494
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,000
Amazing!

495
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,519
He's making noise this early in the morning.

496
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,900
What is he doing?

497
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,220
Let me check.

498
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,439
What are you yelling about?

499
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,519
I said that whenever you speak, I'll give you a slap.

500
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,420
Did you forget?

501
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,439
You dodge my slap and so you eat my punch.

502
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,660
- That's how we do it.
- You...

503
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,159
Weird.

504
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,379
I only gave him a punch and somehow I feel exhausted already.

505
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,239
How uncivilized!

506
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,119
All I said was a few "Amazing!"

507
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,500
It's not like it hindered you at all!

508
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,239
I got a punch for no reason at all.

509
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,479
Thankfully, it doesn't hurt at all.

510
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,800
Just a bit out of breath, though.

511
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,119
Untie the prince.

512
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,520
Yes, Sir.

513
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,959
Do you know the consequence of kidnapping me?

514
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,460
I do.

515
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:53,140
In fact, I know you quite well.

516
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,560
Like?

517
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,639
You two are dismissed.

518
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,940
Noted.

519
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,179
When Emperor Shengzhong passed away,

520
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:12,979
his will stated that his eldest son, Xinzhong, will succeed as the emperor.

521
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:16,099
However, the Dowager Empress favored the second child, Chongyuan.

522
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:21,740
She plotted to get Chongyuan the throne but Chongyuan revealed

523
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:25,039
and foiled her plan.

524
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,079
Later, as a token of gratitude,

525
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,639
Emperor Xingzhong made Chongyuan the crown prince

526
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,060
and promised to give him the throne later.

527
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,379
When Emperor Xingzhong fell sick, he reneged on his promise

528
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:44,759
and passed the throne to his son,

529
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,199
your current Emperor, Yelv Hongji.

530
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,959
After Yelv Hongji became the emperor, he felt guilty,

531
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:54,919
so he gave his uncle, Chongyuan, the title of Crown Prince again

532
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:59,119
and the title of Grand Marshal.

533
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,560
He also made Chongyuan's son,

534
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,160
Nie Lugu,

535
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,480
which is you, the Prince of Chu.

536
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,060
You handle the affairs of the South and are now the Ruler of the South.

537
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,260
Your Highness, you have no ordinary background.

538
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,780
You're well respected in the Liao Empire,

539
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,439
but everyone only knows your royal lineage.

540
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,400
They don't know the full picture.

541
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,220
You're not from Liao.

542
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,440
How do you know this?

543
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,180
The Beggars' Sect is all over the world.

544
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:48,320
It is not hard to get a hold of such information.

545
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,440
I also know that many Liao people

546
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,020
support you and your father.

547
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,860
They said Yelv Hongji cheated his way up.

548
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:06,300
And your dad is the rightful emperor.

549
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,060
So what?

550
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,360
Your Highness,

551
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,080
you're a smart person.

552
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,220
You know your situation better than me.

553
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,399
We hold you as a prisoner now.

554
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,920
Your dad, your tacticians, or your soldiers might want to save you

555
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,100
but those people in the capital city

556
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,680
might not think so.

557
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,159
You sure they won't prolong the negotiation

558
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,740
so that you can't return to the Liao Empire

559
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:51,899
or instigate an incident that results in your death?

560
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,620
Some Liao regions support the current emperor

561
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,999
and some support you and your father.

562
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,979
This deep-rooted divide

563
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:15,519
cannot be solved within a day.

564
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,959
The Song and the Liao signed a peace accord.

565
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,219
From what I know, you breached the accord and deployed the army yourself

566
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:26,380
without consent from the Liao Emperor.

567
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,120
If you win this war, then you might be fine.

568
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,519
But you're here now.

569
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,340
And as time passes,

570
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,239
do you think you will still hold military power?

571
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,140
You... What do you want?

572
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,900
It's simple.

573
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,139
Peace by the border so that the civilians can live worry-free.

574
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,919
Chief Qiao!

575
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,420
Come in.

576
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,160
Chief Qiao.

577
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,439
Your Highness, let's see how much

578
00:42:29,439 --> 00:42:33,640
the Ruler of the South is worth.

Crimson Toad?

605

Why did it come here to make things worse?

606
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,020
This is my mouth. Don't mistake it for your burrow.
