[Episode 38]

14
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,460
Then... Then won't I be the same as them and be under your control?

15
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,541
Not at all.

16
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,940
You are different from those animals.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,560
They have one Mortality Talisman each.

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,060
You have nine!

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,600
It is so itchy! It is so itchy!

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,720
Little Monk, do not worry.

21
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,960
To get rid of these Mortality Talismans,

22
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,060
you need to use the internal force of your palm.

23
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,620
My divine martial arts is recuperating well these days.

24
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,500
I cannot be wasting my internal force on you, right?

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,920
What about this?

26
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,100
I will teach you the method of applying the technique.

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,440
You can try to get rid of them yourself.

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,040
All right!

29
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,540
None of Elder Wu and the rest can dispel my Mortality Talisman.

30
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,320
It is because the types and techniques applied

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,700
when I planted Mortality Talismans into their bodies are different.

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,100
Every Mortality Talisman carries different Yin and Yang energy.

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,380
How can they even dispel it?

34
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,160
You dispelled one Mortality Talisman with Yang energy.

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,860
The rest are planted with Yin energy, which will be troublesome.

36
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,660
So you must dispel them one by one.

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,200
He looks a little silly, but he understood it easily.

38
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,620
He is indeed an extraordinary talent.

39
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,400
I feel better now.

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,020
You are not that slow or dumb.

41
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,300
"Know yourself and your enemy,  then you will win every battle."

42
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,220
If you want to control this Mortality Talisman,

43
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,360
you must know how to approach it.

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,299
Do you know what a Mortality Talisman is?

45
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,320
It is a hidden weapon.

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,720
Obviously, but what does it look like?

47
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,640
I may have nine Mortality Talismans planted in me, which hurt me and made me itch,

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,790
but as for how Mortality Talismans look like,

49
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,440
I am not sure.

50
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,820
This is the Mortality Talisman.

51
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,700
Take a good look.

52
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,260
This is bad!

53
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,010
I planted another Mortality Talisman in myself.

54
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,480
Mortality Talisman is a piece of round thin ice.

55
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,960
So it melted.

56
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,820
It was not planted in me.

57
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,300
To learn how to break the Mortality Talisman technique,

58
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,840
you must learn how to use it youself.

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,267
If you want to know how, then you have to learn how to make it.

60
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:17,980
Put some water on your palm.

61
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,950
Then reverse the internal force in your palm...

62
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,680
to form the true qi as cold as ice in your palm.

63
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,913
I did it. I did it!

64
00:05:40,913 --> 00:05:45,040
To make a Mortality Talisman, you need to infuse either Yin or Yang's internal force.

65
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,580
The order of precedence varies.

66
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,400
Being able to change and alter it as you wish

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,150
will allow you to exert the greatest power.

68
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,840
Brother Quan.

69
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,500
Brother, you're finally here.

70
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,960
Come here quickly.

71
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,680
Brother Quan, did anything happen?

72
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,010
I have found a skilled man who can remove this thing from your head.

73
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,180
Brother Quan, for you to treat me this way...

74
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,500
We are sworn brothers so we are naturally like family.

75
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,340
After removing this thing from your head,

76
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,660
you can be like other ordinary people and do whatever you want.

77
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,920
Even if Miss A'Zi recovers and can see again right away,

78
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,970
you do not have to worry anymore.

79
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,420
Thank you so much, Brother Quan.

80
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,953
Let's go.

81
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,933
Brother, don't be scared.

82
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,540
Let me see.

83
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,459
It is better that you do not see.

84
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,000
I am afraid you might have nightmares at night.

85
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,493
Brother, why are you saying that?

86
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:53,700
People who are born with strange appearances are everywhere.

87
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,540
This is nothing compared to them.

88
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,073
Come. Get up.

89
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,340
I just hope, from now on, you will stop thinking about your terrible past.

90
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,260
Let us treat it as if Zhuang Juxian of the iron mask is dead

91
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,600
and move forward.

92
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,800
Won't that be great?

93
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
Be that as it may,

94
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,613
but...

95
00:09:20,613 --> 00:09:23,440
But if Miss A'Zi sees me...

96
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,060
Sees my current look...

97
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,060
If you do not mind,

98
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,310
I just got a mask here, which has fine craftsmanship.

99
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,360
If one doesn't look closely, there is really not much difference.

100
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,310
Why don't you try to put it on?

101
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,200
Your kindness is like that of parents.

102
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,790
Please accept my gratitude.

103
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,600
Brother, get up quickly.

104
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,900
Brother, from now on, if you ever need my help in anything,

105
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,480
just tell me. I will not refuse even if I were to die.

106
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,500
You are being courteous again.

107
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,860
We are all brothers.

108
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,720
This does not require much effort.

109
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,420
So there's no need for all that formality.

110
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,240
By the way, how is Miss A'Zi?

111
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,840
She is still the same.

112
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,180
The physician said the poison is unusual.

113
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,420
There was nothing he could do.

114
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,360
Also, Miss A'Zi is constantly thinking

115
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,860
about returning to Liao to find her brother-in-law.

116
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,933
Brother, I can see you have an abundance of internal force,

117
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,550
and it seems to be of Yin energy.

118
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,900
It is quite similar to Miss A'Zi's martial arts skills.

119
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,340
Since you really like her,

120
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,460
why don't you ask her for advice and guidance?

121
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,160
Lest she thinks about going back every day.

122
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,810
Use the opportunity to distract her mind.

123
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,660
Will this work?

124
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,520
Why not?

125
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,020
You are quite good at martial arts.

126
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,100
Naturally, you must show it in front of Miss A'Zi.

127
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,420
Since ancient times, beautiful women love heroes.

128
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,940
After you have mastered her martial art techniques,

129
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,580
not only will you have improved your martial arts skills,

130
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,960
but you can also protect her better.

131
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,000
As time passes, won't she feel touched and moved then?

132
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,193
Mind the steps.

133
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,980
You want to learn Xingxiu Sect's martial arts?

134
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,480
Why?

135
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,380
To be honest, I mastered the martial arts I have by chance.

136
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,420
If we talk about the attainment of martial arts,

137
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,660
I fear I cannot be compared to you.

138
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,980
So I want to learn more from you.

139
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,980
In that case, I can at least protect you if we are ever attacked by a strong enemy.

140
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,060
If it is not convenient for you, there is no need to force yourself.

141
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,320
Not at all. Brother Zhuang, you are my savior

142
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,660
and you've taken care of me all this time.

143
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,940
It is not a problem for me to teach you Xingxiu Sect's martial arts.

144
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,780
Watch closely.

145
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,220
Poison and hidden weapons are Xingxiu Sect's special skills.

146
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,380
Poisonous Palm uses internal force to activate the poison from within the body.

147
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,860
Once you achieve a certain level of mastery,

148
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,140
there will be no limit as to how your body works and the poison you can unleash.

149
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,600
Brother Zhuang, you have an extremely cold force in your body,

150
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,600
which is similar to the principle of this Poisonous Palm.

151
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,240
Gather your internal force in your palm

152
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,280
and make a strike.

153
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,040
Back then, my brother-in-law always said

154
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,160
the level of one's martial arts is not about skills

155
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,060
but lies in the strength of one's internal force.

156
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,540
I used to think the martial arts I learned were not good.

157
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
But now that I see it, he's right.

158
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,140
It is the same skill, but when you applied it,

159
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,140
it actually unleashed such incredible power!

160
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,300
Miss A'Zi, don't say that.

161
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,400
If you had not taught me well, possessing this internal force alone would be useless.

162
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,320
Here. Have a seat.

163
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,000
Brother Zhuang, no need to comfort me.

164
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,660
You have such great skills, I cannot be happier.

165
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,940
Do you really think I am very skilled?

166
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,140
Of course.

167
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,180
My master's martial arts are so sinister.

168
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,860
But you were able to escape from his hands,

169
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,360
your skills must be extraordinary.

170
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,140
In the future, you must learn more skills.

171
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,630
If someone dares to pick on me...

172
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,610
I will not let them go!

173
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:01,080
The last mortality Talisman is planted at the Yinlingquan acupuncture point of your right knee.

174
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,580
Gather Yang energy in your right palm.

175
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,560
Hit it with the second technique.

176
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,620
Gather Yin energy in your left palm.

177
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,860
Use the seventh technique to extract it three times.

178
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,080
All right.

179
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,800
That way, the hot and cold poison from the talisman

180
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,100
can be removed altogether.

181
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,513
I did it.

182
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,350
Thank you, Madam.

183
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,920
Little Monk,

184
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,140
Didn't you refuse to learn Six Solar Palms of Tianshan before?

185
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,740
Now, you have completed it all.

186
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,540
The one you taught me was the Six Solar Palms of Tianshan?

187
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,620
Yes.

188
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,900
If I did not do this,

189
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,900
how could you remove your Mortality Talisman then?

190
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,040
Madam, why did you have to trick me?

191
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,100
You really have no sense at all.

192
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,000
What should you address me after learning my martial art techniques?

193
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,900
I carry Senior Wu Yazi's 70 years' worth of cultivation within my body.

194
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
That makes him my master.

195
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,040
You are his Martial Sister.

196
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,860
That means you are my Martial Aunt.

197
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,660
Thank you, Martial Aunt.

198
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,620
That is more like it.

199
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,260
Tomorrow at noon, my divine martial arts will be fully recovered.

200
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,180
My mind will be filled with thoughts and ideas.

201
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,500
It will be extremely dangerous.

202
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,380
I must cultivate in peace today.

203
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,240
Do not talk to me anymore, lest you disturb my mind.

204
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,060
Martial Sister, you have come to my house,f

205
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,820
yet you do not dare to see me.

206
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,680
Don't you think that's a bit rude?

207
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,100
Martial Aunt, she... she found us.

208
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,480
Li Qiushui.

209
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,033
Martial Sister.

210
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,493
Martial Sister,

211
00:17:18,493 --> 00:17:20,920
you dare not come out to see me.

212
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,300
That is not surprising.

213
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,240
We have been training under the same master for decades.

214
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,780
But when had Martial Brother ever noticed you?

215
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,800
The one he liked was me.

216
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,020
It has always been me.

217
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,640
Martial Aunt.

218
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,280
Martial Aunt, she is here.

219
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,120
Why are you making a fuss?

220
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,140
She may know that I am inside the palace,

221
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,240
but she does not know where I am hiding.

222
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,860
There are thousands of rooms in this imperial palace.

223
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,980
If she were to search each room,

224
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,500
she might not necessarily manage to find this place even if she spent weeks and months searching.

225
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
Yes, you are right.

226
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,260
As long as we managed to get through until tomorrow noon,

227
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,510
we do not have to fear her anymore.

228
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,710
Fine, Martial Sister.

229
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,540
Do you know where Martial Brother is now?

230
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,660
He is now at my palace waiting to see you.

231
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,220
He has something important to tell you.

232
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,020
Madam, she is lying.

233
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020
Master has already died. Do not believe her.

234
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,321
Of course, I would not.

235
00:18:18,321 --> 00:18:20,700
This wretched woman is using the Sound Transmission Technique

236
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,270
to provoke me, and make me go outside.

237
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,860
I would never fall for her tricks.

238
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,140
Yes.

239
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,820
Martial Sister, didn't you like pestering Martial Brother the most?

240
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,880
Why are you hiding from him this time?

241
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,740
It is no surprise either.

242
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,000
Martial Brother only tolerated you

243
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
because you were from the same sect.

244
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But you read too much into it,

245
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,120
thinking he was interested in you,

246
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,840
and you even harbored hope that he would return your feelings.

247
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,980
What a joke.

248
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,960
What a joke.

249
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,780
Martial Sister, why aren't you coming over?

250
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,770
Martial Sister, Martial Brother only has me in his heart.

251
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,540
But you thought too highly of yourself, dreaming to have someone

252
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,740
who is way beyond your league.

253
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,620
Why don't you take a look at your face and that body of yours?

254
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,780
Martial Brother would never have eyes on you.

255
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,000
You are an old woman who will never age or mature.

256
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,060
Who are you to compete with me?

257
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,640
Martial Sister, why won't you talk?

258
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,160
Actually, I'm envious of you.

259
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,060
Beauty will fade in a moment for us,

260
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,000
but you will forever remain young.

261
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I suppose you cannot be blamed for refusing to see Martial Brother.

262
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,360
If you really did see him,

263
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,420
he would have already aged,

264
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,940
yet you are still young.

265
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,000
How could you address him as Younger Martial Brother then?

266
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,140
In the long run, you should be thanking me.

267
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,340
Qiushui, wait.

268
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,220
Qiushui, you said you have something to tell me.

269
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,600
What is it?

270
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,920
And can't you just tell me in the room instead of coming here?

271
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,053
Martial Brother, we have been getting along for so many years.

272
00:21:50,053 --> 00:21:53,220
Don't you know how I feel?

273
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,940
Do you have feelings for me...

274
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,940
or not?

275
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,293
Qiushui,

276
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,400
you have treated me so kindly

277
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,020
and you are always by my side.

278
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,960
How could I not fall for you...

279
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,100
and long for you?

280
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,320
Madam. Madam!

281
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,981
Madam, let me cover your ears.

282
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
It is useless.

283
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,140
She uses profound internal force to transmit her message.

284
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:59,100
So much so that we can hear it very clearly

285
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,120
even from within this ice cellar.

286
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,320
Covering the ears with cotton balls would be useless.

287
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,400
What should we do then?

288
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,680
But it is almost time for you to practice your martial arts.

289
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,820
This is the final and most crucial moment for you to recover your power fully.

290
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,080
It is such a grave matter.

291
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,800
If you keep hearing such words, you will definitely be distracted.

292
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,320
This wretched woman used the Soul Searching Technique to disturb my will.

293
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,160
Even if she has arrived, with my divine martial arts full recovered,

294
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,440
she would not be my match.

295
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,720
So she is here to obstruct me.

296
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,720
Madam, can you put this cultivation aside for now?

297
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,200
There is such a fierce enemy waiting for an opportunity to invade.

298
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,720
If you keep on cultivating, it is bound to be very dangerous.

299
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,200
You would rather die than help me deal with that wretched woman.

300
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,450
Why are you concerned about me now?

301
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,180
Madam, this is my reasoning.

302
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,740
I am not willing to assist you in harming others,

303
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,580
but I am also not willing to let others harm you.

304
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,620
You have a kind heart.

305
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:02,560
This wretched woman is currently using the Soul Searching Technique to disrupt my will.

306
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,920
At the same time, she has sent her men to search for me.

307
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,980
I suppose this imperial palace's defense must be impenetrable.

308
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,480
We won't be able to escape.

309
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,780
- What should we do then?
- Right now,

310
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,860
the only way is to fully recover and master my divine martial arts to fight her.

311
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,720
Little Monk, go and keep watch over there.

312
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,540
It is noon,

313
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,680
I must cultivate my martial arts now.

314
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,390
Martial Sister,

315
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,220
Martial Brother and I had a great time together for quite some time.

316
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,080
I played chess with him

317
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,180
and played the zither for him.

318
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,060
The way he looked at me was different from when he looked at others.

319
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,180
We have known each other for so long.

320
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,820
He only shows such affection in his eyes when he looks at me.

321
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,960
I even gave birth to his cute daughter.

322
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,160
She looks exactly like Martial Brother and me.

323
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,300
I personally made clothes for her.

324
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,660
Martial Brother carved a toy for her himself,

325
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,280
and made her laugh happily.

326
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,320
She looked so adorable.

327
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,450
I remembered it was the Seventh Day of the Seventh Month of that year.

328
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,880
the day the Cowherd and the Weaver meet at magpie bridge.

329
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,980
Martial Brother was admiring the moon with me.

330
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,840
He promised that we would be husband and wife forever.

331
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,790
Martial Brother even drew a portrait of me.

332
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,300
He said my hair was so beautiful,

333
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,880
just like the moonlight during the Qixi Festival, shining brightly.
(T/N: Qixi is second Valentine's Day in China)

334
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,800
My dear Martial Brother, we spent so many unforgettable days together.

335
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,680
I knew you would come back to me.

336
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,200
Martial Brother, you promised to be with me forever. Right?

337
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,720
My dear Martial Brother, hold me.

338
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Hold me tightly.

339
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,220
Martial Brother, come and kiss me.

340
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,280
Kiss me. Come and kiss me.

341
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,300
Wretched woman, Younger Martial Brother never liked you!

342
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,150
You are so shameless to have seduced him!

343
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,320
Shameless woman!

344
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,560
If Younger Martial Brother had truly loved you,

345
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,800
then why had he come to Piaomiao Peak to hand over the Seven Treasure Ring to me before he died?

346
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,700
Oh right!

347
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,080
Younger Martial Brother also gave me a painting.

348
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,280
A painting of me when I was at the age of 18.

349
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,100
He painted it himself.

350
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,960
He said for more than 60 years, this portrait had never left his side

351
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,100
and he had always kept it close to him.

352
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,400
You must be feeling sad after hearing this, right?

353
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,800
Martial Aunt. Martial Aunt!

354
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,640
Martial Aunt, why did you lie?

355
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,800
No, I am not lying!

356
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,040
You are lying. You are lying!

357
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,620
He only loves me. Why would he paint a portrait of you?

358
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,600
With that appearance of yours,

359
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,920
how could Martial Brother love you?

360
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,670
You wretched woman!

361
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,400
You think you are beautiful. But your face is full of scars.

362
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,600
Do you think Younger Martial Brother is willing to see this face of yours?

363
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,520
You wretched woman!

364
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,820
All your life, you've only known how to seduce handsome young men.

365
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,460
But I only ever loved Younger Martial Brother alone!

366
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,553
Martial Aunt.

367
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,413
Martial Aunt!

368
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,360
The door to the ice cellar is sealed,

369
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,200
lest someone barges in to disturb us.

370
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,640
If you like to win by sheer numbers,

371
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,760
you can use the Sound Transmission Technique to ask for help.

372
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,800
Who is there?

373
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,020
That is the number one romantic of the central plains,

374
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,020
the Fair Gentleman of Valiant, Pan An.

375
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,970
Do you want to see him?

376
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,530
What "Fair Gentleman of Valiant, Pan An"?

377
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,670
He must be that ugly little monk who escaped with you on his back.

378
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,480
Mr. Dreamy,

379
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,300
she is calling a romantic, handsome young man like you

380
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,840
an ugly little monk.

381
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,020
That is so hilarious.

382
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,660
Mr. Dreamy, don't worry.

383
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,940
In a few days' time, you will be able to meet your Mrs. Dreamy.

384
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,260
She could not eat nor sleep because of her worry for you.

385
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,880
Do you miss her?

386
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,180
I do.

387
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,560
He is indeed a passionate young man.

388
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,060
Mr. Dreamy, come here.

389
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,540
Let me see what the number one romantic of the martial arts world

390
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,790
of the Central Plains looks like.

391
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,300
You want to see him?

392
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,320
Not that easy.

393
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,620
This is bad. Martial Aunt is still wounded.

394
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,560
I must help her.

395
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,560
Martial Aunt. Martial Aunt.

396
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,973
Martial Aunt! Martial Aunt!

397
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,720
Younger Martial Aunt, you killed Martial Aunt!

398
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,780
Younger Martial Aunt, why are you so ruthless?

399
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,180
She was your martial sister.

400
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,013
She is dead?

401
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,200
Martial Sister, are you really dead?

402
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,440
All my life, I have suffered so much because of you.

403
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,380
I still do not believe it.

404
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,900
What are you trying to do?

405
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,940
She is already dead!

406
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,180
Why do you still have to harm her remains?

407
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,780
You ugly little monk,

408
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,340
how dare you call yourself the number one romantic of the central plains.

409
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,990
I am going to teach you a lesson today!

410
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,100
Martial Aunt, you were not dead!

411
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,120
Luckily, you stopped her from destroying my remains.

412
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
Otherwise, I would really be dead.

413
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,700
You wretched woman, I'm still better than you, after all.

414
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,200
Martial Sister, Heaven has eyes

415
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,120
to let you die before me finally.

416
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,260
No, I will make sure you die

417
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,030
before me.

418
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,090
I am going to choke you to death.

419
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,400
- I am going to choke you to death.
- Younger Martial Aunt.

420
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,320
Martial Aunt, stop fighting.

421
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,900
You are from the same sect.

422
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,420
There is no need to behave this way.

423
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,160
Younger Martial Aunt. Martial Aunt.

424
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:57,020
If there is any dispute, we can always talk it out in peace.

425
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,640
There is no need to fight. Stop fighting already.

426
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,440
Younger Martial Aunt. Martial Aunt. Stop fighting.

427
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,780
You are doing the right thing.

428
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,920
If there is any problem, we can always talk it out nicely.

429
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,613
There is no need to fight, right?

430
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:16,700
Little Monk, come here.

431
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,980
I cannot move.

432
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,860
My acupuncture point has been sealed.

433
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,820
Then listen up.

434
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,210
Do not use your skills to resist.

435
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,780
Otherwise, you are seeking death.

436
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,873
Martial Aunt? Martial Aunt.

437
00:34:32,873 --> 00:34:36,080
Younger Martial Aunt. Young Martial Aunt?

438
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,790
I should get both of you out of here first.

439
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,260
We have finally escaped.

440
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,460
I should keep you two separated.

441
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,040
So both of you won't fight again.

442
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,281
- I am going to kill you.
- Wretched woman!

443
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:05,660
I am going to kill you. I am going to kill you.

444
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,600
- Wretched woman.
- Younger Martial Aunt.

445
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,920
Younger Martial Aunt. Younger Martial Aunt!

446
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,120
Younger Martial Aunt!

447
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,760
It was not easy for the three of us to escape.

448
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,320
Can you please stop fighting?

449
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,020
No, that wretched woman is still alive.

450
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,780
How can I stop?

451
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,980
My hatred is as deep as the sea. I won't stop until she is dead.

452
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,520
Martial Aunt.

453
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,780
Can't you both just give it a rest for a moment?

454
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,760
Martial Aunt, you are already 96 years old this year.

455
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,520
Younger Martial Aunt, you must be over 80 years old, right?

456
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,900
For someone as old as you two,

457
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,900
how can you have such tempers?

458
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,280
Little Monk, hurry.

459
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,120
Bring Wu Yazi's portrait and show it to me.

460
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,740
I would never believe that Martial Brother

461
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,260
would draw a portrait of that wretched woman.

462
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,700
Do not show it to her.

463
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,750
If she died from being provoked, that would be too easy for her.

464
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,110
You refused to let me see this portrait

465
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:18,860
because you know you are not the one in this portrait.

466
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,700
Martial Brother was a skillful painter.

467
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:26,560
Why would he even draw an ugly monster like you?

468
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,440
You wretched woman! I... I am going to kill you!

469
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,440
Martial Aunt.

470
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,720
How about it?

471
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,140
Do you admit defeat?

472
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,920
You want to compete with me?

473
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,860
You can never defeat me.

474
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,973
Little Monk, release this into the sky.

475
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,820
Martial Aunt, are you gathering people to deal with Younger Martial Aunt?

476
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,840
Younger Martial Aunt, Martial Aunt has sent someone to deal with you.

477
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,840
Let me carry you away from here.

478
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,960
Younger Martial Aunt? Younger Martial Aunt.

479
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,850
Younger Martial Aunt!

480
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,020
- Martial Aunt, Younger Martial Aunt is...
- Dead?

481
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,060
This wretched woman finally died before me!

482
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,973
Master!

483
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,480
Greetings, Master.

484
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,040
We came late. We deserve to be punished.

485
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,840
All of you thought that I was dead, right?

486
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,100
None of you actually cared about me.

487
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,880
Without anyone to control you,

488
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,840
you enjoyed yourself and behaved lawlessly!

489
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,360
- We dare not.
- You don't dare?

490
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,660
If you really cared about an old woman like me,

491
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,600
why are there so few of you here?

492
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,620
Master, since the night you left the palace,

493
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:45,760
all of us had been so worried.

494
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,220
You were worried?

495
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,000
Then, why had you not left the mountain earlier to search for me?

496
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,300
All Nine Divisions had left the mountain

497
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,200
and split up to search for you immediately.

498
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,280
We were incompetent and were late.

499
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,960
We deserve to die. We deserve to die!

500
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,220
All right, just get up.

501
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,960
Thank you, Master.

502
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,580
All of you do look worn out.

503
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,460
I guess for the past three months, all of you have gone through a lot.

504
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:15,340
We will not refuse to face any difficulties for you, Master.

505
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,880
A little hardship is not worth mentioning.

506
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,960
Before I managed to complete my cultivation,

507
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,840
I was interrupted by this wretched woman.

508
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,740
She cut off my leg and almost made me lose my life.

509
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,340
Fortunately, my martial nephew, Xu Zhu, came to my rescue.

510
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:33,160
The hardships we have experienced are truly unspeakable.

511
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,480
We are indebted to you, Mister.

512
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,140
I will repay your kindness even if I die!

513
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,500
We will repay your kindness even if we die!

514
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,160
I do not deserve this.

515
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,540
Xu Zhu, get up!

516
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,440
They are my servants.

517
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,390
You must not forget your place!

518
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,500
What place?

519
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,540
You little monk...

520
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,840
All of you, please get up.

521
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,800
Get up.

522
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,860
Thank you, Mister.

523
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,860
Our treasure ring was stolen by this wretched woman.

524
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,880
Go and retrieve it for me.

525
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,440
Martial Aunt, Younger Martial Aunt has already passed away.

526
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,660
Won't you please stop talking badly of her?

527
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,040
- Why you little...
- Don't be upset.

528
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,660
I will go and get it now.

529
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,700
- Here you go, Martial Aunt.
- You are now the Chief of the Carefree Sect.

530
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,040
I have already passed down Mortality Talisman, Tianshan Plum Hand,

531
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,940
Six Solar Palms of Tianshan,

532
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,720
and other skills to you.

533
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,830
From now on, you are the Master of Lingjiu Palace of Piaomiao Peak.

534
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,960
All the lives of the servants of the Nine Divisions

535
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,280
will be at your disposal.

536
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,440
We are at your disposal!

537
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,960
No. You must not do this, Martial Aunt.

538
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
What do you mean?

539
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,560
These servants from the Nine Divisions were incompetent in their duties.

540
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,410
They failed to protect me

541
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,540
and let Elder Wu and the rest mistreat and humiliate me.

542
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,180
My thumb and leg were also cut by that wretched woman, too.

543
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,760
They should die!

544
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,220
But now, I intend to pass Lingjiu Palace to you.

545
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,700
Their lives will be for you to decide.

546
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,320
We deserve to die.

547
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,680
Thank you for your mercy.

548
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,280
Why aren't you thanking your new master?

549
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,560
Thank you, Master!

550
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,840
Don't. Please don't.

551
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,860
Get up.

552
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,440
Everyone, get up. Get up.

553
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,000
Get up now.

554
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,573
Martial Aunt!

555
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,440
Martial Aunt.

556
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,740
With my last breath,

557
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:57,700
I was able to see that wretched woman die before me.

Tong... Tonglao.

585

Tonglao? Tonglao?
