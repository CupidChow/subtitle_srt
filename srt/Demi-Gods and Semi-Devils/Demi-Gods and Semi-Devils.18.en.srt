00:01:30,166 --> 00:01:32,833
[Episode 18]

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,679
Then, may I know who your master is?

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,419
What impressive martial arts does he know?

16
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:40,859
The master who taught me has passed away.

17
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,600
Don't mention him.

18
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,559
However, my current master is very capable.

19
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,319
No one else in the world can do

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,920
his Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves.

21
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves?

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,200
Indeed, that requires advanced skills.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,880
But I don't believe that Young Master Duan of Dali

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,000
would take you as his disciple.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,939
What? You don't believe me?

26
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,239
Why would I lie to you?

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,279
Everyone here has heard him calling me his disciple. Right?

28
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,478
Right, Fourth Brother?

29
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,899
Yes!

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,460
All right.

31
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:18,519
In that case, I suppose you must have mastered your master's special technique.

32
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,439
Congratulations.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,719
It's too early to congratulate me.

34
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,560
I have yet to master it.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,559
Didn't you say you know

36
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,319
all the martial arts in the world?

37
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,999
If you can show me three steps of the Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves,

38
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:34,220
I, Second Young Master Yue, will admit defeat.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,439
The Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves may be difficult to master,

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,799
but I did learn a few steps.

41
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,779
Shall I show you?

42
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:43,160
Come!

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,840
In that case,

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,839
we shall also watch and enrich our knowledge.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,360
Great! Show it!

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,700
Come catch me.

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,419
How was it? I've shown you the three steps.

48
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:12,540
I only saw one step!

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,879
All right.

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,140
This time, I'll close my eyes. Come catch me.

51
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,700
I can catch you even with my eyes closed!

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,700
Last step!

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,359
How was it?

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,560
There were three steps, right?

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,740
Weren't there only two steps?

56
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,260
There was one more on your face.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,039
Fourth Brother! Was there?

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,580
Third Young Master Yue.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,439
How was it?

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,880
Young Master Murong's Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves

61
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,940
is better than your master's, right?

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,359
Enough! I'm tired! I'll stop fighting!

63
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:32,319
He could kick my face with his eyes closed.

64
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,240
I surrender!

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,220
Impressive!

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,599
May I know why both of you heroes are here?

67
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:47,559
Some brothers of mine in the Beggars' Sect have offended you unknowingly,

68
00:04:47,559 --> 00:04:49,980
so they were arrested and brought here.

69
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,439
If I may be so bold,

70
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,759
can you please release my brothers?

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,940
You're right.

72
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,459
Just now, you've shown us your great skills.

73
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,880
You live up to your name, Young Master Murong.

74
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,559
Chief Qiao, you're at the same level as Young Master Murong.

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,379
You should show all of us here some of your skills as well

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,919
to let us, the Xixia people, admire you wholeheartedly.

77
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,079
Only then will I release all the good men

78
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,500
in your esteemed sect.

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,240
Oh, right.

80
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,060
Here.

81
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,840
This is strange.

82
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,799
These people caused a scene and poisoned themselves.

83
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:03,060
Who used my Teary and Limpy Breeze without my permission?

84
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,000
General, I can't move.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,699
- There must be a traitor among us.
- Who? Who is the traitor?

86
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:12,759
Find him! Tear him into pieces!

87
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,459
Chief Qiao, please let us smell the antidote as well.

88
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,500
Our general will reward you greatly for sure.

89
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,080
I have to rescue my brothers now.

90
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,160
I have no need for the general's reward.

91
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,700
Young Master Murong,

92
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,959
there's a bottle of antidote around my chest.

93
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,279
Can you please remove the cap and let me smell it?

94
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,420
There's really an antidote.

95
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,839
I won't let you smell it.

96
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:57,180
- You...
- You...

97
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,120
Who are you?

98
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,200
What do you want?

99
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,500
How dare you!

100
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,999
- Chief Qiao?
- Chief.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,999
Chief Qiao.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,559
- Chief Qiao.
- It's really you.

103
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,780
- Thank goodness.
- Chief.

104
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,659
- Chief, you're here!
- This is the antidote.

105
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,960
- This is the antidote.
- Take a sniff.

106
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,959
Here.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,159
- Thank you.
- This is the antidote.

108
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,239
Quick. Let the others smell it, too.

109
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,880
All right. Thank you.

110
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,240
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,720
- Did it work?
- Yes.

112
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,659
Young Master Murong, we were blinded and foolish

113
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:53,039
to have blamed you for killing Deputy Chief Ma.

114
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,899
Thanks to you and Chief, we were saved in time.

115
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,400
We were captured by the Xixia people.

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,679
We can't imagine how things would have ended up.

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,360
- Yes.
- Exactly.

118
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,759
- Exactly.
- Chief.

119
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,119
Please forgive us.

120
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,959
Please come back and be our chief.

121
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,959
- Yes!
- Chief!

122
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,199
- Come back and be our chief.
- Yes. Come back, Chief.

123
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,439
- Yes.
- Come back, Chief.

124
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,599
Chief, please come back.

125
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,060
- Chief Qiao, come back.
- The Beggars' Sect needs you.

126
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,580
Master Qiao and Young Master Murong

127
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,200
are close friends indeed.

128
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,139
Let's discuss this matter another time.

129
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,359
We should go out and take a look first.

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,040
- Chief!
- I'll go as well.

131
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,279
- Chief Qiao!
- Chief, don't leave!

132
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,879
- Exactly.
- Chief Qiao!

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,779
Did you see that?

134
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:44,160
- The Beggars' Sect needs Chief Qiao.
- Exactly.

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,599
As a citizen of Xixia, how dare he help the outsiders.

136
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,779
When we return and find him, I will kill his entire family!

137
00:08:53,779 --> 00:08:56,439
How dare he write those words on the wall.

138
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,420
- It is obvious that he is mocking us!
- Who beat you up?

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,720
[Strike once...]

140
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
That little bastard!

141
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,660
He even stole my Teary and Limpy Breeze and released it at his own will.

142
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,199
Find him!

143
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,859
Find out his name and kill his whole family!

144
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,400
[After one strike, execute the other's body]

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,600
[Use poison]

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,159
This is Young Master Murong's handwriting...

147
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,560
You are "Young Master Murong" right now.

148
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,739
Our young master can write various characters and writing styles.

149
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,539
But I can't tell if this is our young master's handwriting or not.

150
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,740
Then, who could have written it?

151
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,900
They kept saying that there was a traitor.

152
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,400
Could it be someone among them?

153
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,800
Could it be Li Yanzong?

154
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,360
Who is Li Yanzong?

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,359
He's a Xixia warrior whom Miss Wang and I met at the dye house.

156
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,639
That person was odd indeed.

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,419
He released us and gave us the antidote of Teary and Limpy Breeze.

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,320
Let's go back and discuss this with Miss Wang.

159
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,060
Are you all right?

160
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,259
Chief Qiao.

161
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,279
- Chief Qiao.
- The chief didn't leave.

162
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,159
Young Master Murong and I have something important to do.

163
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,580
We will meet again.

164
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,759
- Chief!
- Don't go, Chief Qiao!

165
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,579
Chief!

166
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,559
Say, it's such a coincidence, isn't it?

167
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,119
My silly disciple told me to perform the Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves.

168
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,799
Wasn't that...

169
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,700
The real Chief Qiao is here.

170
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,080
Oh, no!

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,080
Come on. Let's go!

172
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,280
Hurry up!

173
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,440
Chief!

174
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,199
The chief is back! The chief is back!

175
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,719
The chief is back!

176
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,719
Chief!

177
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,719
Is everyone all right?

178
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,639
Yes.

179
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,560
We're all right, Chief.

180
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,740
What happened to these Xixia people?

181
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,039
Chief, this is what happened.

182
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,679
Yesterday, in the Xingzi Forest,

183
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,599
the spy whom we sent to Xixia sent us an urgent message,

184
00:11:28,599 --> 00:11:32,239
but Elder Xu decided not to show you.

185
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,679
Why do you think he would do that?

186
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,700
"Chief,

187
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,679
I have learned that General Helian Tieshu of Xixia

188
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,599
is bringing many skilled fighters from First Class Hall

189
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
to fight against us.

190
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
They have a powerful poisonous gas.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It is odorless.

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Once released, one who smells it will be unable to move.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
When we meet them,

194
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
we must cover our mouths and noses

195
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,100
or snatch the antidote, which has a pungent smell.

196
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,800
Otherwise, we will be in grave danger.

197
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
This is an urgent message.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,800
Reported by Yi Dabiao from Daxin Branch."

199
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,400
Actually, Brother Yi's report came just in time.

200
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,100
It's just that I didn't open it and read it sooner.

201
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,000
That's why we fell into their trap.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,300
Fortunately, none of us in the Beggars' Sect

203
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,400
was injured or gravely wounded.

204
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,400
It's all thanks to you, Chief.

205
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
We treated you badly,

206
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,600
yet you still treated us benevolently.

207
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
We're truly ashamed.

208
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
- Chief.
- Yes, Chief.

209
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,400
We're sorry.

210
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,000
We got tricked right after you left.

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,400
If you and Young Master Murong hadn't come here in time,

212
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,300
the entire Beggars' Sect would have died.

213
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,100
If you don't come back and become our leader and save us,

214
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,400
things won't work in the Beggars' Sect!

215
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
Wait a minute.

216
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
Young Master Murong?

217
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,200
I didn't meet him.

218
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,400
- You came together with him just now.
- He was here just now.

219
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
He was here just now.

220
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
That boy was able to perform

221
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,900
the Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves

222
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,400
with his eyes closed.

223
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,200
If that wasn't him, who else could it be?

224
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
It was him.

225
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,700
It was him!

226
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,600
- Murong Fu was here earlier?
- He was.

227
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,500
- He came.
- Yes.

228
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
Qiao Feng.

229
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,500
Just now, both of you came in here hand-in-hand.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,700
You look like a great hero.

231
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,000
Why are you talking nonsense?

232
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,300
Murong Fu and I came in here hand-in-hand?

233
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,800
How ridiculous.

234
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Qiao Feng, you're the Chief of the Beggars' Sect.

235
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,200
You must not tell lies!

236
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,200
Just ask everybody if you were here earlier.

237
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,900
You...You were sitting there.

238
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,400
He was sitting there.

239
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,000
Murong Fu showed us his Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,400
And you, Qiao Feng, were cheering and applauding him.

241
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Are you trying to say that all of that was fake?

242
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Elder Bai, did you see me just now?

243
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,400
I saw you for sure, Chief.

245
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,000
What's wrong?

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,679
You cured me with this bottle of antidote earlier. How could that be fake?

247
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:15,600
Indeed.

248
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,800
That's right.

249
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
I saw it with my eyes.

250
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Quan Guanqing was talking nonsense before.

251
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,700
Please don't mind his words.

252
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,100
You're honest and forthright.

253
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,400
It's not a big deal if you are friends with Young Master Murong.

254
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,500
- Exactly.
- That's right.

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Since everyone is all right,

256
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
I shall leave now.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,800
Chief!

258
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,600
- Chief!
- Chief Qiao!

259
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
- Chief Qiao!
- Chief!

260
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm no longer a member of the Beggars' Sect.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,100
You shouldn't address me as Chief anymore.

262
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,700
- Chief!
- Chief Qiao!

263
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
How was it?

264
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,200
How did you guys escape?

265
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
Someone helped us secretly

266
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,200
by releasing Teary and Limpy Breeze,

267
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
immobilizing the Xixia people.

268
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,400
Let me tell you this.

269
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,700
Young Master Duan and I even ran into Brother Qiao earlier.

270
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,500
Luckily, he was busy rescuing the others, so he didn't notice.

271
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,700
Otherwise, we would have gotten into trouble.

272
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,059
Miss Wang, who do you think the person who saved us was?

273
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,500
I do have an assumption.

274
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,000
It's just that...

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,700
No matter how intelligent and capable Miss Wang is,

276
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,500
she can't possibly know everything.

277
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,600
In my opinion,

278
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,400
it's more important for us to go to Shaolin and find Young Master Murong.

279
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,600
You're right.

280
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,600
We will stay here for the night.

281
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,500
Tomorrow, we will depart early in the morning.

282
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,700
If I'm really a Khitan,

283
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:14,800
in the past years, I've killed many Khitans

284
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,400
and destroyed countless plans of theirs.

285
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,000
Isn't this a great disloyalty?

286
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What if it's true

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,200
that my parents were murdered by the Hans outside Yanmen Pass?

288
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,400
Yet, I called the murderer my master?

289
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,600
For the past thirty years,

290
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,400
I called other people my parents.

291
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
If this is true, have I not been unfilial?

292
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
If I have indeed been disloyal and unfilial,

293
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,200
how can I stand to live in this world any longer?

294
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,600
But all of these

295
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,600
might be lies and accusations created by those deceitful ones.

296
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I, Qiao Feng, am a dignified man.

297
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,200
Yet, my reputation is now in ruins

298
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
and can never be restored.

299
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,200
If I were to leave the Beggars' Sect

300
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,800
in a moment of rage

301
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
and never bother about their matters anymore,

302
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,200
would I have let the evil ones succeed?

303
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,800
No matter what the truth is,

304
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
I must get to the bottom of it.

305
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,100
[Paths]

306
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,300
Seniors, please be more mindful.

307
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,800
Miss Wang, we are here.

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,600
Master.

309
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
Amitabha.

310
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,800
Please stop here.

311
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Shaolin Temple is a sacred place.

312
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Women are not allowed to enter.

313
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Master, my young master's surname is Murong.

314
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,500
Some time ago, he had come to Shaolin Temple to settle some matters.

315
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,600
May I know if he is still in the temple?

316
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,400
Miss, it is fate that brought him to the temple.

317
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,000
There's no point for you to pester him.

318
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,600
If women enter the temple, you will interrupt his meditation.

319
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,200
That is very sinful.

320
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Why would women interrupt his meditation?

321
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
And how is that sinful?

322
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,000
Obviously, it's because you men do not have enough will to stay focused;

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,600
yet, you're pinning the blame on women.

324
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,000
How shameful.

325
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,400
Furthermore, there's a saying in dharma.

326
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
"All beings are equal."

327
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,200
So, why aren't women allowed to enter Shaolin Temple?

328
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
- This...
- What?

329
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,200
Shaolin Temple is a sacred place with the most concentrated amount of Yang energy.

330
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,900
The rule has been set since long ago.

331
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,000
How can we allow women to enter as they like?

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,600
If you wish to pay homage to Buddha,

333
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,200
please go somewhere else.

334
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,800
Do not sully the Shaolin Temple.

335
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,700
That monk looks dumb and dull.

336
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,200
Let's not bother arguing with him.

337
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,500
We are all given birth by women.

338
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,800
- So how can he look down on women?
- Let's go.

339
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,700
That monk appears to be of low status here.

340
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,900
He clearly doesn't know everything that goes on inside the temple.

341
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,600
I think my cousin has already left Shaolin Temple.

342
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,000
Why don't we go back to Swallow's Nest first?

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
A'Bi, take Miss Wang and Young Master Duan with you and leave first.

344
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm going to teach that little brat a lesson.

345
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, dear.

346
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,400
The little monk has landed himself into trouble with Sister A'Zhu.

347
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,000
Then, you must take extra care.

348
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,200
Don't make enemies with Shaolin.

349
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,400
Don't worry, Miss Wang.

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
I have my own way.

351
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,000
Go on now.

352
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,700
Let's go.

353
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,800
I'd left home many years ago,

354
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,500
but I still remember the days when I played here.

355
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
Father was hardworking and thrifty.

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,400
We had used these tea cups for so many years

357
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,100
but he still couldn't bear to throw them away.

358
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,500
Father. Mother. I'm back.

359
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,200
Mother?

360
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,200
Mother?

361
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,300
Father!

362
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,500
Father.

363
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,200
My parents are humble farmers.

364
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Why would a powerful martial arts practitioner kill them?

365
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,000
It's clearly because of me.

366
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Amitabha.

367
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,700
We're too late.

368
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,900
Qiao Feng!

369
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,200
You're worse than animals.

370
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Mr. and Mrs. Qiao may not have been your birth parents,

371
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,800
but how could you forsake all the years and effort they spent raising you?

372
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,600
How could you be so cruel and heartless to have killed them?

373
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,900
I just got home.

374
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,000
I just saw that my parents had been murdered.

375
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,200
I was just about to investigate their murder.

376
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,100
Master, why did you accuse me of so?

377
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
Qiao Feng! How dare you act so brazenly at Shaoshi Mountain?

378
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,200
You're not skillful enough!

379
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,000
Masters, you must all be compassionate to have rushed here

380
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,300
to save my parents.

381
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,800
If I may ask,

382
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,400
how did you learn of the news

383
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
that someone would harm my parents?

384
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
You're only asking because you want to find out

385
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,800
who reported the matter and harm them.

386
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,200
You won't get a single word out of me

387
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,400
even if you torture me.

388
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,300
If I had planned to silence everyone here,

389
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,000
I would've killed all of you by now.

390
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,400
Well, it might not be that easy for you to silence us.

391
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
Empty. He's not here!

392
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He's not here either.

393
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Amitabha.

394
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,800
May I know how to get to Bodhi Temple?

395
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Amitabha.

396
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,200
Xu Zhu greets Martial Uncle Zhi Qing.

397
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
This way leads to Bodhi Temple.

398
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:00,000
Martial Uncle, you came to the temple earlier than I did.

399
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You already know where Bodhi Temple is.

400
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,600
Why did you ask me for directions?

401
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
How dare you talk to your martial uncle like that?

402
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,200
You're such a fool.

403
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,800
I was just testing you.

404
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,200
Martial Uncle, you are right.

405
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,800
To go to Bodhi Temple, please walk

406
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
until the end of this road.

407
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,600
It is located behind Zhengdao Temple.

408
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,800
That's better.

409
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
Xu Zhu. Oh, Xu Zhu.

410
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
Everyone here knows

411
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,700
that you grew up in the temple.

412
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,300
But Martial Uncle Zhi Qing

413
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,200
used such a simple question to test you just now.

414
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,400
It shows you're becoming dumber.

415
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,700
You must work harder.

416
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,800
[For father and mother, Qiao]

417
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,300
Father. Mother. I'm sorry for coming back late.

418
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,500
I couldn't see you before you passed away.

419
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,000
Otherwise, you would've been so happy...

420
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,200
to see that I have...

421
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,000
grown into a strong and healthy man.

422
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,700
But now, we are separated forever.

423
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,200
If the three of us could gather again,

424
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
even for only a day...

425
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,110
we could have still shared a happy moment together.

426
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,670
[For mother and father, QIao]

427
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,800
Father. Mother. Who killed you?

428
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I must catch the murderer.

429
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,600
I will avenge you.

430
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,600
The murderer did not kill my parents by chance.

431
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
He killed them just before I got home.

432
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,300
It was obviously planned ahead.

433
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,100
His purpose was not to kill,

434
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,000
but to put the blame on me.

435
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,600
The other person who knows

436
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
of my heritage in this world is Reverend Xuan Ku.

437
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
This is bad!

438
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,000
[Shaolin Temple]

439
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Junior Xuan Ku, do you have anything else to say?

440
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,300
On the day of my ordination,

441
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:26,000
my late master gave me the dharma name Xuan Ku.

442
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Buddha said that there were seven states of suffering,

443
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,600
which are birth, aging, sickness, death,

444
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,800
engaging someone you hate,

445
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,200
separation from someone you love,

446
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
and not being able to obtain what you desire.

447
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,500
I have tried to avoid these sufferings.

448
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,200
One can help oneself

449
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,100
but can't help others.

450
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,800
I feel ashamed to say this.

451
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,600
The suffering of engaging someone you hate or dislike

452
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,800
will definitely happen in one's life.

453
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Because of all these,

454
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
I deserve this karma.

455
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,900
All of you here

456
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,400
should feel happy for me

457
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,400
because I am fulfilling this cycle.

458
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,500
A few months ago, Xuan Bei was murdered by a person of evil.

459
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,800
We did all we could to find the murderer.

460
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,400
We went against Buddha's commandment of not getting angry.

461
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
But getting rid of the bad and evil

462
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
is a deed of saving others.

463
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,000
Removing an evil person

464
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
will save countless people.

465
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,400
Xuan Ku, is that person from the Murong clan?

466
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,700
Senior,

467
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,800
I don't want you and the others

468
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
to worry about me.

469
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,200
That will add to my karma.

470
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,500
As for that person,

471
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,400
if he puts down his knife,

472
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,800
he can repent and be saved.

473
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,600
If he continues to be stubborn,

474
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,200
he will be suffering in vain.

475
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,000
As for what he looks like,

476
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I think there's no need to mention it.

477
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,700
You're wise to have such a realization.

478
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,200
As a senior, I have been too obsessed over this.

479
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,200
My thoughts are at a low level.

480
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:29,700
I would like to meditate in peace for a while to repent.

481
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,200
Junior,

482
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
do take care.

483
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,000
Dear guest, you've come from far.

484
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,200
Why do you not enter?

485
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,600
Greetings, Master.

486
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,300
I, Qiao Feng, pay my respects to you.

487
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,300
Feng'er.

488
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,600
I was just thinking about you.

489
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,900
I want to see you.

490
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,850
Come in.

491
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,800
Come in.

492
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,800
Master.

493
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
You...

494
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,300
You are...

495
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,400
Are you Qiao Feng,

496
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,900
the disciple who I trained myself?

497
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,400
Yes, it's me.

498
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,600
I seldom accompany you.

499
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,900
Thank you for having me in your mind.

500
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,100
Seeing you being healthy

501
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
makes me very glad.

502
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,300
Good.

503
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,400
Good.

504
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,200
Good.

505
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,400
Master.

506
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,500
Master!

507
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,600
Master...

508
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Master...

509
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,100
You have potential,

510
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,500
but you lack something.

511
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,900
These are sins,

512
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,800
and these are good deeds.

513
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,200
From now on,

514
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,600
you must hold them both in your hands at all times.

515
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,100
Master, don't worry.

516
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,000
I will keep them balanced in my hands.

517
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Not only that,

518
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,100
you have to keep them in your heart as well.

519
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,800
Do no evil.

520
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,000
Do good deeds.

521
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,800
Think kindly and act kindly.

522
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,100
You will be blessed in return.

523
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,600
For all the years I spent

524
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,200
in the martial arts world,

525
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,600
I've been honest, sincere, and forthright

526
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,500
in everything I do and to everyone I meet.

527
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,400
In those years, my master taught me martial arts every day.

528
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,800
Even when it was raining heavily,

529
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,200
he had never skipped a day.

530
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,600
I must repay all that he has done for me

531
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,800
with everything I can.

532
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,200
Abbot!

533
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,060
Reverend Xuan Ku has passed away!

534
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,939
- Qiao Feng?
- Abbot.

535
00:34:12,939 --> 00:34:14,158
Why are you here?

536
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,660
I came to see Reverend Xuan Ku for something.

537
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,279
But unfortunately... unfortunately I witnessed his passing.

538
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,820
Abbot.

539
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,460
Why did my master end up like this?

540
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,720
Xuan Ku was assassinated.

541
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,820
He took a grave hit to his chest.

542
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,699
His ribs were all broken, and his organs were all damaged.

543
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:19,100
It was because of his thick power

544
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,039
that he made it until now.

545
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,000
Who was the murderer?

546
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,659
I asked him who the murderer was,

547
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:26,940
but he said he didn't know.

548
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,160
I also asked for the murderer's appearance and age,

549
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,340
but he said that there are seven sufferings in Buddhism.

550
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,400
Engaging someone you hate or dislike in life is one of them.

551
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,439
Since he met his enemy,

552
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,559
he thought he would take the opportunity to extricate himself.

553
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,060
As for the murderer's appearance,

554
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,720
he mentioned nothing about it.

555
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,980
I, Qiao Feng, am a layperson.

556
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,240
I must catch the murderer to avenge my master.

557
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,120
The guards at the temple are strict.

558
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:10,220
How did the murderer enter the temple without anyone noticing?

559
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,560
We didn't notice your presence until you entered as well.

560
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,099
So the murderer could have easily done the same.

561
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:23,133
I had urgent matters.

562
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,780
So I did not have time to ask for permission at the mountain gate.

563
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,680
Please forgive me, Abbot.

564
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,660
Reverend, it's time to take your medicine.

565
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,619
Reverend. Reverend, it's time to take your medicine.

566
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,300
Abbot, what happened to my master?

567
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,820
- He passed away.
- Passed...

568
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,000
My master passed away?

569
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,260
Master. Master.

570
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
It was him.

571
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,060
It was him who hurt Master!

572
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,800
What did you say?

573
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,900
Qing Song, don't be afraid.

574
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,780
Speak clearly.

575
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,919
You said that he was the one who hit your master?

576
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,420
Yes.

577
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,840
He hit Master's chest with his palm.

578
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,519
I saw it through the window.

579
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,279
Abbot, you... you have to hit him in return!

580
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,940
You must look carefully.

581
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,699
You must not accuse the wrong person.

582
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:44,359
I saw him clearly.

583
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,899
Right. It was him.

584
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:49,740
Abbot, he was the one who hurt master! Abbot, it was him!
- Reverend Xuan Ku,

585
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,459
was my master! I am indebted to him!

586
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:54,719
We haven't seen each other for more than ten years.

587
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,219
He was delighted when he saw that I had returned just now.

588
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,579
Since I've grown up and become an adult,

589
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,479
I look different from when I was a child.

590
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,940
Could it be because Master saw

591
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:10,039
that the murderer and I looked alike?

592
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,679
The murderer impersonated me to shift the blame on me.

593
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,660
My master was hurt by someone,

594
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,260
but he didn't know who that was.

595
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,880
When he saw me,

596
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,559
he was so overwhelmed that

597
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,039
he passed away.

598
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,679
Abbot!

599
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:28,959
I left the temple when I was really young. My looks have long changed since.

600
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,879
The murderer purposely impersonated me to shift the blame on me.

601
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,400
Qiao Feng.

602
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,779
Although you are no longer in the Beggars' Sect,

603
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,960
you're still famous in the martial arts world.

604
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,879
Today, you came to this temple

605
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,000
and hurt Xuan Ku.

606
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,820
May I know what brought you here?

607
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,020
Master.

608
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,639
Right before you passed away, you still thought that I was the murderer.

609
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:07,359
Master, I dare not offend you,

610
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,280
but the murderer killed you because of me.

611
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,040
If I took my life tonight, it would be to repay my debt to you.

612
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,000
It's not a pity.

613
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,500
But if I do so,

614
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,740
I will not be able to avenge you.

615
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,940
I have gone against Shaolin's respect.

616
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,640
Master,

617
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,320
please forgive me.

618
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:52,239
- He escaped!
- Catch him!

619
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,720
- Don't let him escape!
- Hurry up! Catch him!

620
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,520
- Where did he go?
- Stop!

621
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
- This way.
- Quick!

622
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,820
Where is he?

623
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,919
Listen carefully.

624
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,899
Zhi Jing and Zhi Ming, check the roof.

625
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:07,059
- We must not let Qiao Feng escape.
- Yes!

626
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:11,259
Zhi Kong and Zhi Ran, tell those who are on night duty to check every nook and corner.

627
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:12,780
Yes!

628
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,659
- He's not at the front gate.
- He's not at the north gate.

629
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,480
- Not at the east.
- Not at the west.

630
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,200
This is strange.

631
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,739
How can a person disappear just like that?

632
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:35,460
Zhi Ran, bring someone to help to move Xuan Ku's body to be cremated at Sheli Temple.

633
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,259
Others will go on patrol.

634
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:39,040
Yes!

635
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,020
Amitabha.

636
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,380
- Quick.
- Over there.

637
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,010
Let's go.

638
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,880
- Check carefully. That way!
- Yes!

639
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,500
- Did you find him?
- Anything?

640
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,600
- No!
- No!

641
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,440
- He's not here either.
-  Let's go there.

642
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,800
- Where is he hiding?
- Let's look there.

643
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,760
Where did he go?

644
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,660
He's not here either.

645
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,120
Let's go.

646
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,660
Everyone, let's walk faster.

647
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,980
Senior, it's all empty here in Bodhi Temple.

648
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,079
Where are the scriptures?

649
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,660
Why did Master tell us to guard this place?

650
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:56,159
He even said this was to prevent the enemies from stealing.

651
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,559
This is a secret in Bodhi Temple.

652
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,140
I can't tell you anything else.
