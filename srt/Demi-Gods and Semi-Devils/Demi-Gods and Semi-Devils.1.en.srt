During the Yuanyou Era of the Northern Song Dynasty,

14
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,879
the Song Emperor, Zhao Xu, was too young to govern,

Upon seeing the civil unrest and the weakening of the Song Dynasty,

the Liao Emperor disregarded the peace accord he signed with Great Song

21

Their incessant transgression and larceny

25
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:30,620

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,819
You have two hours to break your right arm and discard your weapons.

180
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:17,699
Leave the Limitless Mountain or the entire sect shall be massacred.

181
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,839
Who does this Shennong Sect think they are?

182
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,300
What a bold claim.

183
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,920
Your bully is about to die.

184
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,740
What do you mean?

185
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,720
The letter was laced with poison.

186
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,960
How do you know?

187
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,739
- Junior!
- Don't touch him. There's poison!

188
00:14:41,739 --> 00:14:43,740
That's such a basic way to poison a person.

189
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,320
It only works on rookies like you.

190
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,140
May I know who you are, Miss?

191
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,399
Come down and let's find a solution, shall we?

192
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,180
You heard the content of this letter.

193
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,220
The Shennong Sect will spare no one.

194
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,520
And that includes you.

195
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,780
They won't kill me.

196
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,439
They only want people from the Limitless Sword Sect.

197
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,839
I heard it on my journey, so I came here to watch the show.

198
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,239
How did you get on Shennong Sect's bad side?

199
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,279
They wanted to gather some herbs from our mountain.

200
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,299
I turned them away. So they snuck in.

201
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,299
We got into a quarrel and resorted to violence. We killed them.

202
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,420
I see.

203
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,760
Since you're willing to share your story with me,

204
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,159
I'll tell you mine then.

205
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,479
I was hunting some snakes by the mountain for my lightning ferret.

206
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,759
I bumped into several guys.

207
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,759
They said if they couldn't wipe out the entire Limitless Sword Sect,

208
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,580
they would take their own lives.

209
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,999
They also mentioned receiving orders from the Lingjiu Palace of the Piaomiao Peak

210
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,560
to unearth the truth about the Limitless Jade Cliff.

211
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,340
And then?

212
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,760
And then, they left.

213
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,999
All right. I'm done. See you then.

214
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,060
Watch out!

215
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,660
Stay here.

216
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,959
What? Do you want to fight me?

217
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,719
I just want you to be more specific with the details.

218
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,540
This old dude wants to kill me. What should I do?

219
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,740
Whatever you see fit.

220
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,540
We're in this together no matter what.

221
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,599
We will share every seed or beating.

222
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:32,460
I like you. I'm glad we met.

223
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,239
Come down. Let's go.

224
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,720
I...

225
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,900
But how?

226
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,779
- Poison! Her ferret is venomous!
- Master.

227
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,640
Antidote. Ask her for the antidote.

228
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,719
Quick. Give us the antidote.

229
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,799
I don't have it.

230
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,579
Just gather some Sky Herbs from the mountain and boil the herbs into a thick soup.

231
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,480
Is that true?

232
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,540
However, he has to stay still for six hours.

233
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,440
If the poison enters his heart, he dies.

234
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,559
Master.

235
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,160
Let's go.

236
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,940
Why are you still pointing your swords at me?

237
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,880
You want to have a taste of my ferret?

238
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,780
Do you want a taste of its bite?

239
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,140
Let's go.

240
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,120
Stop!

241
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,900
[Limitless Palace]

242
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,260
This way, please.

243
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Careful!

244
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,700
Thank you for pointing it out.

245
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,140
May I know your name?

246
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,039
I am no "master."

247
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,620
[Xu Zhu, Shaolin Temple]
My dharma name is Xu Zhu.

248
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,740
Your chief is having tea with the chief.

249
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,999
I shall inform them. Please wait here patiently.

250
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,680
Thank you.

251
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,799
The news of Liao's military conscription came to us all of a sudden, too.

252
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,940
However, according to the agreement signed,

253
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,461
even if a conflict were to occur, conscription would still be unnecessary.

254
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:39,719
[Reverend Zhi Guang, Zhiguan Temple]
According to this secret letter,

255
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,319
Prince Chu has ordered 30,000 soldiers.
[Reverend Xuan Bei, Shaolin Temple]

256
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,359
Something's off.

257
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,980
It might come to harm my Great Song.

258
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,860
The emperor is young.
[Wang Jiantong, Beggars' Sect Chief]

259
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,499
There are rumors in the palace that Grand Empress Dowager has fallen sick.

260
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,800
Even with the protection by the agreement,

261
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,259
the Liao people might have some other motive.

262
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,559
They are an ambitious bunch.

263
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,020
Western Xia, Jurchen, and even the Dali Kingdom.

264
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,159
They are not afraid of anyone.

265
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:18,279
This conscription might be for some other purposes.

266
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,319
Everything is interdependent.

267
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,639
If we allow the Liao people to grow ever so powerful,

268
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
they will be a threat to our land one day.

269
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,233
[Abbot Xuan Ci, Shaolin Temple]

270
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,380
In that case, I shall write to the Dali Kingdom now

271
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,879
to remind Mr. Duan to be careful.

272
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:47,800
Beware of the imperial court also.

273
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,959
And as for intel gathering by the border...

274
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,639
Worry not.

275
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
My disciples from the Beggar Sect are all over the world.

276
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,240
Leave it to us.

277
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,500
Thank you.

278
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,700
Amazing techniques.

279
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,319
If I don't test my skills against him, that would be so regretful.

280
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,860
This Murong Fu is strong in martial arts.

281
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,900
Unfortunately, he lacks an equal rival.

282
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,079
The tournament this year will be dull again.

283
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,980
I'll join.

284
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,780
Your techniques are amazing.

285
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,559
I'm Qiao Feng of the Beggars' Sect.

286
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,599
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

287
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,740
He's the famous Qiao Feng?

288
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,300
Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North.

289
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,700
Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North?!

290
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,660
Galactic Shift?

291
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,900
Stay cautious.

292
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,779
It seems like Murong Fu lost.

293
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:58,900
The difference in strength is obvious.

294
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,099
- I lost.
- Bravo!

295
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,639
Nice one, Qiao Feng.

296
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,839
You're too humble.

297
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,279
You fought so many matches in a row.

298
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,959
My sole advantage was my brute force.

299
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,739
Let's fight another day to commemorate our fateful encounter.

300
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:27,380
Farewell.

301
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,840
You wish to talk to me, Mr. Wang.

302
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,639
May I know why?

303
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,739
Qiao Feng came today.

304
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:48,079
Both of you bore witness to it.

305
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,639
I wonder what you think of him?

306
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,179
He used to study at Shaolin Temple when he was young.

307
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,959
He then joined the Beggars' Sect.

308
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,239
He has grown a lot these past few years.

309
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,119
I heard that Murong Fu got all the spotlight in the matches today

310
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,580
but ultimately lost to Qiao Feng.

311
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,919
They all talk of Qiao Feng of the North and Murong of the South.

312
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,199
This can show that he has made a name for himself in the martial arts world.

313
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,920
He was the messenger who delivered us the news

314
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,840
of Liao's conscription.

315
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,059
With this sudden query of yours, Mr. Wang, are you...

316
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,999
Truth be told, I have limited potential.

317
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:32,359
Old age is catching up to me, too.

318
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,900
It's time to find an heir.

319
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,999
Qiao Feng is talented.

320
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,399
Back in the tournament at Mountain Tai,

321
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,519
he was barely 20 years old.

322
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,599
But he defeated nine of Beggars' Sect's most formidable enemies in a row.

323
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,740
He has spread the name of my sect far and wide.

324
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,759
He once charged into the enemy base alone

325
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:54,199
and assassinated the second in command of the Liao army.

326
00:26:54,199 --> 00:26:58,479
With such feats under his belt, he should have already been promoted to be the chief.

327
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,480
I should have seen this coming.

328
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,119
You passed the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms to him

329
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,239
and assigned him with great quests.

330
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,680
It's all part of your plan to make him the next chief.

331
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,540
You must not do so.

332
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,339
The Beggars' Sect is the strongest sect at the moment.

333
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,100
A chief plays a pivotal role.

334
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,999
I've known this man since he was a little boy.

335
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,159
He places the bond between people above all else.

336
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,519
To help him conquer his inner demon,

337
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,540
I gave him three difficult tasks.

338
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,639
He solved them all.

339
00:27:36,639 --> 00:27:39,619
If I hadn't made things hard on him,

340
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:43,639
he would have been the chief already.

341
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,320
If you have already made up your mind,

342
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,879
then I can only give you my blessing.

343
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,759
However, we still need to be ready

344
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,119
for the worst-case scenario.

345
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,879
Don't worry.

346
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,859
I have plans to deal with this.

347
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,580
That would be best.

348
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,200
Amitabha.

349
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,000
Wonderful.

350
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,599
Good. Good.

351
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,800
Nice.

352
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,880
Good.

353
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,460
Xu Zhu, our master is not here.

354
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,500
You don't have to show off your strength.

355
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,240
Have you watched the match between Qiao Feng and Murong Fu today?

356
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,239
Trust me, it won't do you any good.

357
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,799
With your tiny brain,

358
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,719
you can practice your entire life and never land a hit on him.

359
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,719
You know why?

360
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,540
Because you're dumb and stupid.

361
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,219
You can't even chant properly. You're a fool.

362
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:02,820
Isn't that right?

363
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,620
Indeed.

364
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,839
Master said that only when we look up to somebody can we improve ourselves.

365
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,659
Even though both of them are great heroes,

366
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:18,819
but they must have started from the basics, too.

367
00:29:18,819 --> 00:29:22,039
I'm slow, but I can start somewhere.

368
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,239
I should work even harder.

369
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,680
They became famous warriors in their 20s.

370
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,000
Look at you. You're still sweeping leaves.

371
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,780
Senior, there's nothing lowly about sweeping leaves.

372
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,639
Master says that with the right mindset,

373
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:39,119
eating can be a form of training, so can walking.

374
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,319
So sweeping leaves is also a form of training.

375
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,599
What?

376
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,120
Sweeping leaves is a form of training?

377
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,179
Fine then.

378
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,619
You want to sweep the floor, don't you?

379
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:53,559
Then sweep it well and train well.

380
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,940
- I can't believe you're doing it!
- Amitabha.

381
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,140
Abbot.

382
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,739
Why are you making fun of your peer instead of working hard?

383
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,799
We are all equal in Buddha's eyes.

384
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,879
You who look down on others

385
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,319
and make fun of your peers,

386
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,479
have forgotten our teachings.

387
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,620
As your punishment, copy the Heart Sutra a hundred times.

388
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,439
Off you go.

389
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,140
Yes.

390
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
Xu Zhu.

391
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,519
Did you learn something from the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms?

392
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,379
I'm too dumb. I can't learn anything from it.

393
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:50,399
I just feel that when Mr. Qiao used it,

394
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,039
it felt unstoppable and powerful.

395
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,959
Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms is a technique with great might.

396
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,939
However, the essence of it is not about using force but not overdoing it.

397
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,100
The technique might look simple,

398
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,419
but each palm strikes with varying levels of force

399
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,119
and varying levels of strength.

400
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,580
From brute force comes flexibility.

401
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,019
Murong Fu lost the match because he failed to adapt to the fluctuation of strength

402
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:21,159
and tell the difference between every strike.

403
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,759
Heroes are everywhere.

404
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,359
If you ever have the chance to train in the outside world,

405
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,940
you'll learn the vastness of our world.

406
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,820
I shall not forget this lesson.

407
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,359
Go on.

408
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,860
Yes.

409
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,240
Unbound by mortal desire.

410
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,640
This might be your blessing.

411
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,959
Your ferret is called a lightning ferret?

412
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,619
Quick as the gust, fast as the lightning?

413
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:58,299
Indeed. It's not just an impressive name.

414
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,679
Its fangs are even more poisonous.

415
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,359
Once bitten, one must sever the affected part.

416
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,539
Any further delay of treatment will result in death after eight days.

417
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:09,600
Didn't you say that a broth of Sky Herb could cure it?

418
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,979
I tricked them.

419
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:14,180
If I didn't say that, they wouldn't have released us.

420
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,959
No, wait for me. I must inform them.

421
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:20,299
You fool!

422
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,539
If you head back now, we will all be dead.

423
00:32:22,539 --> 00:32:24,039
My ferret is strong,

424
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,079
but it can't fend off a crowd on its own.

425
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,699
You said we would share all seeds and take on fights.

426
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,919
I can't abandon you and flee alone.

427
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,139
My last name is Zhong. My parents call me Ling'er.

428
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,679
And you? Why did you come to Limitless Mountain?

429
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,019
I heard that the scenery here is serene.

430
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,400
And so I came to check it out.

431
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,819
Miss Zhong, what's that over there?

432
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,439
This is bad.

433
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,319
The Shennong Sect must be brewing poisons over there to kill the Limitless Sword Sect.

434
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,499
Brother Duan, let's leave.

435
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:08,520
Let's not get involved.

436
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,679
The violence in the martial arts world is beyond any cruelty.

437
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,279
No.

438
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,919
I have to talk to their chief.

439
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,079
I must stop them from killing the people.

440
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,119
If you're scared,

441
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,959
just wait here for me.

442
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
I'll go there myself.

443
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,920
Brother Duan!

444
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,919
Are you okay?

445
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,240
Why did you do that?

446
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,339
Your food, sir.

447
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,219
- Here, please.
- Thank you.

448
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,059
Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North are the heroes of our generation.

449
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:29,619
But I think it's just an exaggeration.

450
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:31,838
Between Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North,

451
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,120
the Northern warrior is obviously superior.

452
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,059
- Young Master.
- It's okay.

453
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,839
Why did you...

454
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,540
It hurts.

455
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,059
You should have been more mindful with your hand and not touching me like a pervert.

456
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,819
If it were someone else, I would have killed them.

457
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:24,199
I didn't do it on purpose.

458
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,239
Just now in the Sword Lake Palace,

459
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,199
if you hadn't helped me,

460
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,759
I would have gotten more beatings.

461
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,979
However, you also hurt me twice. We're even now.

462
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,919
Are you mad at me right now?

463
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:39,519
So after you hit me,

464
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,720
I have to say "Nice hit there" or "Great job"?

465
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,960
Should I thank you for hurting me?

466
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,519
From today onwards,

467
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,079
I won't hit you again.

468
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,480
Don't be mad.

469
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,679
Fine.

470
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,960
But only if you let me hit you twice.

471
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,119
Go ahead.

472
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,359
But... don't hit me too hard.

473
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:07,280
Okay.

474
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,300
Here I go.

475
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,860
What are you waiting for?

476
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,859
It's done. Those were hard. Do you feel the pain now?

477
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,140
I knew you were a nice person.

478
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:35,759
Okay. I have had my payback.

479
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,039
I have to go find that Chief Sikong Xuan.

480
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,879
You know nothing about their rules in the martial arts world.

481
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:42,739
If you ruffle his feathers, not even I can save you.

482
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:44,399
Let me tag along.

483
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,800
Let's go.

484
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,800
Brother Duan, look.

485
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,239
That old guy sitting in the middle is the Chief of the Shennong Sect, Sikong Xuan.

486
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,279
Okay. Let's greet him.

487
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:15,440
[Sikong Xuan, Shennong Sect]

488
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,800
- Come help out.
- Okay.

489
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,660
You must be careful.

490
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,650
- Who is that?
- I don't know him.

491
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,080
Who is that?

492
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,399
Greetings, Chief Sikong Xuan.

493
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,679
I am Duan Yu.

494
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,219
Can I help you?

495
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,820
I heard that you were on bad terms with the Limitless Sword Sect.

496
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,299
I would like to mediate.

497
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:49,159
You know, it's better to forgive than to hate.

498
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,019
Also, gang violence is against the law.

499
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,779
If the authorities take notice, it'll be really ugly.

500
00:37:54,779 --> 00:37:58,439
Therefore, I implore you to put a stop to it before it's too late

501
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,960
and forget about getting revenge from the Limitless Sword Sect.

502
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,919
Who are you?

503
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,700
Why are you wasting my time?

504
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,420
Who sent you here?

505
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,759
No one.

506
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,040
I came here myself.

507
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,959
I've survived the martial arts world for four decades.

508
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,780
You're the most disrespectful brat I've seen.

509
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,899
Take him down.

510
00:38:23,899 --> 00:38:25,199
Hold on.

511
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:27,719
Chief Sikong, Young Master Duan merely offered his advice.

512
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:31,019
You could have just ignored him. The violence is unnecessary.

513
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,499
Brother Duan, he's too stubborn.

514
00:38:34,499 --> 00:38:36,199
Let's leave him alone. Let's go.

515
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,439
Okay.

516
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,099
Two brats are making a scene before me.

517
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,159
They must have come with an ulterior motive.

518
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,100
Tie up that girl.

519
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,099
Hey, you old man with the beard.

520
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,219
You... Don't force me to fight you.

521
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:54,559
Release Brother Duan immediately.

522
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,799
I'm not afraid of you.

523
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,119
It's just that my father asked me to keep a low profile.

524
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,599
Such insolence!

525
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,360
Take her down!

526
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,560
Careful, Miss Zhong!

527
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,179
Brother Duan, let's go.

528
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,940
Burn realgar at the east, musk at the west.

529
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,339
Split and search the north and the south.

530
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,919
Don't let that girl escape!

531
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,320
Yes!

532
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,319
Our recent trip to the border has one priority.

533
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,039
Stealth.

534
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,819
We must find out if the Liao Army has conscripted more soldiers.

535
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:06,799
Check what they have and find their plan.

536
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,319
Remember, unless it's absolutely necessary,

537
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,499
avoid any direct confrontations.

538
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:13,059
We do not want to alert them.

539
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:14,560
Yes!

540
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,019
In addition, I've also informed Commander-in-Chief Han to be extra cautious.

541
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:21,600
If Liao makes a move,

542
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,459
you are to join Commander-in-Chief Han

543
00:40:24,459 --> 00:40:27,179
and stand by to provide backup for the army.

544
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,480
Yes!

545
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,560
Master.

546
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,660
Greetings, Chief.

547
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,479
Abbot Xuan Ci has already informed the Ministry of Defense regarding Liao's conscription.

548
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:47,080
However, the imperial court thinks it's only our speculation. They refuse to take it seriously.

549
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,759
But this brings danger to the civilians who live along the border.

550
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:52,819
Even if it's just a small matter, we cannot just neglect it.

551
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:57,379
If there's any update, we'll inform the imperial court.

552
00:40:57,379 --> 00:40:59,919
- You can leave first.
- Yes!

553
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,199
Feng'er, you've been with us for a decade already.

554
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,199
Master, more than a decade.

555
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,520
I joined the sect when I was 16.

556
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,179
After all these years, what do you think of the sect?

557
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,899
It's like my second home.

558
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:31,539
My clan mates treat me like family.

559
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,899
They are my kin and irreplaceable.

560
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:35,719
All this time,

561
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,319
I gave you three tasks and seven ordeals.

562
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:44,439
I asked you to run all over the place for us.

563
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,479
And I asked you to infiltrate the enemy base alone.

564
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,779
You almost lost your life.

565
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:51,379
Do you hold any grudges against me?

566
00:41:51,379 --> 00:41:53,939
You merely expect greatness from me.

567
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:55,679
Why would I hold grudges?

568
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,280
Good.

569
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,979
I knew you were the right person.

570
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:05,159
Qiao Feng, disciple of the Beggars' Sect, kneel before me.

571
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,720
Yes!

572
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,839
With the power vested in me, I, Wang Jiantong, the 8th chief of the Beggars' Sect,

573
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,359
on behalf of my predecessors,

574
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,379
pass down the Dog Beating Staff technique to the 9th generation disciple, Qiao Feng.

575
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:27,080
From now on, you are the 9th chief of the Beggars' Sect.

576
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,839
The sect will be your priority.

577
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,199
You shall live and die with the sect.

578
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,199
I have contacted all elders and branch leaders.

579
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,879
We will hold your inauguration ceremony in the headquarter soon.

580
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,239
From now on, I leave the sect to your care.

581
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,339
I, Qiao Feng, will not let you down.

582
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:54,310
[Righteousness]

608
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,260
Qiao Feng, do you know the importance of

609
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,740
- the Dog Beating Staff?
- I understand.

610
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,450
I , Wang Jiantong, am a person who has no talents.

611
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,400
Today, I will give the chief position

612
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,660
to the 9th Chief,

613
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,320
Qiao Feng! Do you agree?

614
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,220
Today, I , Qiao Feng, will inherit the chief position.

615
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:49,490
In the future, I will

616
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,010
think of the Beggars' Sect first!

617
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,120
Welcome, Chief.
