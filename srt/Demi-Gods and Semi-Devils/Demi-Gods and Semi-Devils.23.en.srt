[Episode 23]

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,239
In Buddhism, a kind soul and a sinner are equal beings.

14
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:45,980
However, I am not a Buddhist follower.

15
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,120
I do not have it in me to move on.

16
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,900
Reverend, I seek your counsel.

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,120
Who is the leader?

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,740
Reverend?

19
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,900
He passed away.

20
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,919
Every being on earth is born equal.

21
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,959
The Saint and the beasts are treated equally.

22
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,719
Let's go.

23
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,679
The Han and the Khitan could be both fake and real.

24
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,000
Gratitude and resentment will all eventually turn into ashes.

25
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,520
A'Zhu... I did not wish to harm Reverend Zhi Guang.

26
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,519
But why did he do that?

27
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,680
I think... it's still the doing of that evil person.

28
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,500
I think so too.

29
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,060
He came before me and misled Revered Zhi Guang

30
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,460
to think that I'd come for vengeance.

31
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,759
Fearing the harm I might cause him,

32
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,619
Reverend Zhi Guang poisoned himself after telling me those words.

33
00:04:27,619 --> 00:04:29,500
Brother Xiao,

34
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,940
I have an honest opinion

35
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,100
- but I don't know if I should say it.
- Go ahead.

36
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,639
Actually, I think that what Reverend Zhi Guang said before makes lots of sense.

37
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,019
The Han and the Khitan could be both fake and real.

38
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,879
Gratitude and resentment will all eventually turn into ashes.

39
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,180
Actually, the Hans and the Khitans

40
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,740
are all the same.

41
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,199
The days of always tasting blood and fighting with a sword in the martial arts world

42
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,740
is probably something you have grown tired of.

43
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,820
Why not just hunt or raise livestock outside of the Yanmen Pass

44
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,700
and forget the grudges from the pugilist world?

45
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,620
You're right.

46
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,599
I'm sick of playing with death.

47
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,560
Settling outside of the Pass

48
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,319
while riding horses or chasing animals

49
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,940
will certainly be more worry-free and liberating.

50
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,760
A'Zhu, if I settle down outside of the Pass,

51
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,620
will you come and visit me?

52
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,679
Didn't I tell you already?

53
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
Hunting and raising livestock.

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,480
You hunt,

55
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,800
I raise livestock.

56
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,519
You won't mind the fact that I'm a Khitan?

57
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,940
Han people are human.

58
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,959
Khitans are also human.

59
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,820
I...

60
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
I would like being a Khitan.

61
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,940
Follow me then.

62
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,960
Let's ride horses, hunt, and raise livestock together without any regret.

63
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,799
More than that.

64
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,660
No matter the pain and hardship,

65
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,359
I will never regret it.

66
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,180
I sincerely want this.

67
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,320
I am not being forced at all.

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:39,220
I'd relinquish my position as the Chief of the Beggars' Sect

69
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,239
or even the Song Emperor just to be with you.

70
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,460
Brother Xiao...

71
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,240
Let's find Kang Min.

72
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,420
Whether she will tell me everything or not,

73
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,599
she is our last target.

74
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,399
After asking her that question,

75
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,600
we will venture beyond the Pass.

76
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,820
From now onwards,

77
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,400
I won't walk a lonely path.

78
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,439
I won't be looked down upon.

79
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,179
Because I know that there's one person in this world...

80
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:08,280
Who respects you,

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,060
looks up to you,

82
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,020
appreciates you,

83
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,640
and who admires you.

84
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,679
I want to be together with you forever.

85
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:36,020
Together, we'll share every

86
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,300
pain, humiliation,

87
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,620
risk, and burden.

88
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,599
Without investigating the truth,

89
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,639
we blindly assumed Qiao Feng to be the cause of several deaths.

90
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,720
We even decided to kill Qiao Feng together.

91
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,420
Amitabha.

92
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,319
My dear juniors,

93
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,619
you wished for Qiao Feng to be the real culprit so badly

94
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:54,439
so that it would conveniently prove to everyone

95
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:57,959
the bloodthirsty nature of Khitans.

96
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,199
That way, the murder of Qiao Feng's parents 30 years ago

97
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:06,100
would be something that could be justified and right.

98
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,200
Is that so?

99
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,200
Guilty. Guilty.

100
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,959
I was like this too.

101
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,399
Even though Qiao Feng promised not to harm Zhi Guang,

102
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,639
prejudice still clouded my vision

103
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,199
and I sent someone to spy on Qiao Feng.

104
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,159
I betrayed the trust a fine gentleman placed in me.

105
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,980
However, praise the Buddha, thanks to my spy,

106
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,759
I found out that Reverend Zhi Guang committed suicide by ingesting poison.

107
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,100
It wasn't Qiao Feng who did it.

108
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,380
Now, rumors have spread far and wide.

109
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,559
Everyone thinks Qiao Feng is the killer.

110
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,699
We should announce the truth to debunk the misconception.

111
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:01,640
What do you think, Abbot?

112
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,200
I wish to do this, too.

113
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,800
Go now.

114
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,700
Feng'er has exceptional talent in martial arts.

115
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,200
Even better, he is a man of moral integrity

116
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
and is suited to lead.

117
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to pass down everything I know to him.

118
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,900
And when the right moment presents itself,

119
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,400
I will pass the chief position to him, too.

120
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,800
My young brother, what do you think?

121
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,600
Beggars' Sect is the largest sect in the world.

122
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,100
If he inherits everything from you and is a righteous person,

123
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,500
then he is indeed the best choice.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
I only hope that he will be independent

125
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,300
and lead a peaceful life. That is enough.

126
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Oh, Xuan Ci. You have been reckless.

127
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,200
You supported Qiao Feng to be the Beggars' Sect Chief

128
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
and now, he's stuck in a moral dilemma

129
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
and does not know how to proceed.

130
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,800
The martial arts world is now in disarray.

131
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Many righteous souls have lost their lives.

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,700
Your juniors are plagued by delusion.

133
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,100
But you, as the Abbot,

134
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,400
you are plagued by greed, aversion, and delusion; the three poisons.

135
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,500
Xuan Ci, you bear heavy sins.

136
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,800
Karma will catch up to you eventually.

137
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,399
Brother Xiao, did you know why I disguised as Elder Bai?

138
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,000
It's because when I was treated by Physician Xue in Heroes' Gathering Manor,

139
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,600
Elder Bai was always beside me.

140
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,400
So disguising as him was the easiest.

141
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,900
Let me have a look again.

142
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,300
I have known Elder Bai for several decades

143
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,100
and I still can't find a flaw in your disguise.

144
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,600
We've arrived.

145
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
I'm telling you now.

146
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
When you see Kang Min later, you cannot talk much.

147
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Kang Min is astute. We don't want her to detect anything.

148
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Got it?

149
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,800
Yes.

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,500
This trick of yours is so...

151
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,000
Sister-in-Law.

152
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
Welcome to my humble abode, Elder Bai.

153
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,100
I didn't expect a sudden visit.

154
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,500
I have something to discuss with you.

155
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,800
So I came all of a sudden. Please pardon my sudden intrusion.

156
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
Don't be this formal.

157
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,800
Come in and have some tea.

158
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,600
Have a seat, Elder Bai.

159
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,000
May I know who this gentleman is?

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,900
Is he one of us?

161
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,199
This is Brother Chen Xiu from the Daren branch.

162
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,300
You met him during the meeting,

163
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,000
but you must have forgotten.

164
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,300
Greetings, Sister-in-Law.

165
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,800
How can I help you, Elder Bai?

166
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,000
I believe you must have heard the news

167
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,600
of Elder Xu passing away in Weihui City.

168
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Of course.

169
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,000
We all suspected Qiao Feng to be behind his death.

170
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,800
Soon, three seniors, Zhao Qiansun, Mr. and Mrs. Tan,

171
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
were found dead outside of Weihui City, too.

172
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,400
And then, the Stern Faced Judge and the entire Shan family

173
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,200
were burned to the ground by someone.

174
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,700
Several days ago, I was in Jiangnan

175
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,200
to discipline a 7th generation disciple who went against the sect rules.

176
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,300
Suddenly, the death of Reverend Zhi Guang on the Zhiguan Temple, Tiantai Mountain

177
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,600
came to my ears.

178
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Qiao Feng did it again?

179
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,800
I did investigate the Zhi Guan Temple

180
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,400
but I couldn't find anything.

181
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,600
Qiao Feng is most probably behind it

182
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,600
and I reckon he'll target you next.

183
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,100
That's why I rushed here to warn you so that you can flee.

184
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,400
What do you plan to do, Sister-in-Law?

185
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
I appreciate your thoughts, Elder Bai

186
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,800
but I do not want to leave.

187
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,700
By right, I should stay somewhere nearby these few days to protect you.

188
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,000
While my martial arts are nowhere as strong as Qiao Feng,

189
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,900
but I can buy you some time in times of danger.

190
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,000
However, on my way here,

191
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,400
I heard about another confidential matter.

192
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,900
It must be of utmost importance then.

193
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
Wait for me outside.

194
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
I have something classified to tell Madam Ma.

195
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,400
Yes.

196
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,900
So, why are you here?

197
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,200
I came bearing important news.

198
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,600
It is related to the death of Brother Ma Dayuan.

199
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,200
Is that so?

200
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,300
When I was in Weihui City for the funeral of Elder Xu,

201
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,400
I saw Zhao Qiansun.

202
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,200
He told me that he knew

203
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,800
who killed Brother Dayuan.

204
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,279
Are you joking?

205
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,800
This is a serious matter.

206
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,600
I would never joke with it.

207
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,500
Zhao Qiansun did say that he absolutely

208
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,600
knew who killed Brother Dayuan.

209
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
It's not Qiao Feng. Not the Murong clan either.

210
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,900
The true killer is actually someone else.

211
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,800
How did he know?

212
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
How did he know?!

213
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,800
What are you talking about?

214
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,600
Nonsense.

215
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,800
Sister-in-Law, be patient.

216
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,400
Let me explain to you.

217
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,500
Zhao Qiansun told me

218
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,200
that during the last Mid Autumn Festival in August,

219
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,000
Mr. and Mrs. Tan as well as the killer of Dayuan

220
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,700
had a get-together at the leader's place.

221
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,000
He told you that?

222
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes.

223
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,600
And so I quizzed him about the identity of the killer.

224
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,400
He then said that he couldn't tell me the name.

225
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
I then asked Mr. Tan

226
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,900
but he just glared at me angrily without saying anything.

227
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,600
Mrs. Tan told me, however.

228
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
She said that

229
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,900
it wasn't fake at all.

230
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,800
And that it was her who told Zhao Qiansun.

231
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,600
Now I understand why Mr. Tan was so upset.

232
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
He must be angry at his wife

233
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,700
because she told Zhao Qiansun about everything.

234
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,200
And Zhao Qiansun refused to tell me the identity of the killer

235
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,100
in order to protect his old lover, Mrs. Tan.

236
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,800
So what?

237
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,400
Zhao Qiansun also said that everyone thought Qiao Feng

238
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
and Murong Fu killed Dayuan.

239
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,300
But the real killer is still out and about, living a free life.

240
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,000
If Dayuan saw this from heaven,

241
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,900
he wouldn't be able to rest in peace.

242
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,300
Indeed. Too bad Zhao Qiansun died as well.

243
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,400
Mr. and Mrs. Tan didn't tell you, did they?

244
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
They didn't.

245
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,500
In this case, I can only ask the leader myself.

246
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,400
What's funny is that I don't know who the leader is

247
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,800
and where he lives.

248
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,400
So you gave me this elaborate story

249
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,050
just to fish out the info regarding the leader from me?

250
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,700
If you can't tell me, you can remain silent.

251
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,400
You can investigate yourself

252
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,700
and then, we'll settle the score with the killer together.

253
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,300
Elder Bai, as for the identity of the leader,

254
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,500
I really can't tell an outsider.

255
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,400
If Qiao Feng gets hold of this info,

256
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,100
he will find the leader to avenge the death of his parents.

257
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,800
But you're not an outsider, Elder Bai.

258
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,900
I guess I don't have anything to hide.

259
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,400
The leader is...

260
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,520
The moon has been so round and bright lately.

261
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,679
Indeed. It is the full moon.

262
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,559
Naturally, it is round and bright.

263
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,999
What a shame.

264
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,880
Brother Dayuan will never be able to admire it again.

265
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,190
Speaking of mooncake,

266
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,150
do you like it sweet or savory?

267
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,219
Beggars can't be so picky with food.

268
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:43,619
Well, if I can't find the killer and avenge Brother Dayuan,

269
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,139
luxurious delicacies will taste bland to me,

270
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,860
let alone mooncakes.

271
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,540
Elder Bai, come.

272
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,599
Have a seat and some tea.

273
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,800
Thanks, Sister-in-Law.

274
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,439
Elder Bai, you are committed to finding the real killer

275
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,539
to avenge your friend.

276
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,159
I really appreciate it.

277
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,899
Sister-in-Law, this is just my duty.

278
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:30,839
Besides, everyone from the Beggars' Sect

279
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,240
wants to avenge Brother Dayuan, too.

280
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,039
The leader is well-respected

281
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,919
and has many people under him.

282
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,039
Just one order from him and more than ten thousand men will get to work.

283
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,999
Also, he has one particular habit:

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,279
he really likes to protect his allies and friends.

285
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,020
If you asked him who the killer was like this,

286
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,480
he wouldn't tell you a thing.

287
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,860
In this world,

288
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,119
the ability to command ten thousand people with one word...

289
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,180
in the past, Beggars' Sect Chief could do it.

290
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,840
But now...the Shaolin disciples are everywhere.

291
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,119
One word from the leaders or Abbot of Shaolin

292
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,260
will be able to mobilize more than ten thousand people.

293
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
You don't need to guess around anymore.

294
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,239
Let me give you more tips.

295
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,679
You only need to guess in the southwest direction.

296
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,340
Southwest?

297
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,980
No one of great importance lives in the southwest.

298
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,599
I don't know any martial arts.

299
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,199
Elder Bai, surely you know

300
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:00,720
who is famous for this technique?

301
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,200
Are you talking about a touching technique?

302
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,939
The Vajra Finger from Shaolin

303
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:11,959
and the Lethal Finger from the Zheng family by Cangzhou, Hebei are quite famous.

304
00:23:11,959 --> 00:23:14,140
You're knowledgeable, Elder Bai.

305
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,439
But how could you forget the renowned One-Finger Death Touch?

306
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,760
One-Finger Death Touch?

307
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,759
Of course, I know about that.

308
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,279
However, the Duan family is now the ruler of Dali.

309
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,720
They already severed their ties to the martial arts world.

310
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,719
If the leader has some sort of relationship with the Duan family,

311
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:39,500
that could very well just be a rumor.

312
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,579
The Duan family is the ruler of Dali

313
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:46,839
but there isn't only one person in the Duan family.

314
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,799
The leader is the younger brother of the Dali Emperor.

315
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:54,120
His name is Duan Zhengchun,

316
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,120
Prince Zhennan.

317
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,540
But he's a noble prince.

318
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,620
How could he meddle in the pugilist world?

319
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,180
If it's just an ordinary feud,

320
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,780
Prince Duan would never bring himself into the mess.

321
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,540
But if it's related to the national security of Dali,

322
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,940
then he would have to intervene.

323
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,260
If it's like this, then he definitely would intervene.

324
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,940
I heard from Elder Xu

325
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,300
that Song serves as Dali Kingdom's barricade against the northern threat.

326
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,239
If Liao conquers Song,

327
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,559
then the Dali Kingdom will be Liao's second target.

328
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,580
The Dali Kingdom and the Song empire need each other

329
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,360
so the Dali Kingdom will not want

330
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,930
Liao to conquer Song.

331
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,919
Elder Xu is right.

332
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,900
He also said that back when Prince Duan came

333
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,460
to our headquarter as a guest,

334
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,459
he drank and exchanged techniques with Chief Wang.

335
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,279
When he heard that Khitan warriors

336
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,760
were invading the Shaolin Temple for the scriptures,

337
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,399
he led everyone to Yanmen Pass to intercept the warriors.

338
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,320
He said it's for the Song empire, but it's also for Dali.

339
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,380
I also heard

340
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,019
that Prince Duan was young but powerful at that time.

341
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,659
He's also a righteous man.

342
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:20,079
He is a leader in the Dali Kingdom

343
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,039
and so in this martial arts world,

344
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:27,180
who can the leader be if not him?

345
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,119
Also, he will become the Dali Emperor one day.

346
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,739
A nobleman like him

347
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:36,300
will not take orders

348
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,260
from the brutes around him.

349
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,820
Who would have thought

350
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,160
that the leader is actually Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom.

351
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,040
No wonder people would rather die than rat him out.

352
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,760
It's all to protect him.

353
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,200
Elder Bai.

354
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,419
Please don't tell anyone this.

355
00:26:02,419 --> 00:26:05,739
Prince Duan and our sect are very close.

356
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:09,479
If this secret breaks out, it will be disastrous.

357
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:11,439
I agree, Sister-in-Law.

358
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,099
I will keep this secret with me.

359
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,239
Can you swear on it then?

360
00:26:20,239 --> 00:26:24,299
That way, it will reassure me.

361
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,999
Okay.

362
00:26:25,999 --> 00:26:28,719
I, Bai Shijing, swear to never tell anyone

363
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,199
that Duan Zhengchun is the leader.

364
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,960
If I do, I shall be cut into thousand pieces.

365
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,260
My reputation will be ruined and I will be a laughing stock.

366
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,879
Thank you.

367
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,739
Well, I shall seek this Prince Duan now in the Dali Kingdom.

368
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:48,819
I will try to fish out who else was there with him

369
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,980
during the last Mid Autumn Festival.

370
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,600
That way, we can find the real killer.

371
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,540
Please do, Elder Bai.

372
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,420
You're a loyal man.

373
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,520
My dead husband

374
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,119
must be honored to have you as a friend.

375
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,799
You're too polite, Sister-in-Law.

376
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,419
Brother Dayuan is my kin.

377
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,380
I will do anything for him.

378
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,199
So, take care, Sister-in-Law. I should get going now.

379
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,959
- Enjoy your meal, Miss.
- Thank you.

380
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,659
Brother Xiao, you haven't had any wine for a few days.

381
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,439
You must be craving it.

382
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,540
Knowing who your enemy is is definitely wonderful news.

383
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,540
I will drink with you to celebrate it.

384
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,519
I'm from the Duan family of Dali Kingdom.

385
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm new to Jiangnan and I can already meet a true hero like you, Brother Qiao.

386
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,359
The wine I drink will travel with my qi to each pressure point.

387
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:55,420
And then, they will be released out of my body through my fingertip.

388
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,940
We just met and yet, it feels like we're old friends.

389
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,999
Why don't we

390
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,520
swear each other as brother now?

391
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,740
Brother Xiao, you finally know who your enemy is.

392
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,980
Why are you not happy?

393
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,720
Dali Duan Family.

394
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,459
Six Pulse Excalibur.

395
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:20,619
Brother Xiao, apart from the death of your biological parents,

396
00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:22,460
there is also your adoptive parents,

397
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,159
as well as your Master, Reverend Xuan Ku, deaths.

398
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,380
This is a great vengeance.

399
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,239
You need not care about the rules or the moral code of the pugilist world anymore.

400
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,780
You're right.

401
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,459
Kindness and grudges, never one without another.

402
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,320
One more thing, Brother Xiao.

403
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,520
When I talked to Kang Min today, I felt scared.

404
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,179
I think something's off.

405
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,380
She's an astute woman.

406
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,879
You were probably afraid because you were worried that she might see through your disguise.

407
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,980
Perhaps.

408
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,480
But on this trip to Dali, we will find ourselves outnumbered.

409
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,659
I'm scared... that it will be very risky.

410
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:13,079
Don't worry.

411
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,079
Before I avenge my parents, I won't die.

412
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,519
I heard from Old Master Murong

413
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,779
that the signature technique of the Dali Duan family

414
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:28,119
is not One-Finger Death Touch.

415
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,979
It's something called Six Pulse Excalibur.

416
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:33,720
Yes. I was brooding

417
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,260
not just because the brotherhood between Young Master Duan and I will soon end

418
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,359
but also because of the Duan family's Six Pulse Excalibur.

419
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,799
When Old Master Murong and my young master were discussing martial arts,

420
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,660
I was serving tea next to them.

421
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,380
I overheard the conversation.

422
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,080
Old Master said that the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin

423
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,679
were good on their own,

424
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,860
but the best technique came from Yijin Jing.

425
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,500
If you can get it,

426
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,279
whatever ordinary technique you have

427
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,879
can be turned into a powerful one.

428
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,759
Very insightful.

429
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Mr. Murong is a gifted martial artist.

430
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,000
Of course.

431
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,600
Old Master knows every martial art,

432
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,400
except for the Six Pulse Excalibur from Dali

433
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,300
and the Yijin Jing from Shaolin.

434
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:15,700
If he compares both of them together,

435
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,400
it probably means that only Yijin Jing

436
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,300
can fight against the Six Pulse Excalibur.

437
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,800
And so I was thinking

438
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,600
if someone steals the Yijin Jing from the Shaolin Temple

439
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,100
and spends a few years to learn it,

440
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:29,400
no matter Six Pulse or Seven Pulse Excalibur,

441
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,400
it will just be a piece of cake.

442
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,000
Naughty little kid.

443
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
That day, you...

444
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,300
I actually stole the text for my young master

445
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,800
After he reads it,

446
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,000
I will burn it in front of Old Master's tomb.

447
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,200
That way, one of his life goals will be accomplished.

448
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,200
However, I want to give it to you today.

449
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,300
I can't take it.

450
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,500
You took a huge risk and stole it from the Shaolin Temple.

451
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,300
It's for your Young Master Murong. I can't accept it.

452
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,000
Brother Xiao, I decided to steal it myself.

453
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,600
It wasn't an order from my young master.

454
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,300
Therefore, I can give it to whoever I want.

455
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,000
Why is it all in Sanskrit?

456
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,100
I didn't have the time to check its content when I was stealing it.

457
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,200
No wonder those monks

458
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,400
weren't all that worried when an important text was stolen.

459
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't think too much about it.

460
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
What's mine will be mine.

461
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,400
Brother Xiao, you should keep this text.

462
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
I will be by your side anyway.

463
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,600
Perhaps one day, we'll be able to decipher it.

464
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
Help!

465
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,000
Bad guy...

466
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,600
Help!

467
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,400
I'll slice you to death!

468
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,400
Don't you hurt my master. Inform the master.

469
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,800
Why is this person so crazy?

470
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
They are here now.

471
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,300
It seems like he was hit by a technique.

472
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,200
He's hallucinating.

473
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Die!

474
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,300
Hurry up.

475
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,200
Just leave me here.

476
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Hurry up and inform the master.

477
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,400
He's wasting his stamina like this.

478
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,400
- He must have sustained heavy internal injuries.
- Run!

479
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Inform Master.

480
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,000
He's trying to protect his master.

481
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,100
He is a loyal and good man.

482
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,200
My friend, fancy some wine?

483
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,200
Bad guy... Bad guy...

484
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,000
- Brother Xiao.
- Where's the bad guy?

485
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
- Bad guy...
- My friend.

486
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,400
Have some wine and calm your nerves.

487
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,000
What happened?

488
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,200
Stop gawking.

489
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,400
Let's go.

490
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,000
Are you friends or foes?

491
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm a friend.

492
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
So is Brother Xiao here.

493
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,300
And you...

494
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,000
You must be a kind man, too.

495
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,800
The three of us are good friends.

496
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
We are here to fight the bad guy.

497
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,300
Bad guy...

498
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,500
The bad guy is here.

499
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,000
My friend, I'm Xiao Feng, a Khitan.

500
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,300
The bad guy is not here yet.

501
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,800
Who is your master?

502
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,400
Where is he?

503
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,100
My master...

504
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,400
Where is he?

505
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,500
I can't tell you guys.

506
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,000
You have to tell us

507
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,100
so that we can inform him.

508
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,700
Or else, your master will be captured by the bad guy. That'll be catastrophic.

509
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,400
- Yes. Inform...
- We'll inform him.

510
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,600
But you need to tell us where your master is.

511
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,800
My master is in Mirror Lake,

512
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,800
by the Square Bamboo Forest.

513
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,800
Inform him now!

514
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,600
Mirror Lake?

515
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,500
That's quite far from here.

516
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,300
Where is it?

517
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,500
How far is it?

518
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,800
If you ask someone else,

519
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,200
they can't give you an answer.

520
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,500
But if you ask me, then you asked the right person.

521
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,200
I came from somewhere close to Mirror Lake.

522
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,700
How serendipitous!

523
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,400
Ouch. Ouch.

524
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,800
Speak.

525
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
Sure.

526
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,000
You are an impatient fellow.

527
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,200
Let me indulge you.

528
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,200
And that is Mirror Lake.

529
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,000
Why are you still here?

530
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,500
The bad guy is powerful!

531
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,600
My friend.

532
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Why not just tell us who your master is.

533
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Master? Who's my master?

534
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,800
I can't tell anyone.

535
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Forget it.

536
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,100
Stay here.

537
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,000
I'll fight you, bad guy!

538
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,100
My friend, you're tired.

539
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,800
Rest here.

540
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,600
We'll let your master know

541
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,000
that the bad guy is coming.

542
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,900
Rest now.

543
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,600
Brother Xiao, he can't even speak properly.

544
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,600
Let's not be fooled by him.

545
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,000
Even if our enemy sends him here to set us up,

546
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,800
I'd gladly welcome it too.

547
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm after him.

548
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,100
Also, even if Mirror Lake is a dangerous place,

549
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,400
I am not afraid.

550
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,300
Miss, do not proceed further.

551
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,500
Give my fishing rod back.

552
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,000
I just want to take a shortcut.

553
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,300
Why do you have to be a major nuisance?

554
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,400
I already said that everything within

555
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,500
a 5 km radius is my master's private property.

556
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:24,400
You cannot just come and go as you wish.

557
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,600
But I'm not an ordinary person.

558
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
What are you doing?

559
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,900
You won't let me pass

560
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,200
so I won't let you fish.

561
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,300
Why fish when you can spear?

562
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,600
You're being unreasonable now.

563
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,200
What do you want to do?

564
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,400
Excuse me, mister, I merely helped you fish

565
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
but you refused my kindness.

566
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
Whatever.

567
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'll throw it away.

568
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,000
You're young but you're behaving like a devil.

569
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,800
If you want to fish, so be it.

570
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
You caught a fish but you refused to eat it.

571
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,400
That's killing for the sake of killing.

572
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,500
What are you here for?

573
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,600
I like to kill.

574
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,700
What can you do about it?

575
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,000
You...

576
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,000
Who's there? Quick.

577
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,900
Witch!

578
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Let me go.

579
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,300
Let me go, witch!

580
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,600
Let me go.

581
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,500
- How fun.
- Let go of me, witch!

582
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,000
Why should I let you go?

583
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,100
I finally caught you with the net, idiot.

584
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:32,400
Once I'm out, I'll teach you a lesson.

585
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Watch your foul mouth

586
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,100
or I'll shove that fish into your throat.

587
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,800
- You dare to.
- Why wouldn't I?

588
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,000
- Hit me again, I dare you.
- I'll hit you then. So what?

589
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,000
What kind of people would give birth to a witch like you?

590
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,400
What kind of people...?

591
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,600
- Let me go.
- Let's go.

592
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
There's a couple there.

593
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,200
Let me ask them for you.

594
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
Stay right here!

595
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,900
A'Xing, are you out there?

596
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,700
A'Xing?

597
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,800
Dad. Mom. Wait.

598
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,600
Dad. Mom.

599
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,700
Witch!

600
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,000
Which spell did you use?

601
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,800
Release me at once!

602
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
You dare to speak badly of me!

603
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,000
I'll ask my parents to spank you.

604
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,400
Brother Chu,

605
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,900
what happened?

606
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,300
What's going on?

607
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,800
This young lady used some sort of spell to trap me.

608
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,100
Only I can untie the fish net.

609
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,400
Just say "I admit defeat, Miss" thrice and I'll release you.

610
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
Witch!

611
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
If you piss off my friend here,

612
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,200
dire consequences will befall you.

613
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,700
Really?

614
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,200
I love dire consequences.

615
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,700
The worse the consequences are, the better.

616
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What technique are you using?

617
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Let me go!

618
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,400
Just say "I admit defeat, Mister" thrice

619
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,500
and free my friend from the net,

620
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,200
then I'll release you.

621
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You shamelessly copied me!

622
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,500
You...

623
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
Fine.

624
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
I admit defeat, Mister. I admit defeat, Mister.

625
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,500
I admit defeat, Mister. Done?

626
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,700
Untie the net now.

627
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,200
The poison on the needles is a potent one.

628
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,600
Once it's in my blood, my breath will be gone.

629
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,400
This is only our first encounter.

630
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,000
Why would you do this to me?

631
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,800
You sure need some discipline.

632
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,100
Brother Xiao, should we save her?

633
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,700
This young lady needs to be taught a lesson.

634
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,200
Young lady?

635
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,500
This is bad.

636
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,200
A'Xing, come out, please. Someone's drowning.

637
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,000
Who's drowning?

638
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,500
If it's you, I'd come and save you.

639
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,100
If it's someone else, then I'll just watch the fun.

640
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,200
Save the person, please.

641
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,600
I need to know who fell into the water.

642
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,200
If it were a man, I'd save him.

643
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,800
If it's a woman, then don't bother.

644
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,400
It's just a 14 or 15-year-old girl.

645
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,000
Save her. You're overthinking.

646
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
[Ruan Xingzhu, Mirror Lake]
She's a teenager. So what?

647
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,200
Whether it's a 14, 15 years old teenager

648
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,800
or a 70, 80 years old grandma,

649
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,000
you'll say yes to them.

650
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,600
Okay, okay. You really are overthinking it.

651
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,800
Fine. If you're upset, then don't save her.

652
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,100
She wanted to kill me with her poisonous needles anyway.

653
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,200
She deserves to die. Don't save her.

654
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,800
Why don't we save her?

655
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,700
If you don't want me to save her, I'll save her.

656
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,400
How is she?

657
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,600
No heartbeat.

658
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Brother Chu, hang in there.

659
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,600
I'm fine.

660
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,200
May I know your name?

661
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,900
And why did you come here?

662
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,300
I'm Xiao Feng.

663
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,800
A friend of mine asked me to come here to deliver a message.

664
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,700
May I know who your friend is? And what message?

665
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,000
My friend there wields an axe

666
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,300
and keeps yelling that the bad guy is here.

667
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,500
Brother Xiao, he is a good friend of mine.

668
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,600
Where is he? Is he injured?

669
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,800
Do tell me so that I'll come to his aid.

670
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,200
He is injured but he's still alive for now.

671
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,400
He's in the small town over there.
