[Episode 35]

14
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:37,420
We were lucky just now. You wanted to protect me so badly

15
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,620
that you managed to use Six Pulse Excalibur.

16
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,640
You might not be able to save Cousin like you did with me.

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,839
- But...
- Don't worry, Miss Wang.

18
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,460
I'll treat your cousin like how I treat you.

19
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,560
No, that'd be too risky.

20
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,419
Miss Wang, if you told me to put myself in danger, I would do it in a heartbeat.

21
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,200
But I'm immobilized now.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,620
If you leave, no one can take care of me.

23
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,920
What if a bad guy comes?

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,440
What should we do...?

25
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,560
Kill him. Hurry up!

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,260
Mr. Duan, can you carry me again?

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,920
Let's rescue my cousin.

28
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,099
You're right. Foolish me. Why didn't I think of that?

29
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:31,780
Let's go.

30
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,440
Come.

31
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,980
Cousin! Use the Golden Lamp technique and the Wind Cloak technique.

32
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,880
Cousin?

33
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,420
Let's rescue your cousin.

34
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,100
Young Master Murong, Island Owners, Cave Masters!

35
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,440
We never crossed each other.

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,100
[Taoist Bu Ping, the Serpent Dragon]
Why the drawn blades?

37
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,020
Can we have a truce for my sake?

38
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,400
We can then figure out who's right and who's wrong.

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,940
Having a mediator will only do us good.

40
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,460
May I know your name?

41
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,160
He is Taoist Bu Ping, the Serpent Dragon.

42
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,240
As gentle as the breeze. Impressive qinggong.

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,920
Everyone, the feud we have here is but a misunderstanding.

44
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,739
Should we shake hands and call it off?

45
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,380
Since Taoist Pu Bing has said it,

46
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,460
should we?

47
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,559
Elder Wu. Island Owners. Cave Masters. The gathering you have here

48
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:49,060
must be related to Tianshan.

49
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,259
What are you on about, Taoist Bu Ping?

50
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,699
My brothers and I merely wanted a little get-together here.

51
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,100
However, for some reason, Young Master Murong chased after us and showed aggression.

52
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,799
I am a passer-by.

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,759
I didn't know it was a gathering among strong fighters.

54
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,900
Pardon my intrusion.

55
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,940
Thanks to the intervention of Taoist Bu Ping,

56
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,420
I was able to stop before it evolved into something much worse.

57
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,460
Many thanks. I shall take my leave now. Farewell.

58
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,180
Stop!

59
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,220
Young Master Murong,

60
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,100
all 36 Cave Masters and 72 Island Owners

61
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:36,460
have been the subjects of Tonglao's cruelty for several decades.

62
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,200
We lived like animals.

63
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,160
This time, we swear with our life to eliminate this tyrant.

64
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,060
We kindly request your aid, Young Master.

65
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,900
Free us from our torture.

66
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,100
Your kindness will never be forgotten.

67
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,160
Strong fighters are everywhere here.

68
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,639
Why do you need me?

69
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
Young Master.

70
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,579
Talents abound within these 36 Cave Masters and 72 Island Owners.

71
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,620
Should anything happen in the future, we will need as much help as we can get.

72
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,239
If you grant them this favor today,

73
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,719
we will have a strong reason to request their aid in the future.

74
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,199
However, as the saying goes,

75
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,719
fighting injustice is the duty of all martial artists.

76
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:27,639
I believe all of you are more than enough to eliminate the evil.

77
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,239
But since fate wills us to be friends,

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,220
we shall share good and bad together. I, Murong Fu,

79
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,900
will gladly join your cause.

80
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,580
Congratulations!

81
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,340
With Young Master Murong by our side,

82
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,780
our cause will be even more likely to succeed.

83
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,140
Elder Wu. Island Owners. Cave Masters.

84
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,000
I have heard, but not met, most of you.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,760
Now that we are a family, we have a common goal.

86
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,280
Should you introduce everyone to everyone?

87
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,200
Of course. Of course.

88
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,380
I'm Xuan Huangzi of the Wyvern Cave in West Tibet.

89
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,380
Zhang Dafu, Winter Island Owner of the North Sea.

90
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,940
Owner Song, Phantom Island Owner in Jiangxia.

91
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,620
Owner Qin, Seahorse Island Owner.

92

Owner Hong, White Water Cave Master.

93
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,140
Owner Huo, Amethyst Cave Master.

94
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,300
Elder Wu, you're the leader.

95
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,079
Can you tell everyone what's so fearsome about Tianshan Tonglao?

96
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,260
We have nothing to be embarrassed about.

97
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,300
Among the island owners and cave masters,

98
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,580
some are recluses, some rule the sea.

99
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,740
We look unbridled but we are all puppets for Tianshan Tonglao.

100
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,439
Once or twice per year,

101
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,040
she'll send someone to admonish us with harsh words.

102
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,979
You might think that we'd be upset, humiliated.

103
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,080
But no.

104
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,920
The harsher the words are

105
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,500
the happier we will be. Isn't that right?

106
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,060
Yes.

107
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,919
How odd. Do such subservient beings exist in this world?

108
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,720
Brother Bao, you know nothing.

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,740
If Tonglao sends someone to scold us,

110
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,680
it means it'll be a peaceful year.

111
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,420
We will then have a feast as the celebration.

112
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,180
But if Tonglao doesn't send someone over to scold, she'll send someone to beat us.

113
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,980
If you are lucky, your legs might still be intact.

114
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,380
And that, we will celebrate it with a feast, too.

115
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,100
The atrocity!

116
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,639
Is this Tianshan Tonglao a human, a demon, or a deity?

117
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,459
Such despotism is not right!

118
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,420
I agree, Young Master Duan.

119
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,140
Island Owner Sima.

120
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,860
Show everyone your whip scar.

121
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,020
That's nothing.

122
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,860
Look at my Spine Bolt.

123
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,539
- I...
- This is...

124
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:16,660
How could it be?

125
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,480
That's disturbing.

126
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,319
How can someone be this inhumane?

127
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,200
Elder Wu.

128
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,119
I, Duan Yu, wish to help you to rid this great pest from the martial arts world.

129
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,059
Thanks, Young Master Duan, for your help.

130
00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:45,919
Every one of my brothers has been mistreated by Tianshan Tonglao.

131
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,380
Even in Avici, you will not go through such pain.

132
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,839
Back then, we were afraid of more torture

133
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,080
so we took it silently.

134
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,180
But God has mercy.

135
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,060
She rules like a tyrant

136
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,600
but sometimes, she gets unlucky too.

137
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,959
Are all of you scared of her because of her martial prowess?

138
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,180
She is powerful

139
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,960
but no one knows how powerful she is.

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,400
- How mysterious.
- It's mysterious.

141
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,910
Then you said, sometimes, she gets unlucky.

142
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,660
What do you mean?

143
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,040
It's the reason why we gathered here.

144
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,479
On the 3rd of March, Sky Wind Cave Master An,

145
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,260
Island Owner Qin and others including me, the nine of us were supposed to provide offerings.

146
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,699
We bought jewelry, silk, wool, exotic game meat,

147
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:38,640
rouges, powders to be sent to Piaomiao Peak.

148
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,380
So you mean,

149
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,460
that none of you

150
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,700
know what Tianshan Tonglao looks like?

151
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,660
One person did once.

152
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,540
When he was on the Piaomiao Peak,

153
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,820
he removed his blindfold secretly

154
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,200
and took a peek at that witch.

155
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,060
His eyes were then stabbed,

156
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,620
his tongue severed, and his arms chopped off.

157
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,500
I suppose she doesn't want anyone to know what she looks like.

158
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,899
Of course, we remain obedient.

159
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,980
When I wore the blindfold for the first time, I couldn't get used to it.

160
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,800
Now, it's like part of me.

161
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,860
Someone's there.

162
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,460
They are dead.

163
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,580
I...

164
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,780
Isn't he a strong fighter from the First Class Hall of Xixia,

165
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,100
- Taoist Jiu Yi?
- So, Taoist Jiu Yi

166
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,300
was killed by Tianshan Tonglao?

167
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,260
But rumor has it

168
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,240
that the Murong clan was the killer.

169
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,679
The two stab wounds on Taoist Jiu Yi

170
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,640
weren't caused by his signature weapon, Thunder Tonfas.

171
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,199
And so, the rumor of the Murong clan killing him

172
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,279
was baseless and nonsensical.

173
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,300
Two stab wounds on Taoist Jiu Yi?

174
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,620
- Then, it's not Tianshan Tonglao's doing either.
- I thought so too.

175
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,420
However, Tonglao never likes to venture too far.

176
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,580
She will kill anyone powerful in Piaomiao Peak

177
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,439
within a radius of 50km.

178
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,020
But when she kills, she only hits once.

179
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,600
Never more than one.

180
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,120
I saw the two stab wounds on Taoist Jiu Yi

181
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,620
and I grew suspicious.

182
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,980
Something's off about this.

183
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,440
Unless... Tonglao didn't kill Taoist Jiu Yi?

184
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,820
First, she asked us to scour rare herbs.

185
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,500
Now, she changed her method of killing.

186
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,100
Perhaps...

187
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,300
Perhaps Madam Tonglao is sick.

188
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,380
When we learned of this news, we couldn't be happier.

189
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,120
However, we also fear that she is faking her illness to test us.

190
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,500
Therefore, we discussed a bit

191
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,200
and we went to Piaomiao Peak again after two days.

192
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,159
And then, I heard clearly

193
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,799
that the witch had fallen ill.

194
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,060
It's true!

195
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,060
It's a shame that the location of

196
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,700
the Mortality Talisman still eludes us.

197
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,160
Cave Master Wu, what is the Mortality Talisman?

198
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,340
It's complicated. I can't explain in a few words.

199
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,300
Just know that as long as she has the Mortality Talisman,

200
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,800
she can kill us whenever.

201
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,660
My brothers! That witch has fallen sick.

202
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,099
If we want to be free, we can only fight back with our lives.

203
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:45,119
- Yes!
- Good!

204
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,740
That said, no one knows

205
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,920
if she has returned to the Lingjiu Palace on Piaomiao Peak.

206
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,979
We need to plan our next move.

207
00:13:55,979 --> 00:13:58,340
Taoist Bu Ping,

208
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,120
Young Master Murong, Miss Wang, and Young Master Duan.

209
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,859
If you have any ideas, do not hesitate.

210
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,739
You said that Tianshan Tonglao was a tyrant and a bully.

211
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,980
However, she is sick at the moment.

212
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,060
Taking advantage of someone weak is not something a gentleman would do.

213
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,140
You're a real gentleman, Young Master Duan.

214
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,580
I admire your decision not to take advantage of someone.

215
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,080
It's useless to talk about the gentleman code at the moment.

216
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,220
She is sick. If we don't take advantage of this, stage an uprising,

217
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,580
and force her to tell us how to dispel the Mortality Talisman,

218
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,640
your torture will never end.

219
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,300
I agree, Young Master Murong.

220
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,959
We are of the same opinion.

221
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,219
Elder Wu, in order to invade the Piaomiao Peak, you first need to know your enemy.

222
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,580
Cave Master An and you have gone up before

223
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,880
and had a look. Although Tonglao is not home,

224
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,739
but we still don't know how many fighters there are in the palace.

225
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,580
Why don't you tell us what you know

226
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,340
so that we can find a solution together?

227
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,180
I am ashamed of myself.

228
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,420
The servants of Lingjiu Palace

229
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,420
are all mentored by Tonglao. They are powerful.

230
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,860
When we were scouting, we tried our best to hide

231
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,980
so that no one could see us.

232
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,320
However, a little girl managed

233
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,939
to find me in the back garden.

234
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,399
I captured this girl from Piaomiao Peak.

235
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,020
To avoid alerting them after we captured her,

236
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,360
we retreated straight away and interrogated her.

237
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,580
Unfortunately, she's mute.

238
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,719
If vengeance is what you want, then seek Tianshan Tonglao.

239
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:41,219
Capturing a little girl serves nothing.

240
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,640
It is useful.

241
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,620
Brothers!

242
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,479
Let's uproot the Piaomiao Peak together.

243
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,860
We will share all joy and sorrow together.

244
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,880
We will swear absolute loyalty to each other. Do any of you wish to quit?

245
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,520
Anyone?

246
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,320
Good then.

247
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,700
If everyone is okay with it,

248
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,460
then unsheathe your blade

249
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,260
and slice this girl once.

250
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,860
This girl might not know any martial arts

251
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,700
but she's from Piaomiao Peak.

252
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,739
Let our blade taste her blood to show

253
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,959
that Piaomiao Peak is our sworn enemy.

254
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,219
No! No!

255
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:29,479
Tianshan Tonglao is your target.

256
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,759
Killing an innocent girl under her is...

257
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,199
Young Master Murong is here. He will definitely call a halt to your barbarism.

258
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,020
Brother Duan, her life has nothing to do with us.

259
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,000
We're outsiders. Let's not meddle.

260
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,379
Fighting injustice is the duty of all martial artists.

261
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,760
I cannot just stand here and do nothing.

262
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,240
Okay then.

263
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,080
Since everyone agrees to it,

264
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,200
I shall be the first.

265
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,220
Oh no!

266
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,400
Master Xu Zhu!

267
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,940
Shaolin Temple is the Martial Titan of the Central Plains.

268
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,820
I see this title still holds true.

269
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,220
No need to panic. There's only one way out.

270
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,060
We just have to wait at the foot and prevent him from escaping.

271
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,500
Guard the north, south, east, west paths

272
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,599
and have ten runners for coordination.

273
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,460
He will be ours.

274
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,759
Let's go!

275
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Go.

276
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,420
Where should I go?

277
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,620
Coward.

278
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,079
All you think of is running.

279
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,339
If I were you, I'd die from embarrassment.

280
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,320
No one's here.

281
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,820
Was it a hallucination?

282
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,759
You're a man but look how scared you are.

283
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,400
Imbecile.

284
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,380
I called you dumb

285
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,240
but who knew you were actually one.

286
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,960
Oh no. Oh no.

287
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,520
Seems like we have a powerful foe here.

288
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:54,180
Little girl, it seems like this is the end for us.

289
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,220
If you're afraid, then don't play the hero.

290
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,359
I saw a bunch of men trying to harm this little girl.

291
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:04,460
I had to intervene!

292
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,699
Even though I'm weak, but...

293
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:11,299
but this isn't vain heroism.

294
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:15,359
If you bite more than you can chew, you'll suffer.

295
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,259
Yes. You're right.

296
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,159
But I'm outnumbered.

297
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,239
I can't defeat all of them

298
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,899
so I...I...

299
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:26,420
I...

300
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,200
ran away.

301
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
This peak is a dead end.

302
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,140
They are guarding the base of the mountain.

303
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,620
How can you flee?

304
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,220
I...

305
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,500
I don't know yet.

306
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,080
Have mercy, madam.

307
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,540
Enlighten me.

308
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,859
In that case, put me down.

309
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,080
Madam, where are you?

310
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,699
How can I put you down?

311
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:14,619
Stupid monk, put me down at once!

312
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,380
I'm in the bag you're carrying.

313
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,120
Oh, little girl. It's you.

314
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,339
Why do you have a weird voice?

315
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:35,959
Greet your elderly properly.

316
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,060
Show some manners.

317
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,439
Little girl, you...

318
00:21:40,439 --> 00:21:41,839
Stop calling me little girl.

319
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,780
I'm your grandmother!

320
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,140
Little girl, you must be in shock.

321
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,280
Little girl, you can't hit someone like this.

322
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,819
You're young so you ought to behave!

323
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,500
You...

324
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,160
Whatever.

325
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,580
Look.

326
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,740
We're in a pinch now.

327
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,279
You should go back into the bag and we'll leave this place together.

328
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,239
They will be here soon.

329
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,060
Where did you steal that Seven Gems Ring?

330
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,760
Steal?

331
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,940
Little girl!

332
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,860
You can't accuse me of thievery!

333
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,580
I'm a monk.

334
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,619
I am disciplined. I would never steal something!

335
00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:37,599
I...

336
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,359
Someone gave it to me.

337
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,820
I didn't steal it.

338
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,300
Nonsense!

339
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,100
You're a Shaolin disciple.

340
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,340
Why would someone give you the Seven Gems Ring?

341
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,399
If you do not confess, I will cut and skin you.

342
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,960
You will experience all sorts of pain.

343
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,040
Little girl.

344
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,200
You hit me again.

345
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Your dharma name is Xu Zhu?

346
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,900
Ling. Xuan. Hui. Xu.

347
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,300
You're the 37th generation of the Shaolin Sect.

348
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:18,100
Xuan Ci. Xuan Bei. Xuan Ku. Xuan Nan.

349
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,400
Those monks are your masters?

350
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,900
I'm asking you a question.

351
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,400
Answer yes or no.

352
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,500
Why won't you answer me?

353
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,200
You're correct.

354
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,800
But you called the abbot a monk.

355
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,400
It's impolite.

356
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
Why can't I call him a monk?

357
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,400
His Master, Reverend Ling Men, and I are of equal status.

358
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,100
So why can't I call the abbot a monk?

359
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,700
Reverend Ling Men is a renowned monk among

360
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,000
the 34th generation of Shaolin.

361
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,400
If you and he are of equal status,

362
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,000
then you are...

363
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,800
You were so respectful just now

364
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,000
by calling me madam.

365
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And now, the madam is gone.

366
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
If you hadn't rescued me just now,

367
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,200
I would have killed you with one palm.

368
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
Pardon my insolence.

369
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,600
If Madam wishes to be addressed so,

370
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,000
I shall comply.

371
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Finally. Have a seat.

372
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
Yes.

373
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,800
I have a question.

374
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Where did you get the Seven Gems Ring?

375
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,900
An old man gave it to me.

376
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,600
I didn't want to accept it but he was dying. I had no other choice.

377
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
What do you mean he was dying?

378
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,700
Is he dead?

379
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:00,000
Tell me what he looks like first.

380
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,100
That old man had a meter-long goatee.

381
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,000
His face was like polished jade.

382
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,200
He's definitely a handsome man.

383
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,400
Why was he dying then?

384
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,600
Stupid monk, Wu Yazi is a talented martial artist.

385
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,100
Unless he dismissed his own martial energy, he won't perish.

386
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,200
It's not easy to pass away.

387
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,000
Madam, what do you mean by dismissing his own martial energy?

388
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,400
Isn't it easy for someone to die?

389
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,100
How hard can it be?

390
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Where did you find Wu Yazi?

391
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,200
You mean that old man,

392
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
the Master of Intelligent Gentleman, Su Xinghe?

393
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,900
Of course.

394
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,000
You don't even know his name

395
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,600
and you dare to lie to me, saying that he gave you the ring?

396
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,100
Shame on you!

397
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,900
Madam, I was at the mountain peak.

398
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,200
I accidentally solved the Zhenlong Go Formation

399
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,100
and he appeared in front of me.

400
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
Nonsense!

401
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,900
That Go formation left countless wise men stunned for several decades.

402
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,400
How could a simpleton like you solve it?

403
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,100
If you lie to me again, I will show you a rough time.

404
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,000
I know very well that I can't solve it.

405
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,300
But there was an urgent matter.

406
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,400
Someone was stuck in the Go formation

407
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,300
and I wanted to save that person.

408
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,800
I moved a few pieces and somehow,

409
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:34,300
one random piece that I placed unlocked the formation.

410
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,000
And then, another wise man gave me a few tips

411
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
and I managed to solve it.

412
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,400
Who knew that my reckless behavior

413
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
could cause all these sins.

414
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,700
I repent.

415
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
Amitabha.

416
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,200
Your explanation makes sense now.

417
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Here. Chase after him!

418
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,800
They are here.

419
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,000
Madam, come.

420
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,800
If you run like this, they will find you eventually.

421
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Fly on top of the trees to escape.

422
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,300
Little monk.

423
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,800
I can see that you have a strong internal force.

424
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
It's worth a try.

425
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,100
Okay, I'll try.

426
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,500
Little girl.

427
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,600
Are you okay?

428
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm weak and dumb.

429
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,800
I can't do it. I can't fly.

430
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,800
You'd rather hurt yourself than fall on top of me.

431
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,400
That is courtesy done right.

432
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,300
To commend your effort and also to make sure you're useful to me,

433
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,800
I will teach you how to fly.

434
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,400
Listen carefully.

435
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
As you leap, bend your knees slightly.

436
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,600
Gather qi around your Dantian.

437
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,800
As you feel the qi rise, relax your body.

438
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,500
Focus on the Yuzhen acupoint.

439
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,000
When you're swerving mid-air, you need to hold your qi.

440
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Do not relax completely.

441
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,700
Now, try using my trick again.

442
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,200
Should I try alone first?

443
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,900
I don't want to fall and hurt you again.

444
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,100
I taught you myself. I never make any mistakes.

445
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,800
Try alone?

446
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
If you fall again, I'll kill you.

447
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,500
Okay.

448
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,000
Quick!

449
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,400
All right. Come down now.

450
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Thank you for your mentorship, Madam.

451
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,300
Useless monk.

452
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,500
It's just a simple trick

453
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,800
and you're all over the moon already.

454
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,500
Indeed, Madam.

455
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200
I do not know a lot of things

456
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,400
but what you taught me is very useful.

457
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,600
You mastered it in one go.

458
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,800
I didn't invest in the wrong person, it seems.

459
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Your internal force does not conform to the Shaolin Sect's style.

460
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Who did you learn martial arts from?

461
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,200
How did you amass such an impressive internal force when you're this young?

462
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,000
Madam, before Mr. Wu Yazi passed away,

463
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,800
he forced the power he honed on

464
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,800
for more than seven decades into my body.

465
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,900
In this case,

466
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,400
Wu Yazi passed down the leader position of the Carefree Sect to you.

467
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,000
You've heard of the Carefree Sect, Madam?

468
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Why wouldn't I?

469
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I've heard of it

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
before Wu Yazi even knew it existed.

471
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,800
That Zhenlong Go formation...

472
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,700
Where should the first piece go?

473
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,500
Tell me.

474
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Okay.

475
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,000
Fate.

476
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
Who would have thought that you need

477
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,800
to sacrifice your pawn before killing the enemy in chess.

478
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,600
Also, Wu Yazi was your master.

479
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Why didn't you call him so?

480
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,500
Instead, you called him "mister."

481
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,400
Because I'm still a Shaolin disciple.

482
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,100
I cannot join another sect.

483
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,600
So, you will never lead the Carefree Sect?

484
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,900
Never.

485
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,500
Okay then.

486
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Give me that Seven Gems Ring.

487
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll be the leader of Carefree Sect.

488
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,800
What do you think?

489
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,600
I'd very much love to.

490
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,400
You said Wu Yazi gave you a drawing

491
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,400
and asked you to look for someone in the Wuliang Mountain of Dali

492
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
to learn the Divine Art of the Northern Darkness.

493
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,200
Yes.

494
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,600
Where is the drawing?

495
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,100
Here.

496
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,400
He...

497
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,400
He wanted you to learn from that hag?

498
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,900
He still couldn't forget that hag until his last breath.

499
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,200
How dare he drew her so beautifully!

500
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,000
What? It pains you?

501
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,800
Of course. It's a good drawing.

502
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,100
Sullying it would be a shame.

503
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,900
Did that scoundrel Wu Yazi

504
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,400
tell you who this hag is?

505
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,800
Madam, you are friends with Mr. Wu Yazi.

506
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Why do you call him a scoundrel now?

507
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,300
He was delusional.

508
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,300
There's no way this hag would have retained her beauty

509
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,200
after several decades.

510
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,600
And back then, she wasn't this pretty either.

511
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,200
Give it to me.

512
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,900
No. Mr. Wu Yazi passed it down to me.

513
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,300
I have to protect it.

514
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,400
I can't let you throw it around like this.

515
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,000
Heartless scoundrel.

516
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Shameless hag.

517
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,500
Are you hungry?

518
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Yes.

519
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,500
But I don't think there's any vegetarian food around.

520
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,500
What do you mean?

521
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,800
This mountain has a lot of bamboo partridges.

522
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,600
It has spotted deer and antelope, too.

523
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll teach you how to run quickly

524
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,200
and how to capture wild beasts.

525
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,000
You want me to kill, Madam?

526
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,900
No way. I'm a monk.

527
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,100
I have to follow my religious rules.

528
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,500
You won't kill animals but you can kill a human.

529
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
Isn't that a greater sin?

530
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,200
I...

531
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,500
When did I say I want to kill?

532
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,000
I... Repent! Repent!

533
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,500
Amitabha.

534
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,600
When it reaches noon

535
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,500
and I'm not fed fresh blood,

536
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,500
I will die.

537
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,000
Madam,

538
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,200
why will you die if you don't drink blood?

539
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,300
I have this weird illness.

540
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,200
If I do not drink blood every noon,

541
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,800
the qi in me will start heating up.

542
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,700
I will burn myself from inside out.

543
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,800
Before I die, I will go berserk.

544
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,000
You will be in great danger.

545
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,100
No way. I can't.

546
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,800
I'm a monk.

547
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,400
I need to observe religious rules. I cannot kill.

548
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,200
If you're not willing to hunt for me,

549
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,500
then follow Gautama Buddha's footsteps

550
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,400
and feed me your own blood.

551
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Or else, don't call yourself a Buddhist monk.

552
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,100
One arm is enough to last me a day.

553
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,800
- They are there.
- Hurry up!

554
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
Madam, they are here.

555
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,500
I... Let me carry you.

556
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,200
Those five persons behind us.

557
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,600
The first one is Taoist Bu Ping.

558
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
The second one is Elder Wu.

559
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,300
The other three are ordinary fighters.

560
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,910
Stop.

561
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
What's the matter, Madam?

562
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,800
I'll teach you a few techniques.

563
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,000
Kill that Taoist Bu Ping first.

564
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,500
I...

565
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,300
Just knock him out so that he can't harm us.

566
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,400
That's not killing. You won't break any rules.

567
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
Okay.

568
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,200
But, Madam, I can't win.

569
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Dummy.

570
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,200
Wu Yazi is the Master of Su Xinghe and Ding Chunqiu.

571
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,400
He passed down the power he honed on for more than seven decades to you.

572
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,200
People like Taoist Bu Ping or Elder Wu do not hold a candle to you.

573
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,900
You're just dumb. You don't know how to utilize your potential.

574
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,700
Come closer.

575
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,200
Now, use it.

576
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,900
Dummy.

577
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:17,400
Wu Yazi picked you as his successor.

578
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Was he blind?

579
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,200
God knows what was in his mind.

580
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,700
Little monk, you sure are quick on your feet.

581
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,900
Do as I instructed. Follow the steps and make no mistake.

582
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,400
Little monk!

583
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,000
Madam, he holds a blade!

584
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,600
How should I fight someone armed, Madam?

585
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
You didn't teach me that.

586
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,200
Stupid monk, I dare you to come down.

587
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Come down!

588
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,800
Imbecile.

589
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,000
- I taught you the technique and you failed to use it twice.
- Sorry.

590
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
They are here. After them!

591
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,600
They are here again.

592
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,900
Carry me to the top of the tree.

593
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
Madam, what should we do?

594
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Send the qi in your Dantian to the Jugu acupoint located on your shoulder.

595
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,700
Then, to the Tianjin acupoint on your elbow.

596
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,600
Then, Yangchi acupoint on your wrist.

597
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,700
Circulate the qi between Yanghuo, Yanggu,

598
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,900
and Yangchi acupoints thrice.

599
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,000
Charge!

600
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,600
Madam! I did it. I did it!

601
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,700
Let's go down now.

602
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,600
Amitabha.

603
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,100
What did you do? What did you do?

604
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,000
They are all dead!

605
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,700
You killed them and I drink their blood to treat my disease.

606
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,800
What's wrong with that?

607
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,000
What did you say?

608
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,500
I killed them?

609
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,300
They are more dead than dead.

610
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,300
It's the truth.

611
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,000
I...

612
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,400
I shot the pine cones into their brains.

613
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,600
But the pine cones are soft.

614
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,400
How could they possibly enter someone's brain?

615
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,100
Fake monk!

616
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,600
Stop your crocodile tears.

617
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,000
Who else killed them if not you?

618
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,900
It's me...

619
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
Amitabha.

- Oh my.
- There's something different.

646
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,020
Elder Wu, then can you see where I have changed?

647
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,000
You seem to have grown older.

648
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,200
Your eyes aren't bad.

649
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,200
Then can you tell I am Tianshan Tonglao?

650
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,700
Tianshan Tonglao?

651
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
You are... Tianshan Tonglao?

652
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,000
You are Tianshan Tonglao!
