14
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,220
I wonder where he is and if he is injured.

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,360
Tell me, please. I will go help him now.

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,879
He is injured.

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,879
But for now, his life is not in danger.

18
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,040
He is in the nearest town up this path.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,120
- Thank you.
- Come quickly!

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,260
Come look at this!

21
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,420
Coming.

22
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,580
Hurry up!

23
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,719
Brother Xiao, why don't you come inside and we'll talk more about the message?

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,820
Please.

25
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,580
Let's go.

26
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,540
How is she?

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,960
Look.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,460
Where did this come from?

29
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,980
I took it off her neck.

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,460
Back then, I made a mark on their left shoulders.

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,919
You...

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,020
Look at it yourself.

33
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,360
This is A'Zi.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,520
She is your daughter.

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,840
I can't believe you killed her with your own hands.

36
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,380
Not only did you not take care of her, but now you've killed her.

37
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,039
You are a cruel father. A heartless father!

38
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,320
What is it?

39
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,900
It grieves me to see

40
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,560
the tragic death of this young lady.

41
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,320
- Get this off of me! It is all right. Untie me.
- She's fine.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,380
She was using...

43
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,220
the Old Freak of Xingxiu's Tortoise Breathing Skill.

44
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,679
How do you know everything?

45
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,840
A'Zi, where did you learn these heterodox martial arts?

46
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,140
And how did you know that my name is A'Zi?

47
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,959
Didn't you hear what we just said?

48
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,079
When I pretend to be dead, my heart shuts down.

49
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,959
I can't hear anything, and I don't know anything that happens.

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,500
A'Zi.

51
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,940
A'Zi.

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,740
I am your mother.

53
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,940
He is your father.

54
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,660
We have been separated for over a decade.

55
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,479
Today, we can finally be reunited.

56
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,200
You... are my mother and father? Really?

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,620
You are kidding!

58
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,160
Have you been wearing this lock charm since you were a child?

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,620
How do you know that?

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,199
Then we are right. You are my daughter.

61
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,560
My little A'Zi.

62
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,360
Xiao Zi.

63
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:42,980
You really are my mother?

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,020
My father?

65
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,460
And you still threw me into the water?!

66
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,159
What kind of father would do that?

67
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,759
It was because you were naughty.

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,279
Go and let your Uncle Chu go.

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,440
We are facing powerful enemies. Stop messing around.

70
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,520
Let him go. Well, it's not that I can't.

71
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,150
- But I should get something in return, right?
- A'Zi...

72
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,310
A'Zi, be good.

73
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,599
I will give you something nice.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,599
Let go of Uncle Chu quickly.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,240
Something nice? Let me see it first, all right?

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,000
- I heard those silks loosen up when they are in water.
- Take it out, take it out.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,960
I will give it a try.

78
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,560
Hey, old man! It is none of your business!

79
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,100
You are meddling again.

80
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,360
You stop right there!

81
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,140
Thank you for your help.

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,960
This young lady is way too spoiled.

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,580
Witch.

84
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,980
Give it back to me.

85
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,480
Don't ever use anything like this again.

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,400
You...

87
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,141
Father!

88
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,660
He is bullying me.

89
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,900
Nonsense!

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,340
How could His Highness be the father of a witch like you?

91
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,820
Your Highness, that is not true at all, is it?

92
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,340
Your Highness!

93
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,079
Your Highness! Your Highness!

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Your Highness!

95
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,980
Your Highness!

96
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Good work, everyone.

97
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,540
Who is this man?

98
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,720
All these people are speaking respectfully to him.

99
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,140
A'Zhu?

100
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,860
What is the matter with you?

101
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,900
Your Highness,

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,799
I am afraid that the Evils will be here soon.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,480
Let's... get going now.

104
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,399
If we are destined to encounter him here, we can't avoid it even if we want to.

105
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,779
Your Highness, it is our duty to fight the enemy.

106
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:00,819
You must bear in mind the interest of the nation and return to Dali as soon as possible.

107
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,940
His Majesty is worried.

108
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,300
There is no escape for you!

109
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,860
Just give up!

110
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,440
I will spare your life for the sake of your son.

111
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,499
Every time I see you, you are with pretty ladies.

112
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,679
You are a lucky devil.

113
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,260
Second Madam, you are very pretty too.

114
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,740
Stop that! What is all this nonsense?

115
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,839
Old bastard, I think you've had enough of this good life!

116
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,660
You have a coward of a son who won't acknowledge me as his master!

117
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,519
What kind of father are you?

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,340
Come on! Let me cut you!

119
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,860
Little green man!

120
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,180
Come on!

121
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,280
- Brother!
- Wanli!

122
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,620
Wanli! Move! Let me do it.

123
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,520
Your Highness!

124
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,400
Absolutely not!

125
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,048
Wanli. Wanli.

126
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:07,100
Your Highness... I would rather die than give in.

127
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,499
I have been loyal all my life to the Duan family of Dali.

128
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,140
The Duan family of Dali?

129
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,339
Brothers, I...

130
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:18,340
will leave first.

131
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,059
- Brother!
- Brother Chu!

132
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,339
Brother Chu fought Duan Yanqing at the risk of his life.

133
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:27,620
I think he was prepared to die all along.

134
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,439
Wanli, I failed to raise my daughter properly and let her offend you.

135
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:35,060
I feel so ashamed.

136
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,980
This man is such a weakling.

137
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,799
He went up against them and got killed for nothing.

138
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,140
He is such a big fool.

139
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,199
You are the reason he is dead.

140
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,560
If you hadn't insulted him...

141
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,340
All right.

142
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,900
You have never raised me all these years.

143
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:02,019
You saw me for the first time today and slapped me because of a fool!

144
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,620
Mother. Mother!

145
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,359
Mother.

146
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,039
- It is all right.
- He hit me!

147
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,279
It's all right. Does it hurt?

148
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,580
Yes!

149
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,760
You are protecting him?

150
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,719
If you want to kill me, go ahead and take my life.

151
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:26,860
Stop!

152
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,259
You and I will fight alone, no one else will be involved.

153
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,020
Is that so?

154
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,479
That is right.

155
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,919
Do you not wish to kill me first and then go to Dali to kill my imperial brother?

156
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,240
My men and my family have nothing to do with this. This is between us.

157
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,820
Brother Chu,

158
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,820
I, Duan Zhengchun, will fight the enemy with you today.

159
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,400
Duan Zhengchun.

160
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,520
It is him.

161
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,919
The revenge of my parents, my adoptive parents,

162
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,240
my master,

163
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,300
and my injustice...

164
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,220
Your Highness!

165
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,879
Who are you?

166
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,300
Why interfere with us?

167
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,480
Boss, he is the former chief of the Beggars' Sect, Qiao Feng.

168
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,260
So it is him.

169
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:03,479
Chivalrous and brave. He is really worthy of his reputation.

170
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,399
I have never offended you in any way.

171
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,039
Why do you want to ruin my plan?

172
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,780
You cannot kill this man.

173
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,559
Help Duan into the house!

174
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,340
- Let's go.
- Your Highness.

175
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,440
Chief Qiao, I can't thank you enough.

176
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,540
Thank you, Chief Qiao.

177
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,920
No need.

178
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,300
I saved your Prince Duan out of my own self-interest.

179
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,660
Prince Duan, I will ask you this only once.

180
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,040
Please tell me the truth.

181
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,620
Have you ever done something wrong,

182
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,780
something that you are ashamed of,

183
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,960
that left a child orphaned, with a hard life?

184
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,060
Yes.

185
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,980
I have been haunted by this all my life,

186
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,159
and it makes me upset when I think about it.

187
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,000
However, it is a mistake that cannot be undone.

188
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,440
Heaven knows

189
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,059
and allowed me to see this child, who lost her parents, again.

190
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,540
I always feel sorry for her.

191
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,320
If you know that you have made a great mistake,

192
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,800
why do you continue to do such evil things until now?

193
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,299
I have done all sorts of absurd things in my life.

194
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,820
I feel ashamed whenever I think about them.

195
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,319
He has always been like this.

196
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,180
I don't really blame him.

197
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,239
I will meet you at midnight tonight at the Qingshi Bridge near the intersection.

198
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,960
I have something important to discuss.

199
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,119
I am deeply grateful for your help.

200
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
I will be there on time.

201
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,360
You do not need to bring your men.

202
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,400
I will do as you wish.

203
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,700
Have some warm soup.

204
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,780
I know you are worried about my safety.

205
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,020
But you saw what happened today.

206
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,459
Duan Zhengchun's skills are hardly enough to warrant concern.

207
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:26,660
Once I get my revenge tonight,

208
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:31,320
we will... leave Yanmen Pass to live a simple life

209
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,560
and never set foot in this place again.

210
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,300
I don't know how many people I have killed with these hands.

211
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,020
You don't like me killing people?

212
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,420
I just feel a little sick all of a sudden.

213
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,959
You must have caught a cold from the long journey.

214
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,880
Wait here.

215
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,500
Here.

216
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,680
Brother Xiao, hug me tightly.

217
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,159
I really don't want to part with you.

218
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,639
Can we leave Yanmen Pass right away?

219
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,720
We can go hunting and herd livestock.

220
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,940
Can we deal with Duan Zhengchun after a year?

221
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,220
Silly girl.

222
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,359
After tonight, we can leave Yanmen Pass without worries.

223
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:47,439
That Duan Zhengchun doesn't know how to use the Six Pulse Excalibur now.

224
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,519
However, things may be different a year later.

225
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,559
We must go to Dali if we want to take revenge.

226
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,320
If it is just me,

227
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,499
even if the Duan family of Dali was a tiger's den,

228
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:01,660
I would still go and get my revenge.

229
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,920
Life and death are not important to me.

230
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,439
However, I have you now.

231
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,660
I have to take care of you forever.

232
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,740
So it is not that I don't want to listen to you,

233
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,060
but things are really difficult.

234
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,640
I understand.

235
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,480
Brother Xiao,

236
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,939
I want to have a bowl of ginger soup.

237
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,760
I want to drink the ginger soup that you make.

238
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,979
All right. Wait here.

239
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,079
Madam.

240
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,519
Sir, you are very thoughtful and kind to your wife.

241
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:23,999
I am lucky to have met her.

242
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,599
She doesn't even mind that I've had a rough life.

243
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,999
This is nothing.

244
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,440
Your wife is blessed.

245
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,399
By the way, Madam, here are some taels.

246
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,739
Here.

247
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,399
How can I accept these?

248
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:43,399
It is what you deserve. Here.

249
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:44,799
I will take them then.

250
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,239
Thank you, Sir.

251
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,819
Oh, right. I have to meet someone tonight.

252
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,519
But my wife is not feeling well.

253
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,319
Could you look after her for me again?

254
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,599
Of course.

255
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,820
Don't worry.

256
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,660
Thank you.

257
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,320
Ginger soup is ready.

258
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,980
Brother Xiao.

259
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,920
I am an orphan.

260
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,439
I grew up without parents.

261
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,540
What did I do to deserve this?

262
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,260
I cherish every second

263
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,560
of every day that I spend with you.

264
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,980
Silly girl.

265
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,959
Aren't I an orphan, too?

266
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,680
Here, I am even a Khitan that everybody hates.

267
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,439
It should have been a time of pain,

268
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,000
anger, and despair,

269
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,060
but with you, I am not afraid of anything.

270
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,759
So what if I can't be the chief of the Beggars' Sect?

271
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,260
So what if I can never set foot in the martial arts world of the Central Plains again?

272
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,380
All this time, I've been thinking

273
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,299
about why my father jumped off a cliff over my mother's death.

274
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,920
But I have figured it out.

275
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,460
The world may be vast, but there are only a few

276
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,600
who love and care for you.

277
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,780
It is lucky to gain

278
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,560
and fate to lose.

279
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,579

00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:01,259

That was beautiful.

290
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,500
After we cross the border,

291
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,640
I will herd cattle and sheep,

292
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,439
and you will sing to me every day.

293
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,359

294
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,279

♫  My clothes may be dull and plain  ♫

00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:45,559

♫  I am afraid that all of this will fly away  ♫

304
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,559
In order to get my revenge,

305
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,839
I was so impatient that I arrived early.

306
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,239
I used to be alone and had no attachments.

307
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,260
But tonight I have A'Zhu in my heart.

308
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,340
The rain is coming.

309
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,240
It is almost midnight.

310
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,159
Chief Qiao, why have you asked to see me here?

311
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,919
Prince Duan,

312
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:32,719
don't you know why I asked you to come here today?

313
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,319
It is about what happened outside the Yanmen Pass, isn't it?

314
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,120
Back then, I was tricked into taking your mother's life.

315
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,480
And caused your father to kill himself.

316
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,559
That was a grave mistake I made.

317
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,239
Then why did you harm my adoptive father,

318
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,479
Qiao Sanhuai and his wife,

319
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,999
and my master, Reverend Xuan Ku?

320
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,639
I was just trying to cover it up.

321
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,140
But I got deeper and deeper into it.

322
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,720
Until I could no longer stop.

323
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,440
Fine.

324
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,460
Are you going to take your own life,

325
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,759
or do I have to do it?

326
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,240
If you had not helped me out today,

327
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,580
I would have died by the side of Mirror Lake.

328
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,180
I could live another half day

329
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,320
all thanks to you.

330
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,840
If you want to take my life,

331
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,799
just do it.

332
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,100
How can a son or a student

333
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,860
not avenge the death of his parents and master?

334
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,340
You killed my parents,

335
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
my adoptive parents,

336
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,920
and my master.

337
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,660
There are five of them.

338
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,320
I will strike you five times.

339
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,380
After five strikes,

340
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,319
our feud will be settled.

341
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,040
One strike for one life.

342
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,560
Isn't this punishment a little light?

343
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,340
I appreciate your kindness.

344
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,660
A'Zhu!

345
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,659
A'Zhu! A'Zhu!

346
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,519
How could this be?

347
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,999
How could it be you?

348
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,780
Brother Xiao.

349
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,199
I really want to be with you forever.

350
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,360
All right. All right.

351
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,460
We have found our enemy.

352
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,680
We can now take revenge.

353
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,840
I am truly... very happy.

354
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,540
But while you need to take your revenge,

355
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,040
I have debts to repay as well.

356
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,120
Debts?

357
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:37,759
A'Zhu, what are you talking about?

358
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,480
Look at this.

359
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,900
- This is...
- And on my shoulder.

360
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,200
[Duan]

361
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,039
Where did this come from?

362
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,599
I took it off her neck.

363
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,719
Back then, I made a mark on their left shoulders.

364
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,119
This is A'Zi.

365
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,119
She is your daughter.

366
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,160
A'Zi is your...

367
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:18,079
Our parents carved the word "Duan"

368
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,000
on our shoulders.

369
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,359
This lock charm... A'Zi's lock charm says,

370
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,180
"The bamboos by the lake are green in color.

371
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,860
May you be safe

372
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,899
and happy in life."

373
00:33:35,899 --> 00:33:38,340
My lock charm says,

374
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,279
"The stars twinkle in the sky.

375
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,920
Forever shining,

376
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,840
forever at peace."

377
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,900
I didn't know what it meant before,

378
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,639
but now I do.

379
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,360
On here,

380
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,359
On here, my mother's name is engraved on it.

381
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,000
My mother is Ruan Xingzhu.

382
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,100
My father is Duan Zhengchun.

383
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,200
She is my sister.

384
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:18,440
Duan Zhengchun is your father?

385
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,999
Yes.

386
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,720
Impossible.

387
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,859
Impossible.

388
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:25,599
He is my father.

389
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,920
I only just found out as well.

390
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,199
A'Zhu... A'Zhu...

391
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,638
We will talk more about this later.

392
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,179
I will heal you first.

393
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,759
I am afraid it's too late, Brother.

394
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,799
I asked you to make me ginger soup

395
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,299
so that I could pretend to be you to tell my father

396
00:35:00,299 --> 00:35:05,419
that the meeting at the Qingshi Bridge was off.

397
00:35:05,419 --> 00:35:07,779
Let bygones be bygones.

398
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:10,640
Why? Why would you do this?

399
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,799
Dali has Six Pulse Excalibur.

400
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,100
Do you think they will let you go

401
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,280
if you killed him?

402
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,599
And we don't understand what is written on this Yijin Jing.

403
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,919
Yes.

404
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,479
I should have listened to you and let go of my hatred.

405
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,639
A'Zhu, let's not take revenge anymore, all right?

406
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,159
No more revenge.

407
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,880
We'll just leave.

408
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,159
No more revenge.

409
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,279
Brother, you are so kind to me.

410
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,900
What are you going to do in the future

411
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,439
if you keep spoiling me like this?

412
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,119
I will spoil you even more.

413
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,719
Spoil you a hundred times more.

414
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,600
Spoil you a thousand times more.

415
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:04,220
Brother.

416
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,439
Promise me one thing.

417
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,299
Just name it. I will promise you anything.

418
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:13,700
I only have one younger sister, A'Zi.

419
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,300
We didn't grow up together.

420
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,159
I am afraid she will go astray.

421
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,379
- All right.
- I hope you can take care of her.

422
00:36:23,379 --> 00:36:25,239
When you have recovered,

423
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,759
we will take her with us and leave Yanmen Pass.

424
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,560
We will ride horses, hunt,

425
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,419
and herd cattle and sheep,

426
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:36,879
just like you sang to me today.

427
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,480
Take good care of her,

428
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,520
and let her take good care of you as well.

429
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,440
We will...

430
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,100
herd cattle,

431
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
herd sheep, together.

432
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,100
It will be a beautiful sight...

433
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,320
A'Zhu...

434
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,180
A'Zhu!

435
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,280
A'Zhu!

436
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,100
What should I write on A'Zhu's tombstone?

437
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,399
Tomb of Madam Duan of the Xiao family?

438
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,899
We were supposed to get married,

439
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:03,259
but she passed away before we wed, a pure and noble lady.

440
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,060
Is it appropriate to call her my wife?

441
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:30,120
[A'Zhu's grave]

442
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,999
Mr. Ma's last letter was sealed with wax.

443
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,159
And when Elder Xu opened it,

444
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,079
the wax seal was intact.

445
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,739
That means that no one else had read the contents before this.

446
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:55,639
Even two fists cannot win against four hands.

447
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,999
He is trying to divert the people's attention,

448
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,340
while waiting for aid to come.

449
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,760
Watch out!

450
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,919
The Hans and Khitans

451
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,279
could be both fake and real.

452
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,799
Gratitude and resentment

453
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,540
will all eventually turn into ashes.

454
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,239
Actually, what is the difference between a Han and a Khitan?

455
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,059
Why don't we just leave the Yanmen Pass,

456
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,559
go hunting and herd livestock,

457
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,639
and forget all feuds in the martial arts world?

458
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,999
Then come with me and never regret.

459
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,839
No matter how painful and difficult it will be,

460
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:34,640
I will not regret it.

461
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,559
I want to be with you

462
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,099
forever and ever, for all eternity,

463
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:41,939
through thick and thin,

464
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,620
through hardship, humiliation,

465
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,459
danger, and suffering.

466
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,399
You always asked me not to drink too much.

467
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,599
Who is going to tell me

468
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,279
that from now on?

469
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,479
This is the last time

470
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,199
you and I will drink together.

I feel bad

481
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,319
because you cared for me till your last breath,

482
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,220
and yet I could not tell what was on your mind.

Duan Zhengchun! Come out!

488
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,239
Eyes as starry as the stars. Body as slim as the bamboo.
