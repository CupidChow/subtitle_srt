[Episode 17]

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,360
Young Master Duan, did you use Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves?

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,059
Yes. If you want to see it, Miss Wang, I can show you again.

16
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:46,219
However, whether I can finish my demonstration

17
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,960
is entirely up to this mystical thing called luck.

Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ⚔️Martial Arts Team ⚔️@Viki.com

19
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,819
Careful, Young Master Duan! Dodge first. No need to demonstrate anymore.

20
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,159
But if I don't demonstrate now, when I die, you won't be able to see it anymore.

21
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,460
Grab that girl first!

22
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,580
Miss Wang... I killed them all.

23
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,860
Not all.

24
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,080
You cannot leave this place unless I'm dead.

25
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,319
I cannot kill you.

26
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,540
Also, I'm not as strong as you.

27
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,199
We have never fought before.

28
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,780
How do you know you're weaker than me?

29
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,000
Careful, Young Master Duan!

30
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,260
Go back to your master.

31
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,140
I shall see what she will use to kill me.

32
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,540
Come up here, Young Master Duan.

33
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,120
Miss Wang.

34
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,359
Miss Wang, I can't defeat him. Let's find a way to run.

35
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:55,320
He's sitting right there. We can't escape.

36
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,560
Young Master Duan, can you help me to put on some clothes first?

37
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,340
Okay.

38
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,900
Then... please close your eyes.

39
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,680
Don't ever open them.

40
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,060
Let's start from the sleeves.

41
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,440
And then, there are two strings below your hand.

42
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,320
Can you tie a knot for me?

43
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,899
You, don't randomly place your hands places.

44
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,359
It's... below it.

45
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,280
Sorry!

46
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,280
Careful.

47
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,080
Are you done?

48
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,040
Yes.

49
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,620
Open your eyes then.

50
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,558
How indecent.

51
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,279
I told you to learn some techniques before facing me.

52
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,119
I'm not here to see you two get all chummy.

53
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,459
When you two fought just now, he used 17 techniques from different sects.

54
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,860
I can't figure out which sect he belongs to at the moment.

55
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,240
You can't defeat him.

56
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,239
Miss Wang has already said that

57
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
I can never defeat you.

58
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,759
When will you let this go?

59
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,880
Of course, I can let you live. It's just that, from now onwards,

60
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,740
whenever you see me, you must get on your knees and give me three kowtows.

61
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,439
Then, you'll say loud and clear:

62
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,180
"Master! Show mercy! I'm but a swine!"

63
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,119
A gentleman would rather die than be humiliated.

64
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,599
I will not beg and kowtow to you.

65
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,980
If you want to kill me, do it now.

66
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,940
You're really not afraid of dying?

67
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,799
Of course, I am.

68
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,159
But getting on my knees and begging for my life whenever I see you, that's worse than dying.

69
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,319
I don't see how

70
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,700
kowtowing to me is a bad thing.

71
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,680
When I become the emperor,

72
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,120
you will have to get on your knees when you see me, too.

73
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,999
That's odd. Why did he say the same thing as well?

74
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,159
Kowtowing to the emperor is different.

75
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,439
That's proper manner. It's not begging for my life.

76
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,959
I will never kowtow to you.

77
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,519
Just kill me with your blade.

78
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,700
Sure.

79
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,020
Come down here.

80
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,079
I'll give you one swift cut.

81
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,919
If you want to kill me, then I can only accept my fate.

82
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,420
However, I have a favor to ask.

83
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,080
Speak.

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,180
This lady here has been poisoned.

85
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,599
Her limbs are drained of power and cannot move.

86
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:17,119
Can you please send her back to the Mandarava Villa by Lake Tai?

87
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,500
Why should I do you a favor?

88
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,740
The Xixia East General issued a decree that

89
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,940
whoever captures this knowledgeable girl

90
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,559
will be rewarded with thousands of gold

91
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,980
and the title of Commander of the Ten Thousand Households.

92
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,279
In this case, I'll write you a missive.

93
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,019
Once you send her back, keep this missive and head to the Dali Kingdom.

94
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:41,639
5,000 gold will be yours.

95
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,060
You'll be given the same title, too.

96
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,880
Who do you think you are?

97
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,299
One missive from you is enough to give me 5,000 gold

98
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,480
and the Commander of Ten Thousand Households title?

99
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,640
I can't do anything if you don't trust me.

100
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,780
My death is but a small matter.

101
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,839
But if a girl is stranded here because of my death, and is then captured by thugs,

102
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,099
a million deaths won't be enough to atone for my sin.

103
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,379
If you lay your finger on me, my cousin shall avenge me.

104
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:17,639
The Xixia Kingdom will be thrown into disarray.

105
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,940
Chaos will ensue.

106
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,900
Your cousin?

107
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
Who's your cousin?

108
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,480
My cousin is Young Master Murong.

109
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,839
Surely you have heard of the Murong clan?

110
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,819
Whatever you do to me, he will pay it back tenfold.

111
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:38,439
If Young Master Murong sees your inappropriate behavior with another young man,

112
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,199
he not want to avenge you.

113
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,519
Such accusations!

114
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,120
This Young Master Duan is just a stranger to me.

115
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,220
May I know your name, Mr. General?

116
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,060
Do you even dare to tell me your name?

117
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,599
Of course!

118
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,139
I do not have anything to hide.

119
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,060
I'm Li Yanzong of the Xixia Kingdom.

120
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,279
Your surname is Li.

121
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,780
That's the surname of Xixia's royal family.

122
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,260
Not just Xixia's. Soon, we will conquer both Liao and Song,

123
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,639
then eliminate the Tibetans by the west and devour the Dali Kingdom by the south.

124
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,540
His manner of speech is so familiar...

125
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,340
You are very ambitious.

126
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,799
However, General Li, you have mastered the techniques of every sect.

127
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,819
You can easily become the best fighter in the world.

128
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,599
However, world domination cannot be achieved solely through martial prowess.

129
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:39,140
Also, in my opinion,

130
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,340
you're not the best fighter.

131
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,080
Why is that so?

132
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,039
From what I've seen so far, there are two individuals

133
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,060
stronger than you in this world.

134
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,919
- And who are they?
- The first one is the ex-chief of the Beggars' Sect, Qiao Feng.

135
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:55,839
And the second person?

136
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,999
The second person is my cousin, Murong Fu, from the Murong clan.

137
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,340
You ranked Qiao Feng before Murong Fu.

138
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,280
Was it an objective conclusion or was it due to personal reasons?

139
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,260
What do you mean?

140
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,000
If it's an objective conclusion,

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,499
it means you truly think that Qiao Feng is stronger than Murong Fu.

142
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:16,039
If it's due to personal reasons,

143
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,679
it means you put an outsider above Murong Fu as a gesture of common courtesy.

144
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,600
It doesn't matter.

145
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,240
I certainly wish that my cousin were stronger than Chief Qiao.

146
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,879
But at the moment, he isn't.

147
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,200
I see.

148
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,359
You're implying that Qiao Feng only knows the techniques from his own sect.

149
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,880
But your cousin is well-versed in every technique available.

150
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,520
As he slowly improves, he will become the strongest fighter one day.

151
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,320
That still doesn't work.

152
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,719
In the future, the best fighter, I think,

153
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,600
will most probably be this Young Master Duan here.

154
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,380
This kid?

155
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,719
Thanks to your instructions, he learned Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves.

156
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:06,540
I didn't know an escaping technique is all it takes to be the world's best.

157
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,199
If he studies under me, he might not still be able to defeat Chief Qiao after three years.

158
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:16,939
But defeating you will be a piece of cake.

159
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,440
All right. I'll believe what you said.

160
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:27,279
Instead of letting him grow to be a future nuisance, I shall kill him today.

161
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,280
Young Master Duan, the sword energy released from your hand only works intermittently.

162
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,520
Why is that?

163
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,480
I don't know.

164
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,219
Just do your best and pierce his right wrist with your sword energy.

165
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:45,419
Grab his sword then hug him tight

166
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:50,240
before using Six Solar Snow-Melt Skill to negate his power.

167
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,660
What skill is that?

168
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,679
Back then in Mandarava Villa when you rescued me,

169
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:01,120
you used the special technique of the Dali Duan family.

170
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,059
Why would you learn a dirty technique like Great Energy Dissolving Skill?

171
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:05,679
It's not the Great Energy Dissolving Skill.

172
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,400
It's called the Six Solar Snow-Melt Skill.

173
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,660
Miss Wang.

174
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,760
Due to my incompetence,

175
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,840
I cannot send you back.

176
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,860
I'm deeply sorry.

177
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,519
If one day you return home and marry your cousin,

178
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:42,120
don't forget to spill some wine on the camellia that I planted.

179
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,280
It'll mean I have drunk your celebratory wine and given you my blessing.

180
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,000
Young Master Duan.

181
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,180
I will never ever forget

182
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,540
the kindness that you extended

183
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,560
to me when I needed it.

184
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,080
General Li,

185
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,900
since you've decided to kill me,

186
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,240
now's the time.

187
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,679
Young Master Duan, escape by the front door and run for your life.

188
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,439
As long as I'm still alive,

189
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,060
I will protect you, Miss Wang.

190
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,259
You might be a martial arts idiot, but you're definitely a good lover.

191
00:17:59,259 --> 00:18:07,079
This Miss Wang must be your soulmate to warrant your sacrifice.

192
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
Enough talking.

193
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,479
I'll count to ten.

194
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,599
If you still can't kill me by then, you'll have to let me go.

195
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,300
Fifth hit.

196
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,760
Sixth hit.

197
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Seventh hit.

198
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,300
Ninth hit.

199
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,460
Tenth hit.

200
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,980
Eleventh hit.

201
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,799
It's the thirteenth now and I'm still alive.

202
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:08,320
It means you can't kill me.

203
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,760
You enjoy running, don't you?

204
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,400
I shall kill the girl upstairs first then.

205
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,300
No!

206
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,120
Move one inch

207
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,020
and you'll die by my blade.

208
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,799
If you kill him, kill me too.

209
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,899
Or else, I will kill you to avenge his death one day.

210
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,079
This claim of yours sure is bold.

211
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,280
It seems like

212
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,160
you do have feelings towards him.

213
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,599
Feelings?

214
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,680
There isn't even love between us.

215
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,200
However, if he dies for me,

216
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,860
it's only normal that I avenge him.

217
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,220
When you say this,

218
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,599
you mean you won't regret it?

219
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,640
No regrets.

220
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,359
Miss Wang, he left.

221
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,340
He left?

222
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,259
He didn't take my life.

223
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,920
Young Master Duan,

224
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,500
eoes that bottle contain the antidote?

225
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,519
Damn it. It's rancid.

226
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,099
Young Master Duan, let me smell it.

227
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:23,879
It might be able to counter the poison inside me.

228
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:25,480
Okay.

229
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,239
Miss Wang, are you okay?

230
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,300
I can move my hands now.

231
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
Young Master Duan, I wish to change my clothes now.

232
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,060
- Can you wait for me down there?
- Sure.

233
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,979
- Young Master Duan. Go down, please.
- Okay.

234
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,580
Go down.

235
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,220
Pardon me.

236
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,320
Come. Drink.

237
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,060
More, please. Love it.

238
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,720
Chief Qiao.

239
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,360
Be quiet.

240
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,459
- What happened?
- Chief Qiao, we've been poisoned.

241
00:23:05,459 --> 00:23:07,479
We can't move at all.

242
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,040
Can you check their body to see if they have the antidote?

243
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,720
Wait for me.

244
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,160
Is this the antidote?

245
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,420
Here.

246
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,679
It stinks!

247
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,360
How are you?

248
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,960
I'm feeling better now.

249
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,260
Thanks, Chief Qiao.

250
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,679
- Sister A'Zhu .
- Here,

251
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,360
A'Bi.

252
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,120
What are you staring at, Sister A'Zhu?

253
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,000
Nothing.

254
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,399
I didn't expect to kill this many people one day.

255
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,880
Don't be so fickle-minded.

256
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,320
My mom might be a woman

257
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,439
but she's decisive.

258
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,399
You're a man

259
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,119
and you can't stop second-guessing.

260
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,559
It's my first time killing someone.

261
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,660
Of course, it's shocking.

262
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,839
I guess so.

263
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,359
But in this pugilist world,

264
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,519
bloodshed is an everyday occurrence.

265
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,040
Unless you plan to quit the pugilist world?

266
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,759
Back home, my dad and my uncle forced me to learn martial arts every day.

267
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,820
I kept refusing.

268
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,319
Who knew that one day, when it really came to it,

269
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,600
I'd still kill somebody.

270
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,719
You want to study

271
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,760
so that you can be a scholar or the prime minister, I suppose?

272
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Not really.

273
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,080
Working as a government official is boring.

274
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,879
What do you want to be then?

275
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,679
Are you like my cousin who wants

276
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,260
to be the emperor?

277
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,440
Young Master Murong wants to be the emperor?

278
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,959
I accidentally spilled the beans.

279
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,119
Please don't tell anyone else,

280
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,100
especially in front of my cousin.

281
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,799
Or else, he'll blame me.

282
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,440
All right.

283
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,120
I don't care about Young Master Murong.

284
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,899
Whether he wants to be the emperor or a panhandler,

285
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,479
it's none of my business.

286
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,720
I don't have a say anyway.

287
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,980
Young Master Duan, are you mad at me?

288
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,720
No.

289
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,840
Miss Wang.

290
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,379
Miss Wang, remember this.

291
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:33,539
I will never ever be mad at you in my whole life.

292
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:35,079
I don't want anything else.

293
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,479
As long as I can spend the rest of my life

294
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,159
like what I'm doing now,

295
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,059
I'll be content. I don't desire other things.

296
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:46,300
Young Master Duan, you saved my life.

297
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,380
I will remember this kindness of yours forever.

298
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,000
But my heart belongs to someone else already.

299
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,460
I hope you can mind your words

300
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,480
so that we can still be friends in the future.

301
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,180
Sure.

302
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,600
Let's get going.

303
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,520
How are you feeling? Better?

304
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,440
Chief Qiao, thank you for your help.

305
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,160
It's my duty.

306
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,479
- Miss...?
- I'm called A'Zhu.

307
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:34,919
Miss A;Zhu, do you know where the Beggars' Sect is?

308
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,199
No, sorry.

309
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,099
Chief Qiao, your so-called sect took you for granted

310
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:40,599
and even expelled you.

311
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,659
It now came back to bite them. They deserve it.

312
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:45,999
The way I see it, you need not save them.

313
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:48,840
Let them suffer so they'll learn.

314
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,800
They are my brothers who have been through life and death with me.

315
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,780
Helian Tieshu wanted to duel with me

316
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,660
but he poisoned everyone secretly.

317
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,879
It must be premeditated.

318
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,620
If I do not intervene in time,

319
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,420
not just the Beggars' Sect,

320
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,019
even the Shaolin Temple, the Wudang Sect,

321
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,220
or even your Young Master Murong will be in danger.

322
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,460
I apologize for my short-sightedness.

323
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,099
It's just that Helian Tieshu imprisoned us on this wagon.

324
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,879
We were also poisoned so we couldn't know

325
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:28,859
what happened or where they went.

326
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:30,800
I shall take my leave then.

327
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,740
Chief Qiao.

328
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,920
Thank you.

329
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,319
You two should find a safe spot to settle down.

330
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,079
If you found your young master,

331
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,020
please warn him.

332
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
Sister.

333
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,420
Sister A'Zhu, let's go.

334
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,919
Chief Qiao already left.

335
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,479
If the Xixia comes here, we'll be in trouble.

336
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,040
Let's go.

337
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,559
Miss Wang, let's take it slow.

338
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,480
Watch your step.

339
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,319
The path is rocky.

340
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,399
Miss Wang, let's check that place out later.

341
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,080
- That place.
- Okay.

342
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,919
Miss Wang!

343
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,279
- Young Master Duan.
- Young Master Duan.

344
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,159
- Miss A'Zhu.
- Sister A'Zhu.

345
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,659
- Sister A'Bi.
- Miss A'Bi, you guys are safe.

346
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:36,199
Wonderful. Wonderful news.

347
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:39,459
Why are you guys turning back? A'Bi and I were about to look for you.

348
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:43,039
What a coincidence! We were about to look for you, too.

349
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,600
Here.

350
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,759
How did you guys escape?

351
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,239
Did you sniff the stinky bottle?

352
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,559
Thank god Chief Qiao came to help us.

353
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,479
The stinky bottle sure was unpleasant.

354
00:29:58,479 --> 00:30:01,559
- Chief Qiao rescued you two?
- Yes.

355
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,399
After he freed us, he went to rescue the Beggars' Sect disciples.

356
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,799
No one knows where they went.

357
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,279
Chief Qiao was so concerned about them.

358
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,059
And they only knew to curse him non-stop.

359
00:30:12,059 --> 00:30:15,319
My big brother sure is a righteous person.

360
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,459
He'd rather be betrayed than betray someone.

361
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,079
Right, Miss Wang!  How about you?

362
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,459
- Did Chief Qiao save you, too?
- No.

363
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:28,160
Young Master Duan here protected me.

364
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,720
I see.

365
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,520
On behalf of my young master, thank you, Young Master Duan.

366
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,779
Miss Wang, where should we go next?

367
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:47,119
Young Master Duan and I were going to save you two.

368
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,519
Seeing the four of us safe and sound here is definitely a better outcome than expected.

369
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,400
The Beggars' Sect is none of our business.

370
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,960
In my opinion, we should head to the Shaolin Temple

371
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,100
to save your young master.

372
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,479
- Okay.
- Okay.

373
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:05,279
I have always looked up to your young master.

374
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,260
I'd love to meet him.

375
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,999
Since I'm free, let me tag along with you guys to the Shaolin Temple.

376
00:31:10,999 --> 00:31:12,679
- Give me a hand.
- Who's there?

377
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,939
- Careful.
- Let me scout it out.

378
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,020
Careful.

379
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,820
Who are you?

380
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,879
Mister, who hurt you?

381
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,719
We're from the Tianning Encampment.

382
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,839
A group of foreign thugs attacked our encampment and killed our leader.

383
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,479
Then, they cast us out.

384
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,340
Where is the encampment?

385
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,240
Over there.

386
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,279
- And the thugs?
- Those thugs captured more than a hundred panhandlers.

387
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,719
They slaughtered chickens and cows.

388
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,779
Our leader wanted to intervene and so they killed him and all the guards.

389
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,380
Have they left?

390
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,759
- They are still there.
- Then why don't you hurry and run!

391
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,820
If they find you, they'll slice you into pieces.

392
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:49,740
Let's go.

393
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,700
Mister...

394
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,579
Sister A'Zhu, they are at their wits' end.

395
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,239
- Why did you have to frighten them so?
- I didn't exaggerate.

396
00:31:57,239 --> 00:31:59,220
It's the truth.

397
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,380
Wait!

398
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,679
If the people from the Beggars' Sect are in the encampment,

399
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,999
then Young Master Qiao headed in the wrong direction!

400
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
I have a solution.

401
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,039
Young Master Duan. Miss Wang.

402
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,719
I want to bring the stinky bottle with me

403
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,199
and impersonate Chief Qiao.

404
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,919
I'll save the Beggars' Sect disciples

405
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,659
and when they are out of danger, they will be grateful to Chief Qiao.

406
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,079
That way, I can repay his kindness.

407
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,279
Chief Qiao is big and tall.

408
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,879
How can you pull off the disguise?

409
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,559
The more challenging it is, the more my talent shines.

410
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,599
Even if you can fool everyone with your disguise,

411
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,440
you can't imitate his martial power.

412
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,879
Tianning Encampment unites all good fighters from the Xixia First Class Hall.

413
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,640
You can't come and go at ease.

414
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,920
Why not let...

415
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,839
Miss, do you have something to say to me?

416
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:08,959
Can you disguise as someone else

417
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,079
and head to the encampment with A'Zhu?

418
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,700
But, if something happens...

419
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,320
Who should I disguise as, Miss?

420
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,999
People of the Beggars' Sect accused my cousin

421
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,399
of working with Chief Qiao in the dark

422
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,020
to kill Deputy Chief Ma.

423
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,379
If my cousin and Chief Qiao come to their rescue,

424
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:33,520
they will believe in their innocence.

425
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,680
Miss Wang, you want me to pretend to be your cousin?

426
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,320
Forget it.

427
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,879
The enemies in the encampment are strong.

428
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,899
Sending you two there will be too dangerous.

429
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:51,960
Let's stay here.

430
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,519
It's not dangerous at all.

431
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,679
Whatever you want me to do, I'll do it.

432
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,419
Running away is my forté.

433
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,999
My cousin kills people for breakfast.

434
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:07,920
He never flees.

435
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,020
I see.

436
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,540
Your cousin is the greatest hero ever.

437
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,439
I don't even deserve to pretend to be like him.

438
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,959
If I make a foolish mistake while disguised as him,

439
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,479
his reputation will be tarnished.

440
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,999
If Young Master Duan wants to disguise as my young master,

441
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,238
it is no easy feat.

442
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,119
However, none from the Beggars' Sect are close to my young master either.

443
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:32,340
You only need to imitate roughly

444
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,039
his voice and his appearance.

445
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,660
I beg to differ.

446
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,479
Young Master Murong stands out like a jewel.

447
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,158
It's not something anyone else can imitate.

448
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,019
The way I see it, the further off the mark, the better.

449
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,839
Or else, when I run with my tail between my legs,

450
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,039
your young master's reputation will be ruined.

451
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,519
Are you mad at me, Young Master Duan?

452
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,799
No.

453
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,419
Never.

454
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,980
I will never be mad at you.

455
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,680
Sister A'Zhu, what do you think?

456
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,599
Let's go.

457
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,660
Miss Wang, look.

458
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,580
Does this look like him?

459
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,679
And with these tall boots...

460
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,720
Sit and put them on.

461
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,360
So?

462
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,620
Does it look the same?

463
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,200
Miss Wang, check me out.

464
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,880
Do I look like your cousin?

465
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,260
Yes.

466
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,160
But... you're still not him.

467
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,279
- Little Brother.
- Brother Qiao.

468
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,679
It took me so long to find you.

469
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,900
Why are you here?

470
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,079
We were about to disguise as you to rescue the people.

471
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:28,679
And now, you're here. Miss A'Zhu doesn't need to disguise anymore.

472
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,319
The Beggars' Sect expelled me.

473
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,879
If those people live or die,

474
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,200
I don't care.

475
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,319
But the both of us

476
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,719
should have a drink together.

477
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,240
Sure.

478
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,900
Miss Wang, care to join us?

479
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,400
You...

480
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,599
No problem.

481
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,199
But the people from the Beggars' Sect are your brothers, no?

482
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,300
You should rescue them.

483
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,660
Sister A'Zhu?

484
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,599
Your disguise is so amazing.

485
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,320
Even the voice is perfect.

486
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,879
Of course. Bring that stinky bottle and leave now.

487
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,999
Miss Wang, wait for the good news here.

488
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,220
Chief Qiao. Please.

489
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,920
Let's go.

490
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,039
Take good care of Miss Wang.

491
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,660
Okay.

492
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,020
The wine's here.

493
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,080
Come, let's have some wine.

494
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,900
Come, come.

495
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,119
Have some wine.

496
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,640
Bottoms up!

497
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,920
[Wine]

498
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,959
And you call yourself a man?

499
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,860
How dare you use poison!

500
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,120
What a dishonest trick.

501
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,999
- Shameless being.
- Shameless.

502
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:30,999
Such a dishonest trick.

503
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,240
You're no hero.

504
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,199
Our Beggars' Sect is the best sect.

505
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,680
Our chief is unrivaled.

506
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,160
When he's here, he'll kill all of you.

507
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,240
Quan Guanqing.

508
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,140
You asked us to expel the chief

509
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,540
and now, we're in the hands of our enemy.

510
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,800
Are you happy now?

511
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,659
We just expelled Chief Qiao

512
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,220
and now, we want him to save us.

513
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,980
If I were him,

514
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,359
I would never come.

515
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,520
We wronged Chief Qiao,

516
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,559
it is a wrongdoing on our part.

517
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,399
But Chief Qiao has a generous soul.

518
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,080
If he knew we were imprisoned here,

519
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,779
he would come and save us.

520
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:21,500
When Chief Qiao bled for me,

521
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,860
I sweared to only follow him.

522
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:40,060
Hey! Why are you two here?

523
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,240
Send the message that Qiao Feng of the Beggars' Sect

524
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,280
and Young Master Murong from Jiangnan

525
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,660
are here to meet General Helian.

526
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,639
You're Chief Qiao of the Beggars' Sect.

527
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,600
I shall inform the general now.

528
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,860
Sir, Chief Qiao of the Beggars' Sect and Young Master Murong from Jiangnan are here.

529
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,080
- Send them in now.
- Yes, Sir.

530
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,199
See? Our chief is here to save us.

531
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,239
Indeed.

532
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,079
Chief Qiao is a righteous man.

533
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,279
He would never abandon us.

534
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,880
We still don't know if he's here to save us.

535
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,260
Also, he came with Murong Fu.

536
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,559
If this isn't treason, what is?

537
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,100
Shut up.

538
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,339
- General.
- General.

539
00:40:39,339 --> 00:40:40,960
Chief Qiao.

540
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,940
Young Master Murong.

541
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,519
The name of Murong has spread far and wide.

542
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,719
I heard that you could turn every technique against its user.

543
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,459
Meeting you two here confirms the veracity of those hearsays.

544
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:56,919
Well... Your name has traveled to our ears too, General Helian.

545
00:40:56,919 --> 00:41:00,819
I've longed to meet with the heroes of Xixia First Class Hall.

546
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,919
Do pardon my sudden visit.

547
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,919
People always say:

548
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,899
Qiao Feng of the North, Murong of the South.

549
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,959
The great heroes of the world are none other than you two.

550
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,820
Today, both of you came to visit together.

551
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,680
I am beyond honored!

552
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,039
Come, have a seat.

553
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,279
Are you sure?

554
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,279
Guys, tell me.

555
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,519
I bet his bone hardly weighs one kilo.

556
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,780
Young boy.

557
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:53,139
I heard that you can always turn every technique against its user.

558
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:54,919
I, Second Young Master Yue, do not believe it.

559
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,999
Don't worry.

560
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,319
I won't fight you.

561
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,319
Let me ask you.

562
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,559
What's my signature technique?

563
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:07,339
What technique can you use to turn my technique against me?

564
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,439
Nanhai Crocodile.

565
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,879
Third...

566
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,719
Young Master.

567
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,959
Second Young Master!

568
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,759
You specialize in neck-breaking.

569
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:24,679
Lately, you have improved.

570
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,660
Your signature technique is the Crocodile Snip.

571
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,439
So to defeat you,

572
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,400
I will just have to break your neck first.

573
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,479
Great technique, isn't it?

574
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,059
No. It's normal that you know of my technique.

575
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,639
My master is not here today.

576
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,999
If he were here,

577
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,480
I bet you wouldn't know his technique.

578
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,399
May I know who your master is?

579
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,139
What powerful technique does he know?

580
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,540
My master has passed away.

581
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,420
It's okay not to mention him.

Why don't I show you?

00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,830
Come on.
