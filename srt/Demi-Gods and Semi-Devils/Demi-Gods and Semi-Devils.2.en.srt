Timing and Subtitles brought to you by ⚔️Martial Arts Team ⚔️@Viki.com

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Little girl, do you want to live or die?

15
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Of course, I want to live!

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,200
But if you kill me and Brother Duan, you are going to die too.

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
All right then.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,200
If you hand me the antidote,

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
I will let you go.

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,600
I told you I do not have the antidote!

21
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,000
Only my father can cure the ferret's poison.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,200
What is your father's name then?

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
Tell me, or else I will burn your hair!

24
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,600
You cannot do that!

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,800
If you burn it, it will hurt so much.

26
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,000
Beardy, everything happened because of me.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If you want to release your anger, you can burn my hair.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
No way!

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
You cannot let him do that to you!

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,000
It will hurt for you as well.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,200
What situation is this that you two are still flirting with one another? Hurry up and tell me.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
I told you I do not have the antidote!

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,800
How long can you live after getting poisoned by that ferret?

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,000
My father said you can live for seven days.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,800
But Chief Si Kong, you are skilled in martial arts and possess strong and vital energy.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,000
I believe you can live longer than seven days.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
My father is the only person who can cure you.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,600
Not to mention my ferret is a rare species.

39
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,300
Do you think you can get cured so easily?

40
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,800
Who exactly is your father then?

41
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Tell me!

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,439
Bring that brat here.

43
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,599
No!

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,039
Do not hurt him!

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,119
This has nothing to do with him!

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,899
Miss Zhong, real men are not afraid of death.

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,400
You should not bow down to these evil people!

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
But I am not a man.

49
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,700
I am afraid of death.

50
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,900
I want to bow down to them.

51
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,000
Feed him the Heartbreak Grass!

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
Yes!

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,400
For your information, the Heartbreak Grass will only take effect after seven days.

54
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,200
If you cannot get back here in 7 days,

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
your organs will shatter and you will suffer excruciating pain.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,600
If you come back,

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,900
I will give you the antidote and let her go.

58
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
No!

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,300
My father mentioned before

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,400
that whoever enters the valley will die!

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
I do not want Brother Duan to die.

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Send someone who is not afraid to die instead.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
You are worried that he might die?

64
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,700
What about my men?

65
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,700
You know what? Let us see who will be the one to die first!

66
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Miss Zhong, leave it to me.

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,300
I am sure your father will not harm me

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,500
if he knows that I bring him news of you.

69
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,100
I have an idea!

70
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,000
Just tell him that I am in danger, but do not tell him my exact location.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,500
In that case, if he kills you,

72
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,400
he will not be able to find out where I am.

73
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,100
This sounds like a good idea.

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,200
Take my shoe and hand it to my parents.

75
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,600
They will know what happened.

76
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Let me go.

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Stop staring at each other like that!

78
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,000
Brother Duan, go get the antidote.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,200
By then, I will let her go so you can marry her.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,720
Both of you will have all the time in the world.

81
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,980
You people... stop eavesdropping.

82
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,439
I am going to show Brother Duan the way.

83
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,799
Go further away.

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,100
Nobody is allowed to eavesdrop!

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
So thirsty...

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,200
I live in a valley near the Lancang River.

87
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,400
After you reach the manor,

88
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,000
do not tell my father that you are from the Duan family.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
Also, do not tell him that your father knows One-Finger Death Touch.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,000
You must remember this.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have no idea why her father is so against the Duan family.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
But that does not matter.

93
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
The most important thing to do right now is to save her life.

94
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
It doesn't matter what my surname is.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,700
Junior Ge, we are safe now.

96
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,000
I am sure you are worn out.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,200
Let us take a rest, we'll continue later.

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,000
We betrayed our master and ran away.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,600
There is no longer a place for us in the martial arts world anymore.

100
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
We cannot let Master and those from the sect track us down.

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,800
You do not have to worry about that.

102
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,200
I think the Shennong Sect came prepared this time.

103
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,000
I believe all of them in the sect, both the eastern and western branches, except for us, will be doomed.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,200
You want to get married and take the opportunity to run away,

105
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
But how could you curse your own master and martial sect?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That is so cruel and heartless.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,200
The eastern and western branches have been fighting for the past few years

108
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,000
just to enter the Sword Lake Palace

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
to see the Limitless Jade Cliff.

110
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
What is so special about the Limitless Jade Cliff

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,800
that even you guys cannot tell?

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,000
Master told me that years ago,

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the grandmaster often saw a male and a female immortal

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,800
sparring swords on the Limitless Jade Cliff.

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,400
I can never imagine how superb their skills are.

116
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,200
My grandmaster had hoped to learn a few techniques from them,

117
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,800
but their movements were too fast.

118
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
And they did not appear every day.

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,700
The grandmaster was so obsessed with their techniques

120
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,600
that he neglected the sect's own techniques.

121
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,300
My grandmaster also saw a female immortal

122
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,200
practicing swords on the cliff.

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,700
But she disappeared after two years.

124
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,600
Since then, my grandmaster would wander around the mountain

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
and stare into outer space at the cliff every day.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Less than half a year later, he passed away due to sickness.

127
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,600
From now on, there is no east or west sect between us.

128
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
We are one.

129
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Don't... Stop it.

130
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Trust me.

131
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,500
If I ever betray you,

132
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,600
I will drown in this river. I will turn into a big bastard.

133
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,700
Come on. I do not want to mingle with a bastard.

134
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,200
Who is there?

135
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,300
Go after him!

136
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,480
Stop right there! Don't run!

137
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,820
Amitabha... Manjushri... Guanyin, please don't let them catch me!

138
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,399
That area is forbidden!

139
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,300
Outsiders are not allowed to enter!

140
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,200
If you keep running,

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,100
you will break the rules and you will get killed!

142
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,200
Stop right away!

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,000
I have no way out anyway.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,600
Breaking the rules and getting killed, there doesn't seem like there is much of a difference!

145
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
I...

146
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,500
I didn't die.

147
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
What is this place?

148
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,200
The leader of the Limitless Sword Sect

149
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
claims that he sees shadows

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,000
of immortals sparring swords on the jade cliff.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,800
But how is it possible for such an enormous jade cliff to exist?

152
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Could it be...

153
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,800
Could it be that they thought the waterfall was the Jade Cliff?

154
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
Great!

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,700
Nobody will know even if I die in this deep valley.

156
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,200
Why don't I carve something on the stones?

157
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,000
Maybe I should carve "Duan Yu from Dali died here."

158
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
That's quite fun, too.

I heard you had accomplished a lot this trip.

169
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,159
A'Bi and I heard you defeated ten people on your own at the Shaolin Temple.

170
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,039
What's wrong with Young Master?

171
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,360
During the battle at Shaolin Temple, Young Master lost to Qiao Feng.

172
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,799
That is why he is upset.

173
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,780
No, no, no.

174
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,599
Young Master would not take it to heart

175
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,840
if he lost to Qiao Feng once.

176
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,759
If you ask me, I think he is unhappy because Qiao Feng is going to become the chief of the Beggar' Sect.

177
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,320
The chief of the Beggar' Sect?

178
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,060
- What?
- What is with that?

179
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,359
Rumors have been spreading like wildfire.

180
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,660
Don't you know about this?

181
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,940
- Let me tell you...
- Get on the boat now.

182
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,160
It's dark already.

183
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,279
Forget it.

184
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,639
I never expected the stones on this jade cliff to be so tough.

185
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,419
If someone in the future sees this, they may think that I, Duan Yu, couldn't even write nicely.

186
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,560
What is this?

187
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,640
This...

188
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,439
Amazing!

189
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:53,339
The moonlight reflects my shadow on the rock.

190
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:59,480
Then... my shadow will appear on the waterfall!

191
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,580
It is as though I am standing in between two mirrors.

192
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,580
This is fun.

193
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,779
I wonder if anybody can see me if I do this.

194
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:30,119
It seems like those from the Limitless Sword Sect

195
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,539
really saw immortals practicing swords here.

196
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,840
In that case...

197
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,179
You people put me into this situation.

198
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:47,159
Therefore, I shall pretend to practice a few moves

199
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,260
and give them some false hope!

200
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,960
This is the bottom of Sword Lake Palace.

201
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,320
Why would there be something like this here?

202
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,920
Did someone live here before?

203
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,879
I am Duan Yu. Sorry for showing up uninvited

204
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,799
and trespassing into this wonderful place.

205
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,640
I hope you'll forgive me.

206
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,400
It seems like no one has lived here for a long time.

207
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,420
[Deputy Chief of the Beggars' Sect, Ma Dayuan]
Welcome, Deputy Chief Ma.

208
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,519
You are too polite.

209
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,300
Feng'er, is not yet the chief.

210
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,680
He's doing what he should do.

211
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,599
Is everybody here?

212
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,879
Everybody is here.

213
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,999
Chief, not only the disciples of the Beggars' Sect,
[Head of Discipline, Beggar's Sect, Bai Shijing]

214
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,359
even Elders Song, Xi, Chen, and Elder Wu Siwei, who were away on duty, have returned

215
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:45,140
just to catch a glimpse of the inauguration of our new chief.

216
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,380
Greetings, Chief!

217
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,900
My pleasure, Elders.

218
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,600
Feng'er.

219
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,759
Let's go. Let's go.

220
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,770
[Ceremony]

221
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,000
[Ceremony]

222
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,760
The chief has arrived!

223
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,119
Qiao Feng.

224
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,020
Ever since he joined the Beggars' Sect,

225
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,839
he has cared for our brethren and associates.

226
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,199
He is brave and responsible.

227
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,579
He defends our territory, our nation, and fights against our enemies.

228
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,279
He has contributed a lot to the Beggars' Sect.

229
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,740
Recently, wars are breaking out.

230
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,100
The Khitans have been invading southward,

231
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,380
trying to conquer our Great Song.

232
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,119
We need everybody to stay loyal so that we can turn the tide!

233
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,860
Yes! Yes! Yes!

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,759
Qiao Feng.

235
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,839
I am here.

236
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,560
We, the Beggars' Sect, are the best sect in the world.

237
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,919
Do you know why?

238
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,519
That is because, in the past dynasties,

239
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,799
there have always been those people who ended up having to become beggars.

240
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,239
That is correct.

241
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,499
Our motto is to commit to promises,

242
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,879
curb the violent and assist the weak,

243
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,640
respect others, not be trifled by small details and problems,

244
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,319
and never go against the principles of righteousness!

245
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:48,340
Qiao Feng, I am sure you know how important this Dog Beating Staff is.

246
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,820
I understand!

247
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,920
All right then.

248
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,159
I, Wang Jiantong, am no longer capable.

249
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:00,159
Today, I shall hand over the position of chief

250
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:03,540
to our ninth-generation disciple, Qiao Feng!

251
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,040
Take the staff!

252
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,219
My dear brothers, today, I, Qiao Feng,

253
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:33,839
have inherited the position of the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

254
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
[Head of the Dazhi Branch, Quan Guanqing]
I promise to devote everything

255
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,719
to the Beggars' Sect!

256
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,280
Greetings to the Chief!

257
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:18,279
I apologize for staring at you, Miss. I have no manners!

258
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:19,860
May I ask...

259
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,940
How should I address you?

260
00:20:26,868 --> 00:20:32,039
Miss, you look so pure and beautiful. You are like a deity.

261
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,480
Why don't...

262
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,180
Why don't I call you "Sister Deity"?

263
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,680
Sister Deity, after getting to witness your beauty,

264
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,020
I can die without regrets today.

265
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,100
However, I wonder

266
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,559
why do you live here alone?

267
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,900
Isn't it a little too lonely?

268
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,980
A letter from Wu Yazi to Sister Qiu Shui.

269
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,439
"Time seems to stop when I am with you here."

270
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:18,159
This must have been written by those two immortals

271
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,060
who were practicing swords at the cliff.

272
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,495
This statue must be Sister Qiu Shui in the poem.

273
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,959
Wu Yazi accompanied

274
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,220
and lived with her in this dark cave without any complaints.

275
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,120
They must have truly been in love.

276
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,380
Sister Deity, if you can come back to live and say something to me,

277
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,939
I would be willing to sacrifice my life a thousand or ten thousand times for you.

278
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,639
"Kowtow a thousand times before me.

279
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,239
Do my bidding.

280
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,919
Obey my orders.

281
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,220
You will have no regrets even after you die."

282
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:14,740
It is perfectly justified and reasonable to kowtow to her.

283
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,559
And, of course, it would be an honor to do her bidding!

284
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,580
Kowtow a thousand times.

285
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,320
One,

286
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,980
two,

287
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,600
three...

288
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,460
[Yanzi Building]

289
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,159
Young Master,

290
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,960
judging by the position of your chess pieces,

291
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,000
I am afraid you are going to lose.

292
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,360
I lost!

293
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,119
900...

294
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,240
998...

295
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,340
999...

296
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
1000!

297
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,159
It seems that Sister Deity has prepared for all of this all along.

298
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,380
If I had not heeded her words and kowtowed before her a thousand times,

299
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,639
this cushion would not have torn.

300
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,439
And this treasure would not have appeared then.

301
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,759
Thou kowtowed for a thousand times.

302
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,799
Thou did my bidding.

303
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,540
You can live without regrets.

304
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,619
This is the secret technique of the Carefree Sect.

305
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:17,194
Practice it every day

306
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:19,919
at 5:00 a.m. - 7:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m., and 5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.

307
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,279
Once you have mastered the technique, head down the mountains

308
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,879
and kill all of those of Carefree Sect.

309
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,959
Leave no one alive.

310
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,800
Or I will not be able to rest in peace.

311
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,819
What do you mean?

312
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:33,679
But I don't want to learn any martial arts.

313
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,559
What do you mean to kill those of the Carefree Sect?

314
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
I could never do that.

315
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,139
But I cannot disobey Sister Deity's words...

316
00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:45,220
I...

317
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,279
Sister Deity wants me to learn martial arts

318
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,000
and kill all of those people.

319
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,559
These people must have harmed her.

320
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,800
They deserve to die.

321
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:05,659
But she has already passed away for decades.

322
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,280
Who knows if the Carefree Sect still exists?

323
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,119
Maybe they have already been wiped out by someone else.

324
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,020
And I will not have to kill them myself.

325
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,919
Miss Deity might have already gotten her wish.

326
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,400
She may rest in peace now.

327
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,020
"The Divine Art of the Northern Darkness."

328
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:41,639
The Divine Art of the Northern Darkness uses others' inner energy as one's own.

329
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:44,580
The water in the northern underworld did not come naturally.

330
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,819
The ocean is made up of water from rivers.

331
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:53,499
Others in the world cultivated.

332
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:56,639
However, the Carefree Sect did the opposite.

333
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,679
They absorb, harmonize,

334
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,940
and store other people's inner energy.

335
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,780
If their opponents' energy exceeds their own,

336
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,879
they will make use of that energy as their own.

337
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,300
They are very dangerous people.

338
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,959
Be careful.

339
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,660
Be careful.

340
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,560
Using others' inner energy for their own use?

341
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,520
Isn't that the same as stealing from other people?

342
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,600
But... Sister Deity put it well.

343
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,100
The rivers come together to form an ocean.

344
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,140
The water flowed into the ocean on its own.

345
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,580
The ocean never robbed from the river.

346
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,119
These evil people must have offended Sister Deity.

347
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:47,439
So she absorbed their inner energy and used it as her own.

348
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,220
It is as though...

349
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,359
She took away the butcher's knife,

350
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,519
but she has no intention to harm the butcher.

351
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,600
She is not at fault at all!

352
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,720
Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves?

353
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,919
"Propriety."

354
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
"Innocence."

355
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,980
These are positions and bearings that appeared in Yijing.

356
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,359
It looks very complicated.

357
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,260
But I know them very well.

358
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,660
"When you encounter strong enemies, use this to keep yourself alive.

359
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,739
Use it to accumulate your own inner energy, and take their enemy's instead."

360
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,639
When you are in danger, use this technique to escape and keep yourself alive.

361
00:28:36,639 --> 00:28:37,999
That is a good thing.

362
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,520
But I don't think it is necessary

363
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,880
to take the enemies' lives.

364
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:57,840
Sister Deity, you want me to practice every morning, noon, and evening.

365
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,599
I will not disobey you.

366
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,180
From now on, I will be even more courteous to others.

367
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,080
So that they will not beat me up.

368
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,919
I will try my best to study and practice the Minute Steps Upon Towering Waves.

369
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,719
If I ever sense anything wrong,

370
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,879
I will escape immediately

371
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,300
so that I will not absorb others' inner energy.

372
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,380
The zither remains

373
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,020
and the chess game has yet to end,

374
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,679
but the beauty is no longer here.

375
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:58,739
Sister Deity must have been lonely when she lived here.

376
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:02,400
She could only play chess with herself.

377
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,519
It is a pity that I was not born sooner.

378
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,100
I could have accompanied you.

379
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,780
What is this place?

380
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,140
Library of a fairyland?

381
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,119
So this is the library?

382
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,119
On the silk cloth, Sister Deity mentioned

383
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,039
that the secret techniques of all the sects

384
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,000
are kept here and I can refer to them!

385
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,119
But I never studied martial arts, neither do I want to.

386
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,820
I do not want to read these scrolls and books.

387
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,719
But Sister Deity has given her orders.

388
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,050
I must not disobey her.

389
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,460
But all of the scrolls and books are gone, though?

390
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,859
The Beggars' Sect.

391
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:40,039
"Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms" is missing.

392
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,799
"Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms"?

393
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,959
Shaolin Sect.

394
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,620
The "Yijin Jing" is missing.

395
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,480
The Duan family of Dali.

396
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,319
The "One-Finger Death Touch"

397
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,679
and the "Six Pulse Excalibur" is missing.

398
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,520
What a pity.

399
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,020
What a pity.

400
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,199
What luck! What luck!

401
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,719
Since the scrolls and books are missing,

402
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,259
I will not be disobeying Sister Deity by not practicing then!

403
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,600
So this is the exit.

404
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,259
Sister Deity, I have important matters to deal with today.

405
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,540
I am afraid I have to bid you farewell for now.

406
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,380
After I save Miss Zhong,

407
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,700
I will be sure to visit you every year and spend some time here with you

408
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,580
so that you will not feel lonely.

409
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,319
Young Master, you have been restless since your fight with Qiao Feng.

410
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,719
Would you be willing to share what troubles you have with me?

411
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,899
They talk about Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North.

412
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,999
They make it sound as if they are equally good.

413
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,800
However, black and white can never be equal.

414
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,159
I have been intelligent and capable since young.

415
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,739
There are no martial arts that I do not know.

416
00:33:43,739 --> 00:33:47,719
But I lost to Qiao Feng this time.

417
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:50,419
Now, he is the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

418
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,959
He is in charge of the world's largest sect.

419
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,299
He has those who will devote everything to him, including their lives.

420
00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:00,299
But I, Murong Fu, only have a few servants to serve me.

421
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:06,239
I am afraid I will not be able to achieve my goal to restore Yan.

422
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,679
Murong Fu!

423
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,899
Do you remember that you are a member of the royal family of Yan?

424
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:11,919
Do you not remember your father's last words to you?

425
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,859
All heroes and great men have had to endure suffering to achieve their goals.

426
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:18,119
Back then, we went through so much to build Yan.

427
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,579
Our people worked so hard to fight wars and build the nation!

428
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:25,579
Are you going to give up just because of some minor setbacks?

429
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,959
Let me ask you.

430
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,939
Why did your father name you "Fu?"

431
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,839
Father named me "Fu,"

432
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:39,980
because he wants me to remember the behest of our ancestors.

433
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,559
- Brother.
- Young Master!

434
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,799
Thank you for enlightening me.

435
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,100
Young Master, please do not say that.

436
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,678
It is not an easy task to restore a nation.

437
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,379
The difficulty is unimaginable for ordinary people.

438
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,060
Young Master, you must not lose the spirit of Yan

439
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,380
just because of some minor setbacks.

440
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,479
You are right, Brother.

441
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,179
But we will not be able to restore a nation in one night.

442
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:10,439
Let alone achieving our goal with only so few of us.

443
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,119
Now, the world is in a state of chaos.

444
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,439
The ties between nations are complicated.

445
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,859
If we wish to restore the Murong legacy,

446
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,739
we need to recruit more talented people and alliances to rebuild our power.

447
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,079
As long as we work together as one and work towards our goals,

448
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,599
I am sure we will be able to restore Yan!

449
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,480
Young Master!

450
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,840
"Any person with the surname Duan who enters this valley shall be killed without exception."

451
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,699
So this is why Miss Zhong told me not to tell them that I am from the Duan family.

452
00:36:13,699 --> 00:36:16,599
I wonder why the leader of the valley hates the Duan family so much?

453
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,379
Even if the Duan family offended him,

454
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:19,899
there are hundreds of thousands of people with the surname Duan.

455
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:22,200
Can he kill every one of them?

456
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,490
[Wan]

457
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,780
Brother!

458
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,360
Come on!

459
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,859
Have a drink! Bottoms up!

460
00:36:57,859 --> 00:36:59,280
Cheers!

461
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,140
A toast to the chief!

462
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,540
Bottoms up!

463
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,739
Chief, you can certainly handle your liquor!

464
00:37:09,739 --> 00:37:12,259
- It is rare to see someone who can handle liquor as well as you do!
- You guys worked hard.

465
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:14,299
Enjoy the feast today. Get drunk and enjoy yourselves!

466
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,440
- All right! Here you go!
- Here!

467
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,200
- Bottoms up!
- Cheers!

468
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,899
Chief, I hear that you are skilled in martial arts.

469
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:23,139
Do you mind teaching me a little?

470
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:25,440
- Yes!
- Great!

471
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,060
Come on then.

472
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:45,640
It has been quite some time since things have been so lively here.

473
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,439
Come on, let us have a drink.

474
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,120
This is... the Black Tiger Steals Heart technique.

475
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,879
Not bad. You are quite strong.

476
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,219
But your movements are too big.

477
00:37:56,219 --> 00:37:57,799
Your enemies will see through you easily.

478
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,099
Thank you for your guidance, Chief.

479
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,039
Great!

480
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,640
Who is next?

481
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,119
Actually, we should have handed over our positions

482
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,019
to the younger generations a long time ago.

483
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:13,639
But we still cannot help but worry.

484
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,399
You know the situation in Song right now.

485
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,939
The emperor is too young.

486
00:38:17,939 --> 00:38:22,179
And Empress Dowager's health is getting worse and worse.

487
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:25,459
The nation is weak and surrounded by powerful enemies.

488
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,699
They seem to be in a more difficult situation

489
00:38:28,699 --> 00:38:32,359
- than we are, right?
- Indeed.

490
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:36,039
In times like these, when the nation is in crisis, we should be the ones standing out and protecting it.

491
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,959
But... you have such a competent disciple, Old Wang.

492
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,580
What is there to worry about?

493
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,139
Indeed. Chief Qiao is powerful and honorable.

494
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:47,639
I am sure that with him leading the Beggars' Sect,

495
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,139
there will be nothing that the sect cannot handle.

496
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:52,600
- Right?
- That's right.

497
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,079
The younger generations know what to do.

498
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,659
We should not worry too much. Come on.

499
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,819
- Drink up!
- Cheers.

500
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:05,000
- Let's drink.
- Cheers!

501
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,580
Chief, I would like to give it a try!

502
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,559
Me too!

503
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,260
More?

504
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,540
All right! Drink up!

505
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,359
Come on! Drink!

506
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,860
Come on!

507
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,660
Chief Qiao is amazing indeed.

508
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,619
Old Wang, you did a good job in teaching your disciple.

509
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:01,879
Those six disciples are some of the best fighters in the sect.

510
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:05,739
However, all of us saw what happened

511
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:09,039
during the battles earlier.

512
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,680
Not only does Qiao Feng have good control of his power,

513
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,840
but he also did not even spill a single drop of wine in his bowl.

514
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,239
Of course. He is my disciple!

515
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,920
- Come on, drink some more!
- Drink up!

516
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,420
Bottoms up!

517
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,640
[Wanjie Valley]

518
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,300
Young Master, please come in.

519
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,839
Thank you for alerting us that Miss Zhong is in danger.

520
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,499
Please rest here for a while, Young Master.

521
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:47,999
I will inform Madam right away.

522
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Thank you.

523
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,020
Greetings, Madam, I am Duan Yu.
[Wife of the lord of Wanjie Valley, Gan Baobao]

524
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,700
Greetings, Young Master.

525
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:16,420
Did you just say that your surname is Duan?

526
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,279
After you reach the manor, do not tell my father that your surname is Duan.

527
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,760
You can leave first.

528
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,719
I...

529
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,319
May I ask where your hometown is?

530
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,299
I am from the Lin'an Manor in Jiangnan.

531
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:45,139
I have been living in Dali for about three years.

532
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,920
Jiangnan...

533
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,260
In Dali...

534
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,940
That is why you have a Dali accent.

535
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,040
I heard you came to inform us of something.

536
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,699
Did something happen to my daughter?

537
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,100
Yes.

538
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,139
Madam.

539
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:06,279
Miss Zhong asked me to come here and seek help with this shoe as proof.

540
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:08,579
Miss Zhong and I met at the Limitless Sword Sect.

541
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:11,879
There is this Shennong Sect who came looking for trouble with the people from the Limitless Sword Sect.

542
00:42:11,879 --> 00:42:14,580
I thought that everything should be solved with peace,

543
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,759
so I wanted to stop Shennong Sect

544
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,319
from harming the Limitless Sword Sect.

545
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,740
Miss Zhong came with me.

546
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,379
Not only did they refuse to listen, but they attacked us as well.

547
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:28,439
Miss Zhong's Lightning Ferret bit many of their men.

548
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,959
So they are holding her hostage and have agreed only to let her go

549
00:42:31,959 --> 00:42:33,719
if we get them the antidote.

550
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,479
Indeed, she always causes trouble whenever she leaves the residence.

551
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,219
Madam! It is all my fault.

552
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:41,480
Please do not blame Miss Zhong.

553
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,780
Yeah.

554
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,220
It is not surprising.

555
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,959
Back then, I was exactly like her.

556
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,439
What the heck?

557
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,639
How did Jin Xi'er get killed?

558
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,340
Oh, no.

559

584
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:30,590
Young Master Duan, who is your father?

585
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:34,120
My father's name is Duan Zhengchun.

586
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,660
Duan Zhengchun?

587
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,420
That's right.

588
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,460
You... You are the son of that bastard Duan Zhengchun!

589
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,750
My father is in Dali City right now. If you want to find him, it's very easy.

590
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,560
Why do you need to put up a sign outside your house

591
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,090
that says something like "anyone from the Duan Family cannot come in and will be killed immediately"?
