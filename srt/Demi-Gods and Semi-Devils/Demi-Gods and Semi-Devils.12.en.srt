[Episode 12]

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,470
You really have the nerve to come here again!

15
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,420
Madam said that she wanted to

16
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,370
scratch your faces and hurt your beautiful looks.

17
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,910
Hello Sister You Cao. Is Madam at home?

18
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,030
Madam also said,

19
00:01:49,033 --> 00:01:53,219
how dare you girls bring a stranger to Mandarava Villa.

20
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,540
Chop off his legs now.

21
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,619
Sister You Cao, don't scare me.

22
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,039
Are you being serious?

23
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,879
A'Bi, don't let her scare you.

24
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,239
If Madam was at home,

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,099
Sister You Cao wouldn't be strolling leisurely around. Right?

26
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,719
Enough, both of you.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,999
Come. Follow me. We'll go meet our young miss.

28
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:18,060
Wait here, Young Master. We'll be back soon.

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,140
Sisters! Didn't you say you were going to answer nature's call?

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,599
How can you just leave like that?

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
But the camellia flowers here are really beautiful.

32
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,719
Some time ago, he was practicing the Dog Beating Staff Technique.

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,319
I'm sure he's planning to meet someone from the Beggars' Sect.

34
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,619
Then, how long will he be gone for this time?

35
00:02:44,619 --> 00:02:46,360
I'm not sure.

36
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,559
But he said that he would make a trip to Zhenla.

37
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,699
I think he may even go to Luoyang to meet someone from the Beggars' Sect.

38
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,479
Don't worry, Miss Wang. Brother Deng is with him.

The Dog Beating Staff Technique

40
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,540
and the Eighteen Subduing Dragon Palms are the secret techniques

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,960
of the Beggars' Sect. They don't pass them on to others.

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,819
Even if we combine

43
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,439
the techniques of Huanshi Library and Langhuan Jade Cave,

44
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,720
we can't replicate them at all.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,599
We can't even transfer energy from one to another.

46
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,679
Did you pass on the message that I asked to you?

47
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:16,559
Yes, I did.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,739
But he said this Dog Beating Staff Technique is created by man.

49
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:23,280
He's sure that he can figure it out.

50
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,320
Even if he can, it'll take him eight to ten years.

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,959
He will not be able to figure it out in such a short while.

52
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,540
When will he come back?

53
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,499
Ask him to come and see me as soon as he can.

54
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,479
Even if he has learned the ultimate techniques of the Beggars' Sect, he mustn't be arrogant.

Yes.

68
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,439
I was only looking around your camellia flower garden.

69
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,939
And I accidentally stumbled here. Please forgive me.

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,140

No, I...

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,619

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,720
All right.

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,400
No, I can't. Sister Deity.

- Madam is back.
- What?

80
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,519
- Madam is back?
- Stop talking.

81
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,639
- Let's go now.
- Sister Deity.

82
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,639
Listen to me.

83
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,999
- Miss, let's go.

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,459
- We have to go now.
- I've been following your instructions every day.
- Young Master Duan.

87
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,620
- We'll die if we don't leave now.
- Sister Diety!

88
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,039
- Let's go now.
- Listen to me!

89
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,599
- I have much to tell you.
- Just go. Young Master Duan.

90

How dare you trespass into Mandarava Villa.

94
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:32,879
I am Duan Yu. I only came here to seek shelter.

95
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,020
I didn't mean to trespass.

96
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,580
Please forgive me.

97
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,720
Your surname is Duan?

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,420
Yes.

99
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,840
Madam, we came here for shelter because we were being chased by an enemy.

100
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,340
It's not his fault.

101
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,780
A'Bi and I made the decision to bring him here.

102
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,599
Please forgive us.

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,360
Deceiving words.

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,159
Later, chop off both of his legs,

105
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,458
gouge out his eyes and cut off his tongue.

106
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:20,680
As for both of you, I will cut off your hands, too.

107
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,980
Bring me the two male criminals.

108
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,200
You.

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,299
You are from Dali. Why do you deny it?

110
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:36,340
I'm from Yunnan.

111
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,599
It's more than 400 li from my town to Dali.

112
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,860
It's not a part of Dali.

113
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,300
You are considered a citizen of Dali as long as it's less than 500 li.

114
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,239
Guards. Bury him alive under my Mandarava flowers as fertilizer.

115
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,640
Yes, Madam!

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,400
Wait. What did I do wrong? Give me an explanation.

117
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,299
As long as you are a citizen of Dali or if your surname is Duan,

118
00:07:57,299 --> 00:08:00,399
you'll be buried alive in my hands.

119
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,519
Although you are not from Dali, you are from its neighboring country.

120
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,860
You'll receive the same punishment.

121
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,719
I'm not from Dali!

122
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,140
I'm not!

123
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,439
Absurd. I am from Dali. And my surname is Duan.

124
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,319
If you want to bury me alive, you better do it now.

125
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,920
Be patient.

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,700
It will be your turn soon.

127
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,399
What do you have to say for yourself?

128
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Please spare my life, Madam.

129
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,960
My father is an officer in the capital city. And I'm his only son.

130
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,459
Please spare my life.

131
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,119
If you need anything, just name it, and my father will grant it to you.

132
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,920
Spare your life?

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,660
That's not hard.

134
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,239
Go back today

135
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,199
and kill your wife at once.

136
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,000
Tomorrow, marry the girl who you have been meeting in private.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Give her the proper wedding she deserves.

138
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,200
There's no grudge between us.

139
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Why do you have to force me to kill my wife and marry another?

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
Since you already have a wife,

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,400
why do you still involve yourself with other women?

142
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,100
Since you tricked another woman with your deceiving words,

143
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
you should take her as your wife.

144
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,200
Drag him out.

145
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes, Madam!

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Spare my life, Madam.

147
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
Please spare me, Madam!

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
Madam!

149
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Please spare my life, Madam!

150
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
This is outrageous.

151
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,500
Silence!

152
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,700
Miss! This is bad.

153
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,600
- What happened?
- When AZhu and ÁBi were leaving, they ran into Madam.

154
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
They were all taken to the main hall with the boy.

155
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,200
What should we do then?

156
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
A'Zhu and A'Bi are my cousin's servants.

157
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,400
How will he treat me

158
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,400
if my mother actually punishes them?

159
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,000
You said that I know nothing about camellias.

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,100
But my villa is full of these flowers.

161
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,600
They are lush and abundant.

162
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,600
How could you say that I know nothing about camellias?

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,700
Those are just wild camellia.

164
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,200
Of course, they would grow well even in a harsh environment.

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Take these white camellia flowers, for example.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If an amateur like you can grow them well,

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
I'll change my surname.

168
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,600
Are you saying that you are an expert in flowers?

169
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
It's such a waste for a person like you

170
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,000
to own such precious flowers.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Madam Wang, let me ask you.

172
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,400
Do you know the name of these two white camellia flowers?

173
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,800
They are both called Full Moon.

174
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
You are wrong.

175
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,400
You are totally wrong.

176
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
You can't even recognize the flower.

177
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,800
How can you call yourself an expert?

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,700
One is called Beauty Dressed in Mourning White.

179
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,700
And the other one is called Variegata di Bologna.

180
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,400
Variegata di Bologna?

181
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,000
This name sounds so strange.

182
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,700
Madam Wang, if you want to learn from me,

183
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,800
you'll have to show your sincerity.

184
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
If you want to interrogate me with torture,

185
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,200
go ahead and chop off my legs first.

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
And then, you can ask me.

187
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
That's easy.

188
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
Chop off his legs.

189
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,600
No.

190
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,400
He's a headstrong person.

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,000
If you really hurt him,

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
he'll keep his mouth shut.

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Madam, it's rare to find a flower expert like him.

194
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
It's a waste to kill him.

195
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
Fine. You You.

196
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,000
Tell the kitchen to treat Young Master Duan well.

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,600
If he can impart me valuable knowledge,

198
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,200
we'll treat him well.

199
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,700
But if you can't do that...

200
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Come with me.

201
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Young Master Duan, your Dali Kingdom has many camellia flowers.

202
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,400
But compared with those flowers to mine,

203
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,200
I'm certain my flowers are no less beautiful.

204
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
People of Dali don't plant

205
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,000
these sort of wild camellia flowers.

206
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,400
How dare you say that these are just wildflowers.

207
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,800
How very bold of you.

208
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
Please calm down, Madam.

209
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,200
These flowers are growing in Jiangnan, and they are not properly taken care of.

210
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,600
So, of course, there are only a few colors that blossom here.

211
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,400
That is why they look cheap.

212
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,800
In Dali, there's a kind of camellia called Eighteen Scholars.

213
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,400
Have you heard about it before?

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,200
For this "Eighteen Scholars,"

215
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
a single stalk can have up to 18 flowers on them.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,600
And each flower is in a different color.

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,100
There won't be any mixed colors.

218
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,000
And the shape of those 18 flowers

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,300
will all be different too.

220
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,400
They are each beautiful in their own way.

221
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
They'll bloom together, and they'll wilt together.

222
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,200
Have you seen it before?

223
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
And one species even better than that

224
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,800
is called the Thirteen Princes.

225
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,000
Following that are the Eight Immortals, Maid from Heaven,

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,200
Three Musketeers, and the Two Qiao's.

227
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,700
The blossoms must be pure in color.

228
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,200
If the blossom is mixed with other colors,

229
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,700
it'll lose its value.

230
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Why has he never told me about this before?

231
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,100
Madam, these flowers are rare species, to begin with.

232
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,000
If they were growing under the Nineteen Peaks of Cang Mountain in Dali,

233
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,400
they would certainly blossom splendidly.

234
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,600
But Jiangnan is a humid place.

235
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,800
If you have an expert to take of them,

236
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm sure they'll be able to bloom to their full potential.

237
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,100
So are you saying that you are that flower expert?

238
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,719
How do you think, Madam? Do you think I'm qualified?

239
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,000
You really opened my eyes when you told me

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,900
about the types of camellias just now.

241
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Before this, I had thought both of these white camellias were both called Full Moon.

242
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,400
I had no idea that one was actually called Variegata di Bologna

243
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,600
and the other one was called Beauty Dressed in Mourning White.

244
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,600
But, how do you differentiate them?

245
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
Please enlighten me.

246
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,400
Madam. A white blossom with black speckled spots on it is called the Full Moon.

247
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
The black spots represent the craters on the moon.

248
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If the white blossom

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,800
has two black spots in the shape of an olive pit,

250
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,600
it's called the Bewitching Eyes.

251
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,200
That's a good name.

252
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
White blossoms with red spots on their petals

253
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,600
are called Variegata di Bologna.

254
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,200
If the white petals have strokes of red and green,

255
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
then it is the Beauty Dressed in Mourning White.

256
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,400
But if there are too many red stripes,

257
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
then it's another different kind.

258
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,300
Think about it.

259
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,100
A beauty must be quiet and gentle like yourself.

260
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,200
How would they scratch their own face to make them ugly?

261
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
The bird must have accidentally scratched her face

262
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,600
when it was playing with the flowers.

263
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
That is why it has to have a shade of green in it too.

264
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,600
The green represents the green parrot.

265
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,800
But if it's full of red stripes,

266
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
that means it fights with others every day.

267
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,800
How can it be deemed a beauty then?

268
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,800
You are mocking me!

269
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,500
Madam, I wouldn't dare.

270
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,600
May I ask how did I offend you?

271
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
I don't know who told you about my stories

272
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,200
that called for such humiliating words from you.

273
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,800
Who said that women who know martial arts

274
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
can't be beautiful?

275
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,100
What's so good about being quiet and gentle?

276
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Madam, I was only speaking from the general point of view.

277
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,500
I'm sure that there are

278
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,200
many beautiful and gentle women.

279
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,600
Are you saying that I'm not gentle or proper?

280
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,200
You know yourself best, Madam.

281
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,500
I can't possibly judge you.

282
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,100
But you forced someone to kill his wife and marry another.

283
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,000
A proper and kind person would certainly not do such a thing.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,800
Duan Yu.

285
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,700
You are from Dali. And your surname is Duan.

286
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,000
I should've killed you early on.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,600
I'll spare you for now.

288
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,500
You'll be tasked with taking care of all the flowers in this villa.

289
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,400
If one is dead, I'll chop off your hand.

290
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,700
If two are dead, I'll chop off both of your hands.

291
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,600
What if every flower stays alive?

292
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
If all of them stay alive,

293
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I want you to grow me other types of camellia.

294
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,000
For instance, Eighteen Scholars,

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,600
Thirteen Princes, Eight Immortals,

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,800
Maid from Heaven, Three Musketeers,

297
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,200
and the Two Qiao's.

298
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,000
I want one of each type.

299
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,600
If you can't do that,

300
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,800
I'll gouge out your eyes.

301
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
These types of flowers are rare, even in Dali.

302
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,100
How can I find them easily in Jiangnan?

303
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,300
I think you better kill me now.

304
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,800
You want to chop off my hands and gouge out my eyes.

305
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
What torture.

306
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
It seems you would prefer to die, after all!

307
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
This is a good place

308
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,400
to grow this rare breed of flowers.

309
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Xiao Ming. You said you overheard

310
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,100
some news about him?

311
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,000
A few days ago, Madam ran into Second Young Master Gong Ye.

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,400
He said that Young Master Murong went to the Shaolin Temple on Song Mountain.

313
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
Why did he go there?

314
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
Second Young Master Gong Ye said

315
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,600
an old monk from Shaolin Temple died in Dali.

316
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,700
They are accusing the Murong clan of murdering him.

317
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,100
So they want an explanation from Young Master Murong.

318
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,200
If he can't convince them otherwise,

319
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,300
are they going to retaliate?

320
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,200
Since she has found out about this,

321
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,900
why did she come back?

322
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,500
Why didn't she go to help him?

323
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm not sure, Miss.

324
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,000
I think it's because Madam doesn't like him.

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,600
Even if she doesn't like him,

326
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,800
he is still one of our own.

327
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
If the Murong clan is humiliated,

328
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
it won't be good for the Wang family either.

329
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,900
Who planted camellia here?

330
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Sister Deity.

331
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
- You...
- We agreed on three years.

332
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,800
But we meet again today.

333
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,000
Get up now.

334
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Sister Deity, ever since I became your disciple in the rock cave that day,

335
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,300
I already feel very fortunate.

336
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,100
I never thought that I would be able to see your true looks with my very own eyes today.

337
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,600
Deities do actually exist.

338
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,900
Didn't you say that my mother pardoned him?

339
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,400
Why is he still here?

340
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,800
He said that he knows how to take care of camellia.

341
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
And Madam believes in his nonsense.

342
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
So she had him stay and become a gardener.

343
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,100
Silly scholar. Did you overhear us just now?

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,400
My name is Duan Yu.

345
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,900
I am from Dali.

346
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,200
I'm not a silly scholar.

347
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,800
I accidentally overheard your conversation just now.

348
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,900
But don't worry.

349
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,200
I won't tell anyone about what I heard.

350
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,900
Don't call me your sister.

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,400
If I can't address you as Sister Deity,

352
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
how should I address you then?

353
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,400
My surname is Wang.

354
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
You can call me Miss Wang.

355
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
No, that won't do.

356
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
There are many ladies with the surname Wang in this world.

357
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,600
But you are like a deity.

358
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,000
How can I just address you as Miss Wang?

359
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,100
You are lucky that my mother didn't chop off your legs.

360
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,800
You better get back to your flowers.

361
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Stop chatting with me.

362
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,900
I still have important issues to discuss with her.

363
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,500
Sister Deity.

364
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,800
Shaolin Temple is a respectable organization in the pugilist world.

365
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
There are a lot of skillful monks in the temple.

366
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,900
Most of them can perform the Shaolin 72 Secret Arts.

367
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,400
Reverend Xuan Bei from Shaolin Temple was killed by an enemy

368
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,800
in the Shenjie Monastery of Luliangzhou.

369
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,400
All the monks think that the Murong clan is behind it.

370
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I think it is a bad idea for Young Master Murong

371
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
to risk himself like this.

372
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,800
How do you know about these things?

373
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,100
Have you met my cousin before?

374
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,400
I've never met Young Master Murong before.

375
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
But I've heard some things about him concerning

376
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,900
Reverend Xuan Bei.

377
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,000
If you want to find out more,

378
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,700
how about...

379
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,300
Why don't we... Why don't we find a place in private

380
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,500
so that I can give you a more detailed report?

381
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,500
The waterway is indeed complicated.

382
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,800
My head is dizzy from it.

383
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
Is there anybody inside?

384
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,600
Please announce our arrival.

385
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,400
I am Qiao Feng from the Beggars' Sect.

386
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
I would like to meet Young Master Murong.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,100
I have important things to discuss with him.

388
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
There's no need to be so civil.

389
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,900
Let's just head inside and capture him.

390
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,100
You have great sword skills.

391
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,200
But why did you interfere?

392
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,000
I heard Chief Qiao from Beggars' Sect

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,500
has extraordinary martial arts skills.

394
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,600
It looks like the rumor is true.

395
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,500
You are too kind, Senior.

396
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,800
May I ask for your name?

397
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,000
And who are you to Young Master Murong?

398
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,200
I am the adviser to the Tibetan ruler, Jiu Mozhi.

399
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Young Master Murong's father

400
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
was a dear friend of mine.

401
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,100
Now, my friend is dead,

402
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,000
and the young master is not here either.

403
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,900
I've been waiting for days.

404
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,800
It's time for me to leave.

405
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,600
Everybody loves beautiful flowers and women.

406
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,500
Back then, Li Bai used peony

407
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,400
to describe Consort Yang's beauty.

408
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,300
But while peonies are beautiful,

409
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,200
they don't cry, pout, or smile.

410
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,500
It's far from being a real beauty.

411
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,600
You always say that I'm beautiful.

412
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know if you are telling the truth.

413
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,200
You are a ravishing beauty.

414
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,400
Has no one ever complimented you on your beautiful looks?

415
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,000
In this Mandarava Villa,

416
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,600
besides my mother, there are only other maids and female servants.

417
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,800
They only know me as their young mistress.

418
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,200
They don't care about my looks.

419
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
What about the people outside?

420
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,900
When they see such a beautiful girl who looks like a deity,

421
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,000
shouldn't they compliment you and bow to you?

422
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,600
I've never been outside before.

423
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,000
My mother doesn't allow me to leave.

424
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,200
What about Young Master Murong?

425
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Has Young Master Murong never complimented you for your looks?

426
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,100
He... He is often busy.

427
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,800
He doesn't have much free time.

428
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,400
When we were together, we would either discuss martial arts

429
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
or the issues of the country.

430
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,200
I... I hate martial arts.

431
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
What a coincidence.

432
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,300
I hate martial arts, too. When I was home,

433
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,600
my uncle and my father forced me to learn it.

434
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
I refused. So I left home.

435
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
I only read those books and scriptures

436
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,400
to spend more time with him.

437
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,800
If he doesn't understand something,

438
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I can explain it to him.

439
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,400
Why do you have to do that?

440
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Can't he read them himself?

441
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,200
He is my cousin.

442
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,000
We rarely have visitors.

443
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,600
Ever since my uncle passed away,

444
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,000
things have been tense between my mother and my aunt.

445
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,300
Even my cousin is no longer allowed to visit.

446
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,000
What about your father?

447
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,500
My father passed away a long time ago.

448
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,200
I've never met him.

449
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,200
Chief, we've asked some of the servants.

450
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,900
They said that it had been months since Murong Fu left.

451
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
And he has yet to return since.

452
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,300
Chief, the waterway in this area is well-developed and complex.

453
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,200
If Murong Fu really wants to hide from us,

454
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,500
it'll be hard for us to find him in a short amount of time.

455
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,900
The Murong clan has a reputation to uphold.

456
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,600
Even if he was involved in Brother Ma's incident,

457
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,000
he has no reason to hide.

458
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,000
Branch Leader Quan also said

459
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,700
that Reverend Xuan Bei from Shaolin Temple

460
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,000
was killed by the technique that he was famous for.

461
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,200
Now, Shaolin Temple

462
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
is suspecting that Murong Fu is behind the incident as well.

463
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,000
Well, I hope that Murong Fu

464
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,800
is a responsible man who dares to own up to his actions, as you said, Chief.

465
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,000
And not a coward who hides and cowers.

466
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
That would make him laughing stock.

467
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,500
I hope so too.

468
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,400
I want to pay a visit to Shaolin Temple

469
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
to check on Reverend Xuan Bei

470
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,800
and hear their thoughts on this matter.

471
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,700
Miss, I still don't know your name.

472
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,200
My name is Wang Yuyan.

473
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
Wang Yuyan?

474
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,000
Wang.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,300
Yu.

476
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,200
Yan.

477
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,700
These are the words.

478
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,400
A wonderful name.

479
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,200
You are kind, gentle, and amiable.

480
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,800
I'll remember such a beautiful name.

481
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,800
Of course, it's better to have a good name.

482
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,400
Your name is Duan Yu. Do you have a good reputation?

483
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,900
- I think you are just fishing for fame...
- "Fishing" Yu.

484
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,600
If I can see you smile like this every day,

485
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,100
I will not ask for anything else in this world.

486
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,500
He is always very serious and proper.

487
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,179
He would never talk about silly topics with me.

488
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,660
He is a descendant of the royal family, Murong, of the late Yan state.

489
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,860
But hundreds of years have passed since then.

490
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,880
Why does he still have to cling to such matters?

491
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,759
Wouldn't it be better for him to live his life freely like a commoner?

492
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,560
He always treats me like his little sister.

493
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,300
He thinks that besides studying and martial arts,

494
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,460
I know nothing else.

495
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,700
He doesn't even know that I only studied those books for his sake.

496
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,920
That I only memorized those martial arts techniques for him.

497
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,920
If it wasn't for him,

498
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,100
I would rather play musical instruments

499
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,980
and write calligraphy.

500
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,159
Does he really not know that you have done all of this for his sake?

501
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,080
Of course, he knows that I treat him well.

502
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,380
He treats me very well, too.

503
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,659
But our relationship is merely like a relationship between siblings.

504
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:56,020
All right. We've chatted so much.

505
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,980
But we haven't gotten to the point yet.

506
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,100
Why is Shaolin Temple faulting him for what happened?

507
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,719
The abbot of Shaolin Temple is known as Abbot Xuan Ci.

508
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,159
He has a junior called Xuan Bei.

509
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:12,399
Reverend Xuan Bei is an expert in the Vajra technique.

510
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,399
When he went to our Dali, he was killed by an enemy.

511
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,899
And he was killed by the very technique that he was most skilled in.

512
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:25,459
That is why everyone is saying that the culprit must be the Murong clan, who knows the technique.

513
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,140
A technique called...

514
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,700
"Fight fire with fire."

515
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,160
What you said makes sense.

516
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,220
But this is a difficult technique to master.

517
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,140
I don't think he knows how.

518
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,640
But don't tell him about this.

519
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,379
If he hears this, he'll be furious.

520
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,180
This is terrible!

521
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,599
Miss, Madam has given orders

522
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,319
to cut off the right hands of A'Zhu and A'Bi

523
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:56,019
as punishment for trespassing into Mandarava Villa.

524
00:30:56,019 --> 00:31:00,079
What should we do, Miss Wang? We need to think of a way to save them.

525
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:00,920
Where are they?

526
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,820
They've been sent to the fertilizer room already.

527
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,519
I begged Madam Yan to hold on for now.

528
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:08,220
It's still not too late for us to beg Madam Wang to change her mind.

529
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,020
Miss Wang!

530
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,860
Mother!

531
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,480
Are you here to talk about the girls from the Murong clan?

532
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
If you are, save your breath.

533
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,939
Mother, A'Zhu and A'Bi didn't come here on purpose this time.

534
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:37,380
Please forgive them.

535
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
They didn't come here on purpose?

536
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,900
You are afraid that your cousin

537
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,780
will treat you coldly if I cut off their hands, right?

538
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,339
Mother, my cousin is your nephew.

539
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,759
Why do you hate him so much?

540
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,200
Even if my aunt offended you,

541
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,220
you don't have to hate my cousin so much.

542
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,620
How do you know that your aunt offended me?

543
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,060
You hate her family so much.

544
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,040
Of course, it makes sense to think that she must have offended you somehow.

545
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,179
You have never allowed me to leave the villa either.

546
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:16,979
And neither do you allow outsiders to visit this place.

547
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:19,740
I don't know the reason.

548
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,140
My aunt has already passed away.

549
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,680
Why do you have to hold a grudge against her?

550
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,619
Actually, I'm doing this for your own good.

551
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:31,980
There are too many evil people in this world right now.

552
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,359
You are still young.

553
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,879
It's best to stay away from those people.

554
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,939
We have a new gardener.

555
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:42,079
He has a slick tongue. He's not a good man.

556
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:44,540
Don't talk to him. If he talks to you,

557
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,279
ask your maid to kill him at once.

558
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,060
Don't talk to him. I can see

559
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,300
that you are a kind and loving person.

560
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,939
You'll be easily taken advantage of.

561
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,499
Go on now.

562
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:06,759
Mother, please spare A'Zhu and A'Bi this once.

563
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:11,419
You can order them not to come back anymore no matter the reason.

564
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:14,819
I've never taken back my words.

565
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:17,180
It's pointless for you to beg me.

566
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,400
I know why you hate my aunt and cousin.

567
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,460
Yan'er, what do you know? Tell me.

568
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,259
She blamed you for killing without reason.

569
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,179
You offended the local government as well as many people in the pugilist world.

570
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:49,759
That is the Wang famils'y business.

571
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,040
It has nothing to do with the Murong clan.

572
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,739
The Murong clan has been dreaming of restoring Yan for over the past hundreds of years.

573
00:33:56,739 --> 00:34:00,419
They want to convince those martial arts experts to work for the Murong clan.

574
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:07,439
Unfortunately, they've even offended the Beggars' Sect and Shaolin now.

575
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:10,579
My cousin definitely did not kill Reverend Xuan Bei from Shaolin.

576
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,619
- He doesn't even know...
- Those girls came to tell us about this

577
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,220
because they want me to help him.

578
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,080
Murong Fu is going to Shaolin with Deng Baichuan.

579
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,899
What's the use of that?

580
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,500
They've overestimated themselves.

581
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,600
Mother, please think of a way to save him.

582
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,219
Your aunt once said this, didn't she?

583
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:34,039
That their literature collection in their Huanshi Library is superior to those in our Langhuan Jade Cave.

584
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,220
Fine. Then let her son

585
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,940
prove his worth in Shaolin Temple.

586
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,070
- Mother, my cousin...
- Leave now.

587
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,360
Mother, cousin—

588
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,160
You are becoming more and more unbridled. Leave.

589
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,370
Miss, what's wrong?

590
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,480
Don't talk to me.

591
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,119
Miss Wang, even if Madam Wang refuses to change her mind,

592
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,679
we have to think of a way to save them.

593
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,380
I can't save A'Zhu and A'Bi.

594
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,720
My cousin is in danger, but she won't help either.

595
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,979
Miss Wang, you know a lot of martial arts skills.

596
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:43,279
Have you never thought about sneaking out to save him yourself?

597
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,499
I do know a lot of martial arts skills.

598
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:49,339
But it's all theoretical. I don't know how to use them.

599
00:35:49,339 --> 00:35:54,120
Besides, how will I be able to save him? My mother would never allow me to leave.

600
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,340
Of course, your mother won't allow you to do that.

601
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,800
But you can sneak out, can't you?

602
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,040
I ran away from home in secret once.

603
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,879
When I went home, my parents didn't do anything to me.

604
00:36:08,879 --> 00:36:11,080
You are right.

605
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,419
I can sneak out to help him.

606
00:36:17,419 --> 00:36:22,759
Even if she scolds me after I come back, it doesn't matter.

607
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:25,820
But... I don't know martial arts.

608
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,400
If he does encounter a dangerous enemy,

609
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,939
I'm afraid I won't be able to help him.

610
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,680
How can you say that?

611
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,860
You know so many things about martial arts.

612
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,119
When he is fighting, you can give him pointers and guidance.

613
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,460
It'll be a great help to him.

614
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,380
A bystander sees through things better.

615
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,060
But...

616
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,639
I've never left this place before.

617
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,279
I don't know where Shaolin Temple is either.

618
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,020
Don't worry, Miss Wang.

619
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,260
If anything happens along the way,

620
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,880
I'll take care of it.

621
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,799
Miss Wang, stop hesitating.

622
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:05,799
Think about it.

623
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,619
If they really cut off Sister A'Zhu's and Sister A'Bi's hands,

624
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:11,320
your cousin will blame you.

625
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,911
You'll stay here forever and never get to see him again.

626
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:16,880
I can't let that happen!

627
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,200
Come with me.

628
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,400
Help!

629
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,280
Help...

630
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,600
Madam Yan, let go of us.

631
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,660
Or else, Young Master will surely teach you a lesson when he returns.

632
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,260
- Just you wait.
- I'll go first.

633
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,919
Madam Yan!

634
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,639
My mother said that she has something important to ask them.

635
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,680
She asked you to let go of them first.

636
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,999
I'll get a confirmation from Madam first then.

637
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:09,080
Miss, sorry about this.

638
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,219
Stop! What are you doing?

639
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:13,280
You trespassed into Mandarava Villa.

640
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,080
I'll tie you up and chop you up together with them to be made into fertilizer!

641
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,320
Young Master Duan, no!

642
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,580
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

643
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,919
Miss Wang. Young Master Duan. Thank you for your help.

644
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,300
Enough. Let's go.

645
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,839
Miss, you can't leave!

646
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:02,540
The madam from the Murong clan said that your mother was unfaithful...

647
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,960
You are so noisy.

648
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,380
Let's go.

649
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,220
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,840
Miss Wang, why don't you leave with us?

651
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,919
Madam will punish you anyway when you return.

652
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,860
It would be better for you to leave with us.

653
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,359
Yes, Miss Wang. Come with us.

654
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,339
Why did you learn the despicable

655
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,340
Great Energy Dissolving Skill?

656
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,099
It's not the Great Energy Dissolving Skill.

657
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:33,099
It's called the Six Solar Snow-Melt Skill.

658
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:34,879
It's derived from the One-Finger Death Touch

659
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,659
and Six Pulse Excalibur techniques of the Duan family.

660
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:38,920
It's different from the Great Energy Dissolving Skill.

661
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,620
One is good and the other is evil. They are not the same at all.

662
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,099
I apologize. I was ignorant.

663
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:47,599
I know of the Duan clan from Dali's One-Finger Death Touch and Six Pulse Excalibur.

664
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:50,639
But this is my first time hearing

665
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,220
about the Six Solar Snow-Melt Skill.

666
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,140
I'll have to learn more from you.

667
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,379
Miss Wang, Young Master Duan. Let's go now.

668
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:59,300
- Or else, it'll be too late.
- Come on. Let's go!

669
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,780
Look. The light ahead is the Swallow's Nest.

670
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,900
Miss Wang, it's over there.

671
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:24,480
In this life, I'm afraid there will be no other sights like this.

672
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,019
With the very people here tonight at this very moment with this very view.

673
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:35,239
On this lake, how nice will it be if we can never reach the light

674
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:37,280
on the opposite bank.

675
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:43,900
Young Master Duan, you are dreaming of the impossible again.

676
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:53,760
♫ It turns to beautiful colors ♫

677
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,320
Miss, don't worry.

678
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,159
Young Master has always been able to turn things around.

679
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,080
He has never been in any real trouble.

680
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:07,040
Shaolin Temple has upheld their reputation for centuries.

681
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,240
They are a force to be reckoned with.

682
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,540
I hope that the monks will be rational and are willing to listen to him.

683
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,799
I'm just worried that he'll get into a fight with them

684
00:41:17,799 --> 00:41:20,900
because of his temper.

685
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,259
Every time I wish upon a shooting star, it never works.

686
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,439
Miss Wang must be wishing for Young Master Murong

687
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,600
to be safe and sound and a safe journey ahead.

688
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:44,350
Is there a young girl in this world who would secretly wish for me the way Miss Wang does?

689
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,800
Reverend Xuan Bei died of his own famous technique.

690
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,820
Today, we asked Young Master Murong to come here so that we can ask what exactly happened.

691
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:07,190
Junior was killed on the 28th.

692
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:13,160
I would like to know, on that day, were you in Dali?

693
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,730
On the day, he was harmed, I wasn't at Dali.

694
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,530
Then where were you?

695
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,930
And who do you have to testify for you?

696
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,200
I had something to do that day.

697
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,590
As for where I was, I cannot tell you.

698
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,600
That I wasn't in Dali.

699
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,240
This, Brother Deng, Deng Bai Chuan, can testify for me, who was travelling with me.

700
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,200
If you are innocent, then why must you hide it from us?

701
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,690
Plus, Deng Bai Chuan belongs to the Murong Clan.

00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,530
How can we trust his words?

703
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,730
Reverend, aren't your words a little bit unreasonable?

704
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,620
You are all educated,

705
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,560
how many of you would dare to say that everything

706
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,140
can be said to other people?

707
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:24,360
♫ In this life, no matter who is laughing at me ♫

708
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:28,500
♫ I will not go mad or be unreasonable ♫

709
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:33,020
♫ I have crossed seas and mountains of hardships ♫

710
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,880
♫ Everything has it's earnings ♫

711
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,430
♫ All the things that happened in the past are as clear as ink ♫

712
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:48,230
♫ I wait for it to run dry and then start to tint ♫

713
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:52,620
♫ All worldly desires are like mountains and valleys ♫

714
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,280
♫ Borrowing rain's tears as the water rushes out  ♫

715
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:00,430
♫ If you come across me in this life,
who cares if it's life or death in the end ♫

716
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,800
♫ I might as well become a river ♫

717
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,290
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

718
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:13,660
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

719
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:17,830
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

720
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:23,100
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

721
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,790
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

722
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:34,040
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

723
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:39,730
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

724
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:45,030
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

725
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,430
♫ As the sword laughs, many of your dreams are shattered ♫

726
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,970
♫ It's just a small story in the martial arts world ♫

727
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:57,040
♫ If you come across me in this life,
so what if I abandon all my riches ♫

728
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,520
♫ Where do I go to ask the rights and the wrongs,
the benefits and the losses, the empty and the colorful  ♫

729
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,030
♫ If you make it past, come back to find the cause ♫

730
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:18,830
♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫
