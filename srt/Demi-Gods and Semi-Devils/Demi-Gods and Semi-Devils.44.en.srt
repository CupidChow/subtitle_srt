[Episode 44]

14
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,220
Someone spared your life.

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,100
Yet you turned around and tried to kill them.

16
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,140
What kind of a hero are you?

17
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,160
And to think you share the same reputation as I do.

18
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,380
Young Master!

19
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,540
Young Master, are you all right?

20
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,760
Go away!

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,260
Cousin, don't!

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,280
Who's there?

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,239
- Senior.
- Do you have a son?

24
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,138
I've yet to marry. How would I have a son?

25
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,540
Then, do you have ancestors?

26
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,480
Of course, I do.

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,220
But I'm willing to take my life today.

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,340
What does that have to do with you?

29
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,000
A proud son of the Murong clan will not stand for these rude words of yours.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,460
Your great-great-grandfather had a son.

31
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,359
Your great grandfather, grandfather, and your father all had sons.

32
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,920
But you don't have a son.

33
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,180
What a hero the Murong clan of Yan was back then.

34
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,660
To think they have fallen so far and became a clan without an heir now.

35
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,900
You are right. My late father's dying wish was for me to restore Yan.

36
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,759
If I decided to take my life in a moment of recklessness,

37
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,340
the Murong clan would no longer have an heir.

38
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,640
How would the Murongs restore Yan then?

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,240
I was most foolish. You have enlightened me, Senior.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,819
I am indebted to you. I shall never forget this.

41
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,759
Never was anything achieved without sacrifices and hardship.

42
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,660
Emperor Gaozu of Han struggled in the battle of Baideng.

43
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,519
Emperor Gaozu of Tang suffered humiliating setbacks dealing with the Turks.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,700
If all of them had taken their lives because of minor setbacks,

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,799
then they would've all been selfish, narrow-minded men.

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,659
They would not have been able to build a nation.

47
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,260
You are worse than Goujian and Han Xin.
(T/N: Goujian was a king in the late Spring Autumn Period and Han Xin was a general in the Chu-Han warring period/early Han Dynasty)

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,400
You are simply ignorant and foolish.

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,580
I know my mistakes.

50
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,200
Get up.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,159
The Murong clan has always excelled in martial arts.

52
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,619
Can it really not compete with the Duan clan's Six Pulse Excalibur?

53
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,660
Watch closely.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
That was the Murong clan's Canhe Finger.

55
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,340
Who knows how many other remarkable skills the Murong clan have?

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,920
The Murong clan of Gusu couldn't have built their reputation of "fight fire with fire"

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,380
with such limited and poor skills, could it?

58
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,980
Hero Qiao, you have impressive skills.

59
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,420
I would like to exchange a few moves with you.

60
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,100
I don't dare to accept such high praise.

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,500
Benefactor?

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,880
Who are you?

63
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,959
For what purpose did you hide in Shaolin Temple for over 10 years?

64
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,000
That's my question.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,320
What is the reason you have for hiding yourself

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,180
in the Shaolin Temple for over 10 years?

67
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,319
I seek an item in the Shaolin Temple.

68
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,160
I seek an item in the Shaolin Temple as well.

69
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,420
However, I have found what I came for.

70
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:03,740
I'm sure that you must have found what you seek as well.

71
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,100
Otherwise, our battle would have been decided three moves earlier.

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,460
That's right.

73
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,919
You have impressive skills.

74
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,039
I have only ever seen a few as skilled as you in my life.

75
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,200
Do you wish to duel today?

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,340
I am impressed with your skills as well.

77
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,080
I think it would be hard to decide a winner in our battle.

78
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,919
In that case, I think there is no need for us to duel.

79
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,199
I think we should leave that to the younger ones instead.

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,480
Good idea.

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,280
I am here.

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,940
You now have a sect of your own.

83
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,460
You must stay on the path of righteousness from now on.

84
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,180
Disciplining and guiding your disciples well.

85
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,340
Do not let them commit evil and cause harm to the martial arts world.

86
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,360
That will be an act that allows you to accumulate blessings and good merits.

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,980
Practicing Buddhism in another place is the same as if you were in the temple.

88
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,340
Rules are rules. You will be expelled.

89
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,400
However, you are exempted from the beatings.

90
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,780
I had thought the Shaolin Temple prided itself on its discipline and rules

91
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,559
and enforced them with an iron hand.

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,440
But it seems I was mistaken.

93
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,339
The Lingjiu Palace is virtuous

94
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:35,020
and has always been revered by the rest of the world.

95
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,580
What? Is the Shaolin Temple trying to take advantage of the kind and fearing the strong today?

96
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,300
Are you going to play by double standards?

97
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,140
The Tibetan Adviser is right.

98
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,840
I understand.

99
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,379
Xu Zhu, you are still a disciple of the Shaolin Sect.

100
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,320
Accept your punishment.

101
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,640
I, Disciple Xu Zhu, have violated the rules and commandments.

102
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,220
I accept my punishment.

103
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,100
[Shaolin Temple]

104
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,439
- Out of my way.
- What's the matter?

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,640
Disciple Xu Zhu.

106
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,660
Do you have anything else to say?

107
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,180
No.

108
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,500
Disciplinary monks, execute the punishment.

109
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,280
Stop!

110
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,880
What is that on your back?

111
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,740
My son!

112
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,260
My son.

113
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,500
My son. My son.

114
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,160
You... Don't you recognize your own mother?

115
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,520
Mother?

116
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,460
You are my mother?

117
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,060
Yes.

118
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,360
I'm your mother.

119
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,420
My mother?

120
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,860
Shortly after I gave birth to you,

121
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:43,099
I left nine incense burn marks on your back and behind.

122
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:47,559
You... Are there nine incense burn marks on your behind?

123
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,180
Yes.

124
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,220
You are my mother...

125
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,580
I'm your mother.

126
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,139
My son. Does it hurt? Are you cold?

127
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,839
Quick. Put your clothes on.

128
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,800
You must be cold. It must have hurt.

129
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,319
My son. Call me "mother."

130
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,440
Come on.

131
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,460
Call me "mother."

132
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,140
Mother.

133
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,760
Mother.

134
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,500
Son.

135
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,240
Mother!

136
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:33,515
Mother!

137
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,780
I've finally found you.

138
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,860
For the past 24 years,

139
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,659
I've missed you day and night.

140
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,360
I resented.

141
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,700
I resented how others had children of their own.

142
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,740
But that man...

143
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,280
stole my child.

144
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,559
So I would often steal other people's children.

145
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,820
But how could someone else's child

146
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,160
- compare to one's own?
- Mother.

147
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,379
I've finally found you.

148
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,199
My son.

149
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,100
Third Sister, so this is the reason why you kept stealing other peoples' children.

150
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,139
Xu Zhu, listen up.

151
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,039
Your mother is my martial sister.

152
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:23,399
That makes me your uncle. Right?

153
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:26,330
No, no. That is not right.

154
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,920
Xu Zhu is your master's sworn brother.

155
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,060
You should call him Martial Uncle.

156
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,360
And I am his mother's martial brother.

157
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,319
Look. I am two generations above you.

158
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,120
You should call me "Grand Martial Uncle."

159
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,880
To heck with that!

160
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,680
He is my son.

161
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,560
I won't allow you to beat him.

162
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,980
Amitabha.

163
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,800
Monks, halt.

164
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,920
Who is that wretched thief that forced

165
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,359
a mother and a son for 24 years?

166
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,520
My son, we must find this bastard

167
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,760
even if we must go to the ends of the earth.

168
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,939
I may not be able to win against them.

169
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:22,599
But my son is skilled in martial arts.

170
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:25,720
You must avenge your mother!

171
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,700
Was your son stolen or taken away from you by force?

172
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,200
You...

173
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,200
Who are you?

174
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,239
How did you get those scars on your face?

175
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,620
Who are you?

176
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,219
How did you know?

177
00:13:09,219 --> 00:13:11,820
Don't you recognize me?

178
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,460
It's you.

179
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,740
It's you!

180
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,860
That's right. I took away your child.

181
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,779
I left those scars on your face.

182
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,039
You... Why did you do this to me?

183
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,919
You and I have no grudges between us. I don't even know you.

184
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,240
Why did you take my child away?

185
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,199
You have caused me so much pain

186
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,239
and torment for the past 24 years.

187
00:13:40,239 --> 00:13:43,739
Tell me. Tell me why!

188
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,580
Who is the father of that child?

189
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,340
He...

190
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,560
I... I can't tell.

191
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,480
I can't tell you!

192
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,320
Mother, who is my father?

193
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,380
I can't say it.

194
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,960
I can't tell you his name.

195
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,560
Second Madam Ye,

196
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,399
you used to be a beautiful, gentle, and dignified woman.

197
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,399
But when you were 18,

198
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,579
you were seduced by a man of powerful status

199
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:24,939
and skilled in martial arts.

200
00:14:24,939 --> 00:14:29,120
He claimed you, and you had his child.

201
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,220
Am I right?

202
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,899
Mother, is that true?

203
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,800
Yes...

204
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,639
No. No. No!

205
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,360
He never seduced me.

206
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,260
I seduced him! It was me!

207
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,479
That man cared only for his own fortune and reputation.

208
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:55,559
He didn't care about you at all, or about the hardships of a young and unwed woman with a child

209
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,719
would face in this world.

210
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,999
No. He cared.

211
00:15:02,999 --> 00:15:05,039
He gave me a lot of money

212
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,159
so that I could take care of myself for the rest of my life.

213
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,840
Then why did he let you stray along in the martial arts world?

214
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,880
That has nothing to do with him.

215
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,760
I couldn't marry him.

216
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,200
And he couldn't marry me.

217
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,019
He had always treated me well.

218
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,840
He is a good man!

219
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,880
I can't drag him down with me.

220
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,640
He is a good man.

221
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,440
Mother, who exactly is my father?

222
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,140
Second Madam Ye may be infamous for her misdeeds,

223
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,939
but she seems to be truly loyal and sincere to her past lover.

224
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:42,000
But I wonder who the man who abandoned her was.

225
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,419
That man must be a man of high status and skilled in martial arts.

226
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:47,299
That's why she can't reveal his identity.

227
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:49,920
The Four Evils went to Dali

228
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,340
and caused trouble for Prince Duan before.

229
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,200
Could it be...

230
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,379
I was involved with plenty of women.

231
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,459
As such, if I were indeed that man, why wouldn't I simply admit it?

232
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:07,040
Even if I were to lose all honor and reputation in the martial arts world,

233
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,680
I would never have let her suffer so.

234
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,260
The child's father is among us right here.

235
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,240
Why won't you point him out?

236
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,799
Mother, who is my father?

237
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,060
I...

238
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,379
I can't say it out loud!

239
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,940
Then, why did you leave 27 ring marks on this child?

240
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,020
Did you decide that he would become a monk the moment you gave birth to him?

241
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,479
No, that's not it!

242
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,000
Then, why did you leave those incense marks on his back?

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,260
I... I don't know.

244
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,519
I'm begging you.

245
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,479
I'm begging you. Don't ask any more questions!

246
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:01,179
I don't know anything! I don't know anything.

247
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,439
Mother. Mother.

248
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,199
If you won't tell them, I'll tell them for you.

249
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,319
This child's father is a disciple of a Buddhist temple.

250
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,259
And he is a revered senior monk.

251
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,460
My son.

252
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,420
Amitabha.

253
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Son, hurry and carry me down the mountain.

254
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,199
We won't take our revenge anymore today.

255
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,399
Quick, let's get away from here. Hurry!

256
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,340
Well, you may not want to anymore,

257
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,980
but I want my revenge.

258
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,260
Second Madam Ye, do you know why I took your child?

259
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,259
It is because someone else took my child away

260
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,160
and destroyed my family.

261
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,499
Your child was taken away from you as well?

262
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,320
You did this for revenge?

263
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,100
Correct.

264
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,859
I took away your child

265
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,319
and placed him in a vegetable garden inside Shaolin Temple.

266
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,099
I let him be raised and taught martial arts

267
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:18,819
by the monks and reverends.

268
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:22,179
Because someone took away my child

269
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:26,159
and raised him and taught him martial arts, too.

270
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,720
Do you want to see my true appearance?

271
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,860
[Xiao Yuanshan: Liao Kingdom, Chief Military Advisor]

272
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,419
- It's Qiao Feng.
- Why are there two of them?

273
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:11,779
- Yes. Why?
- No. It's not Qiao Feng.

274
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,339
This man looks much older than him.

275
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:15,819
But they look very alike.

276
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:18,699
If you don't look carefully, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

277
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,480
Could it be?

278
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
Could he be...

279
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,659
- You are my father.
- That's right.

280
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,740
I am your father.

281
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,499
We look so alike in both appearance and physique.

282
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:57,920
There is hardly any need to prove it.

283
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,720
Of course, I am your father.

284
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,279
All the men of Liao possess this mark.

285
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,960
Father.

286
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,080
30 years ago, outside the Yanmen Pass,

287
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,000
your mother was murdered.

288
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,420
Heartbroken and in despair,

289
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,120
I jumped off a cliff to commit suicide.

290
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,879
But I miraculously survived.

291
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,619
I fell on the branches of a tree at the bottom of the valley and lived.

292
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,260
After that, I lost my will to die

293
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,240
and gained a thirst for vengeance.

294
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,740
Those warriors of the Central Plains killed your harmless mother

295
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,260
without reason outside the Yanmen Pass.

296
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:40,820
Child, should one take revenge for this?

297
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,760
One must never forgive those who murder their parents.

298
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,660
How could one not avenge them?

299
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,000
I have eliminated a great majority of those

300
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,260
who had harmed your mother.

301
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:57,119
The late chief of the Beggars' Sect, Wang Jiantong, died of illness.

302
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:01,260
But that evil mastermind...

303
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,580
remains alive and well.

304
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,500
Child, what do you think we should do to this man?

305
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,580
Who is this person?

306
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,800
Who is that person?

307
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,719
I was the Chief Military Advisor of Liao's Shan Army back then.

308
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,840
I was regarded highly by Empress Dowager Xiao.

309
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,320
That day, your mother and I carried you in our arms.

310
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,220
We were headed to your grandmother's.

311
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,139
Right then, my subordinates informed me

312
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:49,319
that the Liao Emperor had believed in the calumny and was going to attack Song.

313
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,940
I felt that something was odd.

314
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,240
I rushed back to the capital to advise him against doing so,

315
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,180
but dozens of Song warriors showed up along the way

316
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,760
and killed your mother.

317
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,200
I don't know where they had heard rumors

318
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,660
that I was headed to Shaolin Temple to steal their martial arts scriptures.

319
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,820
They thought they had done a great service to Song.

320
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,200
Little did they know that their actions had caused

321
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,279
a war to rage incessantly between Liao and Song.

322
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,600
And the common folk suffered greatly.

323
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,440
For the past 30 years,

324
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,500
I have hidden in Shaolin Temple

325
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,260
and read all of your scriptures and texts.

326
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Monks and Reverends of Shaolin Temple.

327
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,900
Kill me today if you dare!

328
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,820
Otherwise, I will make sure

329
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,360
that your martial arts techniques be passed into the Liao Kingdom.

330
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,499
When that time comes, it'll be too late for you to plan an ambush

331
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:02,360
outside of Yanmen Pass.

332
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,620
That means that person who killed my mother

333
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,460
might have done it by mistake, instead of with intention.

334
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,640
But he killed my adoptive parents and framed me.

335
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,440
You're wrong, Feng'er.

336
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,600
I killed the Qiaos.

337
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,160
My adoptive parents raised me and treated me with kindness.

338
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,480
Why did you kill them?

339
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,760
Because you are my flesh and blood.

340
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,019
We had been living happily in peace together.

341
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:48,039
But those Song warriors forcefully

342
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,880
took you away from me without reason.

343
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,660
The Qiaos pretended to be your birth parents.

344
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,720
Not only did they steal my son and my joy,

345
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,899
but they refused to tell you the truth.

346
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,979
They deserved to die!

347
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:06,200
You were also the one who burned the Shan residence,

348
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,200
and killed Zhao Qiansun and Mrs. Tan.

349
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,960
That's right.

350
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,880
I killed all of them.

351
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,460
All of those people and these people here

352
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,200
knew who killed your mother.

353
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,519
But all of them refused to tell the truth.

354
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,279
They protected him. They defended him!

355
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,160
Do they not deserve to die?

356
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,860
The great evil that I had been searching for all this while

357
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,040
was my own father.

358
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,900
Reverend Xuan Ku of Shaolin Temple

359
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,580
personally taught me martial arts.

360
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,860
For ten long years, regardless of the seasons and weather.

361
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:54,440
It is thanks to his guidance that I am who I am today.

362
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,740
Why must you kill him?

363
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,600
The people of the Four Dynasties are all cunning and devious.

364
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,300
There are no kind people among them.

365
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,779
Among those who killed your mother

366
00:26:05,779 --> 00:26:08,580
were the chief of the Beggars' Sect

367
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,300
and the senior monks of Shaolin!

368
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,540
They only want to hide this bloody sin of theirs away for life!

369
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,459
They turned my son into a Han and made him worship his enemy as his teacher!

370
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:27,120
That night, after I hit Xuan Ku with a palm strike, I hid to the side.

371
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,060
Later, you entered the hall to see that bald mule.

372
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,560
The look of disbelief on his face

373
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,680
was laughable indeed.

374
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,910
So all of this had been the doing of Xiao Yuanshan.

375
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,100
It seems we have wrongly blamed Xiao Feng.

376
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,399
Father and Son are one. It's not wrong to blame the son for his father's misdeeds.

377
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,340
Besides, we don't even know for sure if he didn't do any evil.

378
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,760
I see.

379
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
It's no wonder that little monk

380
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,180
would mistake me for the murderer that day.

381
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,160
Do you know who the evil mastermind

382
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,820
that led the warriors of the Central Plains to ambush outside Yanmen Pass

383
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,380
was then, Father?

384
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,240
Of course.

385
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,540
Of course, I investigated the matter.

386
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,720
This man ruined my family.

387
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,260
It would've been too easy of a death for him

388
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,520
if I had killed him with a single palm strike.

389
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,600
Second Madam Ye.

390
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,779
Who is the father of this child?

391
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,319
If you won't tell, I'll tell them for you.

392
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,380
I have been hiding in Shaolin Temple for over 30 years.

393
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,340
There is nothing that can escape my eye.

394
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,780
You met in Ziyun Cave.

395
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,940
You had Granny Qiao deliver your baby.

396
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:11,200
Do you want me to reveal everything to the public?

397
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,260
All right.

398
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,640
No!

399
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Old Hero Xiao, I beg of you.

400
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,199
Please have mercy and spare him!

401
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:32,039
My son and your son are sworn brothers.

402
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,839
Please spare him. He is old and he holds a high status in the martial arts world.

403
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,699
Please come at me instead if you must.

404
00:28:39,699 --> 00:28:42,460
I beg of you.

405
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,300
Spare him, please!

406
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:47,899
- Old Hero Xiao!
- Mother!

407
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:51,959
Mother, come. Get up.

408
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,959
Very well. Very well.

409
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,940
Every cause has an effect.

410
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,460
Xu Zhu, come over here.

411
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:27,900
No. Don't...

412
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,840
Mother.

413
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,899
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

414
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,500
You've been living in the Shaolin Temple for 24 years.

415
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:02,800
And I never knew...

416
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,980
you were my son.

417
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,059
- What?
- What?
- Is this true?

418
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,440
He is the abbot's...

419
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,160
The abbot's son?

420
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,799
What's going on? How could this be?

421
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,020
- How could this be?
- What will happen now?

422
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,260
Old Hero Xiao.

423
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:55,140
You have been separated from your son for 30 years.

424
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:59,200
But you had long known that he had cultivated and mastered

425
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,279
great martial arts skills and \was regarded

426
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,440
as one of the greatest heroes in the martial arts world.

427
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,199
I'm sure you were most pleased and assured.

428
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,840
I saw my son every single day, yet I had never recognized him.

429
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,320
I had always thought that he had been taken away from me

430
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,440
and his whereabouts unknown.

431
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,240
I was troubled by this day and night for all these years.

432
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,579
Stop.

433
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:38,080
What is the use of saying all of that now?

434
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,040
Second Madam, I have made mistakes and sinned.

435
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,660
There is no use for regrets now.

436
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,020
And neither is there any use to keep it a secret any longer.

437
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,700
But I have...

438
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,520
caused you to suffer for all these years.

439
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,220
I did not suffer.

440
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,720
An unspeakable pain

441
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,220
is what causes the most suffering.

442
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,120
Old Mr. Murong!

443
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,640
At the battle outside the Yanmen Pass,

444
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,580
I've made grave mistakes.

445
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,960
And my brethren have lost their lives

446
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,640
to cover up for my mistakes.

447
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,920
Even if I die today, it would still be too late

448
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,560
to make up for my mistakes.

449
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,280
Old Master Murong!

450
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,480
That day, you faked a message.

451
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,800
You said Khitan warriors

452
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,299
were planning to attack Shaolin Temple to steal the martial arts scriptures,

453
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:12,120
and that led to all the mistakes and chaos today.

454
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,880
To this day,

455
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,420
do you feel even the slightest bit of regret in your heart?

456
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,560
So the root of all the evil deeds back then

457
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,980
was because of Murong Bo?

458
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Abbot is impressive indeed.

459
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,000
You actually recognized me.

460
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
[Gusu Swallow's Nest, Murong Bo]

461
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Father.

462
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
- Master!
- Master!

463
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,800
- Master.
- Master.

464
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,000
Father, you're alive.

465
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,100
Mr. Murong,

466
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,399
you and I have been acquaintances for many years.

467
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
I have always respected you and thought of you as a person of good character.

468
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,600
So I had never doubted you.

469
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,400
When you had mistakenly killed an innocent life,

470
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,400
I had meant to question you,

471
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,200
but I later received news that you had passed away of illness.

472
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
I thought you had mistakenly

473
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,400
believed the rumors and false information like I did.

474
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,700
And that regret drove you to die an early death.

475
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,800
But now, it seems that I was wrong.

476
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,000
So, Father delivered a fake message

477
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,700
to stir up conflict between the Song and the Liao.

478
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:04,400
So that he could take advantage of the situation and restore Yan.

479
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,100
Mr. Murong, the Murong clan of Gusu turned out

480
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,800
to be the direct descendants of the royal family of Yan.

481
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,600
But everything you strived so hard to achieve

482
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,400
proved to be a failure.

483
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,600
And cost the lives of many.

484
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,300
Planning is with man,

485
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,600
accomplishing is with Heaven.

486
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,200
In this case, you were the one

487
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
who took my younger martial brother, Xuan Bei's life as well.

488
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,700
You wanted to stir up conflict between the Shaolin Sect and the Duan clan of Dali,

489
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,400
so you killed him.

490
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,000
You had intended to use the Duan clan's One-finger Death Touch,

491
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,700
but you were not skilled enough.

492
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,230
So you had to resort to using the Murong clan's ultimate technique

493
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,200
and assassinated my younger martial brother.

494
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,400
Mr. Murong,

495
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,200
you will use anything and everything to get what you want.

496
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,000
You are most cruel and heartless indeed.

497
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,200
That is impressive, Abbot.

498
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,100
Unfortunately, you are observant and perceptive,

499
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,300
but you never managed to see the entire picture.

500
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,950
Brother Xiao and I have been hiding in your temple for many years.

501
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,600
Yet, you never noticed.

502
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,700
It is easy to understand others

503
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,000
but difficult to understand oneself.

504
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
It is difficult to overcome an enemy

505
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:27,500
but even harder to overcome one's own flaws.

506
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Abbot,

507
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,500
for the sake of our friendship,

508
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,800
I will speak the truth with you.

509
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,500
Is there anything else you would like to ask me?

510
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,800
Ma Dayuan was killed by his wife and Bai Shijing.

511
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Prince Duan said that Bai Shijing was killed by a masked man.

512
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,300
But I wonder if that masked man was you, Mr. Murong

513
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,100
or Old Mr. Xiao.

514
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,900
I killed Bai Shijing.

515
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,600
I despise traitors the most in my life.

516
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,000
That man betrayed my son first.

517
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,500
Of course, I could not let him live.

518
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,400
Stop!

519
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,900
Father!

520
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Shaolin Temple is a land of peace and benevolence.

521
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
It is not a place for you to settle personal feuds.

522
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Please do not barge into our temple without permission.

523
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,400
Amitabha.

524
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
That is not true.

525
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,600
Shaolin is no longer what it once was.

526
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,600
The Shaolin Temple now has become a place that houses illegitimate children.

527
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Amitabha.

528
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,800
I have broken the precepts of Buddhism.

529
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,000
I have sullied the name of Shaolin.

530
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Xuan Ji,

531
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,600
according to the rules of the temple,

532
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,400
how should he be punished?

533
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,000
This...

534
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
Martial Brother.

535
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,100
He shall be punished according to the rules.

536
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,800
Xu Zhu.

537
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,800
Come forth and receive your punishment.

538
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,500
Mother, I must accept my punishment.

539
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

540
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,200
Disciplinary monks,

541
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,800
punish Xu Zhu with 130 beatings.

542
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Yes, Abbot.

543
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,000
Xiao Yuanshan.

544
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,400
Will you and your son duel me together?

545
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,000
Or shall we have a one-on-one duel to the death?

546
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Old Thief Murong,

547
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,300
you and I have a deep grudge that will not be resolved until we die.

548
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,800
You have killed my wife and the mother of my son.

549
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,100
We, father and son, will now take your life.

550
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,800
Mr. Murong.

551
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,300
Mr. Murong.

552
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,700
Thanks to your guidance,

553
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,600
I was able to find the answers to the doubts I had.

554
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,800
And I am ever grateful to you for gifting me the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

555
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,100
That is but a small matter. You need not bring it up.

556
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,500
The Xiaos intend to claim my life today.

557
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,900
What is your take on this matter?

558
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,700
You and I are close friends. How can I stand aside and do nothing?

559
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,400
We will not stop until we take your life today.

560
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,600
Even if it costs our lives.

561
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,000
Abbot, his punishment has been served.

562
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,500
My son.

563
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,100
My son.

564
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,100
From this moment on, you will return to the secular.

565
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,500
And you are no longer a monk of the Shaolin Temple.

566
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,000
Mother, I'm fine.

♫ How will fate deal with me? ♫

592
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,800
No matter if it is Song or Liao, the people of both kingdoms

593
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,700
are all innocent, yet their families are being torn apart.

594
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,500
The two kingdoms have stopped fighting for nearly 10 years.

595
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,200
If the fighting starts again,

596
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,400
how many innocent people will be killed?

597
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
Wonderful, wonderful.

598
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,800
Mr. Xiao thinks of the people

599
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,200
and places them first.

600
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:54,400
They really have the heart of a Buddha.
