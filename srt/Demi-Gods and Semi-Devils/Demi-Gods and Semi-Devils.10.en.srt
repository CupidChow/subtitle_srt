00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,419
- I'm going to save Ling'er.
- All right.

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,320
Hey, Horse Face! Hold it right there!

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,119
You're the father of my master's wife?

18
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,039
You want to call yourself someone two generations above me?

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,199
Where are you going?

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,320
Come out and show yourself!

21
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,420
Where are you going, little girl?

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,020
What do you want?

23
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
Don't pull me.

00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,839
Bastard, let go of my daughter!

I'm going to kill you, Horse Face!

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,360
Let go of me! Let go of me!

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,400
Third Brother. Fourth Brother. Come out. Hurry up!

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,839
Big Brother said not to fight amongst yourselves!

29
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:29,999
Let go of me!

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
Let me hold you a while longer, little girl.

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,559
Let go of my daughter, bastard!

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,519
Young Master Duan.

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,759
Don't worry, Madam.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,340
Don't touch my sister, Zhong Ling!

35
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,360
You...

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,280
- Who are you?
- Come out!

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,719
What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing?

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,360
What are you doing?

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,600
Hurry up and let go of me!

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,480
Ling'er!

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,880
Ling'er! Ling'er!

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,159
Are you all right, Ling'er?

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm fine.

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,839
- Miss Ling'er.
- Are you all right?

45
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,159
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

46
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,119
- Ling'er!
- Something is not right here.

47
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,840
Let's retreat now.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,960
Brother Duan, just now, you said I'm your...

49
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,360
Brother Duan!

50
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,459
Your Majesty, a message from the crown prince's manor.

51
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:29,119
The crown prince's heir was suddenly possessed.

52
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,240
An imperial physician has already been sent.

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,519
Why was he possessed suddenly? What did the physician say?

54
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,359
Last night, someone took Young Master Duan to Wanjie Valley.

55
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,119
It was the crown prince who brought him back.

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,679
The physician said he is seriously ill.

57
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,000
He seems a little delirious.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,319
Head to Zhennan Manor now.

59
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,559
I am going to see Yu'er.

60
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,160
Yes.

61
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,640
Yu'er.

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,959
Yu'er.

63
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,199
Imperial Physician. Imperial Physician!

64
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,479
- Please spare me, Young Master Duan!
- I can't take it anymore!

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,540
- Please spare me, Young Master Duan!
- Help me!

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,520
Yu'er!

67
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,540
Yu'er.

68
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,479
Father.

69
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,099
- Yu'er.
- His Majesty is here.

70
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,840
I feel terrible, Mother...

71
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,260
Yu'er! What happened to you, Yu'er?

72
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,540
Uncle.

73
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,260
I'm dying.

74
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,200
Brother, the Nanhai Crocodile took Yu'er to Wanjie Valley last night.

75
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,119
But for some reason, he fainted all of a sudden.

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,399
The chief of Wanjie Valley brought him out.

77
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,899
I... I was the one who brought him back here.

78
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,839
However, once he woke up, he went berserk.

79
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,919
I believe Yu'er was poisoned in Wanjie Valley and the poison still lingers inside him.

80
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,179
Brother Chun, it's late now.

81
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,559
Hurry up and go to Shenjie Monastery with the two monks.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,920
I'll take care of Yu'er.

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,940
My son.

84
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,740
Understood.

85
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,479
Imperial Physician, how is his condition now?

86
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,499
Your Majesty, his pulse is beating vigorously.

87
00:06:12,499 --> 00:06:14,780
It seems the inner energy inside his body is overwhelmed.

88
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
Leave now.

89
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,840
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,240
Yu'er, have you met Ding Chunqiu from Xingxiu Sea?

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,620
Ding... Ding Chunqiu?

92
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,560
Yes.

93
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
This man is well-versed in strange and unusual martial arts,

94
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,479
namely, Great Energy Dissolving Skills.

95
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,260
It can dissolve one's inner energy

96
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,879
and destroy all of one's martial arts skills.

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,860
It is despised by all in the pugilistic world.

98
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,219
Since you have never met him, then why do you know this technique?

99
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,839
Uncle... I do not know.

100
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:14,159
This is the first time I have heard of Ding Chunqiu, that strange old man,

101
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:17,280
and the Great Energy Dissolving Skill.

102
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,980
It must be Crown Prince Yan Qing who learned this technique

103
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:31,520
and somehow transferred this skill to Yu'er.

104
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,520
So that he would unknowingly harm both me and Brother Chun.

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,620
It seems we can only seek help from the seniors.

106
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,700
Yu'er, I will bring you to the Tianlong Temple right now.

107
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:06,886
[Reverend Ku Rong, Tianlong Temple]

108
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:26,440
Amitabha.

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,400
The heir of Prince Zhennan was poisoned by a strange malevolence and has come to seek treatment.

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,759
Please offer us guidance, Elders.

111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,279
Even if the inner energy is slightly damaged,

112
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,719
it is still possible to master Six Pulse Excalibur.

113
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,620
Thank you, Elders.

114
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,819
Yu'er, the four elders are willing to exhaust their power to expel your poison.

115
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,760
Hurry, kneel and thank them now.

116
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,500
A formidable enemy is coming.

117
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,559
Yet Tianlong Temple is in a weakened state.

118
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,240
Is it worth sacrificing our power for his sake at a time like this?

119
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,800
I did not realize you were here, Reverend Ku Rong.

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,779
Sorry for being rude. My apologies.

121
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:28,039
Earlier, you mentioned that a formidable enemy is coming.

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,759
I wonder who that could be.

123
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,379
The meeting with Maha Cakra Vajra from Daxue Mountain is tomorrow.

124
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,319
Ben Yin, show him the letter.

125
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,820
"I had once discussed martial arts with Mr. Murong Bo.

126
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,780
Mr. Murong had high regard for the Six Pulse Excalibur technique,

127
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,080
which originated from your temple.

128
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,280
He was very regretful to not have a chance to study it.

129
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,759
Recently, I heard that Mr. Murong has passed away.

130
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,479
I'm in deep grief.

131
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,799
To repay my bosom friend,

132
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:17,180
I would like to ask for this scripture

133
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,239
and to burn it before Mr. Murong's grave.

134
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
I will come to collect it soon."

135
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,939
The Six Pulse Excalibur is the ultimate treasure of our temple,

136
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:32,440
the most prized scripture of the Duan family's martial arts.

137
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,799
With it reposing in this temple,

138
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,879
even Zheng Ming and Zheng Chun are unaware of it,

139
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,040
yet the one from the Murong Clan knew about this.

140
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,099
One who comes is sure with ill-intention, no one well-meaning will come.

141
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:46,259
That is why we have asked Reverend Ku Rong to come and handle the matter.

142
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,739
Maha Cakra Vajra is bold indeed.

143
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:51,620
Is he not afraid of the Six Pulse Excalibur?

144
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,400
Unfortunately, although the scripture is stored here,

145
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,979
none of us have mastered the Six Pulse Excalibur.

146
00:10:58,979 --> 00:11:02,319
If Maha Cakra Vajra requests to read the scripture,

147
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,519
we would just decline the request politely.

148
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,000
But he intends to burn it as an offering for the deceased.

149
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,560
That is an insult to the Tianlong Temple.

150
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,119
Calm your anger, Junior.

151
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,179
I believe he is only trying to imitate the actions of Ji Zha,

152
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:19,079
who hung a precious sword before his friend's grave.

153
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,899
Mr. Murong must be a special person indeed

154
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:24,419
to earn this man's respect to do such a deed for him.

155
00:11:24,419 --> 00:11:26,319
Grand Martial Uncle assessed the situation.

156
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,220
If we are unable to master the Six Pulse Excalibur,

157
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,070
I am afraid the scripture will be seized by the enemy.

158
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,410
However, this technique consumes inner energy.

159
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,760
It takes a long time to master it.

160
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,139
Zheng Ming, it is not that we do not wish to help you,

161
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,839
but I'm afraid everyone's inner energy will be exhausted if we do so

162
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,539
and fail to resist the enemy when he comes.

163
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,500
Although Yu'er is severely poisoned,

164
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,639
however, he can still hold on for a few days longer.

165
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,519
Why not leave him here to rest for now?

166
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,999
We will help him to expel the poison

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,640
after we send the enemy away.

168
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,659
You're very benevolent, Reverend. I appreciate that very much.

169
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,300
Reverend Ku Rong did mention

170
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,220
the issue of Maha Cakra Vajra.

171
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,260
May I offer my help as well?

172
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,760
Coincidentally, I have thought of an idea.

173
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,820
It would take a long time for all of us to master the Six Pulse Excalibur.

174
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,799
Therefore, I've thought of an easier way.

175
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,399
The six of us will each practice one pulse.

176
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,740
And we will attack together.

177
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,460
Zheng Ming. Since you're here, join us.

178
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:43,619
However...we are not allowed to teach the technique to someone who isn't a disciple.

179
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:47,239
I can only teach you the technique only if you receive the tonsure ceremony.

180
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,680
I have always wished to take refuge in the Buddha.

181
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,780
I'll never regret protecting both Buddhism and the temple.

182
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,839
Very well.

183
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,439
If so, come over here.

184
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,899
I'll perform the tonsure ceremony.

185
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,139
Once we defeat the enemy, you may secularize.

186
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,580
Uncle.

187
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:10,560
Every human is able to attain Buddhahood.

188
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,159
Alone, one's power is small yet significant.

189
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,200
Even a single change can make a difference.

190
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,200
Now, you've sought refuge in the Buddha,

191
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,540
you will be given the Dharma name, Ben Chen.

192
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Thank you, Master.

193
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,320
The Six Pulse Excalibur does not refer to a real sword.

194
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,759
It is a technique that uses power formed from the One-Finger Death Touch.

195
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,379
It has all of a sword's properties but without a form.

196
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:56,640
It is also known as the Invisible Sword.

197
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,099
As for the "six pulses,"

198
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,519
it refers to the Lung Meridian of Hand-Taiyin,

199
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,899
Pericardium Meridian of Hand-Jueyin, Heart Meridian of Hand-Shaoyin,

200
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,119
Small Intestine Meridian of Hand-Taiyang, Stomach Meridian of Hand-Yanging,

201
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,520
and Sanjiao Meridian of Hand-Shaoyang.

202
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:38,900
Junior Ben Chen, among the six pulses,

203
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,280
you will learn the Sanjiao Meridian of Hand-Shaoyang.

204
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,639
Supposedly, it should be one to master all six pulses.

205
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,699
However, due to the decline of the pugilistic world,

206
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,239
there is no one who possesses such profound inner energy to master it.

207
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,539
We can only opt for the other option.

208
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,579
For six people to each master a pulse.

209
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:13,840
Grand Martial Uncle will learn the Shao Shang Sword of Thumb.

210
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,600
I will learn the Shangyang Sword of Index Finger.

211
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,339
Senior Ben Guan, you will learn the Zhongchong Sword of Middle Finger.

212
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:24,219
Junior Ben Chen, you will learn the Guanchong Sword of Ring Finger.

213
00:16:24,219 --> 00:16:28,219
Senior Ben Xiang will learn the Shaochong Sword of Little Finger.

214
00:16:28,219 --> 00:16:32,620
Junior Ben Can, you will learn the Shaoze Sword of Left Hand's Little Finger.

215
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,799
As the enemy will soon appear,

216
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,279
we must remove all distractions and stay focused.

217
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,399
My arm.

218
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,279
What's wrong with my arm?

219
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,939
I feel as if something like a rat is trying to come out.

220
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:24,600
This place...

221
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,857
Uncle.

222
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,840
This place...

223
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,399
It's the Kongzui acupoint according to the pulse chart.

224
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:42,400
Why is it becoming even more unbearable now?

225
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,619
It's probably because the five masters have instilled a lot of inner energy in me

226
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:50,220
and caused the energy in my body to flow even more vigorously.

227
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,019
They are all working so hard right now, I can't disturb them.

228
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,859
Perhaps, I should move the inner energy inside my body according to the figure chart

229
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,340
to divert my attention.

230
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,639
From Kongzui acupoint to Taiyuan acupoint,

231
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,939
then to Chize acupoint

232
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:19,260
and towards the Yuji acupoint.

233
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,659
Amazing. Fascinating.

234
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:21,839
After moving the inner energy around,

235
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,980
I feel a lot calmer and better.

236
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,379
This technique I have already seen it,

237
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:31,799
it can ease my pain.

238
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,580
So should I...

239
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,379
No, I can't.

240
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,079
This is the secret technique of the Tianlong Temple.

241
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,199
I cannot learn it without permission as I'm not a disciple.

242
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,159
I just want to see it. I won't learn it.

243
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,279
I won't learn it.

244
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,059
I'll just take a look. I'll just look.

245
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,739
The Six Pulse Excalibur cannot be taught to someone who is not a disciple.

246
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,980
I only wish to ease the pain inside my body.

247
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,780
To let the inner energy flow freely in my arms and hands.

248
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,020
It's so strange.

249
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,630
This illness struck me so suddenly, yet it left abruptly as well.

250
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,860
I've caused them worry unnecessarily.

251
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,500
Why haven't the little monks and disciples

252
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,600
delivered the meals here yet?

253
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,500
Well, I should find something to eat first.

254
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Please stop here. The area ahead is a forbidden area.

255
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
[Jiu Mozhi, Adviser to the Tibetan ruler]

256
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,300
He has come. He's here.

257
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,000
Well. Maha Cakra Vajra has arrived.

258
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,600
Yu'er, stay in the room.

259
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,300
Don't come out.

260
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,600
Maha Cakra Vajra, you've traveled a long way.

261
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,900
My apologies for not coming to welcome you.

262
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,600
I have long heard of Tianlong Temple's name.

263
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,000
I am delighted to be able to meet

264
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
the masters of the temple today.

265
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,100
Amitabha.

266
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,100
I come with a presumptuous request.

267
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,000
I hope that you may grant my wish.

268
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,400
The encounter between you and Mr. Murong is because of fate.

269
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,700
Since it has ended, why do you dwell on it?

270
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,700
Mr. Murong has passed away and joined the other world.

271
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,000
He no longer has any ties

272
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,600
to the martial arts of the mortal world.

273
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,700
Your words are sound and reasonable, Reverend.

274
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,400
However, I'm too dull and shallow.

275
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,700
I can't let go of this friendship.

276
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,800
Previously, both of us had discussed martial arts.

277
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,300
On the topic of sword skills,

278
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,800
he had high regard

279
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,100
for the Six Pulse Excalibur technique of the Duan Family in Dali.

280
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,000
It is a pity that he never had a chance to see it in his life.

281
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,200
It was his greatest regret.

282
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,600
I had once promised him

283
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,000
to borrow the scripture of the Six Pulse Excalibur

284
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,800
for him to read.

285
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,600
I should make good on my promises

286
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,400
regardless if I'm dead or alive.

287
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,800
Besides, I will never break my own promises...

288
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,600
Inside this chest are three amazing scripts.

289
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,100
[72 Secret Arts of Shaolin]
They were all written by Mr. Murong when he was alive.

290
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,300
They record the moves, gist, and unraveling skills

291
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,800
of the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

292
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,200
I would like to exchange these three scripts

293
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,400
for the one scripture of the Six Pulse Excalibur technique.

294
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,700
Of course, I'm young and inexperienced.

295
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,200
It will be hard for me to gain your trust with just my words.

296
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Therefore, please forgive my rudeness.

297
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,200
Flower-pinching Finger.

298
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,400
My skills are, of course,

299
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,000
inferior to Reverend Xuan Du of Shaolin Temple.

300
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,300
As for the Pattra Finger...

301
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,200
The Invincible Finger is as incredible as the legend says.

302
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
I'm impressed.

303
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
You flatter me.

304
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,300
What is your answer then, Reverend?

305
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,000
You have shown us your mastery of the three techniques.

306
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
We can tell your sincerity.

307
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,500
However, we have yet to master

308
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,800
our One-Finger Death Touch ourselves.

309
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Why should we need scriptures of other techniques?

310
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,800
Please forgive my arrogant words.

311
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,400
If the Six Pulse Excalibur technique is indeed as invincible as Mr. Murong described,

312
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,000
then I believe no one in Tianlong Temple

313
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,600
will be able to master it.

314
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
See him off.

315
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,000
Adviser, this way, please.

316
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,400
Since the scripture of the Six Pulse Excalibur

317
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,000
does not live up to its reputation,

318
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,400
why would you want to risk the harmony between Dali and the Tibetan Empire

319
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,600
for just one scripture, Reverend?

320
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,000
Are you insinuating

321
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
that if we refuse to hand over the scripture,

322
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,700
the Tibetan Empire will wage war against Dali?

323
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,200
The emperor of the Tibetan Empire is well-versed and well aware

324
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
of Dali's people and its nation.

325
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,000
His Majesty has always had the intention to conquer Dali.

326
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,400
I'm just afraid that such an act would cost unnecessary lives

327
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,200
that go against Buddha's benevolence.

328
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,600
I've been advising His Majesty against waging war for many years.

329
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,800
You are well-versed in the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin

330
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,300
as well as the martial arts of Dalun Temple in the Daxue Mountain.

331
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,200
If you want the scripture,

332
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,600
then come and get it.

333
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,400
The Shaoze Sword Skill does exist, after all.

334
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Good.

335
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,500
Zhongchong Sword Skill.

336
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,800
Don't lose this opportunity.

337
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,200
Read the scripture and learn.

338
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,600
Self-study and master it.

339
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,800
This is not against the rules.

340
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Reverend Ku Rong does have profound inner energy.

341
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,600
I'm truly impressed.

342
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
However, the Six Pulse Excalibur is overrated.

343
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,800
What makes you say so?

344
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,700
Please enlighten us.

345
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,000
Back then, Mr. Murong admired

346
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,200
the sword skill techniques of the Six Pulse Excalibur.

347
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,300
Not its formation.

348
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,000
With the six of you combined, you are able to exert great force.

349
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,400
But even then, the formation is only comparable to that of the Luohan Formation of Shaolin Temple

350
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,100
and the Chaos Sword Skill of the Kunlun clan.

351
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,000
It cannot be considered the ultimate martial arts technique.

352
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Regardless of the technique or formation,

353
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
who is the winner between us?

354
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,200
You? Or us?

355
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,600
You have the upper hand for the first round.

356
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,400
However, I promised Mr. Murong

357
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,200
I would bring him the scripture.

358
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,600
I won't give up.

359
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,000
Rest assured, Reverend.

360
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,200
I've already thought of a way to counter your formation.

361
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
Be prepared.

362
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,000
I see.

363
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,700
He exerts several forces of power from his palm.

364
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,800
While Uncle and the other masters can only use their palms instead of the "pulses."

365
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Obviously, the Six Pulse Excalibur is inferior to his Blaze Blade.

366
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,600
My apologies.

367
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,000
[Martial arts techniques]

368
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,800
Uncle.

369
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
Reverend Ku Rong.

370
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,600
I didn't expect you to be so resolute.

371
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
You would rather destroy the scripture

372
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
than give it to me!

373
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:50,800
Well. Your scripture was destroyed because of me.

374
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm disconcerted.

375
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,900
However, I can tell that the Six Pulse Excalibur

376
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,000
can't be fully mastered by one person.

377
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
It'll be useless even if I have it.

378
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,200
I'll take my leave now.

379
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,100
Please.

380
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,200
Uncle!

381
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,400
His Majesty has been aware of the prestige of Emperor Baoding.

382
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,400
I would like to invite you to come with me to the Tibetan Empire.

383
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,300
Reverends, I don't have any ill intentions.

384
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,600
If you keep forcing me,

385
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm afraid I can't guarantee his end.

386
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,300
Release my uncle!

387
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,200
And who are you?

388
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Don't ask.

389
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,400
Release my uncle first!

390
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,600
Yu'er, don't bother.

391
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,800
I'm only a monk right now.

392
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,100
Tell your father to ascend to the throne as soon as possible.

393
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,400
How dare you sneak attack me with this weird footwork?

394
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,300
You're the despicable villain who sneaked an attack!

395
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,000
The Six Pulse Excalibur?

396
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,100
It seems like I have underestimated you, little brat.

397
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,800
Let me see how capable you are then.

398
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,700
You've destroyed the written scripture.

399
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,200
I'll take the "live" one with me then.

400
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,600
That way, Mr. Murong will have a companion to join him in the other world.

401
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,200
Farewell.

402
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,100
Young Master Duan, I have been quite rude to you

403
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,200
for the past few days.

404
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,500
I'm very unsettled.

405
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,200
Years back,

406
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,900
I promised Mr. Murong

407
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:41,500
to show him the Six Pulse Excalibur of the Duan family.

408
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,800
Yet, I was never able to make good on that promise.

409
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,100
I still mind it until now.

410
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,500
Fortunately, you have the scripture in your mind.

411
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,500
So I'll have to burn you before his grave

412
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,700
to fulfill that promise.

413
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,800
That way, I won't let down my deceased friend.

414
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,060
Of course, you are indeed talented,

415
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,140
Young Master Duan.

416
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,419
There are no grudges between us.

417
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:20,140
How could I harm you?

418
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,240
As long as you write down

419
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,060
the scripture in your mind.

420
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,499
Don't worry. I will not read it.

421
00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:32,479
When it is finished, I'll seal it instantly and bring it to Mr. Murong's grave to burn it.

422
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,120
That way, I will be able to make good on my promise

423
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,040
and you will be able to return to Dali soon.

424
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,439
Sir, don't try to deceive me.

425
00:40:54,439 --> 00:41:00,820
Look. No one can tell if the promise between you and Mr. Murong is true or not.

426
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,999
Besides, you would definitely carefully read the scripture when it's done.

427
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,739
Who knows if you will really burn it?

428
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,859
Even if you do burn it, you would read it and memorize it

429
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,099
as you are intelligent.

430
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:17,459
Young Master Duan, both of us are Buddha's believers.

431
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:20,480
How can you spout such nonsense?

432
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,539
Be kind. Stay kind.

433
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,060
If so,

434
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,200
I'm afraid I will have to force you then.

435
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,180
I'm doing this for your sake.

436
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,280
Don't blame me.

437
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,039
Don't worry.

438
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,839
If you can't handle it,

439
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,880
I'll stop right away.

440
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,800
And let you write down the scripture.

441
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,219
If I write it, you'll kill me after I'm done.

442
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,379
But if I don't, you won't bear to kill me.

443
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:57,779
So writing down the scripture is suicide for me.

444
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:01,539
I've already thought it over. Adviser Jiu Mozhi.

445
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,760
How benevolent of Buddha.

00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,640
