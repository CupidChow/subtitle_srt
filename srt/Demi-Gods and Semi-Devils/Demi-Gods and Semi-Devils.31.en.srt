13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,079
A rooster will die when bitten by a centipede. However, you're a human.

14
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,699
You won't die from it. Also, didn't you say you'd die a million times for me?

15
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:46,219
If the centipede only sucks this tiny bit of blood, will you die?

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,420
Noted.

17
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,740
I shall do as you asked.

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,760
Go.

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,440
Hold still.

20
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,840
Put the centipede in here.

21
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,320
Okay.

22
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,260
Finally, I managed to learn it.

23
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,000
I managed to learn it.

24
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,600
What is this feeling? I'm running out of breath.

25
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,220

This position... why does it feel familiar?

29
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,980
How odd. Even though my body is still numb,

30
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,100
I can breathe better now.

31
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,380
What does this arrow mean?

32
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,960
Weird.

33
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,940
My arm is somehow healed.

34
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,339
Wait!  Did I send the poison to my brain?

35
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,879
There was no illustration in this book.

36
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,360
Where did this odd-looking monk come from?

37
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,070
The buddha must have sent this monk to save me.

38
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,059
Praised be Buddha. Praised be Buddha.

39
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,600
Praised be Buddha.

Yes.

44

Throw him away.

45
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,590
Yes.

46
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,060
Go away.

47

You're still alive?

48

Yes, I'm still alive.

What should we do?

56
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,639
That silkworm is so powerful.

57
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,340
It must be the most venomous of them all.

58
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,720
It's running away. Chase after it!

59
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,180
Okay.

That ice silkworm disappeared, Miss.

Why are you so sluggish?

63
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,880
It's nowhere to be seen now.

64
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,199
I don't care. You have to find it. Or else, don't come back. Go!

65
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,239

I will catch it for you.

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,860
You're one mischievous silkworm.

71
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,359
You wandered off alone while I was worried sick about you.

72
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:59,639
I brought you here all the way from the peak of Mount Kunlun.

73
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,100
Show some gratitude, at least.

74
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,699
You don't know what I had to go through to keep you here.

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,939
What are you doing here ditching your evening lecture?

77
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,380
I'm rinsing the vegetables.

78
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,919
And you just have to rinse the vegetables now of all time. Attend the lecture now.

79
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,340
Okay. Coming.

80
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,620
Why is this bottle gourd so cold?

81
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,420
It hurts.

82
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,900
Miss A'Zi, the ice silkworm is here.

83
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,740
Come in.

84
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,359
Miss A'Zi, the silkworm is in the bottle gourd.

85
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,980
Really?

86
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,040
Wonderful.

87
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,819
Well done. If you can catch it, you can take care of it.

88
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:28,959
Find a ceramic urn and put it inside.

89
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,959
I'll check on it tomorrow morning.

90
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,800
Okay.

91
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,380
Go now!

92
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,180
Off you go.

93
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,400
It has to be one of the weirdest silkworms in the world.

94
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,279
If Miss asks me to get stung again,

95
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,640
either the frostbite or the poison will do me in.

96
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,580
That monk must be the manifestation of Buddha.

97
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,420
It will only appear when I'm about to die.

98
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,960
Miss might be cruel

99
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,219
but she won't send me to die, will she?

100
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,780
My dear silkworm.

101
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Iron Clown.

102
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,380
Miss.

103
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,280
We will put this silkworm to good use today.

104
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,439
Insert your hand into the urn and let it drink your blood.

105
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,119
I found this exotic treasure by chance.

106
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,039
The power of my Poisonous Palm will surpass that of my master soon.

107
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,560
You don't want to?

108
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,500
Miss...

109
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,080
Once you master your Poisonous Palm,

110
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,959
please don't forget the one who sacrificed for you.

111
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,800
I'm You Tanzhi.

112
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,520
I'm not Iron Clown.

113
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,159
All right, You Tanzhi. I'll remember your name.

114
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,740
Come.

115
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,220
Hurry up.

116
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
What's the matter?

117
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,480
Shi Li. Shi Li.

118
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,020
Your Highness?

119
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
Your Highness,

120
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
he is dead.

121
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,999
Bury him.

122
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,600
Yes. Come!

123
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,439
Don't you think something's off with this iron-clad man?

124
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,260
It's sweltering hot today but he's as cold as ice.

125
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,519
I know, right? My hands are almost frozen solid.

126
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,159
Captain didn't tell us how to bury him either.

127
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,980
You know what? Let's find a river to throw him in.

128
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,100
Okay.

129
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,000
Let's go.

130
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,940
I'm still alive.

131
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,740
That ice silkworm sure is something.

132
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,660
The poison from that ice silkworm is extremely potent.

133
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,820
It's more potent than a thousand venomous bugs.

134
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,780
Once she absorbs it into her palm,

135
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,560
it will mean her Poisonous Palm is ready.

136
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,940
If I head back to see her...

137
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,820
Hold still.

138
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,180
No, I can't go back. When she sees me,

139
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,540
she'll use me as her tester for her Poisonous Palm.

140
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,420
If she has mastered her Poisonous Palm,

141
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,920
then I'll die in one hit.

142
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,959
Otherwise, she'll ask me to catch more venomous bugs

143
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,959
until she can master that technique.

144
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,300
I will die either way.

145
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,060
So why should I head back?

146
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,980
Young Master.

147
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,480
Intelligent Gentleman sent his envoy here to deliver us an invitation.

148
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,420
Intelligent Gentleman, Su Xinghe?

149
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,720
What for?

150
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,819
"I, Su Xinghe, courteously invite all chess aficionados to gather together

151
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:53,820
at the Soundless Canyon by Leigu Mountain, Henan on the 8th of February.

152
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,920
I await your presence."

153
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,460
What do all of you think?

154
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,740
I heard the Intelligent Gentleman is both deaf and mute.

155
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,879
He rarely interacts with the pugilist world.

156
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,079
Unlike his usual demeanor,

157
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,360
he is holding a gathering this time.

158
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,079
I believe you are not the only one invited.

159
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,180
It is rather odd.

160
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,340
I beg to differ.

161
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,719
It's not just odd.

162
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,799
Fighting will definitely happen.

163
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,039
Intelligent Gentleman is but a stranger to us.

164
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,799
If you attend, Young Master,

165
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,159
you risk walking into a trap.

166
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,220
I think not going is the best answer.

167
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,380
This Intelligent Gentleman is touted as the brightest among everyone.

168
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,660
His martial prowess is strong and mysterious.

169
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,239
It's already hard enough to find him.

170
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,679
If you turn his invitation down,

171
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,040
you will lose this amazing opportunity to meet him in person.

172
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,239
It's just a chess game. How risky can it be?

173
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:09,500
If I care for the world,

174
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,380
I should do my best to befriend more similar minds.

175
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,800
You're right, Young Master.

176
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,299
In my opinion, the date of the rendezvous is nigh.

177
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:21,359
I suggest we travel first

178
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,940
and find out more info about this chess game.

179
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,740
If there's any anomaly,

180
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,919
we can inform you straight away so that you can be better prepared.

181
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,520
All right.

182
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,299
Send Intelligent Gentleman my regards on behalf of me.

183
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,100
I will arrive later.

184
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,620
Yes.

185
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,240
Beggars' Sect disciples?

186
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,520
Why don't I follow them?

187
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,319
What's happening? Who did it?

188
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,320
Branch Leader Quan, they are both dead.

189
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,079
Branch Leader Quan, these two people were poisoned to death.

190
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,100
The killer said he's from the Xingxiu Sect.

191
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,040
He's working under the Old Deity of Xingxiu.

192
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,479
Who are you?

193
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,359
Why are you being so suspicious?

194
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,780
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe!

195
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,380
I'm a disciple of Old Deity of Xingxiu.

196
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,999
He is visiting the Central Plains soon and he has some questions for you.

197
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:33,320
Answer honestly and no harm will be done.

198
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,220
Or else, you shall end up like these two.

199
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,839
Oh, you're from the Xingxiu Sect.

200
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,199
May I know your name?

201
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,279
I go by Sky Wolf.

202
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:52,419
All of you better prepare for the arrival of Old Diety of Xingxiu.

203
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:56,579
We are more than honored to welcome him.

204
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,680
We have two treasures here.

205
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,519
Can you have a look

206
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,820
and see if they will please the Old Deity of Xingxiu?

207
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,959
Without Qiao Feng, the Beggars' Sect can't fend for themselves

208
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,100
and can only be pushovers?

209
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,940
The Xingxiu Sect is renowned for its poison.

210
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,499
Now, get in formation and fight for your life.

211
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:36,220
Yes.

212
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,820
All of them are holding a bag.

213
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,540
There must be something inside.

214
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,959
If it's interesting, I'll steal it and give it to Miss A'Zi.

215
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:46,020
She will definitely be very happy.

216
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,320
I wonder if Miss A'Zi thinks about me from time to time.

217
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,439
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

218
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,700
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

219
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,760
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

220
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,679
and he shall conquer the world and live a long life!

221
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,759
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

222
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,040
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

223
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,140
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

224
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,279
and he shall conquer the world and live a long life!

225
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,620
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

226
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,639
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

227
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,759
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

228
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,799
and he shall conquer the world and live a long life!

229
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,959
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

230
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,060
with his infinite strength and great magical power!

231
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,079
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

232
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,079
and he shall conquer the world and live a long life!

233
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,279
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

234
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,319
and he shall conquer the world and live a long life!

235
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,439
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe

236
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,800
and he shall conquer the world and live a long life!

237
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,639
Master, the extent of your power is limitless.

238
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,919
Do these panhandlers wish to fight us?

239
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,000
It's as if a candle's light thinks it's the sun.

240
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,360
Fighting spear with chopsticks. How futile and hilarious.

241
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,260
Master, just a few words from you and everything turns to dust. Such effortlessness.

242
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,639
It is beyond my mortal understanding!

243
00:30:18,639 --> 00:30:21,939
Master, what you achieved here is unprecedented.

244
00:30:21,939 --> 00:30:24,199
If you hadn't graced everyone with your presence today,

245
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,239
no one from the Central Plains

246
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,280
would have known a powerful technique like this even existed!

247
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,919
Beggars' Sect really are the best sect in the world.

248
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,780
Their leader came with a plan.

249
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,820
Xingxiu Sect might be defeated here.

250
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,140
Hold still!

251
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,260
Old Freak of Xingxiu. Your sect and my sect had been minding our own business.

252
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,140
Why did you have to cross me today?

253
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,320
Qiao Feng is in the Beggars' Sect, isn't he?

254
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,000
Where is he?

255
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
- Ask him to come to see me.
- Qiao Feng?

256
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,759
May I know why you're looking for him?

257
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,100
Just ask him to come here.

258
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,780
Everyone has heard of the Old Freak of Xingxiu.

259
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,519
Who knew that it's just a vanity name

260
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,880
because you can't even get out of a fish net.

261
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,980
Since Xingxiu Sect loves poison that much,

262
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,880
let's dig all their poison out and make them ingest it.

263
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,939
Let's rid the martial world of its pest.

264
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:09,040
Yes!

265
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,339
Almighty Beggars' Sect! Release me, please.

266
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:12,999
I will offer you a huge favor.

267
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,600
Release you?

268
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,999
What good will I get out of it?

269
00:32:15,999 --> 00:32:18,180
Xingxiu Sect has three treasures.

270
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,999
Only Old Freak of Xingxiu and I know where they are.

271
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,319
Spare my life.

272
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:27,000
Once you kill Old Freak of Xingxiu, I'll hand those treasures to you.

273
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,999
Don't be fooled, hero.

274
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,700
One of the treasures was stolen long ago.

275
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,020
You should release me.

276
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,839
Only I'm the one who's loyal to you.

277
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,840
Disgusting.

278
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,039
Hero, hero. Don't listen to them.

279
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:40,660
They are all liars.

280
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,260
Release me.

281
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,259
I'm the most loyal one.

282
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:48,500
Sir, I know most of Xingxiu Sect's techniques.

283
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,640
I will share them with you.

284
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,660
All of them.

285
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,840
Hero!

286
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,800
You guys...

287
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,480
You betrayed your Master so easily.

288
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,220
How could you swear loyalty to another person?

289
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,760
What a joke!

290
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,559
Old Freak of Xingxiu is a weakling.

291
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,740
Being loyal to him won't do me any good.

292
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,559
But the power of Beggars' Sect travels far and wide.

293
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,920
Old Freak of Xingxiu can never hold a candle to it.

294
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,079
The word "hero" is not enough to depict your prowess.

295
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,879
You should be called a martial saint.

296
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,239
I'm good with words. I can help to promote your name.

297
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,180
That way, everyone will know your sect.

298
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,780
The heroism of Beggars' Sect is common knowledge now.

299
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,239
They don't need you to promote it.

300
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,979
I'm the first to call you a saint and a savior.

301
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:37,140
The others only know to echo after me. They have no contributions.

302
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,259
I don't understand why Old Freak of Xingxiu

303
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:42,360
would keep groveling scoundrels as his disciples.

304
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,940
Let me kill you first, Old Freak of Xingxiu.

305
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,319
And the others will follow suit.

306
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,140
No need.

307
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,400
Don't stop.

308
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
Are you okay?

309
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,119
Back off. They are poisonous.

310
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,740
Oh no! I've been poisoned.

311
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,280
Retreat.

312
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,279
- Retreat now!
- Stay here.

313
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:50,939
Stay here. You guys are not all poisoned yet.

314
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:52,158
I...

315
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,399
Come back and release us!

316
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,520
Old Deity of Xingxiu managed to turn the table.

317
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,779
Impressive.

318
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:05,779
If he catches me here, I'll die.

319
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,240
Master! Your technique is unrivaled

320
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,999
Before we know it, the panhandlers fled with tails between their legs.

321
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,199
Don't listen to him, Master.

322
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,679
He was the one who called those panhandlers a saint and a savior.

323
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,279
I followed Master for several years.

324
00:35:30,279 --> 00:35:32,779
Of course, I know Master is omnipotent.

325
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:36,739
I was just coddling the panhandlers so that they let their guard down

326
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:39,579
and Master could use his marvelous technique.

327
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,399
It's all my fault, Master. I was dumb.

328
00:35:42,399 --> 00:35:45,459
I shouldn't have surrendered. I regret it very much.

329
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:47,519
I'd rather die in the hands of the panhandlers

330
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:49,679
than beg for your forgiveness again, Master.

331
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,079
Forgive us, Master.

332
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,680
All right. All right.

333
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,160
Whoever frees me will be able to live.

334
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,879
But no blade can cut through this net.

335
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,819
If someone can undo the knot there,

336
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:06,559
then we can get out of the net.

337
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,540
We're in the middle of nowhere. No one can help us.

338
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,340
They can't possibly send a clone to harm me.

339
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,040
Now's the best time to flee.

340
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Mister! Kind soul!

341
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,719
If you can free me from this net,

342
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,180
I'll give you 1,000 taels.

343
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,239
1,000 is not enough. 10,000 taels at least.

344
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,240
10,000 taels!

345
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,740
Mister, I know you are a righteous man.

346
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,499
You will help us, won't you?

347
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:36,419
- Save us, please.
- Save a soul to accumulate merits!

348
00:36:36,419 --> 00:36:38,439
Just untie the knot.

349
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,919
There's no danger involved.

350
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,359
Once we're free, we'll regard you as our savior.

351
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,959
We will make one longevity tablet for you

352
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,240
and we'll offer you incense and candles every day.

353
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,740
Save us, kind Samaritan.

354
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,399
Save us!

355
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,679
Save us, please.

356
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,919
Savior!

357
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,439
Save us, kind Samaritan.

358
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,719
I beg of you.

359
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,839
Please.

360
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,159
Save us, kind soul.

361
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,679
Save us, hero.

362
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,780
- Save us.
- 10,000 taels!

363
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,799
Help us, please.

364
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,159
Free me, mister.

365
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,719
Help us, please.

366
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,719
Free us.

367
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,080
Help.

368
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,260
Thanks, kind Samaritan.

369
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,579
Us too! Help!

370
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:32,400
Us too!

371
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,720
Thank you, savior.

372
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,719
Thanks.

373
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:38,839
Let's go.

374
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,140
Young man with an iron helmet. What's your name?

375
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,020
I'm You Tanzhi.

376
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,060
You Tanzhi.

377
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,780
Great.

378
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,419
Check those panhandlers and see if they are still breathing.

379
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,739
Mister, they are all dead. You're so powerful.

380
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,540
You're quite resistant to poison, too.

381
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,440
Me?

382
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,920
What poison resistance?

383
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,840
You dare to kill my disciple?

384
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,580
The audacity!

385
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,940
Who's your master?

386
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,319
I don't have a master, mister.

387
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:00,700
I don't dare to kill your disciple, either.

388
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,199
Spare my life, sir.

389
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,100
Spare my life.

390
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,539
I wonder if your plea is sincere or fake.

391
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:23,539
It's very sincere, sir.

392
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:25,359
Please spare my life.

393
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,940
Spare you?

394
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,919
Unless you become my disciple,

395
00:39:30,919 --> 00:39:33,940
or else, why should I spare you?

396
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,600
I, You Tanzhi, wish to study under you.

397
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,780
Please take me in, Master.

398
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,060
Good.

399
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,479
I have a question.

400
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,799
Where did you learn martial arts?

401
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:54,239
Where did you get your poison from?

402
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:57,459
Master, I was a farm boy

403
00:39:57,459 --> 00:39:59,399
but the Liao invaded and took me away.

404
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,160
I was forced to wear this helmet.

405
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,819
I do not know any martial arts.

406
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:06,560
However, one day, I went to the mountain

407
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,679
and I was bitten by an ice silkworm that belonged to a monk called Hui Jing.

408
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:14,379
My body was frozen solid and I almost died.

409
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:17,659
When I woke up, the silkworm already died.

410
00:40:17,659 --> 00:40:19,239
What did the ice silkworm look like?

411
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:22,519
Just like a normal silkworm

412
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:24,079
but slightly bigger.

413
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,539
A magical creature like this was somehow absorbed by your body.

414
00:40:29,539 --> 00:40:32,420
What a waste.

415
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,500
If Monk Hui Jing can find an ice silkworm,

416
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,900
he can find a second one,

417
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,520
a third one.

418
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,720
- You Tanzhi.
- Yes.

419
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,500
Follow me to the mountain and find that monk, Hui Jing.

420
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,300
Yes.

421
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,460
We should arrive within half a day.

422
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,960
Our young master must have departed already.

423
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,919
This will be a dangerous trip.

424
00:41:09,919 --> 00:41:13,100
Everyone, stay alert.

425
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,800
Amitabha.

426
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,140
Misters, I came down from the mountain

427
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,579
because my temple asked me to send invitation letters

428
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,780
to all heroes.

429
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,619
I saw your impressive techniques and I believe you're experienced.

430
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,879
Therefore, please accept this invitation letter.

431
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,339
May I know your name

432
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:45,700
so that I can inform my master?

433
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,079
You haven't fought me.

434
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,360
How do you know if I'm a hero or a nobody?

435
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,019
You know what? Let's fight a bit here.

436
00:41:56,019 --> 00:42:00,039
- If I win, I'll take this invitation letter.
- I...

437
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,359
Fourth Brother, hold your horses.

438
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:05,620
Let's read what's on this invitation letter first.

439
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,320
What invitation letter?

440
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,199
I, Abbot Xuan Ci of the Shaolin Temple, courteously invite all heroes

441
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,639
to meet at the Shaolin Temple by Song Mountain

442
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:20,499
during the Chong Yang Festival on the 9th of September.
(TN: double 9 festival)

443
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,839
The Dali Duan family has also asked me

444
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,619
to clarify a certain matter in the martial world.

445
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,520
I look forward to your presence.

446
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,819
Wonderful.

447
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:35,359
The Shaolin Sect is holding a Heroes Gathering.

448
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,799
Yes.

449
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,679
I'm Gusty, Feng Bo'e.

450
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,220
I work under the Murong Clan.

451
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,259
You guys are under Young Master Murong.

452
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:49,839
The Shaolin Sect accused my young master wrongly last time.

453
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,759
I wasn't too happy about it.

454
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:54,800
I don't think I need to attend some Heroes Gathering.

455
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,140
Let's settle the score here.

456
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,190
The Old Deity of Xingxiu holds the realm in awe.

457
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:08,100

I still have the upper hand.

484
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,720
Murong Fu, Murong Fu.

485
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,620
You are going to destroy the reputation of the Murong Clan!

486
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:46,720
I'm so unlucky.

487
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,260
Everything I have done was in vain.

488
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,340
Everything I have tried to do

489
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,090
were just short-lived illusions.
