[Episode 47]

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,279
Then, what about Young Master Murong?

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,460
Cousin still intends to marry the princess of Xixia,

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,520
in order to restore the Yan nation.

17
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,100
There's no place for me in his heart.

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,280
I'd better die with you.

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,359
What's wrong? Are you injured?

20
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:09,359
No... No.

21
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,400
It has nothing to do with my injury.

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,020
I...

23
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,279
Miss Wang, did you really jump into the well for me?

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,439
You are here because of me.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,220
Even if I die,

26
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,520
I won't be able to repay the kindness I've received from you.

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,299
I advise you to leave Xixia as soon as possible.

28
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:36,959
For what you have done to Miss Wang,

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,280
I will let you off this time.

30
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,399
Advisor reversed the sequence

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,900
and is now in great danger.

32
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,919
Do you really think the 72 Secret Arts are something you can master easily?

33
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,079
Those who went obsessed

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,279
and lost their sanity practicing these superior martial arts have put their lives in danger.

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,680
I don't understand what you are talking about.

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,679
I am giving you a piece of advice out of courtesy.

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,719
You should leave Xixia now.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,379
As long as you don't activate your internal energy, don't feel angry, don't attack anyone,

39
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:09,580
you'll be able to return home safely.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,019
Otherwise, the divine monk's words will come true.

41
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,779
Master Jiu Mozhi,

42
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:16,999
you were wrong.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,370
You got the sequence in reverse and a great catastrophe is looming.

44
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,899
But right now, your Chengqi acupoint is of vermillion color,

45
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:29,959
your Wenxiang acupoint is revealing a faint purple cloud.

46
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,479
Your internal energy has taken the wrong path.

47
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,920
Your life is in great danger.

48
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,240
How do you know that my internal energy has taken the wrong path?

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,439
Utter rubbish.

50
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,220
Even if I am spouting nonsense,

51
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,099
you, as the Advisor from Tibet, should just give it a thought.

52
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,019
Why would my father impart the 72 Secret Arts to you so easily?

53
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,599
He had his own agenda when he did that.

54
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,039
His intentions were to,

55
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,159
first, make Advisor practice the 72 Secret Arts on your own,

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,759
so that he could study the sequela Advisor faced.

57
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,279
Second, to jeopardize the relationship between Advisor and the Shaolin,

58
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,959
and from that, bring about a war between Song and Tibet.

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,559
Then, the Murong clan could take this opportunity

60
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,740
to restore the Yan nation.

61
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I didn't plan to take your life today.

62
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,879
But I didn't expect

63
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,960
your father to be just as vicious as you.

64
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,520
Today, let me serve justice on behalf of Heaven,

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,320
and punish this brute.

66
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,499
No. Someone has sealed the entrance of the well.

67
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,380
My scriptures.

68
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,260
Advisor.

69
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,760
Who's there?

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,100
Young Master Duan.

71
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,839
Do you want to snatch my scriptures from me?

72
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,880
How dare you?

73
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,960
Miss Wang, what's going on?

74
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,060
This master must have practiced

75
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,270
the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

76
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,340
But he didn't use the Shaolin's internal force as the foundation.

77
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,090
Because of that, the sequence was reversed,

78
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,090
and subsequently caused the back flow of his meridians.

79
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,420
What do you mean?

80
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,660
He was too obsessed with martial arts.

81
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,820
Young Master Duan.

82
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,958
Although I... I...

83
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,519
have been holding you captive,

84
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,839
but I haven't done anything to harm you.

85
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,679
I have never intended to take your life.

86
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,479
Young Master Duan, I beg you.

87
00:08:56,479 --> 00:09:01,179
Please end this for me.

88
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,999
Yuyan, you are well-versed with martial arts manuals.

89
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,079
Do you know how to relieve Advisor's pain?

90
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,799
The only way to save this master is to eliminate

91
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,600
the real Qi in his body.

92
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,299
How can we do that?

93
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,800
Perhaps, you can help him with your Six Solar Snow-Melt Skill.

94
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,379
All right. Let me try.

95
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,859
This Tibetan monk is a vicious man.

96
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,750
If we save him, will he...

97
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,090
- But we can't leave see him to die and not save him.
- Young Master...

98
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:37,920
Our priority now is to save him.

99
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,720
Master.

100
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,019
Young Master Duan, are you all right?

101
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,739
Master Jiu Mozhi, you were wrong.

102
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:56,039
You got the sequence in reverse

103
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,940
and a great catastrophe is looming.

104
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,279
A Buddhist disciple practices martial arts not to fight with others.

105
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,119
Instead, we do that to strengthen our body

106
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,719
and protect the law and guard against demons.

107
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:12,959
If we don't use the Buddhist doctrine as the foundation of our training,

108
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,979
we will surely injure ourselves when we are practicing martial arts.

109
00:11:16,979 --> 00:11:18,759
The more we practice,

110
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,820
the worse the injury gets.

111
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,060
Ridiculous.

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
This is ridiculous.

113
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,620
I, Jiu Mozhi,

114
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,680
have always been wise.

115
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,060
But...

116
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,840
I ended up here.

117
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,440
Ridiculous.

118
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,500
Young Master.

119
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,999
I applied the wrong method

120
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,160
when I practiced the 72 Secret Arts of Shaolin.

121
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,599
I was obsessed with it and put my own life in danger.

122
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,079
If it wasn't for Young Master who disregarded our past enmity

123
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,640
and suck out my internal force,

124
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,280
I would've already died from insanity.

125
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,420
Now, I've lost my ability to perform martial arts,

126
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,980
but I'm still alive.

127
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,799
I thank Young Master for disregarding our previous enmity

128
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,300
and saving my life.

129
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,519
Advisor, please get up.

130
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,059
Duan Yu is in no place to receive Advisor's gratitude.

131
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,220
Advisor.

132
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,519
I used to practice Buddhism.

133
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,619
However, because I was more competitive than everyone else in the world...

134
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,960
Greed, hatred, and ignorance:

135
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,999
I possess all three of these poisons.

136
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,039
Yet, I posed as a senior monk.

137
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,859
I was arrogant and brazen.

138
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,980
If I'm subject to any misfortune,

139
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,519
I will surely go to the infernal hell

140
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,319
and get punished with everlasting damnation.

141
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,519
Master, why do you say so?

142
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,160
The teachings of Buddha to the Buddhist disciples.

143
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,960
First, we need to eliminate greed,

144
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,720
attachment, desire, and clinging.

145
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,360
I didn't manage to lose a single one of them.

146
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,939
My only goal was to become the best martial artist in the world.

147
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,120
I went after fame and wealth, and hurt others and myself.

148
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,820
Now, I ended up here.

149
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,640
I have lost all my martial arts.

150
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,920
It must be a lesson from Buddha,

151
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,680
to set me back to the right path,

152
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,760
and return to the lane of purity.

153
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,439
I'm happy to see that you have found blessings in disguise.

154
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,419
This has cleared your mind and righted your world.

155
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,899
I apologize again for what I have done before.

156
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,960
Master is too kind.

157
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,640
To be honest,

158
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,999
I owe Master my gratitude as well.

159
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,199
If Master didn't bring me to Jiangnan,

160
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,580
I would not have met Miss Wang.

161
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,159
I owe Master my utmost gratitude.

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,120
This is a blessing Young Master deserves.

163
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,280
I have another request.

164
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,559
If it's convenient for Young Master, please return this "Yijin Jing"

165
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,719
to Shaolin Temple.

166
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,259
Master, it's not that I don't want to help you.

167
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,019
But we are trapped within this well.

168
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:54,179
How can I get out of here?

169
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:56,799
Young Master has long mastered the Six Pulse Excalibur.

170
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,079
Right before this,

171
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,820
you absorbed the internal strength I accumulated over tens of years.

172
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,399
These rocks can't stop you.

173
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:08,439
- Really?
- Try it out.

174
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,179
Yuyan, I will bring you out of here.

175
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,139
Master, then what about you?

176
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,299
Although I lost my internal force,

177
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:32,739
this dried well can't stop me either.

178
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:37,559
From now on, I will travel across the world,

179
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,119
and stay wherever my mind tells me to.

180
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,620
As long as my mind is at peace,

181
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,559
my body will be at peace, too.

182
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,799
Thanks, Master. Regarding Master's request, Duan Yu will definitely fulfill it.

183
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,179
For now, I'll bid my farewell.

184
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:50,960
Master, take care.

185
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,819
Yuyan, let's go.

186
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,919
Do you know why I traveled to Xixia?

187
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,959
I'm going to marry their princess

188
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,759
and become the Prince Consort of Xixia.

189
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,620
Why should I bring you along?

190
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,599
I'll make it clear to you.

191
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,039
I, Murong Fu, was born for the Yan nation.

192
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,318
If I don't restore the country,

193
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,580
my life will lose its meaning.

194
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,559
Young Master Murong has been taking his blessings for granted.

195
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,879
Since the very beginning,

196
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,959
Miss Wang has had her fair share of sorrow.

197
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:32,780
Hopefully, after this,

198
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,440
Miss Wang and I...

199
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,000
Duan Yu, the heir of the Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom, has arrived.

200
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,919
Miss Mu looks really good

201
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,480
when she is in the guise of a man.

202
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,059
Perhaps, she can win the heart of the princess.

203
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:00,239
This is a promise he made.

204
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,519
Now she's here and he's gone.

205
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,619
My brother is gone.

206
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:08,479
I have to marry the princess of Xixia.

207
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,399
Brother Xiao. Brother Xu Zhu.

208
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,719
I might have to trouble you to come with me.

209
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,559
If a fight breaks out,

210
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,120
I might not be able to handle it alone.

211
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,439
Both of us have given Uncle Duan our words.

212
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:25,999
We will surely do our best.

213
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,559
Elder Brother, what are you going to do?

214
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,519
Young Master, you're finally back.

215
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,719
Third Brother, where did you go?

216
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,079
We were anxious because we couldn't find you.

217
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,759
I... Someone kidnapped me...

218
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,499
yesterday night. I was then thrown into a dried well.

219
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,919
Are you all right?

220
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,799
Don't worry, Elder Brother. I'm fine.

221
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,599
That's good.

222
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,260
I'll go get changed.

223
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,880
Sister Wan.

224
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,259
Why did you dress up as a guy again?

225
00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:04,040
Because...

226
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,759
Because we couldn't find you

227
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,979
and were worried that she would be upset if you didn't marry her.

228
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,319
Hence, I dressed up as you and was going to marry her.

229
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,900
I'm sorry to have worried you.

230
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,679
However, your worries are justifiable.

231
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,799
We can't upset the princess of Xixia.

232
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,039
Let's go to the palace of Xixia now.

233
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,999
The princess or Miss Wang.

234
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,320
You shall decide for yourself.

235
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,279
- Sister Wan.
- Sister Mu.

236
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,199
Zhong Ling. Zhong Ling.

237
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,380
Nice meeting you.

238
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,980
Gentlemen, please take a seat.

239
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,699
Her Highness has sent her message.

240
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:27,319
The guests have traveled a long journey.

241
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,499
Please enjoy the snacks.

242
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:30,479
We will skip the snacks. We want to meet the princess.

243
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,479
Yes. We want to meet the princess.

244
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,699
When is the princess coming?

245
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,239
Yes. She should be here by now.

246
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,419
After you finish the tea, Her Highness will give another order.

247
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,800
Since Her Highness has sent her order,

248
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,720
we shall just obey.

249
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,099
I'm done eating.

250
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,160
You can bring the princess here now.

251
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,340
Eat.

252
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,260
Eat up.

253
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,600
Her Highness has arrived!

254
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,339
- The princess is here.
- Look.

255
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,199
- Is that the princess?
- Stop pushing me.

256
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,719
Her Highness has sent a decree.

257
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,039
Gentlemen have come from afar, and we truly appreciate your courtesy.

258
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,179
If there is anything lacking in our hospitality, please excuse us.

259
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,599
Her Highness has three questions for you.

260
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,599
Please answer them one by one.

261
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,159
Whoever gives an answer that pleases Her Highness will be invited for a meeting.

262
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:28,779
So, this is an exam after all. I only know how to fight.

263
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,499
This... I...

264
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,159
What questions?

265
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,119
This is really challenging.

266
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,179
Her Highness has already passed her questions to me.

267
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:39,120
Which gentleman would like to go first?

268
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,959
- I'll go first.
- Me.

269
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:44,980
I'll go first.

270
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,840
Quiet.

271
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,839
Please go on.

272
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,620
You don't have to fight for this. The questions are the same.

273
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,200
Whoever goes first will be disadvantaged.

274
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
Then, you can go first.

275
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
I'm Duan Yu from the Dali Kingdom.

276
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,639
Please send my greetings to Her Highness.

277
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,159
So it's the heir of Prince Zhennan of Dali Kingdom.

278
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,999
Young Master Duan, please answer these three questions.

279
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,079
The first question.

280
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,260
Where did Young Master have your best and happiest experience?

281
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,379
I had my best and happiest time in a dried well.

282
00:23:25,379 --> 00:23:27,639
Dried... Dried well?

283
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,479
Is he a tortoise?

284
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,779
You had your best time in a dried well.

285
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,579
What is the name of the person Young Master loves the most?

286
00:23:38,579 --> 00:23:40,640
How does he or she look like?

287
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,939
The people I love the most are none other than my father and my mother.

288
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,540
Yes.

289
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,679
The love one has for parents is completely different from the love between lovers.

290
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,119
I won't let Yuyan down if I provide this answer.

291
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,159
Thanks, Young Master Duan.

292
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,020
Please have a rest at the side.

293
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,600
Which gentleman will come forward next?

294
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,599
My turn.

295
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,559
Who's that? I haven't met him before.

296
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,159
I'm the Tibetan Prince, Zong Zan.

297
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,039
I would like to meet Her Highness.

298
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,359
Your Highness' visit has honored our entire nation.

299
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,460
Our princess has three questions for you, too.

300
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,619
I have heard the three questions.

301
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,639
You don't have to repeat it again.

302
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,799
I will answer it at once.

303
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,019
The best and happiest experience of my life is becoming the Prince Consort in the future,

304
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,120
and spending our first night with the princess in our bridal room.

305
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,119
- The person I love the most is none other than Her Highness.
- How can he say that so shamelessly?

306
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,480
Her last name is Li.

307
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,660
I'm unaware of her name yet.

308
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,219
But after our wedding, she will definitely reveal it to me.

309
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:42,420
Then, I'll know what her name is.

310
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,139
Regarding Her Highness' appearance...

311
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:50,479
Of course, she resembles a deity.

312
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:53,739
Her beauty is unrivaled in both Heaven and Earth.

313
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,000
Can I go in now?

314
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,839
Why is he in such a hurry?

315
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,020
Exactly.

316
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,799
I'm Murong Fu from the Murong Swallow's Nest.

317
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,019
I've heard so much about the princess and I wish to meet the princess myself.

318
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,039
It's Young Master Murong.

319
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,179
Although I live in the palace, I've heard so much about Murong of the South and Qiao Feng of the North.

320
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,159
I heard that Qiao Feng of the North has changed his last name to Xiao, and is now a minister of the Liao Kingdom.

321
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,259
- I wonder if the rumor is true.
- Yes, it is.

322
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:32,079
Young Master is of the same status as Hero Xiao.

323
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,279
I suppose you are acquainted.

324
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,959
I wonder what Hero Xiao is like?

325
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,059
In terms of martial arts, which of you has the upper hand?

326
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,959
What Miss just asked is not one of Her Highness' questions, right?

327
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,119
No. My apologies.

328
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,999
I've heard so much about the great Hero Xiao and always admired him.

329
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:54,560
I couldn't help myself from asking a few questions regarding him.

330
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,999
In fact, Hero Xiao is here, too.

331
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
If Miss is interested, you can ask him personally.

332
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,639
We had no idea that Hero Xiao was present.

333
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:06,319
I apologize for our lacking hospitality.

334
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,719
I'll pose the questions to Young Master Murong first before I proceed to speak to Hero Xiao.

335
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:13,719
Young Master, where did you have your best and happiest experience?

336
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,599
My true happiness lies in the future, not in the past.

337
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,420
What is the name of the person you love the most?

338
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,699
As of now, I haven't met the person I love the most.

339
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,259
If that's the case, we can skip the third question.

340
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,719
Only after I meet the princess, will I be able to answer the second and the third question.

341
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,400
Young Master Murong, please take a seat here.

342
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,360
I wonder where Hero Xiao is?

343
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,759
Elder Brother has left.

344
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,920
Hero Xiao has left?

345
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,159
The three questions from the princess of Xixia.

346
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,040
If I am to be in their shoes, what answer should I give?

347
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:03,179
The happiest experience in my life is when I'm going after the Evils.

348
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,400
At that time, A'Zhu was by my side.

349
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,419
Yet, I was blinded by hatred and didn't cherish her presence.

350
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,260
The surname of the person I love the most is Duan.

351
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,340
I only learned about it after she passed away.

352
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,860
I only called her by A'Zhu.

353
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,079
Why did Hero Xiao leave?

354
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,620
Was it because of our poor hospitality?

355
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,319
Miss, please don't take it the wrong way.

356
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,759
Brother Xiao must have had a craving for wine.

357
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,359
I heard about Hero Xiao's drinking habits.

358
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,779
We do not store wine here and are unable to host him appropriately.

359
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,419
When you meet Hero Xiao again later, please pass on our apologies.

360
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:48,580
Sure.

361
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,679
How can I address this gentleman?

362
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,759
My name is Xu Zhu.

363
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,419
Since you're here, why not you try answering the questions?

364
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,120
I don't think I can.

365
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,320
Elder Brother and I are here to give Third Brother our support.

366
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,679
Since you're here, you should answer the questions.

367
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,319
Young Master Xu Zhu, where did you have your best and happiest experience in life?

368
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,859
My second brother had his best and happiest time in a dark ice chamber.

369
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,540
An ice chamber?

370
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,000
- Is that a joke?
- Is he joking?

371
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,860
Third Brother.

372
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,980
Third Brother.

373
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,100
What is the name of the person you love the most?

374
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,799
To be honest, I... I...

375
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,799
I have no idea, either.

376
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,460
In fact, he has no idea as well.

377
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,479
No idea?

378
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,660
What do you call this?

379
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,760
You... Are you Mr. Dreamy?

380
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,060
Are you... Mrs. Dreamy?

381
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,710
[Princess of Xixia, Li Qinglu]

382
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,440
You are Mr. Dreamy?

383
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,880
You are Mrs. Dreamy?

384
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,440
Mr. Dreamy.

385
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,400
Mrs. Dreamy.

386
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,240
Why did they leave?

387
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,300
Mrs. Dreamy.

388
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,120
Mr. Dreamy.

389
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm not dreaming again, am I?

390
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,180
No.

391
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,200
You are not dreaming.

392
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,260
I have to take a good look at you this time.

393
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,420
I've missed you.

394
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,540
I've missed you so much.

395
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,460
Me too.

396
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,720
I spent those days feeling groggy.

397
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,260
It was like a dream I had.

398
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,960
I wished to dream of you again,

399
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,900
but it never happened.

400
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
I was subject to Tianshan Tonglao

401
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,760
just to get more information about you.

402
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:07,919
Later, Tianshan Tonglao passed away together with Senior Li Qiushui.

403
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,299
Since then, I had never heard of you again.

404
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:13,040
At that time, I thought

405
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,880
that we would never meet again.

406
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,760
- I didn't expect that...
- Mr. Dreamy.

407
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,400
I couldn't find you,

408
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,679
so I asked my Imperial Father to issue a decree to invite you over.

409
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,879
Owing to God's favor,

410
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,000
we have finally reunited.

411
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,880
Mr. Dreamy.

412
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,860
Does meeting me make you happy?

413
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,160
Yes, it does.

414
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,760
Mrs. Dreamy.

415
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,740
Tianshan Tonglao and Senior Li Qiushui

416
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,700
spent their whole life searching for love.

417
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,260
They only learned about the truth right before their death.

418
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,839
My parents loved each other.

419
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,340
Yet, they were not accepted by the others.

420
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,180
You and I only met by chance,

421
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,520
and it was a brief meeting.

422
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,219
Initially, we should never have had anything to do with each other.

423
00:32:22,219 --> 00:32:26,779
However, we managed to escape from our dreams and reunited here.

424
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,140
I'm so grateful for this.

425
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,839
I thank Madam Tonglao and Senior Li Qiushui

426
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:37,599
for bringing us together despite it being done unintentionally.

427
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,200
I thank my parents for bringing me to this world

428
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,079
and allowing us to meet.

429
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,099
Also, you, Mrs. Dreamy.

430
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,759
If it wasn't for you who spent strenuous effort in looking for me,

431
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,119
we wouldn't have been able to meet each other again

432
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,280
among the sea of the crowd.

433
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,000
I was often told

434
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,859
that fate was not something we could create for ourselves.

435
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,900
After I met you,

436
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,740
I finally understood the meaning of it.

437
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Mr. Dreamy, you said that you were alone.

438
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,499
Hence, I'm your mortal pal, your soul mate, your family.

439
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,620
You are my Mr. Dreamy.

440
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,639
You are my Mrs. Dreamy.

441
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:30,539
Let's not wake up from such a sweet dream ever.

442
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,159
May our love be eternal.

443
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,519
Great Prince of the South Palace.

444
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,120
His Majesty has issued an order.

445
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,960
The Grand Empress Dowager Gao is in critical condition.

446
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,319
It's afraid that the relationship between Song and Liao will be affected.

447
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,700
His Highness called for the Great Prince of the South Palace to return immediately.

448
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,059
I am Fu Minyi from the Lingjiu Palace.

449
00:34:39,059 --> 00:34:42,480
We have caught up with the Prince of Zhennan and his men. There were two women.

450
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,119
Later, Madam Zhong joined the caravan.

451
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,799
The Prince of Zhennan intended to head south.

452
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,079
After he received our warnings, he decided to head to the east.

453
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,300
He said that they would take a detour before they returned to the Dali Kingdom

454
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,380
to avoid running into any enemies.

455
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,240
Thank you for your hard work.

456
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,599
I have to set off now to catch up with my father.

457
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,280
I'm afraid that the journey will be a dangerous one.

458
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,740
We are both his sisters.

459
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,160
If you don't believe me,

460
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,799
you can ask your mother.

461
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,639
Sister Mu, what are you saying?

462
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,719
How can I be his sister? I don't believe it.

463
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,520
Brother Duan.

464
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,660
Is Sister Mu telling the truth?

465
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,440
Ling'er.

466
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,739
My father told me this personally.

467
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:54,059
Your mother and my father knew each other a long time ago.

468
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:56,699
Many things happened in between.

469
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:00,519
Your mother had no choice but to marry your father.

470
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,020
No.

471
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,420
This is impossible.

472
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,540
This is impossible.

473
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,079
I'm my father's daughter.

474
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,600
How can I be your sister?

475
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,980
Ling'er, I should have told you about this way earlier.

476
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,819
Unfortunately, many things happened throughout our journey.

477
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:31,780
I was distracted by something else.

478
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,039
No.

479
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,039
I don't want to be your sister.

480
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,880
I don't believe it.

481
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,340
Duan Yu, I have something to tell you.

482
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,060
Sister Wan.

483
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,480
This slap is for your breaking your promises.

484
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,919
You got distracted and fell in love with another woman.

485
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,720
This slap...

486
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,400
is for my being a failure.

487
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,760
Despite knowing our brother and sister relationship,

488
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,860
I couldn't stop myself from missing you.

489
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,920
I traveled all the way to Dali for you

490
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,280
and for witnessing the truth with my own eyes.

491
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,360
Sure enough, my mother was right.

492
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,720
All men...

493
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,100
are ungrateful and heartless.

494
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,120
Even if he gives you his words,

495
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,740
when he meets another lady,

496
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,599
he won't stay loyal to you anymore.

497
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,040
Sister Wan.

498
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,739
But... I...

499
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:09,140
That's enough.

500
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,220
I am not someone who dwells in the past.

501
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,500
Since you don't intend to keep your promises,

502
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,380
let's forget all the vows you made before.

503
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,980
Sister Wan.

504
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,500
Duan.

505
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,480
Today onwards, we still have a long life to live...

506
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,700
and we will never meet again.

507
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,080
Sister Wan.

508
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,620
If you insist on leaving,

509
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,820
I won't be able to stop you.

510
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,760
Do take care of yourself.

511
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,500
Madam.

512
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,420
Feng Huang, long time no see.

513
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:50,799
How are you doing?

514
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,100
I'm not here to meet you.

515
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,860
Duan Zhengchun, I'm here to send an edict from the emperor.

516
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,579
You are ordered to return to the Dali Kingdom immediately

517
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:03,000
to succeed the throne.

518
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,359
Why?

519
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,719
Did Imperial Brother...

520
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,919
That's right. He has decided to become a monk

521
00:41:08,919 --> 00:41:11,020
at the Heavenly Dragon Monastery.

522
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,920
He is in the prime of his life. How did this decision come by?

523
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,380
Xingzhu, Hong Mian, Baobao.

524
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,479
I'll have Grand Marshal Fan take you home.

525
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,399
I'll pay a visit to Dali

526
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,840
to talk to my brother and clear things up.

527
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,039
Duan Zhengming has always been a wise man.

528
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,560
Why did he pick a rabble to succeed the throne?

529
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,939
I thought that since you were going to ascend the throne, you would change.

530
00:41:41,939 --> 00:41:45,119
Unexpectedly, you are still the player you used to be.

531
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,199
You have all your ladies keeping you company.

532
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,319
What a pleasant journey.

533
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
What are you talking about?

534
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,100
You should seek revenge against the one who is responsible.

535
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,759
Duan Yanqing, I'll blame it on my bad luck to have run into you.

536
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,639
But our enmity has nothing to do with the ladies.

537
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,960
I hope you can remember who you are

538
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,140
and don't put them in a difficult position.

539
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,959
If anything,

540
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,759
I would be the one who puts these ladies in a difficult position.

541
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,160
We shouldn't bother my brother with this.

542
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,180
This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

543
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,759
Duan Zhengchun,

544
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,319
the Grand Empress Dowager Gao is critically ill.

545
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,660
The war will break out soon.

546
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,199
Yet, you only care about your romance.

547
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,580
This is how our future ruler is.

548
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,479
The Dali Kingdom sure has a worrying future.

549
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,179
Since you have followed us all the way here, why do you even bother saying these words?

550
00:42:38,179 --> 00:42:39,740
Fight then.

577
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:27,810
I, Third Young Master Yue, am willing to bet and admit defeat.

578
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:29,690
No...

579
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,110
I shouldn't see my master die in front of my eyes.

580
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,150
Isn't that right, Elder Brother?

581
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:35,560
Third, you...

582
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,290
Elder Brother, I won't listen to anything you say today.

583
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:40,550
I must save my master.

584
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,500
Master!
