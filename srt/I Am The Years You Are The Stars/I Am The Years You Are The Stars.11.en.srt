00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,160
Happy Birthday.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,760
Thanks.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,360
What did you wish for?

22
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
I wished for

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
a romantic relationship.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,440
So?

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,240
So, would you date me?

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,720
A romantic relationship
is something voluntary, right?

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,640
Yeah, it is.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,560
But I am pressed for time.

29
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,840
I don't have much time left.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,200
You...

31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,400
Then answer me.

32
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,200
Do you like me or not?

33
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,400
- I...
- Make sure you think it over before answering.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,440
Xiaoyu.

35
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,920
You young people

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,920
would start a relationship

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,480
as long as there's nothing hateful
about the other person.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Then break up when you find
the other person unsuitable.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,800
But I can't do that.

40
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,360
For a man my age,

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,480
love is a luxury.

42
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm lucky if I get it. If not, it's my destiny.

43
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,640
You can't force love,

44
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,080
or experiment with it.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,080
Your short life expectancy is not a reason

46
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,160
to start a romantic relationship with me.

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,120
Right?

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,480
I can't give you my love

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
just like a gift.

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,920
It wouldn't be fair to you, either.

51
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not like that.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,600
I just...

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
I just don't want to die like that.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm already 25 years old,

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
and yet I haven't dated anyone before.

56
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,720
- Not even once.
- Alright.

57
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,400
Then think about my situation.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
I've been alive for 100 years.

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,440
I've never been in love, either.

60
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,880
That's because of your health.

61
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,400
My health is good.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,120
You sure?

63
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,840
Fine, let's stop joking.

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,040
Then tell me

65
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,520
what have you been doing for the past 80 years?

66
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,120
Studying design.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,080
Running the company.

68
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,080
Traveling around the world.

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,520
And reading, writing, painting.

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,600
There are many things I can do.

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,280
That sounds miserable.

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,240
Am I miserable?

73
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,000
Then tell me,

74
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,440
are you happy with your life?

75
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,520
I have...

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,280
I have my master,

78
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,280
Weilan, and my seniors.

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,240
They all love me.

80
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
And...

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
And I know you now.

82
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,320
As you just said,

83
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,840
before you met me,

84
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,560
there were many people who loved you.

85
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,680
So do you really think that romantic love

86
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,200
is the only thing that brings happiness?

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,040
It doesn't seem so.

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,440
Then think about it again.

89
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Do you like me

90
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,280
or just need me?

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
I need you,

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,280
and I like you, too.

93
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,040
How about you?

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,960
For me,

95
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,440
the one and only woman I can talk with

96
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,400
is you.

97
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,520
I have no other choice.

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,560
And I have no other points of reference.

99
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,520
In that case,

100
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm the only one for you, right?

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,360
Right?

102
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,120
If you must put it this way,

103
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,120
then so be it.

Why are you making breakfast today?

134
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,240
Right.

135
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,560
Qian Cheng has a meeting this morning.

136
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
I'll be your driver.

137
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,720
Young Master.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,640
Why didn't you ask me

139
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,520
where Jin Xiaoyu went?

140
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,760
Why do I have to...

141
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,560
You made this egg, didn't you?

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,440
I do feel ashamed.

143
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,400
Don't you think you've let the hen down?

144
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,360
I'll make another one for you.

145
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:52,840
This...

146
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,080
This is burnt.

147
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
But I heated it up with a wok.

148
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Just use a microwave to heat up milk.

149
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,400
This will make the process seem more complicated,

150
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,400
so as to show my sincerity.

151
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
Morning, Xiaoyu.

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:05,800
Have a seat.

153
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll make you breakfast.

154
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,160
I'll let you try my cooking.

155
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,520
Morning.

156
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,880
Good morning.

157
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,960
So, this is William's handiwork?

158
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,440
I am ashamed of him.

159
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
How's the milk?

160
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,000
A disgrace to the family.

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Thank you for your hard work.

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
I'll let you try my cooking today.

163
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,560
That's great.

164
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,240
Go, go, go.

165
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,680
Okay, okay. You do it.

166
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,880
Young Master.

167
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,360
Looks like she knows what she's doing!

168
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,920
She is definitely good at housework.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,680
Here.

170
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,680
Eat up what you made.

171
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,760
And here, drink up your milk.

172
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,560
I wanted to eat in the living room.

173
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,320
I'll leave you two alone.

174
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,840
No, you don't have to.

175
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,520
You can stay here.

176
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,280
It's okay.

177
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,480
May I...

178
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,640
Is it good?

179
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,120
I like it.

180
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,800
Would you help me
make an appointment with Tan Yueran?

181
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,320
Then ask Qian Tu to discuss with her

182
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,360
about the clues.

183
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,640
Who's Qian Tu?

184
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,480
Qian Tu is Qian Cheng's elder brother.

185
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,880
The one who kicked the door that day.

186
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
I thought he was the driver.

187
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,400
No, he's not.

188
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,920
Then, I'll make an appointment with Tan Yueran

189
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,560
and tell you later.

190
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,160
Anyway, just ask Tan Yueran out.

191
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,880
When we finally catch those guys,

192
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,560
we might be able to cure you.

193
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,880
What if you fail to catch them?

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,080
If we fail,

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
I'll financially support your master
for the rest of his life.

196
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,040
Thank you for being my master's sugar daddy.

197
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,520
That's not what I meant. I...

198
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
You changed your tastes so abruptly.

199
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,360
Come on!

200
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,320
Look at how scared you are.

201
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,520
You might as well go back to the duty room
and hide under the sheets.

202
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
Cover yourself up and you'll be safe.

203
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,840
That won't do.

204
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,920
What if Kayako comes?

205
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,600
I'd better stay with you.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,760
I'm not as scared

207
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,840
when I'm talking to you.

208
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,800
In our line of work,

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,440
it's best to stay away from those horror films.

210
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,640
Don't be afraid.

211
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,840
When I finish my rounds,

212
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,240
I'll take you back to your duty room.

213
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,040
Uncle You.

214
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,160
So when does your round end?

215
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,880
There is only this cemetery left.

216
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,720
Uncle You.

217
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,840
Can you stay with me tonight

218
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,000
in my duty room?

219
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,520
You're a real coward, aren't you?

220
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I need to stay in the guards' room.

221
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,280
If something happens during the night,

222
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
I have to take care of it.

223
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
Do you think the grim reaper

224
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
comes out at night?

225
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,600
People often send the dead here

226
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,720
in the middle of the night.

227
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,520
Uncle You.

228
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,880
What are you talking about?

229
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,240
It's kind of scary.

230
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,600
From now on,

231
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,440
you should learn from Jin Xiaoyu.

232
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,960
Practice more.

233
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Uncle You.

234
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Wait for me.

235
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,080
No wonder people say

236
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,400
a person is either born cowardly or brave.

237
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,720
Look at Jin Xiaoyu.

238
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,040
She grew up here

239
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
and has never been scared.

240
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,640
Why else would others call her

241
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,880
the Little King of Hell.

242
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,640
Let me tell you.

243
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,000
That girl

244
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,560
is totally a guardian angel.

245
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,280
No.

246
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,680
Master said

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,880
Jin Xiaoyu has a positive aura.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,760
Anyway,

249
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,000
whenever she comes to work,

250
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,720
I feel especially at ease.

251
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,440
In my mind, she is

252
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
just like the Taoist priest, Lam Ching-ying.

253
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,560
You best

254
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,960
quit watching those horror movies
as soon as possible.

255
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,880
No, Uncle You.

256
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,960
Why do I feel a little bit cold?

257
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,320
As if it was a gust of evil wind.

258
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,240
Cold?

259
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
It's so hot that I'm sweating.

260
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Peed your pants?

261
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,480
I'm being serious.

262
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm not kidding.

263
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,080
Can you still go on patrol with me?

264
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
I'd better wait for you here.

265
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,960
Go do your round

266
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,960
and hurry back, alright?

267
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,520
Fine.

268
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,640
Stay here and don't go anywhere.

269
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
I-I'll stay here.

270
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,920
I'll wait for you here.

271
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,320
Okay, okay.

272
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,600
What a chicken!

273
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,640
Uncle You?

274
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,040
Here I am.

275
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Uncle You, can you talk to me?

276
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,520
Stop bothering me, okay?

277
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,720
Give me a break.

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,680
Uncle You.

279
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,440
Have you ever seen a thief?

280
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,640
I've been working in the funeral home

281
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,640
for more than 20 years as a security guard.

282
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,520
I've never seen a thief before.

283
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,240
What would thieves steal from us?

284
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Boxes of ashes?

285
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,200
Wreaths?

286
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,120
They can steal corpses.

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,520
Just like the movie

288
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
"Fight Club".

289
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,760
Why do you always watch such weird movies?

290
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,160
- Haunted?
- Haunted?

291
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,240
Cui fell ill because he got scared.

292
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,920
He's still running a high fever.

293
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,120
What did Uncle You say about this?

294
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,280
Uncle You said when he came out of the cemetery,

295
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,600
he saw Cui lying on the ground having a seizure.

296
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,320
Don't we have

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,480
surveillance footage?

298
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,360
The scariest part is the surveillance footage.

299
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,960
The footage was all black.

300
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,920
We couldn't see anything.

301
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,760
All we could see

302
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,720
was a white figure

303
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,240
following Cui.

304
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,280
Our outdoor security cameras

305
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,440
have all worn out.

306
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,760
We have nothing of value here.

307
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,080
The thief came here in the middle of the night.

308
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,080
He was pretty gutsy.

309
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,360
Let's be serious.

310
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,600
Tonight,

311
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
Quanzhan and Quande, you two

312
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,360
must set a good example.

313
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:27,880
No, no, no.

314
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,560
No problem, Master.

315
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,280
I'll be on duty with Quande tonight.

316
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:31,760
You...

317
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,560
I...

318
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,400
Everyone has heard about it.

319
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,800
- The news had spread everywhere.
- Really?

320
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:37,840
Xiaoyu.

321
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,720
I heard that a guy in your department

322
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,680
fell ill because he was so scared.

323
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,040
What happened last night?

324
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,560
You wanna know?

325
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,320
Okay, I'll tell the group leader

326
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,360
to let your group be on duty tonight.

327
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,880
No, no, no.

328
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,040
We're just curious.

329
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,080
I heard that your department

330
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,600
is going to send Quande and Quanzhan
on duty tonight.

331
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,280
Well...

332
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
Cui is still running a high fever.

333
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,880
He's already in the hospital.

334
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
At a time like this,

335
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
of course it's up to Quande

336
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,440
and me to quell the chaos.

337
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,240
Yes, exactly.

338
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,440
I'll have you guys know.

339
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,080
The two of us

340
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,040
will definitely show up

341
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,400
to catch them.

342
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,240
Since something happened to our department,

343
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,240
of course we, as seniors, have the responsibility

344
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,080
to solve the problem.

345
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,760
Right?

346
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,280
- Of course!
- Yeah!

347
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,680
Quanzhan.

348
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,520
If you two are on duty together,

349
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,440
that thief will certainly get caught.

350
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,440
Absolutely!

351
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,080
That's a sure thing!

352
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,520
Haven't you heard?

353
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,000
Double-Quan team.

354
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,280
One can beat three.

355
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
Right, you're right!

356
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,160
Look at these little brats.

357
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
They are so arrogant.

358
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,640
You should show these idiots what you can do.

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,040
If Quanzhan and Quande can handle it,
there is no need to bother me.

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm leaving.

361
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,560
It's just a bottle.

362
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,920
Who threw a mineral water bottle here?

363
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,720
How uneducated!

364
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,480
You should stop ridiculing Cui.

365
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,040
You don't have the guts, either.

366
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,440
If I had known this, I would have asked

367
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,520
the Little King of Hell to team up with me.

368
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,160
She should have been the one doing this.

369
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,520
Then why did you act all brave at that time?

370
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,360
What are you doing?

371
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,320
Throwing the bottle into a trash can.

372
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,240
Hurry back.

373
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,240
Quanzhan!

374
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,040
Quanzhan! Quanzhan!

375
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:40,640
Quanzhan!

376
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,240
My leg.

377
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Have you heard about it?

378
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,200
The Double-Quan team failed spectacularly.

379
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,520
Both of them are in hospital now.

380
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,360
Wang Quande even broke his leg.

381
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,880
Could it be that

382
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,000
there really are ghosts here?

383
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,040
Two seniors have been attacked.

384
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,160
And you still don't believe it?

385
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,080
Where is the security department?

386
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,040
The security department...

387
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,560
How can you two little brats

388
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
be so ignorant?

389
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,920
The security department is in charge
of patrolling the place.

390
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,840
What you two were talking about

391
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,080
is all superstition.

392
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,880
It's under the control of Chief Ge.

393
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,840
I say,

394
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,200
has this ever happened

395
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,040
in the past?

396
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,280
Take a look around.

397
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,400
We work in a funeral home.

398
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,840
You two cowards.

399
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,120
If the Double-Quan team has failed,

400
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
what should we do next?

401
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,600
What's the big deal?

402
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,840
We still have Chief Ge.

403
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,360
If Chief Ge fails,

404
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,640
we still have the Little King of Hell.

405
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,600
Who is the Little King of Hell?

406
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,040
I didn't think there would be someone
more capable than Chief Ge.

407
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,560
Well...

408
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,880
When this person shows up,

409
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,800
you'll know.

410
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,400
Wait, this...

411
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,840
Who is it?

412
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,840
I'll be on duty tomorrow night.

413
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,920
No way.

414
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,840
I'll go with you.

415
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,800
This is a waste of manpower.

416
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,080
I can handle this little problem by myself.

417
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,480
I guess I'm up.

418
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,040
Don't stare at me like that.

419
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,400
You look good from the side.

420
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,160
What did I say?

421
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,400
Being the target of a thief is worse
than having your things stolen.

422
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,080
The thief is not afraid
of you stealing something from her.

423
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,680
Looking at you won't hurt you, right?

424
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,920
Salute.

425
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,760
Did you learn that from William?

426
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,200
This is the secret technique

427
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,320
I used a large pot of soup to trade for, okay?

428
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,320
Aren't you gonna fall for it?

429
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,520
Love requires sincerity, you know?

430
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,560
Haven't you heard a saying?

431
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
Sincerity will lead to nothing but cheating.

432
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,520
Only by playing love games will you win hearts.

433
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
Let me tell you something.

434
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
When I was young,

435
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,440
not many people

436
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,080
could choose who they loved.

437
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
And women who came outside to work

438
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,560
were rare, too.

439
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,680
But do you know what it was like at that time?

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,640
At that time, every couple

441
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,000
grew old together

442
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,240
and stayed with each other forever.

443
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,200
But what is it like now?

444
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,520
Women almost

445
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,760
run half of the whole society.

446
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,880
There are more and more people
believing in pick up routines.

447
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,040
How pathetic.

448
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,160
When you are nagging,

449
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,040
you're like an old man.

450
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
I now believe

451
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,040
you're over 100 years old.

452
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,600
I mean it.

453
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,360
So?

454
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,800
You dislike me?

455
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,320
No.

456
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,360
Then it's okay.

457
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,040
But every generation of young people

458
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,840
are not the same.

459
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,920
There are also young people

460
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,320
who are good and positive.

461
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,200
Just like

462
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,160
me.

463
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,560
I admit

464
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,720
you're an independent woman.

465
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,080
Who are you calling woman?

466
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
I'm a fair maiden, okay?

467
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:27,920
Okay, fair maiden.

468
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,680
- Fair maiden.
- Don't you think I'm a fair maiden?

469
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,800
Yes, yes, yes. Don't move.

470
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Then...

471
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
Don't you want to consider

472
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,080
accepting such a fair maiden like me?

473
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,760
That's funny.

474
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,640
I tell you, I'll let go of your hand.

475
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,160
If you die, I would.

476
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,860
(Outpatient)

477
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,460
(Prescription Review)

478
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,040
Thank you.

479
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,680
Are you a ghost?

480
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
I heard you're going to catch the ghost.

481
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,000
Of course you heard it.

482
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,680
Quanzhan, Quande, and Cui

483
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,600
are all staying in this hospital.

484
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,680
Master also got cold feet.

485
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm now the only one to go.

486
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,920
Then where is your security department?

487
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Why does it have to be you?

488
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,880
Our security department is totally useless,

489
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,160
except for Uncle You,

490
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,520
the department Chief, and Huang.

491
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,480
We're not going to catch thieves.
So why call them?

492
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,120
They are useless in this regard.

493
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,200
Point taken.

494
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,600
Your place is really quiet.

495
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,080
There are neither medical disputes nor thieves.

496
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,160
Who dares to come to our place to cause trouble?

497
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,120
No.

498
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,200
I should say, who has nothing better to do

499
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,920
than coming to our place to cause trouble?

500
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,480
Except during the Festival of The Hungry Ghosts
and Tomb Sweeping Day,

501
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,560
our place

502
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,960
is absolutely quiet.

503
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,960
Stop it.

504
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,520
You go.

505
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll go this way.

506
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,440
Xiaoyu!

507
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,280
Why did you catch a fever?

508
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,720
It was...

509
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,600
It was Old Lady White.

510
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Old Lady White?

511
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,880
These three guys

512
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,840
are definitely possessed.

513
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,880
You need to find a ghost-hunter
to catch that ghost.

514
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,920
I am the ghost-hunter.

515
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,360
Once I get rid of that ghost,

516
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,440
you guys will surely recover.

517
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,720
Miss, don't be a hero.

518
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,360
This supernatural stuff

519
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
is quite troublesome.

520
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,880
If things go wrong,

521
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
you'll get hurt, too.

522
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,440
That's right.

523
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Even these three strong men ended up in hospital.

524
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,640
You're just a young lady.

525
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,360
Patient No.13.

526
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,280
I thought the doctor told you not to go outside.

527
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,640
I-I'm not outside.

528
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm just in the yard

529
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,000
for exercise.

530
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,760
I just came here to play some chess.

531
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,480
You can't do that.

532
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,680
I must call the chief.

533
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,080
No, no, no.

534
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll go.

535
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
I'll go back now.

536
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm leaving now.

537
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,320
Quande.

538
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,080
Xiaoyu.

539
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,680
Quande, your leg is not broken.

540
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,640
It's just a fracture.

541
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,280
Don't be too sad.

542
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,360
You'll be fine after a few days' rest.

543
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,200
Okay.

544
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Quanzhan and Cui.

545
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,480
The problems you two have
are purely psychological.

546
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,800
Don't worry.

547
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,680
I will definitely get rid of

548
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,360
that ghost tonight

549
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
to avenge you guys.

550
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,960
Go! Go! Go!

551
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,280
Young Master, what are you doing?

552
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm looking for inspiration.

553
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,080
What about you?

554
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,800
I came to see you.

555
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,800
What's up?

556
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm here to ask you about the collection
of The Nine Stages.

557
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,240
When will it be finished?

558
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,240
We need to schedule the photoshoot.

559
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,560
Friday, I think.

560
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
The first three sets will be ready.

561
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,760
Young Master.

562
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
You need to hurry up.

563
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,640
Stop indulging in love.

564
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,520
Work needs to take priority.

565
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,120
Creating.

566
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,320
It takes time to create.

567
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,200
It also needs inspiration and...

568
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,800
You want to date Jin Xiaoyu?

569
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,400
You're trying to trick me.

570
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,520
Cheng.

571
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,080
Why do you hate Jin Xiaoyu so much?

572
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,280
I just don't like her.

573
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,760
From what I know about you,

574
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,240
it's hard for you to hate someone.

575
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,400
You can put up with

576
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,800
such an overbearing girl

577
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,720
like Xue Wanwan.

578
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,880
And even your elder brother.

579
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,560
Your elder brother, Qian Tu,

580
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,680
is always very aggressive.

581
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Yet you're fine with it.

582
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,080
But why...

583
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
I don't get along with her by nature.

584
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,480
By nature?

585
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,000
Really,

586
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,120
you should listen more

587
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
to your own heart

588
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,640
and figure out what you are confused
about and what you need.

589
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,440
Only by doing so can you make yourself better.

590
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,120
Am I right?

591
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,560
What I care about is the photoshoot.

592
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,200
But what I care about

593
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,400
is you, Cheng.

594
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,320
What you care most about is Jin Xiaoyu, isn't it?

595
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,680
Oh, one more thing.

596
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,400
She won't be staying tonight.

597
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:03,680
Okay.

598
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,760
Didn't she tell you?

599
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,200
She told me.

600
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,760
But she didn't tell you

601
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
that you're on duty today, did she?

602
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,760
Uncle You.

603
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,760
So you've finally decided to handle this yourself,
Little King of Hell?

604
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,320
It's been years since something
like this happened here.

605
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,200
But these incidents

606
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,840
don't seem like the work of a ghost.

607
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,040
You must be careful.

608
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,360
If it's not ghosts,

609
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,480
then what is it?

610
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,920
I think it's the fox spirit

611
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,600
rumored to have appeared in my village
when I was little.

612
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,680
You're so funny.

613
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Be careful!

614
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,280
Take care, Uncle You.

615
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,200
Okay.

616
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,280
It's not bad if it's a male fox

617
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
with a handsome face, long legs,

618
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,360
and a warm smile.

619
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,800
And it would be perfect if he brought snacks.

620
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,560
Lin Nuoyan.

621
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,360
Why are you here?

622
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,400
Cheng Weilan told me

623
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,640
you'd catch a ghost here tonight.

624
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,840
Look.

625
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,400
I brought snacks

626
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,880
to watch the live show.

627
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,960
Oh, right.

628
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
It's so late.

629
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
Why did you suddenly come to look for me?

630
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,360
Just out of curiosity.

631
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,600
The volunteers had a meeting today.

632
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,040
And Cheng Weilan told us

633
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,160
your funeral home was haunted.

634
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,480
She told it in vivid detail.

635
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,880
It sounded very exciting.

636
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,360
I got off work

637
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,480
and didn't have anything to do at night.

638
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,880
I came here mostly to see you.

639
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,120
You came alone?

640
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,560
You sure you can catch the ghost?

641
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,480
There are no ghosts.

642
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,240
I've been living in the dormitory

643
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,320
behind the funeral home since I was a kid.

644
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,840
For as long as I can remember,

645
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,880
it's always been people

646
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,200
to cause trouble.

647
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,380
(Xiaoyu)

648
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
It's already so late.

649
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,160
Why is she still not back?

650
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,280
It's almost ten.

651
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
Is Jin Xiaoyu going to sleep
at the funeral home today?

652
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,440
Jin Xiaoyu told me

653
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,440
she went to catch a ghost.

654
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,200
She probably hasn't caught the ghost yet,

655
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,080
so she hasn't come back.

656
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,400
Why are you suddenly worried about Jin Xiaoyu?

657
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,520
Who's worried about her?

658
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm just worried about the young master.

659
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,120
If she doesn't come back,

660
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,760
the young master will have to sleep
in the dormant cabin again.

661
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,160
It's been a long time
since I've seen the young master look so lonely,

662
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,080
giving the impression
that he's going to die alone.

663
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
After hearing what you said,

664
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,160
I do feel he looks like a 100-year-old man.

665
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,960
Why do you have to let me listen
to your private conversations?

666
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,560
Good night.

667
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,640
Good night.

668
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,960
Back in the day, there was this incident.

669
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,480
A 90-year-old lady was brought here by her family.

670
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,800
They said she committed suicide.

671
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,000
The medical staff did their best to save her.

672
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,880
But they were unsuccessful.

673
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
I felt that something was wrong about it,

674
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,200
as her family looked quite unnatural.

675
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,440
Later, I found out...

676
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,320
On her body were signs
of violence and physical restraint.

677
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,560
In that case,

678
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,360
the reason why her family looked unnatural

679
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,600
was because they didn't want
others to know, right?

680
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,920
She was already so old,

681
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,160
and yet she died of this kind of treatment.

682
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,480
She must have been abused at home.

683
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,840
She must have died miserably.

684
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,600
That's right.

685
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
Her children were too selfish.

686
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,320
They were afraid of losing face.

687
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,560
And I tell you.

688
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,240
At the farewell ceremony,

689
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,400
while they were taking turns to bid farewell,

690
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,120
the body suddenly opened her eyes!

691
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,360
And then...

692
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
The son took his mother's hand

693
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
and took a good look.

694
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,360
Livor mortis had developed on her arm

695
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,120
and it was the word for hatred.

696
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,320
The family got so scared and called the police.

697
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,960
It was that scary?

698
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,120
Her eyes opened

699
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,440
because I didn't stick them properly.

700
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,640
And the word "hatred"

701
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
was also my handiwork.

702
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,720
Her family didn't come after you?

703
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
They were all arrested by the police.

704
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,520
Don't worry.

705
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,600
Xiaoyu.

706
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,920
Did you hear that?

707
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:38,920
Let's go.

708
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,560
Let's go.

709
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:48,880
What?

710
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,440
You're really not scared at all?

711
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,920
You think all people are scared of ghosts?

712
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,080
Actually, many people hope
that there are ghosts in the world.

713
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,400
Those parents who lost their children.

714
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,200
And those

715
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,080
widows and widowers who lost their loved ones.

716
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,120
When you lose your beloved one,

717
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,040
you'll hope to see ghosts.

718
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,040
That's when you'll realize

719
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,200
there are no ghosts in the world.

720
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,480
Let's check over there.

721
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,280
After hearing what you said,

722
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,680
I suddenly feel it would be a shame

723
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,240
to not at least encounter a ghost.

724
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,840
That's why you must cherish what you have now.

725
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,080
People can only live once.

726
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,040
If it's gone, it's gone.

727
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,280
Xiaoyu.

728
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,920
Who is crying?

729
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,440
Come out!

730
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,840
Will the ghost listen to you and come out?

731
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,880
I guess not.

732
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:31,960
This isn't gonna work.

733
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,080
Stop!

734
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,000
Stop!

735
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,960
Xiaoyu.

736
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,560
It's a living person.

737
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,000
Old lady.

738
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,040
You're so old.

739
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,120
How can you run so fast?

740
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,040
It seems that

741
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,000
there really are no ghosts in this world.

742
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,720
Ma'am.

743
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,920
Have some water first.

744
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,640
It is not safe in this place.

745
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,320
You shouldn't run in here like this.

746
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,600
Where did you come in from?

747
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,520
I came in from the cemetery.

748
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,760
There is an unlocked back door in the cemetery.

749
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
I came here at 9 p.m.

750
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,080
The back door?

751
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,800
But that back door

752
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,400
is used by us to transport the bodies

753
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
at night.

754
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,920
Is the back door unlocked?

755
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,280
What do you mean by that?

756
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I was on patrol in the yard before midnight.

757
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,040
Then I came back

758
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,040
to the guards' room
near the back door at midnight.

759
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,920
She came in at nine.

760
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,160
How could I possibly see her?

761
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,160
Ma'am.

762
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,240
This place is neither safe nor auspicious.

763
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,120
What are you doing here?

764
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
My husband is in your cemetery.

765
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,000
I came to see him.

766
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,320
Why don't you come during the day?

767
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,840
I can't get out during the day.

768
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,640
I...

769
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,720
Ma'am.

770
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
Tell me the truth.

771
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,840
You're ill

772
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,640
and sneaked out of the hospital, right?

773
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,520
See.

774
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,440
What's on your hand is tape residue

775
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,480
after years of having intravenous drips.

776
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,400
And...

777
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,240
I can see that you have signs

778
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,800
of minor hair loss.

779
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
If I'm not wrong,

780
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
you're undergoing chemotherapy, right?

781
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,120
Are you a doctor?

782
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,840
I'm not a doctor.

783
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,800
But I know

784
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
a patient like you

785
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,240
shouldn't take your chances
to sneak out of the hospital.

786
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,680
So Ma'am,

787
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,640
which hospital are you
getting your treatment from?

788
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,360
It's so late.

789
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,360
How about we bring you back?

790
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,080
It's time for the nurses to make rounds.

791
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,720
I live in

792
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:42,920
the Second Hospital.

793
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,880
The Second Hospital?

794
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,600
She's nowhere to be found.

795
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
How could you lose a VIP patient?

796
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,920
How could you be so irresponsible?

797
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,040
We have searched the bathrooms on all floors.

798
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,840
She's not here.

799
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,160
Fine.

800
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
We can only notify her family.

801
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,760
I'll take charge of communicating
with her family when they arrive.

802
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,720
No matter how they yell at us,

803
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,560
don't talk back!

804
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,320
Jin Xiaoyu.

805
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,160
Where did you find Mrs. Xu?

806
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,720
Well, this question...

807
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
I don't know how to put it.

808
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
How about you send her back first?

809
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,520
Go upstairs.

810
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
Send her back to the ward.

811
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,440
Mrs. Xu.

812
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,240
Don't you think

813
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,000
it is pathetic

814
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,640
that a person cannot decide

815
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,280
if they die or live?

816
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,480
I'm so pathetic.

817
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
Mrs. Xu, let's go back first.

818
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,640
You saved me!

819
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,240
She is a VIP patient.

820
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,600
If anything happened to her,

821
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,400
I'll definitely be punished.

822
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,280
Everything is fine now.

823
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Then I'll go to work.

824
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,480
You're hiding from people again?

825
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,280
What?

826
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,200
Caught the ghost?

827
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,240
After all, I'm

828
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,120
Master Jin.

829
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,240
What ghost did you catch?

830
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,160
Old Lady White.

831
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,000
Old Lady White?

832
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:13,880
Tell me the truth.

833
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,760
What happened?

834
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,560
Why are you back so late?

835
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,640
She's an old woman in her seventies

836
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,320
with terminal liver cancer.

837
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,480
She's undergoing chemotherapy.

838
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,600
Do you know?

839
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Liver cancer is the most painful of all cancers.

840
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,640
Then her daughter and son-in-law

841
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,320
bought her a lot of supplements

842
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,720
and let her stay in the VIP patient room.

843
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,400
They really care about their mother.

844
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,440
VIP room.

845
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,000
Isn't it good that her children can

846
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,840
treat her so nicely?

847
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,600
It's a great comfort for this old lady, isn't it?

848
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,760
Is that so?

849
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,800
What's wrong?

850
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,000
Am I wrong?

851
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,280
No, you're not.

852
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,680
Filial piety is a good thing.

853
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,000
It's really good.

854
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,720
Is it really that hard to wash all these clothes?

855
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,000
If you can't do it by hand,

856
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,920
why didn't you wash them in the washing machine?

857
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,120
These are all Mrs. Xu's?

858
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,080
It's none of your business.

859
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,320
Just do as I say.

860
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,440
These as well.

861
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,400
Okay.

862
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,680
Mom.

863
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,960
I brought you

864
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,360
this silk four-piece set this time.

865
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,160
It feels very comfortable.

866
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,720
Okay.

867
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,120
Change these sheets.

868
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,200
Take them.

869
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,520
O-Okay.

870
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:39,960
Mom.

871
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,760
How did you sleep last night?

872
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,960
If you feel uncomfortable,

873
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,360
just tell me.

874
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,600
I'll go talk to those nurses right away.

875
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,520
I'm good.

876
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
This is a VIP room.

877
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,120
Everything is perfect.

878
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,320
Mom.

879
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,360
My aunt is coming to see you this afternoon.

880
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,880
After you finish the examination,

881
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,760
come back as soon as possible.

882
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,040
Okay.

883
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,240
Zhengchen's aunt also said
she would come visit you

884
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,360
after hearing you were sick.

885
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,360
She's out of town.

886
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,840
It's a long way to get here.

887
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,800
Don't go to all that trouble.

888
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,120
Mom.

889
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,880
Zhengchen is your son-in-law.

890
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,800
You're ill.

891
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,520
Of course his family should come to see you.

892
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,840
His parents can't make it.

893
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,760
It's at least courtesy for his aunt to come over.

894
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,840
Isn't it great to have someone thinking of you?

895
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,000
Great.

896
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,000
Great.

897
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,400
We're finally back.

898
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,080
It feels so good to be back.

899
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
What did I say?

900
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,600
The Double-Quan team is just a joke.

901
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,600
Their department is gonna have no future.

902
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,000
Cui doesn't look like a man at all.

903
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,400
Can you keep it down

904
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,160
when talking behind people's backs?

905
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:40,800
You...

906
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,960
Quanzhan.

907
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,720
They said I'm not a man.

908
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,360
Go ahead and cry.

909
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,760
You'll look more like a woman if you cry.

910
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,200
You two

911
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,400
are not as good as a woman.

912
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,480
Just move.

913
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,020
(Hall of General Services)

914
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,160
Chief Ge.

915
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,000
Let me help you.

916
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,160
I tend to my flowers with utmost care.

917
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,160
You can't do it.

918
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,080
Lin Nuoyan.

919
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,080
What are you doing here?

920
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:06,680
Xiaoyu.

921
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,280
Master.

922
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
I came to see you.

923
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,760
Don't you want to help?

924
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:16,720
Here.

925
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,360
Take it.

926
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,200
Supervise his work, okay?

927
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,160
I have something to do.

928
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,280
You...

929
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,160
I'll do it.

930
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,520
You're screwed.

931
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,320
My master is definitely
gonna catch you with a strainer.

932
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,400
Catch me?

933
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,720
I'm not a dumpling.

934
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,480
What is he going to catch me for?

935
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,440
Catching you to be his son-in-law.

936
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,400
Let me tell you.

937
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,400
You're in big trouble.

938
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,280
That's fine.

939
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,800
If that's true,

940
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,920
I'll come over tomorrow

941
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,680
with my ID card and household register.

942
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,680
Don't scare me.

943
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,600
Leave it to me.

944
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,000
Do you really think these flowers

945
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,080
were all planted by my master?

946
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,560
Who else could have planted them?

947
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,320
Of course it's me.

948
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,080
My master merely weeds the grass.

949
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:53,800
Is that so?

950
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,800
You also know how to plant flowers?

951
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,800
You're a real treasure.

952
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,240
Yeah, I'm too perfect.

953
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,160
That's why I can't live long.

954
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,640
Hey.

955
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,720
I'm just kidding.

956
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:08,880
Don't take it seriously, okay?

957
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:11,920
I say.

958
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,400
Even I don't mind.

959
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,120
Why do you mind?

960
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,080
It's exactly because you don't mind 

961
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,520
that I'm even more bothered.

962
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,960
I'm still trying to figure out how to cure you.

963
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,880
I hope you won't give up.

964
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Ever since I was a kid,

965
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,120
I would often hear people tell me

966
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,240
not to give up.

967
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,600
Because they all know that

968
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,960
it's not easy to do so.

969
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,840
Sometimes living with pain

970
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,320
is worse

971
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,120
than death.

972
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,000
What Mrs. Xu said that day

973
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,920
was also what you've been thinking about, right?

974
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,480
A person cannot even

975
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
decide whether they die or live.

976
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,520
People always say death is a bad thing.

977
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,040
They think that living is a good thing.

978
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,200
But death is death.

979
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,600
Just like living.

980
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,280
Death is a natural thing.

981
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,760
But why do people hate it?

982
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,400
Because...

983
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,280
Because of love and attachment, I guess.

984
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,240
People always want their loved ones

985
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,480
and the things they like

986
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,280
to exist in this world.

987
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,240
I remember when I was in college,

988
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,960
there was a senior whom I particularly respected.

989
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,000
He taught me a lot of things.

990
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,400
But later,

991
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,840
we were separated because of work.

992
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,640
So we didn't see each other anymore.

993
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,640
But one day,

994
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,320
I got news of his death.

995
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,640
I couldn't accept it.

996
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,240
Although before that

997
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,440
we hadn't connected with each other

998
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
or met up,

999
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,000
his existence in the world and non-existence

1000
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,720
are completely different for me.

1001
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,680
You're a researcher. It's not good for you

1002
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,480
to be so sentimental.

1003
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,280
I guess it's because of this,

1004
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,560
my conviction in doing research
has become stronger.

1005
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
I think medicine itself

1006
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,280
is a kind of power.

1007
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
As long as the power is strong enough,

1008
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,960
it can change the world.

1009
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,080
That's why

1010
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,400
you must persevere.

1011
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,720
I believe

1012
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,200
I will definitely cure you.

1013
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,000
Okay.

1014
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,240
Since you are so good to me,

1015
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,440
if one day I gave up,

1016
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,720
I'd give you a 20% discount
on the condolence money.

1017
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,440
Look at them, they were flirting with each other.

1018
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,480
He even patted her head.

1019
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,640
Disgusting.

1020
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,160
Why did you go to the funeral home?

1021
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,000
Because

1022
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,040
she's been pestering you,

1023
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,000
saying she wants to date you.

1024
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,120
So I'm worried.

1025
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,240
After investigating,

1026
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,800
I found that she has a backup lover,

1027
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,520
that is, this Professor Lin.

1028
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,520
That day when she caught the ghost
in the funeral home,

1029
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,840
it was Professor Lin who accompanied her.

1030
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,480
Qian.

1031
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,200
That's enough.

1032
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,400
Young Master.

1033
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,600
Even though that Professor Lin was with her,

1034
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,640
it's not a big deal,

1035
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,160
right?

1036
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,120
It's fine as long as Jin Xiaoyu
comes back home, right?

1037
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,520
Don't you know the law of love?

1038
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,120
If you want to get by,

1039
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,040
you must be happy to be a cuckold.

1040
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,920
Only by sharing girlfriends
can we save our planet.
