The most important thing
about Korean style makeup

is the highlight.

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,560
With a correct highlight,
you'll get that dewy look.

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,480
Look, just like me.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,400
Just like this.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,280
Apply it gently to have that natural look, see!

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,200
Very natural.

(Serial novel, Ms. Luosifen)
[*Luosifen is a rice noodle dish with river snails.]

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,120
(and Mr. Coffee's Love Story.)

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
(Ever since parting ways with Ms. Luosifen,)

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,440
(Mr. Coffee would often think about her.)

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,240
(Perhaps it was because their encounter
was too special,)

31
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,840
(or maybe it was because
the Luosifen was too smelly.)

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
(For the next few days,)

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
(the coffee shop smelled of Luosifen.)

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
(The second time they met)

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
(was half a year later.)

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,360
This is the place.

(Ms. Luosifen,)

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,160
(who just became the co-writer of a TV series,)

39
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,920
(brought her friends to the store to celebrate.)

Scan the code to order your food.

41
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:44,920
Miao,

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,480
you are the first from our dormitory

43
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,800
to get a screenplay writing role for a TV series!

44
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,840
It's a web series and I'm just the co-writer.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
My name is at the end of the list.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
But it's a long series!

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,360
36 episodes!

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm still stuck with writing web movies.

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,640
You guys only see the glory

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,120
and not the hard work I've put in.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
Party A bought the rights to a script,

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,720
which was a total waste of money.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Aside from the names in the series,

54
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,480
we couldn't use any lines from the script.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,040
Our team had to write

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,000
an entire new story.

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
It was so exhausting.

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
I'm planning to switch jobs
and become a web novel writer.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,960
That's not bad at all!

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,560
If your novel becomes a hit,

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,040
you can earn so much more than a screenwriter!

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,720
I hope so.

63
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,920
Here's your order.

64
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,040
Thank you.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,640
Not bad, right?

66
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,720
I told you guys it would be good.

67
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
It looks so delicious!

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,520
It looks so pretty.
I want to take a picture of it!

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,400
Thanks.

70
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,320
Are you done?

71
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,720
Waiter!

72
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm done.

73
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,280
What is wrong with you people?

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,920
I ordered the same shaved ice,

75
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
but the toppings are completely different!

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,560
Yeah!

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
The co-owner made their order especially for them.

78
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,000
Please enjoy your meal.

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,200
Miao,

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,320
is something going on?

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,440
Does your boyfriend work here?

82
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,800
When did you get a boyfriend?

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
I don't have a boyfriend.

84
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,960
Then what is going on?

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,000
Tell us the truth!

86
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,400
Confess!

87
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,320
Thank you.

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
My friends are just talking nonsense.

89
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,400
They always make fun of me.

90
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,080
I wish it were true, to be frank.

91
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,000
Did you come here

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
to make our relationship official?

93
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,560
It's okay.

94
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
I don't mind.

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Girlfriend.

96
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,400
Why haven't you been here

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
since that day?

98
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,640
I...

99
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,320
I was busy writing screenplays!

100
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,160
Do you address all your female customers

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
as your girlfriends?

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,400
How could you think of me like that?

103
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
I only said this to the girl

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,120
who asked for hot water
while we were closing shop.

105
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,200
Let's end our conversation.

106
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
(Ms. Luosifen)

107
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,840
(ran back to her seat happily.)

108
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,520
(Even though I looked calm,)

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,000
(my heart was beating like a drum.)

110
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,520
(I told myself,)

111
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,360
(doing this)

112
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,600
(would only result in two outcomes.)

113
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,520
(She would think of me as a pervert)

114
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,440
(and stay away from me.)

115
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,640
(Or)

116
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,760
(maybe she would like my little tricks.)

117
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,920
We know we're wrong.

118
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,080
We'll go outside to eat our food!

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,120
Yeah, Yueran.

120
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Don't tell on us, please.

121
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:14,800
We'll go right now.

122
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,360
I won't report you,

123
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,040
but you have to share it with me!

124
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,160
This...

125
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,640
Let me try it!

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,920
My healthy meal has no salt in it

127
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
and tastes awful!

128
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,720
Hand me a new pair of chopsticks.

129
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,720
Here, here!

130
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,600
Here you go.

131
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,720
It smells so good.

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,200
Here's some water.

133
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:38,960
Yueran,

134
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,400
you look so much prettier than before!

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,240
Tan Yueran!

136
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,640
Look at the camera!

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
I'm warning you,

138
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,360
I'll report you!

139
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
I'll report you for eating in the lab!

140
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,400
Go ahead!

141
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,680
Have fun with that!

142
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,280
Here!

143
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,640
I can't believe Tan Yueran let out a smile!

144
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,720
Yueran,

145
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,200
something's not right.

146
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Are you dating someone?

147
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
I have someone I like.

148
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,240
If you guys treat me to a meal,

149
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
I'll let you guys see him.

150
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,680
Are you serious?

151
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,640
Alright, I'll take your word for it.

152
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,680
This meal is on me.

153
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,960
Okay.

154
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
Then it's a deal.

155
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,400
You two pay for the meal,

156
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,320
I'll pay for the coffee.

157
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,720
You have my word.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,960
That's settled then.

159
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,120
Young Master.

160
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,320
An apple a day

161
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,160
keeps the doctor away.

162
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,280
Even if I don't eat apples,

163
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,200
doctors will still stay away from me.

164
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,120
Young Master,

165
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,600
why don't you go down there and check it out?

166
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,920
Someone is in a bad mood over there.

167
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,440
She looks troubled.

168
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,000
I heard

169
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,960
one of her colleagues

170
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,200
got fooled by an innocent looking wench.

171
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,960
It also seemed like she had something to do it.

172
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
That's why she feels bad.

173
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
How do you know this?

174
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,360
Well,

175
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
it's pretty normal for a girl
to share secrets with me.

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,400
I'm just too charming.

177
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,040
Right?

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,760
Here.

179
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,720
For me?

180
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,960
Would I feed this to the turtle?

181
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,840
So what's up?

182
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,200
I heard a friend of yours got fooled
by an innocent looking wench.

183
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,880
Do you have a crush on that guy?

184
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:24,840
Firstly,

185
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,120
I'm not upset about that innocent looking wench.

186
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm upset because the organ recipient

187
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,280
is illegally looking for organ donors.

188
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:32,680
Secondly,

189
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,280
I don't like him.

190
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,720
I just think he's pitiful.

191
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:36,960
Thirdly,

192
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
I have a feeling this is not
the end of the matter.

193
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,440
But I don't know what to do.

194
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,960
You think there's something wrong
with the organ recipient?

195
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,080
Yeah.

196
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Can I capture her?

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,440
Capture her?

198
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,720
What do you want to do?

199
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
You are so capable.

200
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
Can you investigate someone for me?

201
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,160
I can do it

202
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,840
as long as you move out.

203
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,240
Well, forget it then.

204
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,000
You have absolutely no sincerity!

205
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,640
Don't you know sincerity
is worth its price in gold?

206
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,200
It is!

207
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,720
But Grandma Dao offered me ten times its worth!

208
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,720
I'll give you double of that.

209
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
You don't even have an ID
or a property certificate!

210
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
How can I trust you?

211
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,880
This again.

212
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,000
Your eyebrows are too thick.

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,880
Your eyebrows are too thick!

214
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm saying,

215
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,240
if you help me look into

216
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,320
Tan Yueran's matter,

217
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,280
I will

218
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,680
give you a full body massage

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,880
and a facial care!

220
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,480
How does that sound?

221
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,200
A full body massage and a facial care?

222
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,120
What was your previous occupation?

223
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,200
What are you thinking about?

224
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,400
I'm a professional!

225
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,280
If you don't want a full body massage,

226
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,840
then I guess I have to pay with my body.

227
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,480
That is unnecessary.

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Just give me

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
a traditional Chinese therapy.

230
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,960
Deal!

231
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,800
What would you guys like to drink?

232
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,400
- We have to scan a code, right?
- Let me see...

233
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,960
Yeah.

234
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,000
Just order one for me.

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,680
Anything is fine.

236
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,120
Okay.

237
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Is it the guy over there?

238
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,840
Yeah, what do you think?

239
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
He's handsome, right?

240
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
He's a barista

241
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,960
and the owner of this place.

242
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,240
Tan Yueran,

243
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,480
you're like a whole new person

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,800
after that heart transplant!

245
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,600
Dude,

246
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,480
Tan Yueran is in love.

247
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,280
Can you believe that?

248
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
This isn't what's surprising.

249
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,800
What's surprising is

250
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,560
she's sharing this with us!

251
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,160
Stop, you two.

252
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,480
Yueran,

253
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
who was the previous owner

254
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,280
of your heart?

255
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,280
That person must be a social butterfly!

256
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,400
I agree!

257
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,520
You guys are so dramatic.

258
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,040
Was I really that introverted before?

259
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,800
No,

260
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,040
you weren't introverted.

261
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
You were just autistic!

262
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
Nonsense, shut up!

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,680
Here you go.

264
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,520
Thank you, thank you.

265
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,160
Please enjoy.

266
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,520
Give it a taste.

267
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,480
This is my boyfriend's handiwork.

268
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,920
It looks delicious!

269
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,760
Cut it out, Yueran.

270
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,640
You're making him shy!

271
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,560
He ought to feel shy.

272
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,760
Quanzhan,

273
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,280
why don't you

274
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,840
message the PhD girl!

275
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,240
You won't run into her

276
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,880
by just walking around like this.

277
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,600
What would I even say?

278
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
Just invite her to hang out with you!

279
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,720
Tell her this.

280
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,160
You can say that

281
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,400
you and your colleague are here on business

282
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,240
and it'd be nice if you could meet her.

283
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,480
That's too intentional!

284
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,240
You have to be intentional!

285
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,360
You want her to know

286
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:27,960
that you came here

287
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,280
just to find her.

288
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,920
If she doesn't want to hang out with you,

289
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
then she'll reject you.

290
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
But if she likes you,

291
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,840
or has feelings for you,

292
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,120
then she will meet up with you
no matter how busy she is!

293
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,800
Right?

294
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,680
Yeah!

295
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,240
I think you should just call her!

296
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,280
Just call her.

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:47,720
Call her?

298
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,640
Won't I disturb her?

299
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,760
What if she's in class?

300
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,280
What if she's not in class?

301
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,680
If she's busy,

302
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,600
then send a message later.

303
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,160
If she picks up your call, then it's a win!

304
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,200
Wang Quande,

305
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,720
no wonder you have a girlfriend.

306
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,440
Okay, I'll call her.

307
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,120
Hello?

308
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,280
Tan, Tan Yueran.

309
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,800
Wang Quande, who's my colleague,

310
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
and I,

311
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,120
we're near your school.

312
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,240
Somewhere nearby.

313
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,320
So I'm just wondering if you're on campus.

314
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,080
I'm not on campus.

315
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,960
I'm getting food with my seniors.

316
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,040
Here's your food.

317
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,480
Thank you.

318
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,960
I sent you some messages on WeChat before.

319
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,920
Why didn't you reply to them?

320
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,360
You're a pretty good cook, Brother-in-law!

321
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,560
Keep up the good work, Brother-in-law.

322
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,720
How about we meet up after I'm done

323
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,440
with my projects?

324
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,840
Yueran, we have to go.

325
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,440
We're leaving now.

326
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,800
Bye-bye.

327
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,480
Okay, goodbye.

328
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,080
Well...

329
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,360
Why did she hang up?

330
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,960
Busy, I guess.

331
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,640
Video games are better anyway.

332
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,040
Thank you.

333
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,680
Your friends called me brother-in-law just now.

334
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,440
I think they have the wrong impression
about our relationship.

335
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Firstly,

336
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,400
how does them calling you brother-in-law

337
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
have anything to do with me?

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,480
Secondly,

339
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,480
they were the ones that said it.

340
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,520
You should ask them.

341
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,480
Why are you asking me?

342
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:18,880
Thirdly,

343
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,280
there are two guys at the counter.

344
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,000
How do you know you are the brother-in-law

345
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,920
and I am the sister?

346
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,560
Why are you in such a rush
to put a label on yourself,

347
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
Brother-in-law?

348
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,280
See you, Brother-in-law!

349
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,280
Boss,

350
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,520
did you ask me to come here

351
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,160
to look at you make a dress?

352
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,920
I'm just mentally preparing

353
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,840
for the person that's coming.

354
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,440
A person that's coming?

355
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,480
Is someone trying on this dress later?

356
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
But you won't finish it in time!

357
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,920
I...

358
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,040
You look pissed.

359
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,840
What? You want to buy the place?

360
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,160
Is it on sale?

361
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,840
You can have it for free

362
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,960
when you get married.

363
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,040
I heard you're going on blind dates.

364
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:12,680
Well,

365
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I heard you have

366
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,960
a female cohabiting partner.

367
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,040
My apologies.

368
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,840
Always being a step ahead of you.

369
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,920
That's fine.

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,280
As long as you die

371
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
one step ahead of me, too.

372
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
I had been hoping to die

373
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,600
even before you were born.

374
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,600
Whatever. I don't care.

375
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,600
This is what you wanted.

376
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,700
(Tan Yueran, congenital heart disease)

377
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,640
Little Qian Tu is always so efficient.

378
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,920
So that's a deal?

379
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,240
One week.

380
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,760
He's at the photo studio.

381
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,440
Ask the CAO to accompany you.

382
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,720
But don't tell him

383
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,560
I am here.

384
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,080
I'm worried I might go soft on him
if I see him again.

385
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,600
Wise.

386
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,720
I'm off.

387
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,840
I see

388
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,920
you have two faces.

389
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,000
What do I do?

390
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,080
I've somehow ended up

391
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,120
like a person that's very experienced.

392
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,320
Let me see...

393
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,360
Her personal information is here.

394
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,160
Is there anything different?

395
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,560
Not too far off from what you knew.

396
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,440
This person is very introverted

397
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,200
and has congenital heart disease since childhood.

398
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,760
She suffered from extreme social anxiety

399
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
(Tan Yueran, congenital heart disease)
and was once suspected to be autistic.

400
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
Are you talking about Tan Yueran?

401
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,880
Someone who goes to a funeral home to hit on a guy

402
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,000
and treats everyone to milk tea?

403
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Yet you say she has socially anxiety

404
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,360
instead of a social butterfly?

405
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,720
That I don't know.

406
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,560
This can't be the same person!

407
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,760
Boss.

408
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,600
Can I try it on?

409
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,360
Just for a little while.

410
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:51,880

But

475
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,560
was it Jin Xiaoyu's idea
to do a photo shoot at a funeral home?

476

No,

477
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
it's our spokesperson's idea.

Lin Nuoyan!

No worries.

481
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,080
If there's anything you don't like about it,

482
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,120
you can tell me.

483
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,080
We can figure it out.

484
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Or, we'll find someone else.

485
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,040
Li can do the photo shoot as well.

486
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
It's just that his camera isn't very good.

487
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,400
Might have to borrow yours.

488
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,880
That way you don't even have to be there.

489
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,960
I think I might as well be there.

490
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,600
Dr. Cheng,

491
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,680
I've been losing sleep,

492
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,560
can you help me?

493
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,040
Come.

494
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,760
Let me check your pulse.

495
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,840
I thought you're an emergency doctor.

496
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:33,760
You know how to do pulse diagnosis, too?

497
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,600
So you know I'm an emergency doctor!

498
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,080
I deal with loss of blood,

499
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,960
not loss of sleep.

500
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,240
My bad.

501
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,360
Did I say something wrong?

502
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,720
Did I remind you of a bad memory?

503
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,640
No.

504
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm not that weak.

505
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,440
But

506
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,360
I think about her a lot lately.

507
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,760
I also met

508
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,320
a girl who's really like her.

509
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,560
That's good!

510
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,880
You know, before Cai Miao passed away,

511
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,920
she wanted me to tell you,

512
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,560
that you have to start anew.

513
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,640
I know.

514
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,600
You told me many times.

515
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,760
But that girl

516
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,800
is really like her.

517
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,800
How do I start anew?

518
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,160
It's okay!

519
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,560
As the saying goes,

520
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,520
if you have a girl around you,

521
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
could love be far away?

522
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:18,800
Take it easy.

523
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Okay.

524
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,360
We've seen everything here.

525
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,240
Is it time to show me

526
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,520
where you work?

527
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,480
We're taking pictures for the association.

528
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,840
You can't take photos of where I work.

529
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,240
I'm not taking pictures.

530
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,800
I'm just curious

531
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,120
about where you go to work.

532
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,320
Just think of it as a learning experience for me.

533
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,040
Professor Lin,

534
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
I see you are

535
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,080
a very studious person.

536
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,960
Can I

537
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
take that as a yes?

538
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,600
I guess.

539
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,800
I have a job this afternoon.

540
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
I need the help. So you can give me a hand.

541
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,160
You're professional after all.

542
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,460
(Makeup Room)

543
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
This cadaver

544
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,080
has serious ascites.

545
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,920
This is a liver cancer patient, I think.

546
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,680
Quite the expert, Professor Lin.

547
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,040
The pathology of ascites is complex.

548
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,280
It's usually related to

549
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,640
a disruption in the pressure forces

550
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,720
between intravascular
and extravascular fluid spaces.

551
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,280
But for patients with liver cancer, it's usually
because of the chronic liver cirrhosis

552
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,280
and pressure at the portal veins.

553
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,440
So what do we do about ascites in cadavers?

554
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,400
The decay prevention team
will suck out the liquid.

555
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,080
When in the prone position,

556
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,040
the liquid accumulates
at both sides of the abdomen

557
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,240
while the middle portion
of the abdomen becomes flat.

558
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,200
Tapping on it produces a dull sound.

559
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,400
No wonder people say

560
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
hard working girls are the prettiest.

561
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,640
That's you right now.

562
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,120
Mr. Lin Nuoyan,

563
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,400
can we not flirt

564
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
under this condition?

565
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,620
(Mu City Municipal Funeral Home)

566
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,520
Sorry to bother you today.

567
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,920
People say that

568
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,760
after going to the morgue,

569
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,920
you can't go home directly.

570
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,080
You should have a meal

571
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,600
or a shower before going back home.

572
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,520
Okay.

573
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,960
Thank you for today.

574
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
You taught me so much.

575
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,800
It really broadens my horizon.

576
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,720
Honestly,

577
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,080
I've always been quite interested

578
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,320
in your line of work.

579
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,800
Mainly,

580
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,720
everyone is a little bit fearful

581
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,680
of places like the morgue.

582
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,840
Sure, I study medicine,

583
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,520
but I am also very afraid of death.

584
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,400
We wrestle the Grim Reaper for people's lives.

585
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,160
Death for us

586
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,760
means failure.

587
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,000
Why am I hiding?

588
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,960
Death is like birth.

589
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,480
It's just a journey

590
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,640
in life.

591
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Like airports,

592
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,160
train stations, or harbors.

593
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,960
It's about parting.

594
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
My master told me,

595
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,440
the meaning of death

596
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,360
is to teach people how to be grateful.

597
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,760
The reason why I chose here

598
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,160
as the location to do the photo shoot
for the advertisement

599
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,840
is because I watched a movie

600
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
called "Okuribito".

601
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,280
Apart from that,

602
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
I knew you could help me.

603
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,360
I actually like the advertising slogan
you guys use.

604
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,080
"Live on in another way."

605
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,600
This, to the people who are about to die,

606
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,360
makes organ donation sound like something hopeful.

607
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,080
Congratulations.

608
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,720
You hit your target audience.

609
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,680
I'd rather you not be the target audience.

610
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,720
Especially after seeing your professional side.

611
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,640
I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you.

612
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,360
An animal in suit.

613
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,240
Stop holding her hand.

614
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,280
Then,

615
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,000
will you contribute to my funeral?

616
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,640
Since you're a professional,

617
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,680
please contribute more.

618
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,720
Sure.

619
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,200
I will.

620
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
That's a relief.

621
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
I'll head back to work.

622
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,320
If

623
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,480
you need anything, just come by.

624
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,240
Okay.

625
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,120
Let me treat you to a meal if you're free.

626
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,520
Okay!

627
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,400
I'm off.

628
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,000
This is how

629
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,200
you earthlings date, right?

630
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,160
Are you here to see me?

631
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,000
You think too much.

632
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,280
I went to buy flowers, not to see you.

633
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,120
True.

634
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,880
Then what are these flowers for?

635
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,800
To visit your ex?

636
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,560
Does your ex live here?

637
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,960
Wait up, pretty boy!

638
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,000
Where does your ex-girlfriend live?

639
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,080
Why did that perverted professor meet with you?

640
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
Like you said, for a date.

641
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,360
Seeing you two together

642
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,440
reminded me of something.

643
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,760
Of how matching two people can be?

644
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,160
I can't accompany anyone.

645
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,080
And you're the same.

646
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
To those normal people,

647
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,120
we are abnormal beings.

648
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,440
You still run your mouth like a child
even though you're so old.

649
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,960
You're not afraid of biting your tongue?

650
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,680
Even if I bite my tongue,

651
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,760
I'll heal immediately.

652
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,360
That's why drugs don't do anything for me.

653
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,400
I guess poison wouldn't work on you.

654
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,080
Chen,

655
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,040
I'm here to see you.

656
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,920
He's a guy.

657
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,940
(Grave of Great Friend Chen Zhongshun)

658
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,600
He's my classmate when I was young.

659
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,160
At bootcamp,

660
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,280
we were comrades for a month.

661
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,960
Afterwards he left for the navy

662
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,120
and stayed in Taiwan, China after the war.

663
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,560
His biggest dream

664
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,720
was to go back home.

665
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,720
But only after his death

666
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,440
did I have a chance to bring him back.

667
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,460
(1985, Taiwan, China)

668
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,400
Mr. Chen!

669
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,360
Kid, you're here!

670
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,000
Come, come.

671
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,840
Back in the day,

672
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,160
your grandpa and I

673
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,480
got on the boat from here.

674
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,680
So,

675
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,080
how is your grandfather doing?

676
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,520
He's doing well,

677
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,400
just that his legs are a bit weak.

678
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,160
Everyone's the same.

679
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,360
We're old.

680
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,120
Yeah.

681
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,520
Mr. Chen,

682
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,200
my grandfather wanted me to give you this.

683
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,840
(You told me you love me
and would hold me in your arms.)

684
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,540
(But the time to part has come.)

685
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,200
This old boy, Jiang Baiju,

686
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,200
even at this age,

687
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,640
he still thinks about Chen Mansha.

688
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,000
What?

689
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Have you forgotten about Ms. Chen?

690
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,320
No!

691
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,640
Back in those days, your grandfather and I

692
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,360
often went to Paramount.

693
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,280
The both of us tried to pursue Chen Mansha.

694
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,760
Later on, we joined the army

695
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,520
and went to the frontline.

696
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
I joined the navy,

697
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,240
he went to Yunnan and Burma.

698
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,880
We never reconnected

699
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,280
after those chaotic years.

700
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,480
Only until you found me

701
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,280
did I find out that

702
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,520
your grandfather went to America,

703
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,680
got married and had kids.

704
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,600
He also has a good grandson like you.

705
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,400
Unlike me.

706
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,880
A lonely veteran,

707
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,000
staring at the ocean every day,

708
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,520
with a home I can't go back to.

709
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Compared to your grandfather,

710
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,960
(the Man on the Flying Frapere)
I miss Chen Mansha even more.

711
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,040
Mr. Chen,

712
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,720
my grandpa told me

713
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,800
you liked to have fun when you were young.

714
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,040
He misses you a lot.

715
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,360
So he asked me to visit you more often.

716
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,640
Not anymore.

717
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,640
My legs don't work as well anymore.

718
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:17,920
That's true.

719
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
When I was young,

720
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,240
at Paramount,

721
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,440
only I could match
your grandfather's dance skills.

722
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
All the girls in Shanghai

723
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,560
knew about that.

724
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,000
Your grandfather

725
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,680
was the Prince of Night Shanghai.

726
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,520
And me,

727
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
I was the King of Dance at Paramount.

728
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,880
Since when were you the K...

729
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,120
My grandfather says

730
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,120
you know very few dance styles.

731
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,840
Not nearly as much as he did.

732
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
He talks big!

733
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,560
That guy...

734
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,360
But you.

735
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,960
You look just like

736
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,440
your grandfather when he was young.

737
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
Like an exact replica!

738
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,760
Really?

739
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,520
Back in the day,

740
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,400
I was more handsome than your grandfather.

741
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,120
I knew more moves than he did.

742
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,640
I was more popular than him.

743
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,520
He was just rich.

744
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,680
All I had was my personal charm.

745
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,640
Personal charm.

746
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,000
With your personal charm,

747
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,360
you wooed the most popular socialite,
Miss Qin Xiangjun!

748
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,240
Your grandfather can't keep his mouth shut.

749
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,880
Telling you kids all this stuff.

750
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,240
What's the big deal!

751
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
I'll go to the mainland in two days.

752
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,080
When I'm there,

753
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
I'll find Ms. Qin

754
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,880
and tell her how much you miss her.

755
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,640
Please don't!

756
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,120
She's married now.

757
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,080
She has a family now

758
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,360
and lives a stable life.

759
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,600
Don't disturb her.

760
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,880
So you don't want to know where she is?

761
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,280
Forget it.

762
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,520
I can't live with her,

763
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,160
so I shouldn't

764
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,040
disturb the peace.

765
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,360
It's fate.

766
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,400
I accept it.

767
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,360
Don't you want to know

768
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,240
if she's doing well or not?

769
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,080
Kid.

770
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Do you know?

771
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,720
Before getting to know Ms. Qin,

772
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,840
I always believed that

773
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,960
Chen Mansha was the one I was going to marry.

774
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,560
But after I met Ms. Qin,

775
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,280
that's when I knew

776
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,000
chasing a superstar

777
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,440
and chasing after the woman you love

778
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,640
are different things.

779
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I can put up pictures of Chen Mansha

780
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,920
all over my room

781
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,840
and stare at them every day.

782
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,160
But,

783
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,480
I...

784
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't dare look at photos of Ms. Qin.

785
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,520
You'll become nervous

786
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,080
when you see the woman you love.

787
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,920
You'll become afraid.

788
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,360
You'll become afraid.

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,640
Shared bicycles are everywhere,

854
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,360
but you had to ride your own bike.

855
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,320
Now we have to fix the chain!

856
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,520
This is our first date.

857
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,040
Of course I want to bring you around myself.

858
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,880
The shared bikes don't have backseats.

859
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,360
Who knew Hu's bike was this crappy?

860
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
Failing at critical moments.

861
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,360
This is the result of trying too hard.

862
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,520
Get up.

863
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,240
I got this.

864
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,120
You can't just shove the chain somewhere.

865
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,600
You have to go like this

866
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,120
and let it catch the chain.

867
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,120
There we go!

868
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,680
You're an expert!

869
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
My family owned a repairing shop in the past

870
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,840
and modified motorcycles.

871
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,280
It's nothing

872
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,440
to me.

873
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,320
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

874
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,920
You wanted to see me fumble?

875
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,240
I just wanted to give you

876
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,480
a chance to show off!

877
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,840
Who knew you are as crappy as the bike?

878
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,080
Then...

879
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,560
Mr. Fu Liang!

880
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,000
Let me get this straight.

881
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,840
I don't need you to be good at everything.

882
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,120
I don't cook, you do.

883
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,760
You don't fix bikes, I do.

884
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
In this relationship,

885
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,320
we just have to do

886
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,560
what we're good at.

887
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,920
Does that mean

888
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,840
I should reward you

889
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,520
with the touch of love?

890
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,760
Stop, Fu Liang!

891
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,400
Kitty!

892
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,960
Kitty, kitty!

893
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,920
(You will not be with me my whole life.)

894
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,320
(But I will.)

895
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,800
(I will not grow old with you.)

896
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,360
(But you will.)

897
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,520
Here you go.

898
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,680
Please enjoy.

899
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,720
Thank you.

900
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,680
I see you're the only one working today.

901
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,080
It's a Monday.

902
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,280
We don't get a lot of customers.

903
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,000
So the others will come in the afternoon.

904
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,680
(Computer Composition Principles Study Guide)
You study computing?

905
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,280
I study coding.

906
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,760
I can't fix computers.

907
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,480
Relax.

908
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,880
I won't ask you to do that.

909
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,280
But

910
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,440
can you take a look at this?

911
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,800
I went to a volunteer event.

912
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,320
I uploaded some photos just now

913
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,160
and it turned out like this.

914
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040
There will be another event in two days,

915
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
and I need to upload even more photos.

916
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,560
If it turn out like this again,

917
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,480
I would be in trouble!

918
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,560
Sure, I'll take a look.

919
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,180
(Chinese Organ Donation)

920
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,200
This website of yours

921
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,440
is not going to make money.

922
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,040
See?

923
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,240
The design is ugly.

924
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,120
The server is bad.

925
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
Did you make it?

926
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,360
I'm only in charge of taking photos.

927
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,040
The website was probably made

928
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,920
by the other two volunteers.

929
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,840
I see.

930
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,280
Give me some time.

931
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,560
She hasn't been looking for Jin Xiaoyu recently.

932
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,520
So the two of us

933
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,840
think it's very suspicious.

934
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,440
I can understand how you feel.

935
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,960
As a volunteer,

936
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,640
as Fu Liang's friends,

937
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,640
the two of you are more alert.

938
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,320
Tan Yueran's interest in the donors

939
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,520
is not something new.

940
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,280
Some time ago,

941
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,240
she complained of not sleeping well.

942
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,200
About this,

943
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
I also discussed it with Chief Fan.

944
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,000
Chief Fan says

945
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
she keeps dreaming about a guy.

946
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,840
Did she say

947
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,080
what the guy looks like?

948
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
It's not some reincarnation TV drama.

949
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,720
How could she see his face clearly?

950
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,760
As a doctor,

951
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,440
once the illness is cured,

952
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,640
it doesn't matter where the drug came from.

953
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,960
But to an organ recipient,

954
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,320
aside from the bodily rejection,

955
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,520
psychologically accepting other people's organ

956
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
is the difficult part.

957
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
That's why I want to meet

958
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,800
Chief Fan in person to have a chat.

959
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,800
Medicine is science,

960
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,800
but there are always exceptions.

961
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,800
Chief Fan can solve some of them,

962
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,280
but not all of them.

963
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,880
You're also a doctor.

964
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,960
You should know this.

965
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,480
See that little girl over there?

966
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,920
We call her Cutie.

967
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,080
She's only twelve.

968
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,920
She's also a congenital heart disease patient.

969
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,800
When Tan Yueran first moved in,

970
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,240
she didn't like to speak.

971
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,400
Cutie was always following her around.

972
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
Later on, Tan Yueran's operation went well

973
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,040
and became much more lively.

974
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,200
Cutie, on the other hand, has become low-spirited

975
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,360
because of her worsening illness.

976
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,400
To see your ward mates getting better by the day,

977
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,960
while you wait endlessly for your organ to come.

978
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,000
She must be in despair.

979
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
Even so,

980
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,640
she's still full of smiles.

981
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,840
I guess,

982
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,080
this is fate.

983
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,280
The famous Zen girl.

984
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,360
Chief Zhou,

985
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,360
I can't bear to watch this.

986
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,240
Let's hurry and leave.

987
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
If you're so soft-hearted,

988
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,320
how are you ever going to make it
in this line of work?

989
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,820
(No smoking! No yelling!)

990
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,960
I

991
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,000
normally play some...

992
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,920
(Volunteer Checkpoint)
Wang Quande.

993
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,440
Master.

994
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,120
Did you see Jin Xiaoyu?

995
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,600
I think I saw her in the garden

996
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,680
with Professor Lin.

997
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,240
The handsome professor

998
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,440
that delivers body donors here.

999
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,040
No!

1000
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
I just saw Xiaoyu

1001
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,240
taking a stroll with a handsome guy
in the graveyard.

1002
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,240
That's not Professor Lin?

1003
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:49,800
Is that so?

1004
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,400
She's not answering my calls,

1005
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,920
nor replying to my messages.

1006
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,120
I searched all over the place

1007
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
and I still can't find her!

1008
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,680
Master,

1009
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
did you come

1010
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
because you heard there was a handsome guy?

1011
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,480
Of course.

1012
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,080
Do you think I'm here to invite her
to play Mahjong with me?

1013
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,160
Not answering calls,

1014
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,400
nor responding to texts...

1015
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,960
Something is up.

1016
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:10,680
Stop talking nonsense.

1017
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Go tell everyone to report

1018
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,960
on Jin Xiaoyu's location.

1019
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,760
- Yes, Master.
- Yes, Master.

1020
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,480
Is this what humans are like after death?

1021
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,360
You were like this the last time
you were sent here.

1022
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,840
You haven't died enough?

1023
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,560
I just want a normal death.

1024
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,640
The type that would kill me in one go.

1025
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm lying down here to experience it.

1026
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,240
But why are you lying there?

1027
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,480
To experience

1028
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,120
what it feels like to lie next to you.

1029
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,680
Excuse me.

1030
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,800
Young girls like you

1031
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,200
should date more!

1032
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,760
When I was young,

1033
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,320
I visited all the big hospitals
looking for help every day.

1034
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Even in train stations, I had to do homework.

1035
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,680
My master even had some dreams back then.

1036
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,200
Telling me about all

1037
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:11,800
the possible futures I could have.

1038
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,360
Now, he just wants me
to marry someone that's alive!

1039
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,640
Has your master considered

1040
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,480
what your potential husband will do

1041
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,360
after you pass away?

1042
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,800
As a person who is close to death,

1043
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,360
I hope my potential husband

1044
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
can remember the good times we had together

1045
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,800
and move on.

1046
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
He should try to find love again

1047
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,160
and live a new life.

1048
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,200
But as someone that has such experience,

1049
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,800
I have to remind you,

1050
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,240
your wish

1051
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,880
is only your wish.

1052
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,040
Your husband

1053
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,240
might keep in his heart
the good times you two had.

1054
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,800
But he might not be able to move forward.

1055
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,640
Because whenever

1056
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,240
he sees something beautiful,
he's reminded of you.

1057
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,200
That's why it's difficult to start anew.

1058
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,000
Don't look at me like that.

1059
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,800
How do you know I'm looking at you

1060
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,720
when your eyes are closed?

1061
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,640
Jiang Baiju.

1062
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,920
In all the years you've lived,

1063
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,400
have you truly loved anyone?

1064
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,520
My parents.

1065
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,080
Aliens have parents, too?

1066
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,080
Besides your parents.

1067
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
I guess it'd be my clients.

1068
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,400
To borrow William's words,

1069
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,320
every party A

1070
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,360
is my true love.

1071
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,680
You've never been in love?

1072
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,880
Are you impressed?

1073
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,360
No way!

1074
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,960
Does it not seem that way?
