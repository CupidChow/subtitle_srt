Hello?

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,320
Anybody here?

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,640
No one?

22
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:10,880
Hello?

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,560
Hello.

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,120
William.

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Where is Jiang Baiju?

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,000
Why are you calling me at this time?

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
Not only is he here but also the love rival.

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,520
What are you talking about? What love rival?

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,840
How come I don't understand

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,800
a single word that you say?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,600
Where is he?

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm on the run.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,880
Blood almost spilt all over me.

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I'm asking you where Jiang Baiju is.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,160
Can you answer my question?

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,560
He's at the company,

37
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,480
taking pictures as the love rival
tries on the clothes.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,080
You can

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,480
ask him about it yourself tonight.

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,040
I'm busy.

41
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,760
I'm hanging up.

42
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,720
Wait!

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,040
He's ridiculous!

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,640
Jiang Baiju, photo studio.

45
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,800
Should be on the 18th floor.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,120
M-Mr. Assistant.

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,640
Are you sure this is for me?

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Yeah, look.

49
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
The top

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,000
was designed based on free-range chicken,

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,360
along with your ripped bell-bottoms.

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,240
When you're wearing them,

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,560
they perfectly explain what it means

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
to fly freely.

55
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,600
I'd like to ask...

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,080
Jin Xiaoyu.

57
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,440
Excuse me.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,880
Sorry.

59
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,600
But Mr. Assistant,

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,920
I think this set of clothes is really...

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,160
Not right.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
I-I'll sort you out.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,400
Thank you.

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
Do you know that girl?

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,440
Jin Xiaoyu?

66
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,000
I do.

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,880
She's a very close friend of mine.

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
I don't know

69
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,880
what she came here for.

70
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,360
Do you know each other well?

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,320
Yeah.

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,720
She grows plants,

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,280
and knows traditional Chinese medicine and herbs.

74
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,400
She's nice and straightforward.

75
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,520
It appears

76
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,000
she's your type of girl.

77
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:54,760
Indeed.

78
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,800
What?

79
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,000
I often see her in the company.

80
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,880
Her boyfriend works here.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,520
Really?

82
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,600
You didn't know?

83
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,560
I didn't know she got a boyfriend.

84
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,880
But it doesn't concern me

85
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,760
whether she has a boyfriend or not.

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,880
I still like her.

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,040
But it'll affect their relationship.

88
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
If so,

89
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
then I think that boyfriend of hers

90
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,600
lacks confidence.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,200
You know what?

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
The clothes are pretty good.

93
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Over time,

94
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,600
it gets pleasing to the eye.

95
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,280
I'll change another set for you.

96
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
The free-range chicken isn't your style.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,440
Come.

98
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
I'll find you another one.

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,720
I think it's pretty nice.

100
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,200
Come.

101
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
What the heck?

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,440
Is this
a "My Bossy Love Rival Falls for Me" drama?

103
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,280
Jin Xiaoyu.

104
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,640
What are you doing here?

105
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,120
Are you here to steal things?

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,760
Did you see me steal anything?

107
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
I brought this here. It's still warm.

108
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,000
When I stepped into the door,

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,880
you were mumbling

110
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,360
"My bossy love rival falls for me."

111
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,000
I was just considering a serious problem.

112
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,240
Just being nosy.

113
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,480
Does Young Master like men

114
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,800
or women?

115
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,280
Or both?

116
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Young Master likes the entire human species.

117
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,320
No wonder he doesn't like William.

118
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,680
Qian Cheng, I'm telling you...

119
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,400
Jin Xiaoyu,

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,240
why are you here?

121
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,560
I...

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Don't be so mean.

123
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,800
Young Master is a virtuous gentleman.

124
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
Yes, virtuous.

125
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,360
His physical condition

126
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,280
leaves him no choice but to be virtuous.

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,160
He doesn't have a girlfriend, right?

128
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,280
So what if he doesn't.

129
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,520
One can choose any way he likes

130
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,160
to live his life.

131
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,720
Alright, alright.

132
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,880
Alright, alright.

133
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,720
Go, go, go.

134
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Stop, stop. Go, go, go.

135
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,240
- My daughter
- My mom

136
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,960
- is a fool.
- is a fool.

137
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,880
Bella,

138
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,200
I watched your TV show.

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,400
You played the young female lead

140
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,440
in "The Legend of Mingyue".

141
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,040
Right?

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
I filmed that when I was five.

143
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,160
I just got into the business,

144
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,760
and my acting wasn't very good.

145
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,160
You can watch my TV show from two years ago.

146
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,160
"The Running Happiness".

147
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,520
That's better.

148
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,200
Xu Nan,

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,640
what do you do?

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,760
I worked in a school.

151
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,400
I was in charge of office support
and educational administration.

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,960
Not a teacher?

153
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,520
I didn't teach.

154
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
I managed chores in school.

155
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,000
I know.

156
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
In a film crew,

157
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,760
there's a similar position called craft service.

158
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,920
Are you married?

159
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,520
Look at how old I am.

160
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,120
Of course, I'm married.

161
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,320
My husband

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
died last year.

163
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,120
It's so good

164
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,720
that someone's waiting for you
on the other side.

165
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,160
My parents are divorced.

166
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,440
I've never seen my paternal grandparents.

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,240
And my mom isn't close to
her parents, either.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,320
The point is, they're all alive.

169
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,000
When I'm dead, I'll be all alone.

170
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,920
That's so annoying.

171
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,400
Don't worry about it.

172
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,160
If I go there before you,

173
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,360
I'll be waiting for you.

174
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,960
If I die after you,

175
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,560
I'll send my husband a message

176
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,960
asking him to look after you.

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,080
Thanks.

178
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,280
Cute girl.

179
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,960
I'm pretty, aren't I?

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Yeah.

181
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
I'll show you my boyfriend.

182
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,680
He's super handsome.

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,440
You've got a boyfriend already?

184
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,840
Look.

185
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
(Organ Donation Volunteer Association)
His name is Lin Nuoyan.

186
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,720
He's a professor.

187
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,880
I was seen by a group of doctors in his lab.

188
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,920
He was in charge of the lab.

189
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
Look. Awesome, right?

190
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,880
Organ Donation Volunteer Association?

191
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,160
He's a professor specialized in organ donation?

192
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,280
No. Look.

193
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,280
He's the spokesman of organ donation events.

194
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,480
These are non-profit events.

195
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,080
When I'm dead,

196
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,360
I'll donate

197
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,800
all of my organs

198
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,520
to those who are in need.

199
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
Lin Nuoyan said

200
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,440
there's a shortage of children's organs.

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
I'm going to donate

202
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,360
my corneas

203
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,440
and my heart.

204
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,400
You're like an adult.

205
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,040
You know everything.

206
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,760
I'm going to contribute to the society.

207
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,680
I'm an actress.

208
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm a public figure.

209
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm going to set an example

210
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,120
for my fans and all the young people

211
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
to inspire them.

212
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,440
You're quite silver-tongued. Well done.

213
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,160
Xu Nan.

214
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,960
Why don't you donate yours as well?

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,200
Let's donate together.

216
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,760
But

217
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,200
you're old.

218
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,080
I guess your organs aren't needed.

219
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
You can donate your body

220
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
to the medical school for experimental purposes.

221
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,800
Will they want me?

222
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,440
Hold on.

223
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,120
I'll call a volunteer.

224
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
She'll give you some information.

225
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,120
Hello?

226
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,480
Cheng Weilan,

227
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,440
I'm Bella. Do you have a minute?

228
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
If you do, can you come to us?

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm here with Xu Nan.

230
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,560
You can tell her about body donation.

231
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,200
Okay, I'll wait.

232
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,140
(Radiological Department)

233
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
That little girl Bella

234
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,320
is really slick.

235
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,240
She's trying to convince
Mrs. Xu to donate her body,

236
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,200
and has asked me to share some information.

237
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,360
She's an actress, right?

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
What's her illness?

239
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,880
Leukemia.

240
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,040
She's got a sad life.

241
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,000
She came from a single-parent family.

242
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
It's a blessing

243
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
that she's pretty,

244
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,680
but unfortunately, the illness found her.

245
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,240
The two of them

246
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,480
get on quite well.

247
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm sure they share common topics.

248
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,120
I guess

249
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,320
they received too much pressure from their family.

250
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,080
Xiaoyu,

251
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,800
do you also feel pressured at times,

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
like Mrs. Xu and Bella?

253
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,280
You want the truth?

254
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,400
I want the truth.

255
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,200
Every time my illness relapsed, I'd pray

256
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,640
that you were not on duty.

257
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,600
The last thing I'd like to see

258
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,480
is your anxious looks by the sickbed.

259
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,640
You and Liu Meina

260
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,720
would keep yelling next to me

261
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,400
just like two old wives.

262
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
You are really noisy.

263
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,640
You heartless woman.

264
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,480
I was anxious to save you,

265
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,360
yet you call me noisy.

266
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,080
I know that you scold me

267
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,760
for my own good.

268
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,200
Just like how I'm afraid you'd be attacked

269
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,640
during a medical dispute.

270
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Sometimes,

271
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,400
we ourselves would think it's no big deal,

272
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
but in the eyes of those who love us,

273
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,400
it'd be super important.

274
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,080
Like how your mother's worried
that you may die alone,

275
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
or how you're worried that I may die young,

276
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
and how I'm worried that no one would bury Master.

277
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,960
So to you,

278
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,000
I only rank second.

279
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,400
I thought we were the most important
to each other.

280
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:35,960
Sorry,

281
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
to me, you only rank No. 2,

282
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,640
right behind my master.

283
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,440
I'm fine with being behind Mr. Ge.

284
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,360
I warn you, no handsome guy

285
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
is allowed to cut the line.

286
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,440
What handsome guy?

287
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,160
You're gossipy.

288
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
You're too gossipy. I'm off.

289
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,880
Guilty, huh?

290
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,960
When I'm gone,

291
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
you'll have all of my assets.

292
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,800
Really?

293
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,400
My dear,

294
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,120
just rest in peace.

295
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,240
I promise you I'll get remarried.

296
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,720
All right, you've exposed yourself.

297
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,760
You've found another guy, right?

298
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,280
Yeah.

299
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,680
That Lin guy, right?

300
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I knew that was why you put

301
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,000
the turkey outfit on him.

302
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,160
If the turkey outfit is too much for a man,

303
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,200
then he's not a real man.

304
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,160
I don't know what's the purpose of my life.

305
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm busy every day at work

306
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,440
and I have to listen to your babbling at home.

307
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
I'd rather be dead.

308
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,600
Don't be mad.

309
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,280
I'm really busy at work lately.

310
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,120
The anniversary is near.

311
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,080
We have trouble getting the artists.

312
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,720
William,

313
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,720
as the anniversary draws near,

314
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
lost Miss Qin Rong.

315
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Many sponsors withdrew because of that.

316
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,960
But I saw many artists

317
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
posted their invitations
to Qing'ai anniversary event online.

318
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,200
It's already got so much attention.
Qin Rong isn't essential, right?

319
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,800
You need to reach a balance

320
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,200
when inviting the artists.

321
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,720
Yes, this year, William

322
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,240
has invited a lot of artists of high popularity,

323
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,240
and it is a good idea.

324
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,240
You know, they draw attention.

325
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
But he didn't reach out

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,960
to all those movie stars

327
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,040
and veteran actors or actresses.

328
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
It appears that William

329
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,760
is leading Qin Rong

330
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
by the nose,

331
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
but her works and the awards that she won

332
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,120
are all first-rate ones in the show biz.

333
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
I do know some veteran performers.

334
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,920
You know them?

335
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,040
Who?

336
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,120
But they're all cold.

337
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
It's fine that they aren't popular anymore.

338
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,400
As long as they're veteran performers...

339
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,280
They're dead.

340
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,320
Dead?

341
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,320
Then why did you bring them up?

342
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,120
Calm down.

343
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,160
Sit up straight.

344
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,000
What?

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,920
Do you need any service

346
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
from me?

347
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
Earlier,

348
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,400
you said after dealing with Tan Yueran,

349
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,640
you'd give me a full set of

350
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,840
Chinese traditional massage.

351
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,080
Yes.

352
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:24,920
Do it.

353
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,960
Now?

354
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,800
Yeah.

355
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,400
Come on.

356
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,880
All right.

357
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,120
Distinguished VIP customer,

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,280
my service begins now.

359
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,960
Okay.

360
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,120
What?

361
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,920
What is it?

362
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Why is my face covered?

363
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,240
I'm trying to make you relax.

364
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,840
Follow my lead, okay?

365
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,640
Fine, I'll trust you.

366
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,120
Shall we begin?

367
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,800
Can you not talk?

368
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
When I serve you,

369
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,240
you cannot make a sound.

370
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,680
Okay.

371
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,560
Keep your mouth shut.

372
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,200
I can speak.

373
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,040
Don't answer or make a sound.

374
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,800
Don't move, either.

375
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,040
It's pretty creepy.

376
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,240
This seems ridiculous,

377
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,960
but in my lifetime,

378
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,880
I don't think I'd see you at my workplace.

379
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,720
I wish you happiness.

380
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,560
Whether you live 100 years

381
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,720
or 200,

382
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,080
I wish you good health, happiness,

383
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,480
peace and joy.

384
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,080
When William is gone,

385
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,200
my happy days will come.

386
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,520
Why did you speak again?

387
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,560
I told you not to speak.

388
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:12,960
Okay.

389
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,520
I won't. I'll just listen.

390
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,480
Tell me about

391
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,440
the one who played chess with you.

392
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
And the old lady at the funeral home.

393
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,360
What's the name of the one
who played chess with you?

394
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,960
Actually,

395
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,040
I don't know the lady
I played chess with very well.

396
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,920
Liu Meina always plays chess with her.

397
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
Liu Meina's Cheng Weilan's colleague.

398
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,120
She's the only one who's happy
to play chess with that lady.

399
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,200
But

400
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,240
I only found out that her name's Xia Qi

401
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,720
after she passed away.

402
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,200
Yes, that's right.

403
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,400
She really is Xia Qi.
[*"Xia Qi" sounds the same as "playing chess" in Chinese.]

404
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,880
Don't make a sound.

405
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,360
All right.

406
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,720
I will now shape your eyebrows.

♪My hair is still long♪

409
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
Actually,

410
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,520
I don't know much about the checkers lady.

411
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
I just know she's into checkers,

412
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,200
telling ghost stories and gossips.

413
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
It was before she died did I know

414
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,280
that she was a geologist.

415
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,600
And she was very reputable in her field.

416
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,600
She never got married.

417
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,480
She traveled all over the country

418
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
and had written many books.

419
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Before she died,

420
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,160
she left a gift to her friends.

421
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
She led a very happy life.

422
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,080
As for

423
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,760
the old lady at the funeral home.

424
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,840
She and her husband loved each other.

425
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Her husband died and she's sick.

426
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
Her filial daughter and son-in-law work very hard

427
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,000
to put her in the VIP ward,

428
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,160
so that she can get the best treatment.

429
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,560
But what they don't know is,

430
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,240
their love for her

431
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,160
is a heavy burden.

432
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Their family wants them to live longer,

433
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,840
even though it's going to be painful.

434
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,600
Thus, life becomes a burden as well.

435
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,800
Honey,

436
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,720
look at

437
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,440
what I've got for Mother.

438
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Look.

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,160
I bought a new vacuum cup for Mom.

440
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,080
It's nice, right?

441
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,080
What's the matter?

442
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,800
I just feel a bit bad.

443
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,640
Don't go in there yet.

444
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,460
(Receipt)

445
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,120
I've got a part-time stenography job
for a meeting.

446
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,080
I won't be around during the weekend.

447
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,920
Don't worry.

448
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,480
I've got it.

449
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,000
I keep doing extra work to make money,

450
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
but she insists on getting out of the hospital.

451
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,960
She even called me ill-tempered.

452
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,560
I went in

453
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,000
and saw all the unwashed clothes,

454
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,320
so naturally I got mad.

455
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,480
She's never on her family's side.

456
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,160
All right.

457
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,320
She's old and sick.

458
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't be mad at her.

459
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
She's my mom,

460
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,360
how can I be mad at her?

461
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,960
In her final days,

462
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,040
I only want the best for her.

463
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,600
Human beings

464
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,880
have no control over their birth,

465
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,920
nor their death.

466
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,480
We're constantly bound by ethics, morals, beliefs,

467
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,320
and all kinds of emotions.

468
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,120
But when there's only

469
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,000
misery and torture in life,

470
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,560
how do we face such a life?

471
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,760
All right, time for the stitch.

472
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,560
It appears no stitch is needed.

473
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,440

♪Have you by the side♪

516
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,920
Cut.

517
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,760
Don't you think that the hero
and heroine's meeting

518
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
is too unromantic?

519
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
Do they have to meet in front of the funeral,

520
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,920
while spinning as well? That's so cliche.

521
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:37,960
It's unromantic?

522
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,120
Spinning is a form of artistic expression.

523
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,200
Spin, jump, close your eyes.

524
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,400
It represents love at first sight.

525
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,960
Do you remember the first time

526
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,040
you and Young Master met?

527
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,880
It was as if the time froze

528
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,000
and the world was spinning.

529
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,280
You reminded me.

530
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,680
Speak.

531
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,320
When I watched the bus fall,

532
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,200
I spun like this.

533
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,320
You don't deserve

534
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,880
to study art.

535
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,280
You know nothing about resonance.

536
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
I can't be bothered speaking with you.

Body preservation operators.

These are both my textbooks.

542
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,040
I'll bring the books on
how to write elegiac couplets the next time.

543
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,360
Are these what you were taught in school?

544
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
How did you turn in your homework?

545
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,120
The same as everybody.

546
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,520
Perfect.

548
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,040
Elegiac Couplet Writing.

549
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,600
I'm not bragging,

550
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,840
but back then, my homework

551
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
was used as an example for the juniors

552
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,040
by our teacher.

553
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,920
It was the prime time of my life.

554
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,680
Unbelievable.

Elegiac Couplet Writing.

556
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,960
It sounds pretty familiar.

557
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,800
Familiar to you?

558
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,080
The dead's eyes are closed.

559
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Jin Xiaoyu,

560
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,280
your massage yesterday

561
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,840
is how you do makeup on a dead person, right?

562
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,600
No, no. You got it wrong.

563
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,240
How is that possible?

564
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,760
That's ridiculous. I'm off.

565
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,760
But yesterday...

566
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,880
Bye-bye.

567
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,400
Young Master,

568
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,160
your relationship is even more dramatic

569
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,080
than my novel.

570
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,200
How's it going with Peng Na?

571
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,400
We're still discussing.

572
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,520
She asked for...

573
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
She asked for exclusive cover
of the anniversary brochure.

574
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Is that a joke?

575
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,000
The cover includes 12 stars.

576
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,120
Does she think she's equal to 12 stars?

577
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,280
Plus,

578
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,320
if she attends,

579
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,440
and the other 11 do not,

580
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,400
how would the celebration continue?

581
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,600
Calm down, Mr. Liu.

582
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,920
I know that.

583
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,120
That's why I'm still negotiating.

584
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,960
Qian Cheng.

585
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,480
Hi, Miss Xue.

586
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,040
Hello.

587
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
- William didn't come.
- Come on, watch it.

588
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,520
I came to see you.

589
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,480
People may see us.

590
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,280
What are you doing?

591
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,520
Answer me a question.

592
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,200
Who will be

593
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,120
William's dancing partner for the celebration?

594
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,440
Anyway it's not me.

595
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,600
I won't let you go

596
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,640
unless you tell me.

597
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,360
Then people will take pictures

598
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,640
and send them to your brother.

599
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:11,920
Also.

600
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
I haven't settled the score with you

601
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
for locking me up last time.

602
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,360
Miss Xue,

603
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,360
you can ask him directly.

604
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,160
Why give me a hard time?

605
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,400
If I ask him directly,

606
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,480
will he tell me?

607
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,800
All he does is lie to me, that jerk.

608
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,680
You know he's a jerk,

609
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,600
then why don't you just forget about him?

610
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,360
What's the matter with you?

611
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,640
Do you have to choose a playboy?

612
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,960
Yes, he is a jerk,

613
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,600
but that doesn't stop me from liking him.

614
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,320
Tell me who his dance partner is going to be?

615
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,000
What will you do once I tell you?

616
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,440
Break the girl's leg,

617
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,560
so William has to take you

618
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,560
because he has no other choice?

619
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,840
What a good idea.

620
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,240
What's in it for me

621
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,440
if I tell you?

622
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,040
Let me see.

623
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,000
I know

624
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,080
that you lost Qin Rong,

625
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,920
your spokeswoman.

626
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,600
I've got an option

627
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,560
better than Qin Rong.

628
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,040
But I can only hook you up,

629
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,160
you'll have to convince that person yourself.

630
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,520
Who is it?

631
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
Yang Xue'er.

632
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,320
For real?

633
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,040
She won best actress
of the three major film awards this year.

634
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,160
And her work won
the Best Foreign Language Film nomination.

635
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,920
Compared with her,
Qin Rong is just an outdated carpet star.

636
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,160
I reached out to their team,

637
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,080
but I was turned down.

638
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,840
Yang Xue'er never takes part
in commercial activities

639
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,080
and she only signs with international brands.

640
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,320
She won't even accept being an ambassador.

641
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,200
She's only interested in the title of spokeswoman.

642
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,080
Ours is a non-profit activity, right?

643
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,560
I can ask my mom to hook you up.

644
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,240
Will your mom really do it?

645
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,560
I don't think that's a good idea.

646
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,200
Suit yourself.

647
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,000
Deal.

648
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Stamp.

649
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,380
(Ambulance)

650
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,400
What's wrong?

651
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,440
She bit me.

652
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,200
For no reason,

653
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,920
the patient in the van lost control and bit her,

654
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,760
and wouldn't let go.

655
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,800
What about the patient?

656
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,880
She's gone.

657
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,840
I'll send the body to the morgue.

658
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
(Duty Room)
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

659
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,000
Dr. Liu will get you vaccinated later.

660
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,920
Don't be afraid.

661
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,400
Dr. Cheng,

662
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,480
when we were in the van,

663
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,440
the person was breathless,

664
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,040
how did she bite me?

665
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,000
Medically speaking, it's called fake reanimation.

666
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,440
It's no big deal. Don't worry.

667
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,120
I know that.

668
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,440
But I experienced dead people opening eyes,

669
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,600
exhaling, or farting,

670
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,960
how can a dead person bite?

671
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,680
Now, now.

672
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,720
Dr. Liu will be here soon.

673
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,400
Don't be afraid.

674
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,920
It's fine. I'll bring you to get vaccinated.

675
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,000
Where's the body?

676
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,920
In the morgue.

677
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,640
Let's wait and hear from the legal examiner
after the autopsy.

678
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,080
Okay.

679
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:42,960
Have you heard it?

680
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,240
What was it?

681
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,560
This is the first time I heard of such things.

682
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,880
Stop talking about it.

683
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:47,680
Dr. Cheng.

684
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,200
Alright.

685
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,680
Dr. Liu, get her vaccinated now.

686
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,440
Go, go. Quickly.

687
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,320
William's dancing partner is Jin Xiaoyu,

688
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,720
who works at the municipal funeral home.

689
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,000
She works as a funeral makeup artist.

690
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,600
She's got a simple family background.

691
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,440
You can break her legs however you like.

692
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,200
My Lady, I was told

693
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,120
that Jin Xiaoyu would come to see a doctor today
here in the hospital.

694
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,800
Good. Go find her.

695
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,560
Yes.

696
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,040
It's my day off today.

697
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,880
Are you going to start a graveclothes business?

698
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
What graveclothes business?

699
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,240
Yes, on the surface, I'm a designer,

700
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,960
but in fact, I'm a web writer on the side.

701
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,320
Oh, wow. Impressive.

702
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,800
Please, no unnecessary courtesy between us.

703
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,320
Don't you feel hot?

704
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,720
I do. I've been wearing this for the whole day.

705
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,240
I'll help you take it off.

706
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,720
Put it on when she comes out later.

707
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,160
Okay.

708
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,430
Oh, right.

709
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,600
Aren't you scared?

710
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
What if she got bitten by a zombie?

711
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,240
It'd be like Resident Evil in real life.

712
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,000
You wrote too many novels, didn't you?

713
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm a medical worker.

714
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,680
I believe in science, okay?

715
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,680
She doesn't look like her at all.

716
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,640
Qian Cheng must have given me
the wrong information.

717
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,320
Plus,

718
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,000
the bitten girl is fine.

719
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,040
I don't care if she's fine or not.

720
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,560
I only care if you're fine.

721
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,840
Can you stop flirting with me?

722
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,240
I've got my love in anime.

723
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,840
I'm your love in real life.

724
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,200
You don't like handsome guys?

725
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,880
Of course, I do.

726
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,960
But I don't see
why it has anything to do with you.

727
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,480
I think we lack certain communication
and mutual understanding.

728
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,760
It happens that our company
will hold an anniversary ball,

729
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
and I'd like you to be my dancing partner.

730
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,640
Well, I am

731
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,440
lovely and versatile,

732
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,640
but sadly, I don't know how to dance.

733
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,720
That's exactly what I wanted.

734
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,520
I just need you to be there.

735
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,560
I'd rather be dismembered.

736
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,760
Cheng Weilan, let's go.

737
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,360
Coming.

738
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,720
Please don't turn me down.

739
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,920
Wait.

740
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,700
(Autopsy Room II)

741
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,920
Wait here if you like.

742
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,240
I...

743
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,080
What's so good about her?

744
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,400
My Lady, we've checked.

745
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
The doctor is named Cheng Weilan.

746
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
She's Jin Xiaoyu's best friend.

747
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,480
Qian Cheng must have

748
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,880
confused one with another.

749
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,000
I want more information about the doctor.

750
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,080
So far, we only know she works
in the emergency department.

751
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,320
Her mom used to be

752
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,880
the chief of the emergency department.

753
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,400
A medical family, huh?

754
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,000
Quite professional.

755
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,720
My Lady,

756
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,840
would you consider getting a chef certificate?

757
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,720
Darn it.

758
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,520
Young Master,

759
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,920
I'd like to know about the car accident

760
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,920
while transporting Gao Guofu's body

761
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,480
to the province capital for examination

762
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,520
that happened before my brother's investigation.

763
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,720
What's the result?

764
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
I told you many times.

765
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
Your brother and I will see to it.

766
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
Your main task

767
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,120
is to let Chief Fan cure you,

768
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,560
got it?

769
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,880
My sickness is stable.

770
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,160
It's always been stable at the worst.

771
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,240
I've never been well.

772
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,520
What on earth happened back then?

773
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
I've got a meeting with Yang Xue'er's agent.

774
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,480
I won't come home for dinner.

775
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,400
I thought you were on duty, right?

776
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:13,640
Young Master,

777
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,840
you need to learn how to cook by yourself.

778
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,600
Why are you still here?

779
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,640
I'm waiting for you.

780
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,320
You put the jacket on me?

781
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,560
Do you think

782
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,200
I'd buy such a large-size jacket?

783
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,720
Who did, then?

784
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,680
You never heard,

785
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,600
not to sleep near the morgue or cemetery before?

786
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,520
Its owner may come to find you tonight.

787
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
Why would he want to see me?

788
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,760
What do you think?

789
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,280
Where are we going? I'm hungry.

790
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,160
Let's go get some food.

791
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,520
Mrs. Xue treated my boss to lunch

792
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,960
to fill the activity in Xue'er's schedule.

793
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Mr. Qian, you're quite bold.

794
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,360
I didn't mean to force you into anything.

795
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
I just wanted to express my sincerity.

796
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,480
Miss Yang Xue'er

797
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,440
won every major award this year.

798
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,520
Instead of getting proud,

799
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,760
she's become more discreet,

800
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,640
which I admire.

801
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,840
The 30th anniversary of Qing'ai Group

802
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,080
is a charity activity. It's non-commercial.

803
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
We fund projects
concerning medical care, education,

804
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
and donation to women in poverty-stricken areas.

805
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,800
I hope you can take some time to learn it.

806
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,880
When it comes to film projects,

807
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,200
Xue'er always respects the choices
that our team makes.

808
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,600
But when it comes to activities,

809
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,000
we respect the choices that she makes.

810
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,960
Then for this celebration,

811
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,240
what is Miss Yang's opinion?

812
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,200
Though Mrs. Xue stepped in
and our boss made a guarantee,

813
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,800
you should still try harder.

814
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,840
Fortunately, Xue'er proposed to have a meeting.

815
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,040
After Xue'er checked the plan,
she did her homework.

816
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,600
And she studied your brand.

817
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,560
She's quite fond of Mrs. Dao,

818
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,640
and she's interested
in the third-generation designer

819
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,960
of yours.

820
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,680
The third-generation designer?

821
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,240
Dao Ruifeng?

822
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:20,800
Yes.

823
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,240
She saw Mr. Dao Ruifeng's work before.

824
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,320
She was very into the collection
of Zhuangzhou Dreamt of Butterfly

825
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,840
created in the new designers competition.

826
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,200
She asked to see Dao Ruifeng?

827
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,880
If it's okay,

828
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,560
you can arrange a tour in Qing'ai for Xue'er.

829
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,080
Let her see if your ready-to-wear clothes

830
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,200
are designed with sincerity or not.

831
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,520
And then, Mr. Dao Ruifeng

832
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,840
can talk to Xue'er

833
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,400
while I'll be saying some nice words about you.

834
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,960
That'll do it.

835
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Great. No problem.

836
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,920
He's ill?

837
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,600
38.5 degrees centigrade.

838
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,720
How come?

839
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,920
What did you do to him?

840
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,360
He went to the hospital

841
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,480
and harassed Cheng Weilan on his own

842
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,880
and fell asleep outside the morgue.

843
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,440
It's not my fault.

844
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,800
Maybe he's got a cold.

845
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,680
Noted.

846
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,840
You're done living.

847
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,000
Look at this guy.

848
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,200
Can he be a CEO?

849
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,440
He'll bring down your company.

850
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,360
Who do you think I will choose

851
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,040
between William

852
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
and Qian Cheng?

853
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
There is no way out I guess.

854
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,080
Oh, right.

855
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,120
The patient who bit the nurse in the ambulance

856
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,360
might have something to do with Gao Guofu.

857
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,040
Look.

858
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,320
This is the picture of the body
that Weilan sent me.

859
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,600
The cyanosis on the body

860
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,680
is the same as that on Gao Guofu's.

861
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,520
And there was no rigor mortis,

862
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,600
no livor mortis, only cyanosis.

863
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,240
Qian Tu sent me the conversation recording

864
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:46,840
between him and Tan Yueran.

865
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,200
Tan Yueran said she found

866
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,040
this illegal clinic online.

867
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,720
And every time she went to Zhao Shan
for reexaminations,

868
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
he'd check her body thoroughly,

869
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,120
and made detailed reports on all indicators.

870
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,080
It sounds like

871
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,440
he was recording the conditions
of the pill-takers.

872
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,880
Think about it,

873
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,840
Gao Guofu had livor mortis,

874
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,120
the patient with leprosy

875
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,320
only had a little livor mortis,

876
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,040
and this one

877
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,440
has no livor mortis at all.

878
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,000
Gao Guofu and the leprosy patient

879
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,920
died, plain and simple.

880
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,600
Whereas this body

881
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,880
could still move after death.

882
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,800
It means after death,

883
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,680
though his brain and heart stopped functioning,

884
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,240
his muscle was still active.

885
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,200
It's an upgrade!

886
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,080
Yes, the specific drug has been upgraded.

887
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,880
They are doing experiments

888
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
on those who take the pills.

889
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,640
Zhao Shan is doing experiments on them.

890
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,640
That's why he examined Tan Yueran's body.

891
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,880
I think the other pill-takers

892
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,800
were examined in different ways, too.

893
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,600
They'd upgrade the pill

894
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,520
based on the conditions of the patients.

895
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,840
So they're on the constant lookout
for new experimental subjects.

896
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:04,380
(Outpatient  Service Pay/Registration)

897
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,040
Miss, do you know

898
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,040
if the doctors of the TCM Department
in this hospital are any good?

899
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,040
Pretty average.

900
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,800
Pretty average?

901
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,320
My man has got cancer.

902
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,920
He's beyond saving,

903
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,960
so we figured we could try
traditional Chinese medicine.

904
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,480
We bought the herbs and paid the bills.

905
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,040
But you told me the doctors are pretty average.

906
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,120
Your family got cancer, too?

907
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,640
Yours, too?

908
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,720
We've got a patient at home,

909
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,440
we can't just abandon them, right?

910
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,320
But they really cost a lot of money.

911
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,280
That's true.

912
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,240
Even if it's a giant hole, we have to fill it.

913
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,600
We do the best we can.

914
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,800
Think about it.

915
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,520
If I was sick,

916
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,280
my mother would sell everything she owns
for my treatment.

917
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,880
That's all the more why I can't abandon her.

918
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,960
I want her to live a good life.

919
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,880
My dad is gone.

920
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,960
If my mother is gone, too,

921
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,280
I won't have a family.

922
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,000
Yes, they're our family, after all.

923
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,960
We can't just abandon them.

924
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,760
What are you doing?

925
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,080
How about

926
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,840
you ask the doctors here to prescribe
some traditional Chinese medicine for your mother?

927
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,520
See if it works

928
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,120
along with nourishments.

929
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,560
What cancer does your husband have?

930
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,520
Pancreatic cancer.

931
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,040
That's not easy to treat.

932
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,840
Indeed.

933
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,400
But lately,

934
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,640
a kind of nourishment I bought kind of worked.

935
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,160
The doctor said my man is getting better.

936
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,000
What kind of nourishment?

937
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,640
A foreign medicine.

938
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,200
You know,

939
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,120
you can't buy it in a hospital.

940
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,640
I know.

941
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,240
Is that expensive?

942
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,240
Not expensive.

943
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,280
But you can't tell others about it.

944
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,200
Will it work?

945
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,320
It's cancer already.

946
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,680
They're going to die with or without it.

947
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,120
Just take a gamble.

948
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,840
Ma'am,

949
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,040
wait.

950
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,720
Then, have a good rest.

951
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
I'll take my leave first.

952
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Thank you.

953
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,320
Mom.

954
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,240
This is a kind of nourishment

955
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,560
that I asked my friend to buy from abroad.

956
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,840
It's said to work especially well.

957
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,000
You wasted money again.

958
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,800
It isn't expensive.

959
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,120
Mom, take one pill

960
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,520
every day.

961
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,480
Got it?

962
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,640
Got it.

963
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,080
I'll put them in the drawer for you.
