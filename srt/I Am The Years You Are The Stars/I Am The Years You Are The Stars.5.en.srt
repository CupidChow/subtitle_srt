145

Recently, he came back
because he missed his family.

She studies in a local college.

Let me think.

153
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,840
Think?

154
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
Acquaintances.

155
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
Let me think.

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,400
What are you doing?

157
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I remember now! I remember now!

158
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
He has an acquaintance called

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
Zhao Shan.

160
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,400
- Zhao Shan.
- I also made him an ID card.

161
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,000
But I don't know if he's using it.

162

Gao Guofu

163
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,680
calls him Shan.

164
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,280
He said his last name is Zhao.

165
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,160
I figured his name is Zhao Shan.

166
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
This man should be a doctor.

167
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,000
He has that

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,400
hospital smell.

169
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,520
I have a dog.

170
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
It's normally very aggressive.

Barking at everyone.

172
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
But when it sees this man named Zhao Shan,

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,080
it behaves well.

174
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,040
So I think he's a veterinarian.

175
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,560
Come on.

176
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,040
I've told you guys everything.

177
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,520
Since I've been very cooperative,

178
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
can you let me go?

179
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,520
What's the name on the ID card

180
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,360
you made for Zhao Shan?

181
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't remember.

182
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,160
But I have notes at home.

183
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,040
I'll just look it up.

184
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,400
Really?

185
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,640
Of course it's true.

186
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay, then.

187
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,120
I'll send someone to his home

188
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,040
and see if we can find Zhao Shan's fake ID.

189
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,120
Send him to the police after your investigation.

190
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,280
- Don't worry. That man
- Don't! Please!

191
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,920
is a veteran in the industry.
He knows a lot of things.

192
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,320
Good job.

193
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm going.

194
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,400
Wait a minute.

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,520
Jiang Baiju.

196
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,520
I've found the man

197
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
for you.

198
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Shouldn't you deliver on your promises?

199
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Yeah.

200
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,320
Yeah?

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
You help me find Zhao Shan.

202
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,520
I'll give Qian Cheng a holiday.

203
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,560
What?

204
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,600
You asked me to find this man.

205
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,000
Why are you looking for Zhao Shan now?

206
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,780
Yeah.

207
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
Huh?

208
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,600
What else can I do?

209
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,120
Then I'll have to ask Qian Cheng to help me.

210
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,880
Fine.

211
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,760
I'll do it.

212
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,280
How could someone of your age

213
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
be like this?

214
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
You even let my little brother do this.

215
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,920
You're becoming

216
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,880
a good big brother.

217
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,680
Liar.

218
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,720
Old geezer.

219
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:06,720
Young Master.

220
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,760
What did my brother say to you?

221
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,400
Don't worry about it.

222
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,400
I'm buying the information from your brother

223
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,200
and I'll do the rest myself.

224
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,400
You and William stay out of it.

225
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,400
Young Master.

226
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,200
Whining doesn't work.

227
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Let's go home.

228
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,980
(Seeking for help. I have a strange disease with
red spots on my body and constant nosebleeds.)

229
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,780
(Before every attack, my nose would bleed.)

230
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,500
(The maximum life expectancy of the patient
is no longer than 25 years.)

231
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,520
Xiaoyu.

232
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,520
Professor Lin?

233
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,640
Why are you here?

234
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,160
You're here to see off a body donor again?

235
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,080
There aren't that many body donors
who need to be cremated.

236
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,360
I went to a meeting and ran into Chief Ma.

237
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,480
I dropped him off on the way back

238
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,720
and came to see you.

239
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,440
What are you doing?

240
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm fishing.

241
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,040
Fishing?

242
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,320
What kind of fish is there on the internet?

243
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,200
Black fish.

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Black fish?

245
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,520
How did you know I'm here?

246
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Your master told me.

247
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,520
Looks like Chief Ge

248
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,840
is going to clear the flowerbeds
and rebuild the backyard.

249
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,280
If he keeps doing this,

250
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,960
all my flowers will die.

251
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,960
Those are yours?

252
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Last time I came to see Chief Ge,

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,680
he said these were all his flowers.

254
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,640
Do you believe him?

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,720
The whole morgue would be his
if you believe what he says.

256
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,000
No wonder.

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,440
No wonder what?

258
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
Chief Ge told me to bring this to you.

259
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,080
I brought it today.

260
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,040
He told me to give it to you.

261
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,480
What's this?

262
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Flower seeds.

263
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,360
If you give this to my master,

264
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,560
they would all end up dying.

265
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,800
What do you want to use this for?

266
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,400
To confess your love?

267
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,560
Yes.

268
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,440
I can do that.

269
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Then you can grow it yourself.

270
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,800
But I don't know how to.

271
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,440
How about you plant it for me?

272
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,440
You handsome guys

273
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,320
must find it easy to order people around.

274
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,760
Is that so?

275
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,000
Well?

276
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,960
I'll take that as a yes.

277
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,920
Go ahead and plant them.

278
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,400
What's your hurry?

279
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,560
You have to soak the seeds before planting them.

280
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,160
Since you

281
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,280
asked me to do this,

282
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,760
I

283
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,160
have to ask you to do something too.

284
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,840
Okay, tell me.

285
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,000
Are you free tomorrow?

286
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,480
Yes.

287
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,560
Be my driver

288
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,680
and take me to the suburban area.

289
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,280
No problem.

290
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,640
Illegal doctor?

291
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,120
Yes.

292
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,440
Are you aware

293
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,320
of the bus that fell into the river?

294
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,360
I'm investigating that case.

295
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
In the hospital we're going to,

296
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,440
I think there will be clues there.

297
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,600
Clues?

298
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,360
Shouldn't we call the police

299
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
for something like this?

300
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I can't call the police.

301
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,760
It would alert them.

302
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,800
We should first do some reconnaissance.

303
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
What if they're a regular hospital?

304
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,800
We'd be embarrassed, right?

305
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,600
That's true.

306
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,600
So how did you get the clue?

307
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,600
I

308
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,600
posted my medical history online.

309
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,680
Many kind-hearted people online

310
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,240
told me about prescriptions and hospitals.

311
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,880
I went through them.

312
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,560
Among them was someone who recommended

313
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,200
this hospital and special medicine.
It's very suspicious.

314
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,480
So I decided to go there and check it out.

315
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,280
Let's go.

316
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,720
A sweet kiss.

317
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Hands slowly wrap around her waist.

318
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,880
His lips slowly landed on her cheek.

319
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,120
Qian.

320
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,160
Is this position elegant?

321
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,600
Put your hand on my waist.

322
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,440
Hell no. Get away from me.

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,480
Can't you support my artistic creation?

324
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,600
What kind of art do you call that?

325
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,360
What's the name of your book?

326
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360
The Great Wilderness Whoring.

327
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
The book is about to be published.

328
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,040
It's already wilderness, why is there...?

329
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,200
The name of the novel is already so bad.

330
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,280
What do you know?

331
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
This is a science fiction love story.

332
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,240
In the future world,

333
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,760
Young Master,

334
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,880
3D nude technology is used.

335
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,880
Sounds like a technology
that will give people a cold.

336
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,840
I misspoke, Young Master.

337
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,560
3D naked eye technology.

338
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,280
Hello?

339
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm at home.

340
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,520
Okay, I'll be right there.

341
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,880
You two wait for me at home.

342
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,600
I have something to do.

343
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,200
Okay.

344
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,120
Your brother's special ring tone.

345
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,880
Let's follow him.

346
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,560
Let's go.

347
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,680
Where's Building 4?

348
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,080
Let me ask someone.

349
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,040
Ask her.

350
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,680
Auntie.

351
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,200
Sorry to bother you.

352
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,720
Well.

353
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,080
There's a Building 4 near here.

354
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,920
Do you know where it is?

355
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,240
Over there.

356
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,400
This place is going to be demolished.

357
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,600
All the businesses in the building
have moved out.

358
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,440
There's only a small clinic left.

359
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,800
At night, screams would come out
from that place.

360
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,200
It's like a haunted place.

361
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,240
We want to go to that clinic.

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Why not go to the big hospitals
in the city if you are sick?

363
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,880
- She...
- Well.

364
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,640
Thank you, Ma'am.

365
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,320
Let's go.

366
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,920
Thank you.

367
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,080
I'll go over there.

368
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,240
You wait for me here.

369
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,280
That won't do.

370
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,600
Didn't you hear the lady say?

371
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,760
Screams come from that place at night?

372
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,840
It doesn't look like a good place.

373
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
I can't let you go alone.

374
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,440
Have you heard of my nickname?

375
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,840
You have a nickname?

376
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,840
What's your nickname?

377
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,000
Little King of Hell.

378
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,280
Little King of Hell.

379
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,560
Do you know what my nickname is?

380
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,920
You are not the Jade Emperor, are you?

381
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,120
Advanced worker Lin Nuoyan.

382
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,420
(Mu City Zhao Shan Rehabilitation Clinic)

383
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,360
It's here, right?

384
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:24,960
Yes.

385
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,040
Let me tell you.

386
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,760
I did some digging online.

387
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,320
The business in this building

388
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,840
used to be very good.

389
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,760
But

390
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,520
one time

391
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,040
the tenants and the property owner
had a dispute.

392
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,720
Guess what happened?

393
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,240
What happened?

394
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
For some reasons,

395
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,080
he fell from the building and died.

396
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,320
It's probably a rumor.

397
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,360
It's true.

398
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Don't listen to people's nonsense.

399
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,880
Let's go. Believe in science.

400
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,960
I am science.

401
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,360
I'm not talking nonsense.

402
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,200
I know.

403
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,400
Let me tell you.

404
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
Ever since that event,

405
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,720
strange things had been happening here.

406
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,720
Like the parking lot event,

407
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,960
the elevator fires

408
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,800
and glass falling from above.

409
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:02,840
In short,

410
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,520
it's the real world “Final Destination”.

411
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,240
I'm serious.

412
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,760
Since then,

413
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,280
no one has ever dared to use

414
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,040
anything here.

415
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,640
If the government hadn't acquired
the land this time,

416
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,560
probably no one would come here.

417
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,240
I'm telling you.

418
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,040
Those are just lies

419
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,800
created to scare people.

420
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,440
There may be one or two accidents.

421
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,320
But everything becomes a mystery

422
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,280
when everyone speculates about it.

423
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,240
That scared me.

424
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,200
Consultation room.

425
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,760
You go in and wait for me.

426
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,000
OK.

427
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,400
Please come in.

428
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,600
Who are you?

429
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,760
I came to seek treatment.

430
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,480
This is my medical record.

431
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,040
Jin Xiaoyu.

432
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:03,760
Were you the one

433
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,400
that had an online consultation
with our hospital?

434
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,200
Yes.

435
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,800
I posted online.

436
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
Your hospital customer service
asked me to come here.

437
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,960
I see.

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,920
A lot of people are doing online consultations.

439
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,240
But we want to see them in person

440
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,280
to affirm their condition.

441
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,200
That makes sense.

442
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,400
I heard that someone at your hospital
has been cured of this disease.

443
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,240
The organs of the body
suddenly stop functioning.

444
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,800
And before the attack, a nosebleed would occur.

445
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,360
People with this disease
do not live past the age of 25.

446
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,560
Well.

447
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,160
By the way,

448
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,360
perhaps you know this person?

450
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,400
By the way, doctor.

451
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,600
Can I take a look at

452
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,560

453
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,320
Yes.

454
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,800
We are a regular hospital.

455
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,640
Although the place is a bit far from the city,

456
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,440
we have completed

457
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,160
all the health bureau's procedures.

458
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,240
Good.

00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,840
It's his life and his own choices.

516
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
No matter what happens

517
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,960
to the girl he saved in the future,

518
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,040
that's Jiang Baiju's own business.

519
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,040
Besides, he's not like three years old.

520
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,280
He's older

521
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,600
than our grandfather, okay?

522
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,520
There must be something wrong.

523
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,320
Whatever

524
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,040
it is,

525
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,120
what are you worried about?

526
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,320
He's not gonna die.

527
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,240
He's not going to die, okay?

528
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,760
Mr. Qian, the police are here.

529
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,520
Hurry up with the cleanup.

530
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,320
Yes, sir.

531
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,160
Woman.

532
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,840
Are you satisfied with what you saw?

533
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,080
Are you going to keep talking like this?

534
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,520
Well.

535
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,920
Thank you for yesterday.

536
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,600
Thank you for the first aid yesterday.

537
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,280
I was panicky.

538
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,840
I didn't do a very good job.

539
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,280
Do you intend to keep looking at me like that?

540
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,560
Are you really an alien?

541
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,400
No, I'm not.

542
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,880
It's all your imagination.

543
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,560
You think I will believe you?

544
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,560
Then why do you ask?

545
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:06,760
Because...

546
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,240
Because I'm worried about you.

547
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,760
Are you worried or curious?

548
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,040
Yes, I am curious.

549
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,440
I'm curious about why you were there.

550
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,200
Why were you there?

551
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,680
I posted my medical history online.

552
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,960
I wanted to uncover the group
that was selling the special drugs.

553
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,200
That's why I went to the suspicious hospital.

554
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,760
And I found out...

555
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,240
Where's Lin Nuoyan?

556
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,360
Where's Professor Lin?

557
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,480
Where did he go? Did something happen to him?

558
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,400
Did you call the police?

559
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,600
Nothing happened to anyone.

560
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,920
So there's no need to call the police.

561
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,440
The doctors are all gone too.

562
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,520
How can you let them go?

563
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Jin Xiaoyu, I'm telling you.

564
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,960
That hospital is not just a small clinic.

565
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,120
It has connections
to many dangerous organizations.

566
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,280
Don't pursue it any further.

567
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,400
And don't mention it to anyone.

568
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,000
Are we clear?

569
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,680
Yes, yes.

570
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,400
So...

571
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:00,960
You guys...

572
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,120
You're not with those people, right?

573
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,080
Are you?

574
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,920
No, I'm not.

575
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:08,960
I...

576
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,240
You can look into it.

577
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,440
You can investigate, really.

578
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,920
I will look into it.

579
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,360
If you're not involved with them,

580
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,680
it's best you forget about
what happened yesterday.

581
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

582
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,760
And you don't have much time left.

583
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,800
You should spend more time with your family.

584
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,560
I don't have a family.

585
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,680
Then spend more time with your friends.

586
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,080
Okay.

587
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
In short, don't get yourself killed.

588
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,640
Your Professor Lin didn't see me.

589
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,720
So you can pretend we haven't met.

590
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,280
He was knocked out earlier.

591
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,040
He should be in the hospital, worried about you.

592
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,240
At least you have some kindness.

593
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,760
Sending him to the hospital.

594
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,640
I didn't take him there.

595
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,040
He woke up and went himself.

596
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,760
You should think about

597
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,120
how to explain your whereabouts to him.

598
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,240
And

599
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,040
I didn't call the police.

600
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,200
But your law-abiding Professor Lin

601
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,600
seems to have called the police.

602
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,440
I really don't want to see you anymore.

603
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,880
Don't worry, we won't see each other again.

604
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,360
Are you all right?

605
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,360
I'm leaving.

606
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,200
Well.

607
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,200
Thank you anyway.

608
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,160
I have one last question.

609
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,920
- Well...
- I won't be at your funeral.

610
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,680
Take the necklace I gave you before

611
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,720
as a gift.

612
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,380
(M.D. sent a message)

613
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,920
(M.D.)
Zhao Shan.

614
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,600
How does it feel

615
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,760
seeing the undead come back to life?

616
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,480
During my research for so many years,

617
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,440
I've experienced too many strange things.

618
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,400
But something like coming back from the dead

619
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,880
is still beyond my imagination.

620
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,960
I failed to catch the undead this time

621
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,840
and was even injured by that girl.

622
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,320
What a loss.

623
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,640
Seeing the undead's ability to come back to life

624
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,000
is more important than anything else.

625
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,640
Although the undead
has the power of resurrection,

626
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,160
he is still carrying an untapped treasure.

627
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,120
The key to unlock the treasure
is still in our hands.

628
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
The lead they have on Gao Guofu is gone.

629
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,560
It won't be easy

630
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,680
to investigate this case.

631
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,440
The boss

632
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,840
asked you to get well first.

633
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,320
But I think

634
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,000
those people won't let up.

635
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
Since they could find the hospital,

636
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,320
maybe they can find something else.

637
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,840
Then let's give them some trouble.

638
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,720
Tu, what are you looking at?

639
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,760
Look.

640
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,160
Will Prince Baiju

641
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,160
break into a dance in the garden

642
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,800
with Bambi suddenly appearing?

643
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
I've come to you for something serious.

644
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,080
I know.

645
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,640
You called me here

646
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,200
because of that girl, right?

647
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
First the chandelier, then the fall.

648
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,680
It must be because of her.

649
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,280
We've investigated

650
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,360
everything about Jin Xiaoyu.

651
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,200
But still, we couldn't find out
who was behind her.

652
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,080
But every time something bad happens,

653
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,080
she would be there.

654
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,120
Something is up with her.

655
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,240
Is that so?

656
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,920
Oh my God!

657
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,600
Maybe the empress sent her?

658
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,440
If you do this again,

659
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,360
I'll throw you out.

660
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,240
Don't be angry.

661
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,920
Let me tell you a life lesson.

662
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,000
When a prince is in trouble,

663
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,120
a princess will definitely come to his rescue.

664
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,120
Am I right?

665
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,360
My men have been investigating her.

666
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,080
Don't worry.

667
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,240
Qian, have an apple.

668
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
- He gave it to me.
- You give it to him.

669
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,120
I'm telling you.

670
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,600
Don't let him near Prince Baiju.

671
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,440
You know?

672
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,880
- Grandma.
- Madam.

673
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,600
Where did you find this?

674
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,760
William's father sent it to me

675
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,400
from France.

676
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,800
His police friend in France

677
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,320
downloaded it from the darknet

678
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,400
wanted notice.

679
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Darknet wanted notice?

680
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,520
Yes.

681
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,000
Foreign websites are not strictly managed.

682
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,120
So many illegal black-market transactions

683
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,160
are conducted online,

684
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,440
especially in Europe.

685
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,280
The darknet is used widely there.

686
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,680
I believe

687
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,240
it will spread to China soon.

688
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,600
How could this happen?

689
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,520
Young Master and Jin Xiaoyu

690
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,680
have become the targets of the darknet.

691
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,520
William.

692
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,320
How could you fail
in looking after the young master?

693
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:58,800
Grandma.

694
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,960
It's not my fault.

695
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,080
It's all because of that Jin Xiaoyu.

696
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,280
One more thing, Qian Cheng.

697
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,640
Within five minutes,

698
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,560
send me all the information about this girl.

699
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,480
Yes, ma'am.

700
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,240
I'll send it to you now.

701
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,160
Keep a close eye on the young master these days.

702
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

703
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,560
Okay.

704
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm done explaining her chest X-ray.

705
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,720
Let's look at her physical reaction.

706
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,840
The injury on her wrist

707
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,880
was caused by an accident two days ago.

708
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,720
Ignore that.

709
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,960
You guys should focus these red marks.

710
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,920
The part of the bone that looks like a birthmark

711
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,720
and muscle tissue.

712
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,680
This looks like lupus.

713
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,480
Lupus rash is not as bright as this.

714
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,360
Her rash looks smaller than in cases of Lupus.

715
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,640
There's no rash on her face or chest.

716
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,680
It's more likely to be a blood disease.

717
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
According to the World Health
Organization's definition,

718
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,240
a disease is considered rare

719
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,240
when it affects

720
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,480
between 0.65 to 1 per 1,000

721
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,000
of the total population.

722
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,800
The United States defines a rare disease as

723
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,720
a disease that affects less
than 200,000 people per year

724
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,360
or a disease in which the percentage
of the population affected

725
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,960
is 1 in 1,500.

726
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,480
In Japan, a rare disease is defined as

727
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,400
a disease that affects less
than 50,000 people per year

728
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,800
or with an occurrence of

729
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
1 in 2,500.

730
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,040
Do you know what this means?

731
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,960
It means it's rare.

732
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,840
It means there is still a lot

733
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,320
to explore in terms of medical knowledge.

734
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,920
Let's take the more common rare diseases

735
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,200
like albinism and acromegaly as examples.

736
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,280
So far,

737
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,920
there haven't been effective treatments.

738
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,400
Let alone an unnamed disease

739
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,160
like hers.

740
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,440
That's why you guys should
stop making wild guesses.

741
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,400
I brought you guys here

742
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,600
to see a new case.

743
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,080
I'm not asking you guys to do a consultation.

744
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,800
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

745
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,440
- Bye.
- See you next time.

746
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,040
Go back.

747
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,120
These kids.

748
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,720
They all want to cure you

749
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
with what they know.

750
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,760
Well, good luck to them.

751
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,200
By the way,

752
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,880
I called the police

753
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,600
about that shady hospital last time.

754
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,080
Although they got away,

755
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,920
they still left a lot of evidence.

756
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,760
I think we can catch them sooner or later.

757
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,680
Let's hope so.

758
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,240
But

759
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,920
I don't think you should
continue endangering yourself

760
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,000
with your current health.

761
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,560
It was just an accident.

762
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,200
Look at me now.

763
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,200
What about you?

764
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,200
Were you hurt?

765
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,840
What could happen to me?

766
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,360
I only have a bump behind my head.

767
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,680
It'll go away in a couple of days.

768
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I was too careless.

769
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,720
Do you own all these labs?

770
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,320
Me?

771
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm just a manager.

772
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,720
That's impressive too.

773
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Then is this lab

774
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
owned by this university?

775
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,680
It's not affiliated.

776
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,680
We have a partnership.

777
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,040
It's a private lab.

778
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,080
But let me tell you.

779
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,320
This university's cafeteria

780
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
is very good.

781
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,440
Really?

782
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,040
Unfortunately, you're busy today.

783
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,040
Maybe next time.

784
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,720
Next time when I'm free,

785
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,360
I'll take you to eat something good.

786
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,640
You're such a scientist.

787
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,440
Is that so?

788
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
Here's a little present for you.

789
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,280
I'm the one that should be giving you something.

790
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,320
Why did you buy something for me?

791
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,040
You're here

792
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,880
as a case for my students.

793
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,600
Consider it my token of appreciation.

794
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,800
You're too kind.

795
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,760
Can I open it?

796
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,480
Of course.

797
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,960
What's this?

798
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,200
An incense burner.

799
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:16,800
Here.

800
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
I'll show you.

801
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,760
It's amazing!

802
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,600
Isn't it nice?

803
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,360
This one is called the reverse-flow incense.

804
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,640
Oh.

805
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,240
No wonder.

806
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
Normally the smoke goes up.

807
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,400
But for this one, the smoke goes down.

808
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,680
The smoke going down is nice, right?

809
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,160
Actually

810
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,320
I think life is also like this.

811
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,920
Even incense has different looks.

812
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,320
Then why do we have to

813
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,320
go in the same direction

814
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,560
and live more or less similar lives?

815
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Sometimes,

816
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,520
maybe you'll find more beautiful scenery

817
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,840
when you change direction.

818
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,600
Professor Lin is really a teacher.

819
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,120
I'm giving a lecture again.

820
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,500
(Ticket Office)

821
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,760
Auntie.

822
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,160
Slow down! Slow down!

823
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,240
You're gonna hit someone.

824
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,800
- I know.
- Hurry up!

825
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,560
Hurry up!

826
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Look!

827
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,800
You want me to go fast

828
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,600
and you want me to go steady.

829
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,880
You're so annoying.

830
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,240
I don't want to talk about it. Hurry up!

831
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,440
Do you know how to be a nanny?

832
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,240
Yes, I do.

833
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,560
I've never seen your kind.

834
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,720
(Mu City Bus Terminal)
Why are you so tough to serve?

835
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,480
How annoying.

836
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,160
Let's go!

837
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,160
Go, go, go! This way!

838
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,600
Hurry up, hurry up!

839
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,000
Hurry up, hurry up!

840
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,920
This way, this way.

841
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,080
Come on.

842
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,840
Come on, come on.

843
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,480
Hurry up! Hurry up!

844
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,760
Get out of the way!

845
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,640
What if we bumped into you?

846
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,360
Auntie.

847
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,160
What are you talking about?

848
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,240
Are you going to Thailand?

849
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,120
My precious granddaughter.

850
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,280
Grandma.

851
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,440
I'm all dressed up like this.

852
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,360
And you still can recognize me?

853
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,560
Who would go around

854
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
with a wheelchair like that?

855
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,080
No nanny would push a handicapped like this.

856
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,880
You told me to go faster

857
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,840
and then told me to be stable.

858
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,600
I've been a nanny for over 20 years.

859
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,960
I'm a professional!

860
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,040
What did you want me to do?

861
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,360
You haven't paid me yet!

862
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,280
He hasn't paid yet!

863
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,120
You.

864
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,080
Grandma.

865
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,320
Running away

866
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,280
is useless and shameful.

867
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,720
Grandma.

868
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,240
That's not the version I heard.

869
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,320
Are you unwilling to protect the young master?

870
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,400
Of course I'm willing to protect him.

871
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,720
But

872
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,000
he's a big boy now.

873
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,320
He can learn to feed himself,

874
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,520
sleep and drink milk.

875
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,240
My dream is to become a writer.

876
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,160
I don't want to be a puppet at home.

877
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,920
Okay.

878
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I don't want to belittle your online essays.

879
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
But people need to be grateful.

880
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,320
Think about it.

881
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You have a good life.

882
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,120
You received higher education.

883
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,240
All of this is thanks to the young master.

884
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
If it wasn't for him,

885
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,320
our family would be in the mountains
hunting pheasants.

886
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,920
I think you're right.

887
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,880
But I think

888
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,480
my willingness should be taken into account.

889
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,000
I think

890
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,280
Qian Cheng is more suitable
for this job than me.

891
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,160
Although he has some mental issues

892
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,280
and he's not as handsome as I am,

893
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,160
he loves the young master.

894
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,720
Right?

895
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,920
If anything,

896
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,600
make him change his last name to Dao.

897
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,120
I'll give him this good job.

898
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,160
You...

899
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,240
You really don't know how to do business.

900
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,840
If I were you,

901
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,480
the person I choose to deal with

902
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,120
would not be Qian Cheng.

903
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,680
Grandma.

904
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,240
You don't have a better candidate, do you?

905
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,240
Jin Xiaoyu.

906
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,400
Jin Xiaoyu?

907
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,000
Are you a part-time kidnapper?

908
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,040
I only kidnap people's minds.

909
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,080
I don't kidnap their person.

910
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,280
What are you doing?

911
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,040
Besides, I'm not interested in

912
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,040
your body.

913
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,400
Why did you kidnap me?

914
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,760
Are you an alien?

915
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,160
You have special powers too?

916
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,760
How do you know I'm an alien?

917
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,040
I have two supernatural powers.

918
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,240
I'm handsome.

919
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
And I'm extremely charming.

920
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,120
Do you think you're funny?

921
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,560
No?

922
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,640
But I don't blame you.

923
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,680
I was so scared that I almost peed my pants

924
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,880
the first time I saw him do that.

925
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,000
Does he often

926
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
come back to life like this?

927
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,000
Usually his injuries are not that bad.

928
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
Like what happened the day before yesterday,

929
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,880
I've only seen it twice.

930
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
That day was the second time.

931
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,480
What about the first time?

932
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,480
The first time

933
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,600
was ten years ago.

934
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,840
(Ten years ago)

935
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,520
Is that so?

936
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,560
Ye Lai.

937
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,680
Ye Lai! Ye Lai!

938
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,480
I was waiting for you guys.

939
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,800
Yes.

940
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,560
Let's go for lunch.

941
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm not going.

942
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,280
Are you pursuing her or not?

943
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Go after her, silly you.

944
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,400
Silly.

945
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,200
Silly.

946
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,520
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

947
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,480
Forget about the hot pot.

948
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,720
Go after her!

949
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,880
Go, go, go.

950
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,400
Ye...

951
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,360
Keep your voice down, I can see it.

952
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,640
What are you doing?

953
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,760
You've liked her from high school to college.

954
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,920
But you still haven't confessed to her?

955
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,720
None of your business.

956
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,960
Let me ask you this.

957
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
If you don't go after her,

958
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
I'll do it.

959
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:53,840
How dare you.

960
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,560
Mr. Wang.

961
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,880
Why did you park the car here today?

962
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,480
Mr. Wang.

963
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,240
Who are you?

964
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,600
Why are you in our car?

965
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,480
Help!

966
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,760
Help!

967
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,680
Help! Help!

968
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,360
Help! Help!

969
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,520
Ye Lai.

970
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,520
Help!

971
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,480
Ye Lai.

972
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,120
Stop the car.

973
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,240
Stop the car.

974
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,880
Stop the car.

975
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,120
Stop the car.

976
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,680
Help!

977
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,160
Somebody, kidnap!

978
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,060
(William)

979
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,640
Hello?

980
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,880
Young Master.

981
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,240
Qian Cheng has been kidnapped.

982
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,680
You have to come and help me.
