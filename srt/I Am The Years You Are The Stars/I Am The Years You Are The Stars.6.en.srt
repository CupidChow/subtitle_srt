19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:44,600
Oh, right.

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,800
I saw the news about

21
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,280
Qian Cheng's heroic action online.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,960
What he did this time？

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,080
Yes.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,800
I wanted to witness

25
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,800
the highlight moment of my bro and Ye Lai,

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,600
but I didn't expect that the perpetrator

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,400
kidnapped the two of them together.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
Luckily, Qian Cheng was smart enough

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
to secretly carry a cellphone

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
with which he called Qian Tu.

31
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,680
That's why they were able to find
the location of the warehouse.

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,320
And then,

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,360
when the perpetrator was getting the money,
he took the opportunity

34
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,600
to take Ye Lai away with him.

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,280
Wow!

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,160
Awesome.

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,560
I'm impressed.

38
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,840
I think he's awesome, too.

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,920
But I guess

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,280
this is an experience that

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,520
he will never wish for others to brag about...

42
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,600
You stay here.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,720
When they come up,

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
you go down.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
I'll try to get in touch with our people.

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,320
No.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,040
No.

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,800
Be good.

49
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,480
This may be the best solution.

50
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't go.

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
Let's split up.

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
Help!

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,120
Can anyone hear me?

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,960
Where do you think you are going?

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,280
Run.

56
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,200
Run.

57
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
Qian Cheng fell down.

58
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
He broke an arm and a leg,

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
and stayed in the hospital for three months.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,840
Although he has gotten back in shape,

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,640
he has developed PTSD.

62
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,240
How about Jiang Baiju?

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,360
He's worse.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
God.

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,280
Qian Cheng must've been scared to death.

66
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,600
Qian Cheng was so scared that he passed out.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,160
After my second uncle and I arrived,

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,160
we watched the whole thing.

69
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,440
But when Qian Tu arrived,
he only saw the latter half.

70
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,000
It was us who were scared to death.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,920
God.

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,560
Why did you tell me this?

73
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
You just realized?

74
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,840
I shared a secret with you.

75
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,480
It means I'm making friends with you.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,280
You're using someone else's secret

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
to make friends with me?

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,720
Yep.

79
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,000
Brilliant.

80
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,440
You're brilliant, too. Aren't you?

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,400
Likewise.

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,520
Hold on.

83
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,720
Where are you taking me?

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
Aren't you terminally ill?

85
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,280
Why are you so scared of death?

86
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,120
Hey!

87
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
Dying of disease and dying miserably
are different.

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay?

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Same ending, though.

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,400
They're completely different!

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
I think they're basically the same.

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Please.

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,880
Hello.

94
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,480
So?

95
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
How do you like it?

96
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,760
Pretty good.

97
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,800
Xiaoyu.

98
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,400
Do you know who I'm taking you to see today?

99
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,240
Not your parents, right?

100
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,440
Follow me.

101
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,320
You're not serious, are you?

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,880
Grandmother.

103
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,960
Beautiful.

104
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,880
Oh, I missed you.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,920
Grandmother.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,280
I've brought

107
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,080
the guest to you.

108
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
This is Jin Xiaoyu.

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,640
Thank you.

110
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Grandmother.

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll go to speak with the dean.

112
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,920
I'll get you later.

113
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,720
You'll go and see the dean?

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
If the dean mentions me ...

115
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,680
Never mind. Go.

116
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm off.

117
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,400
Go for it.

118
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,400
Hello,

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,040
Madam Dao.

120
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,600
Saw how unique Jiang Baiju is?

121
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,400
It was my privilege.

122
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,520
After William

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,040
saw that,

124
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,760
he got a fever,

125
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,440
and had bad dreams for a month.

126
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,560
His father

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,240
was fortunate to see that, too.

128
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,880
Ever since that, whenever he meets Jiang Baiju,
he does not dare to speak.

129
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,800
He is shaking all over.

130
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,200
So,

131
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,720
I make his second uncle

132
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,000
the second-generation designer.

133
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,920
Umm...

134
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,600
Have you seen that side of Jiang Baiju?

135
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
I was privileged, too.

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,760
Come and take a look.

137
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,120
This picture

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,280
was taken by Qian Tu two days ago.

139
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,120
Qian Tu is a bad photographer.

140
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,200
And this one.

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,320
Why does this old man

142
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,440
look grumpy?

143
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,640
He met his love rival so he has fire in his eyes.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,800
And this one.

145
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,320
This is the first picture

146
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,960
of me and Jiang Baiju.

147
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,640
Xiuxiu,

148
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,200
when you grow up,

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,400
you should help me take care of the young master,

150
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,040
got it?

151
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,960
Got it.

152
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,800
Good girl.

153
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,680
Young Master.

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,600
Come on.

155
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
One. Two. Three.

156
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
Jiang Baiju said,

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
every time he saw this album,

158
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
he'd feel happy for me.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
He thinks I'm happy.

160
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,800
When I was little,

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
I was loved by my parents.

162
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
After I grew up,

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,400
I met my true love,

164
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,720
and we have a boy and a girl.

165
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,440
He said, this is what life is supposed to be.

166
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,720
It should be

167
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,160
both sweet and bitter.

168
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
Come to me if you need anything.

169
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:15,880
Okay.

170
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,000
When we lived abroad,

171
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,520
we would move

172
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,480
once in every ten years.

173
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,120
We'd lived around the world.

174
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,360
(Year 1990)
It was until the Asian Games

175
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,680
(Beijing Eleventh Asian Games)
did Young Master and I return to our motherland.

176
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,360
Ever since then,

177
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,600
he'd been living a simple and quiet life.

178
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,640
So

179
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,760
he'd been with you for your entire life like that?

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,880
Yes.

181
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,280
He's had a long life,

182
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,680
yet he's unable to fit in.

183
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,400
He was never able to feel

184
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
the joys and sorrows of life.

185
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,200
The so-called family ties,

186
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,680
love, or friendship

187
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,800
only add

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
to his pain.

189
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,680
The gift of immortality

190
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,360
only makes him an eternal onlooker.

191
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,640
So

192
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,240
the sadness in it

193
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
is not something that someone at your age
can understand.

194
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,760
But

195
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,360
who on earth is he?

196
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,200
I don't know who he is, either.

197
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,520
Maybe an earthling,

198
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
maybe an alien,

199
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,680
maybe an immortal,

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
or maybe

201
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,240
a cursed human being.

202
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,080
No one knows.

203
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,600
He never tells his stories.

204
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,000
My father told me

205
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,000
there was an avalanche once,

206
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,440
and Young Master saved him.

207
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,680
Young Master is a mystery.

208
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,720
A beautiful mystery.

209
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,280
I hope

210
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,040
you're the one who cracks the mystery.

211
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,560
Me?

212
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,880
How can I pull that off?

213
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,880
You can.

214
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,520
As long as you're willing to approach him,

215
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,360
and help him.

216
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,280
But of course,

217
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,560
you make your own choice.

218
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,000
This is

219
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,080
what I can offer to you

220
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
as a guardian.

Of course, Young Master can give it to you, too.

225

But he

226
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
doesn't like troubling others.

227
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,520
He also doesn't like the ones

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,400
around him being threatened,

229
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,600

that you sponsored
another three old people this month.

guess this riddle.

Dead animals.

Wrong.

that you have

344
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,280
never seen before.

345
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,640
Really?

00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,280
I'm interested.

349
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,000
It's right upstairs.

350
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:56,760
Let's go.

351
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,480
So? How do you like it?

352
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,920
So pretty.

353
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,640
So beautiful.

354
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,360
Pretty, right?

355
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Come. Please.

356
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,520
Why are you here?

357
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,360
Young Master.

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,280
Allow me to introduce.

359
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,280
This is Miss Jin Xiaoyu.

360
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
A new tenant of Buwenzhong.

361
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,960
Who let her come in?

362
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,000
Who?

363
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,880
Xiuxiu.

364
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,360
Madam Dao and I signed a contract.

365
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
Starting today,

366
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,680
I'll be living in Buwenzhong.

367
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,720
You listen to me.

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't allow it.

369
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Overruled.

370
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,480
Because the owner of this property

371
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,960
is Dao Xiuxiu.

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,640
Follow me, Xiaoyu.

373
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,680
I'll show you your room.

374
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,160
Go.

375
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:56,600
Let's go.

376
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,320
I still won't allow it
even that she's going to die.

377
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:00,920
I tell you what,

378
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,240
I-I object.

379
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,920
How can you be so sure

380
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,960
that she'll die this year?

381
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,600
If she doesn't die this year,

382
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,000
will you allow her to live here?

383
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,480
You must get it sorted.

384
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:09,960
You must...

385
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,320
Hey!

386
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,520
Hey!

387
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,120
Me?

388
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,800
Mr. Qian's daily confusing behavior.

389
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,480
Come on.

390
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll take you to your room.

391
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,280
Come on.

392
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,560
So? Do you like it?

393
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,360
Who decorated the room?

394
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Me, of course.

395
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm in charge of
arranging everything you need when you move in.

396
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,120
Do you have any idea

397
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,240
how hard it was

398
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
to pull off this decoration style
right under Young Master's nose?

399
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,680
Now you can look up to me.

400
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,480
No.

401
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,560
I just wanted to ask if

402
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,760
you were hired because you got connections

403
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,280
or all Qing'ai designers

404
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,160
are like you?

405
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,920
I didn't become a designer

406
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
because of my taste or talent

407
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,480
but my good-looking face.

408
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,720
I'll just take a quick look, okay?

409
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,400
Sure.

410
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,840
Let me take a look.

411
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,680
These are all the clothes that I prepared for you.

412
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,960
It's so beautiful, isn't it?

413
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
You bought that one for you, am I right?

414
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,400
It's specially prepared for you.

415
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,680
Young Master.

416
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,960
Qian wants to speak to me.

417
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm off.

418
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,360
These are pills, not rice.

419
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,440
Two are enough.

420
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,760
Are you okay?

421
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,760
I feel stressed.

422
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,600
What's the matter?

423
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,200
Why is there an outsider in the house?

424
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,240
I can't stand it.

425
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:56,920
Bro,

426
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,240
you're technically an outsider, too.

427
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,720
The house belongs to the Dao's family.

428
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm taking Young Master out.

429
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,880
Where?

430
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,800
To a resort.

431
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,560
My brother's recently opened resort is quite good.

432
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,200
Hey, come on.

433
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
Calm down.

434
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,520
Umm,

435
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,960
you know what?

436
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,080
Let's

437
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,520
keep Jin Xiaoyu here.

438
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,680
She'll share the household chores

439
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,160
with us,

440
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,320
right?

441
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,280
Share the household chores?

442
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,960
Yes, household chores.

443
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,040
Like cooking.

444
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,800
You don't have to cook.

445
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,120
Or cleaning the yard.

446
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
You don't need to do that, either.

447
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
And think about the dirtiest
and the most tiring job.

448
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,480
Cleaning the toilets.

449
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,680
It looks like your
negotiation with Madam Dao has failed.

450
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,360
So?

451
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,200
Let's talk about some rules.

452
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,360
I don't allow you to invade my personal space.

453
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,080
Your personal space has

454
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,880
three people in it, right?

455
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,160
It's not that personal, is it?

456
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
They live here
due to issues left over by the past,

457
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
but I don't want you to join in.

458
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,480
Do you understand?

459
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,200
No.

460
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,800
You're okay with young men,

461
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,280
but not with a pretty young girl?

462
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,880
Your hobby is quite...

463
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,160
Why on earth did you move in?

464
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,560
Money.

465
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,120
Madam Dao offered loads of money.

466
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,760
It appears

467
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,960
you're a big fish.

468
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,600
Whether the fish is big or not

469
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
is none of your business.

470
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
You're the big fish. I'm the small one.

471
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,480
We'll be living in the same house.

472
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,840
Please be kind to me.

473
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,840
I didn't expect

474
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,440
you to trade yourself.

475
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,160
I didn't expect you to be a gigolo

476
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
living in a grandma's house.

477
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm a gigolo?

478
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,560
Me?

479
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,720
I own the entire Qing'ai Group.

480
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,400
Don't you know?

481
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,480
Do you have the property ownership certificate?

482
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,600
Do you?

483
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,480
Okay.

484
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
You're moving in here, right?

485
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,080
Yes.

486
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,560
I must warn you beforehand.

487
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,160
No one will be serving you.

488
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,120
You'll do all the cleaning by yourself.

489
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,800
Do you understand?

490
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:36,800
Hey!

491
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,000
The yard is huge.

492
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,760
How am I able to do that?

493
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,600
I've got a job.

494
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Dao Xiuxiu gave you a lot of money.

495
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,320
Can't believe
you still have the nerve to go to work.

496
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,440
Because I wish to die on my job.

497
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm scared that you're going to die in my house.

498
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,280
Or maybe I'll die in your arms

499
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,600
while watching a movie.

500
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,160
You got your overtime pay, didn't you?

501
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,040
Yes.

502
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,840
Can you show any respect

503
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,360
to your ex-employer?

504
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,120
Also, I'm your lifesaver.

505
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,240
One should start with a clean slate.

506
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Specially with exes.

507
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,040
Bye-bye.

508
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,480
Since we're living under the same roof now,

509
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,680
let's assign the household chores now, shall we?

510
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,280
Are you a middle school student?

511
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Why do we need to be on duty?

512
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,520
Young Master generally resents
outsiders in the house,

513
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,040
so Qian Cheng and I

514
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
do all the household chores.

515
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,120
Now that you're here,

516
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
we, of course, need to re-assign everything.

517
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,320
Is this a joke?

518
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,880
You guys are so rich.

519
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
This is a three-story house

520
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,840
with a pool and a greenhouse.

521
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,920
Would it kill you to hire a housekeeper?

522
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,560
The greenhouse

523
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,360
is Young Master's territory.

524
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,440
He takes care of it himself.

525
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,240
Water these flowers once in every three days.

526
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,560
Feed the goldfish once in the morning
and once in the evening.

527
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,720
Also, pull the weeds once a week.

528
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,600
I

529
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,360
came here to experience the life of the rich.

530
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
What kind of a life are you guys living?

531
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,240
I wanted some water.

532
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
You will be swollen
if you drink water before sleeping.

533
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,960
Cold milk gives you diarrhea.

534
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,440
Illnesses don't affect me.

535
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,280
Since you're so scared,

536
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,040
why did you move in here?

537
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,400
I chose black-and-white horror movie.

538
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,080
What?

539
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,080
Madam Dao said

540
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,880
you're a black-and-white horror movie.

541
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,320
She's really good at fooling people.

542
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,480
Towards the end of your life,

543
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,200
you'll trap yourself
in a black-and-white horror movie.

544
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,360
Is it worth doing for money?

545
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Your life is tough.

546
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,320
I came to keep you company.

547
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,280
I don't need it.

548
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,040
It's almost 11 p.m.

549
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,520
Do I need to work overtime?

550
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
I don't like working at home.

551
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,320
Okay.

552
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:55,720
Goodnight.

553
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,240
Goodnight.

554
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,520
Keep a close watch on that girl.

555
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:17,560
You got it.

556
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,520
You scared me.

557
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,680
Still awake?

558
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,160
Don't worry.

559
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,400
You aren't pretty enough

560
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
to be able to seduce me.

561
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,080
Get to the point, okay?

562
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,240
Didn't you hear the howl of a wolf?

563
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
That's why I came.

564
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Wear these to sleep.

565
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,400
We're in the remote suburbs,

566
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,480
so wild animals are common.

567
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
You'll sleep better with the earplugs.

568
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay.

569
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,120
I always feel like
there's something strange in the yard.

570
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,840
When you're settled down,

571
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,240
I'll take you to explore

572
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,320
the secrets in the yard.

573
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,960
Goodnight.

574
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,700
(Buwenzhong)

575
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,680
What the hell was that?

576
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,480
Why did you put a cooking utensil in your bedroom?

577
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,160
Are you a freak?

578
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,920
What did you do with it?

579
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,280
Can I still use this??

580
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,280
What are you doing in my room?

581
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,040
I'm hungry.

582
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,720
There's no one who will cook for me.

583
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,480
Get up.

584
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,480
What's the matter with you?

585
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,680
What the heck is wrong with you?

586
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,080
(Moon, breeze, where to go)

587
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,040
The victim in the car accident.

588
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
He died in pieces.

589
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,040
Xiaoyu and I came up with four plans

590
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,920
before we were able to clean him.

591
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,520
It was really tough work.

592
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,560
I don't mind as long as his family is satisfied.

593
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:13,560
Let's go.

594
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,000
Xiaoyu.

595
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm exhausted to
the point of almost spraining my back after

596
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
doing so much work with you.

597
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:23,960
Tell me...

598
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm so nice to you, aren't I?

599
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,600
Judge for yourself.

600
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,800
I knew it.

601
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,920
You wouldn't fawn on me

602
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,600
for no reason.

603
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,920
What is it? Say it.

604
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,160
Well, I do have a favor to ask you.

605
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,640
Look.

606
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
What do you think of this house?

607
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,400
This is the matrimonial home of me and Xiaoxi.

608
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,760
When she asks you,

609
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,400
please put in some good words for me.

610
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,120
What?

611
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,760
It's your matrimonial home.

612
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,360
You're asking me to take a look at it?

613
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,800
Is it us who are going to get married?

614
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,280
What?

615
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,800
But she trusts you.

616
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,600
We're together

617
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,800
because you put us together

618
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
with the Tarot.

619
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,240
Yeah. Yeah.

620
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,240
Help me get a wife, too.

621
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,800
I'll catch one for you with a crystal ball, then.

622
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,840
That'd be faster. What do you think?

623
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,200
Are you talking about a demon

624
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,960
or a wife?

625
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,280
Alright. Show me.

626
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,600
The house is on the inside of a curve.

627
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,600
Like it's being cut by a scimitar.

628
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,120
A location like this has a name.

629
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,480
Boomerang bad omen.

630
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,280
What do you mean?

631
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,880
Let me see.

632
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,880
It's the highest level of

633
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,240
bad omen.

634
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,080
Bad idea. Bad idea.

635
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,200
If, if you say so,

636
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,680
I'll be done.

637
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,160
W-What can I do?

638
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:36,720
Nothing.

639
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,360
It's difficult for me, too.

640
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,240
You know what?

641
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,720
If Xiaoxi hears this,

642
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,120
I won't be able to get married.

643
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,240
But there's still a way.

644
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,160
- There's still a way, right?
- There's still a way.

645
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,920
Yeah, there's still a way.

646
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,560
You have received 200 yuan.

647
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:49,960
Is that enough?

648
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,560
Let me check again.

649
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,160
I think

650
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,720
I just made a mistake.

651
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,000
The house is located outside the curve.

652
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,640
It has a name, too.

653
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,920
It's called Jade belt around the waist.

654
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,400
It's auspicious.

655
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,920
- See?
- See?

656
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,120
She's a charlatan.

657
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,640
- Yeah.
- And a mortuary makeup artist.

658
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,420
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

659
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:09,920
So versatile.

660
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,280
You're going to get married.

661
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,800
I should give you a hand.

662
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,960
- I should assist you, right?
- Yeah.

663
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,560
That's right.

664
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,520
Look how sweet Xiaoyu is.

665
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,640
It's as if she's singing.

666
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
You can't spend the 200 yuan for nothing.

667
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,160
Right, right, right.

668
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,560
I've got stuff to do.

669
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,440
I won't be on duty.

670
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,120
Hold on.

671
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,360
He's going on a date tonight.

672
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,280
So I'm on duty again?

673
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,160
It's good for you.

674
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,360
I'll leave the crystal ball to you.

675
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,280
You take it and catch a wife.

676
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,080
Just leave.

677
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,560
Okay.

678
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,400
- But I...
- Go.

679
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,420
(Tomb of My Beloved Daughter Cai Miao)

680
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,720
It feels strange

681
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,160
to see her tombstone.

682
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,000
It feels like

683
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,280
what happened between us

684
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
stayed in our previous life.

685
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,720
There's an expression that goes like this.

686
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
“As if a generation has passed”.

687
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,440
This is how I feel.

688
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,400
You know what?

689
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,600
The greatest regret in my life

690
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,480
is that I can't

691
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,920
be friends with these beautiful people.

692
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,960
These donors

693
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,760
just came but they're leaving already.

694
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,800
In Premier Zhou's love letters to his wife,

695
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,000
he wrote something that really touches me.

696
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,440
He said,

697
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,720
“All my life,

698
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
I've been a materialist.

699
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,360
You're the only one

700
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,040
who makes me wish for an afterlife”.

701
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,880
If there was an afterlife,

702
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,320
I'd like to know you,

703
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,360
to be friends with you.

704
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,280
Miaomiao really liked to make friends.

705
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,640
She really liked it lively.

706
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,040
What was that sound?

707
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,240
Nothing.

708
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,560
It's daytime.

709
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
Jin Xiaoyu, what's your problem?

710
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,480
Do you think it's appropriate

711
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,440
to be so close to him

712
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,080
in front of his girlfriend?

713
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,240
You're unbelievable.

714
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,760
Why are you here?

715
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,640
I work in the mortuary next door.

716
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,760
I was full and wanted to take a walk.

717
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,440
Where did you get the apple?

718
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,880
It isn't a tribute, is it?

719
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,040
The canteen gave it to me.

720
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,960
What do you take me for?

721
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,440
Shoo!

722
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,080
Your girlfriend is so pretty.

723
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,560
She looks kind of familiar.

724
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,880
I remember now.

725
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
I have done funeral makeup on her.

726
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,760
It's been a while.

727
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,600
You're the one who did the makeup?

728
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,120
Thank you so much.

729
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,600
After the car accident,

730
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
it was hard to recognize her.

731
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,120
I didn't expect that she was

732
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
so spruced up for the funeral.

733
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,960
I was thinking

734
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,600
I had to

735
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
thank the mortuary makeup artist properly.

736
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:43,840
It's fine.

737
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,480
Every life

738
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,280
deserves to end at its best.

739
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,040
Not to mention she's such a lovely girl.

740
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,360
At the thought of her still-beating heart,

741
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
I'm not that sad anymore.

742

(Cardiology)

744
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,960
I have arranged a

745
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,160
GI series test tomorrow.

746
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,240
Okay.

747
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,040
Don't pull a long face.

748
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
I've done my best to postpone it.

749
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,320
Thank you, doctor.

750
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,920
The positive rate of

751
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,440
your HLA is 8%.

752
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,440
It isn't good.

753
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,280
How come it's not good again?

754
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,960
I've been trying to control

755
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
my water and sodium salt intake.

756
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,440
I've been eating tasteless food.

757
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,520
Ever since your mother went home,

758
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,080
all of your health indicators

759
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,200
are going bad.

760
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,000
If the results

761
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,880
of your next health check are still bad,

762
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,840
I'll have to call your family.

763
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,520
I just didn't sleep well lately.

764
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,640
I've been having dreams.

765
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,440
About the dreams,

766
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,400
you need to communicate with Director Fan.

767
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,360
Transplant rejection

768
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,720
isn't just physical,

769
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,320
it can also occur mentally.

770
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,360
So

771
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,200
psychological treatment is important as well.

772
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:58,640
Okay.

773
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,360
Tan Yueran.

774
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,040
Raise your head and look at me.

775
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Director Fan.

776
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,720
I've told you many times.

777
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,440
We need to communicate.

778
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,520
Not just verbally.

779
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,760
Eye contact

780
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,760
is also a part of it.

781
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,240
Okay.

782
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,560
If looking at me for a long time

783
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,640
makes you nervous,

784
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,120
you can look at me later,

785
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,240
okay?

786
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,480
Okay.

787
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,560
Doctor Zhou told me

788
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,200
you haven't been sleeping well lately.

789
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,040
Do you have anything
you would like to share with me?

790
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,400
I read a piece of news lately.

791
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
It says, an

792
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
Australian

793
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,200
heart transplant recipient

794
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,440
becomes addicted to hamburgers and French fries

795
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,520
after the surgery

796
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,200
because the original owner of the heart

797
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,960
was an 18-year-old young man

798
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,160
who liked to eat hamburgers and French fries.

799
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
Famous psychology professors of

800
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,320
Arizona State University

801
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
have studied and researched this
for more than 20 years.

802
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,160
They've found

803
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,760
that at least one out of ten

804
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,880
transplant recipients may have

805
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,360
a major personality change.

806
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,040
Some even inherit

807
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,040
the organ donors' personalities.

808
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,800
It's medically acknowledged that

809
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:08,760
the brain

810
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,120
isn't the only organ

811
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,480
that has a memory.

812
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,720
So we become

813
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,120
other people?

814
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,600
One organ isn't enough to
completely change a person.

815
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,280
I've been having

816
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,240
dreams about a handsome man.

817
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,960
I think it's related to the heart.

818
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,680
That's because you've become healthier,

819
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,720
and you have a better mentality.

820
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,560
As for the handsome man,

821
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,480
I think

822
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,720
it's because you're at the age of dating.

823
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,440
Love is also the heart's driving force.

824
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,000
Please take your pills on time.

825
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,080
Three times a day.

826
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,000
Two pills every time.

827
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,720
Okay.

828
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,080
I have a surprise for you.

829
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,400
A32, please go to the window to get your medicine.

830
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,080
Hi, I'm getting my medicine.

831
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,240
Please check.

832
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,040
Thank you.

833
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,580

and get your medicine at the designated window)

You're welcome to learn about our event.

Hello.

839
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,960
Do all donors fill in the forms here?

840
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,840
Yes.

841
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,240
You fill in the forms here,

842
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,560
however, whether the donation will be done or not

843
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,200
is up to your family.

844
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,160
Because their signatures
take the final legal effect.

845
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,400
I see.

846
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,240
Yes.

847
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,160
Can I get hold of you

848
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
with this number?

No.

I'm in charge of this project.

That's her.

855
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,120
She's a volunteer.

856
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,880
If you wish to be a donor or

857
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,720
want to learn any information about it,

858
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,720
you can speak to her.

00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:13,920
Master.

861
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,240
I thought you were off work.

862
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,960
What are you doing here?

863
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
I came to see

864
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,920
how much longer you need.

865
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,200
I've just finished applying the foundation makeup.

866
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,120
I've still got a lot to do.

867
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,800
The foundation is not bad.

868
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,520
Pretty good.

869
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,040
Right?

870
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,040
Doesn't look greasy.

871
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,520
When you're done here,
kindly teach Wang Quande how to apply foundation.

872
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,800
The other day, I was furious

873
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,280
after seeing the foundation he did.

874
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,200
It even reflected.

875
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,320
It's because

876
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,000
he forgot to apply the loose powder.

877
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,480
He was very young.

878
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,360
Yes.

879
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,960
Death doesn't care about your age.

880
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,520
Young people

881
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,000
need to be more careful.

882
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,720
Look.

883
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,000
He was just in his 20s
when he died after getting electrocuted

884
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,160
at his rented apartment.

885
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,240
But every time I see them,

886
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm kind of envious of them.

887
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,440
At least they knew their conditions.

888
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,040
At least they knew how they died.

889
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,560
Xiaoyu,

890
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,320
I wish you have uremia instead.

891
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,480
Even if I need to sacrifice

892
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,720
everything I own,

893
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,840
I would do everything to get you a kidney.

894
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,240
It's better than knowing nothing.

895
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,080
Master,

896
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,960
God is punishing you

897
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,480
for your inappropriate use of
health care resources.

898
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,080
Hence, my unknown disease.

899
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,560
Don't worry about me.

900
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,280
I mean...

901
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,000
Do you have to live elsewhere?

902
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,440
Where will you move?

903
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,160
Can I check the place?

904
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,960
Are you going to heaven?

905
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,120
No, I'm going to hell.

906
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,320
Hell, okay, master?

907
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,440
We've got a new intern, right?

908
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:56,920
I...

909
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,200
Don't feel comfortable
sleeping in the same room with someone.

910
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,200
You moving to another place

911
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,520
worries me.

912
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,560
I've prepared something for you.

913
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,520
You take them to your new dorm.

914
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,240
Wait, Master.

915
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,120
What have you prepared for me?

916
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,280
They're all in the yard.

917
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,940
(Buwenzhong)

918
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,240
So many dishes.

919
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,000
You'll get mushroom soup later.

920
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,040
Really?

921
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,000
What's this?

922
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,760
Is this black bean curd skin or shredded kelp?

923
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,040
It's a folk prescription
that my master created for me.

924
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,600
Toad skin.

925
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,720
Toad skin?!

926
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,240
How can you put such a disgusting

927
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,480
thing in the kitchen?

928
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,320
You're overreacting.

929
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,800
My finger got bitten by a turtle.

930
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,320
Do you have a band-aid, Young Master?

931
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,800
That's my house-blessing turtle, okay?

932
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,680
You know nothing.

933
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Did you tell Young Master

934
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,280
about the thing in the yard?

935
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,280
Oh, no.

936
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,840
I forgot. I got distracted by him.

937
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,560
You'd better tell Young Master soon.

938
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:56,720
Okay.

939
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,320
Don't come over.

940
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,800
A goose.

941
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,680
What an experience, huh?

942
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,520
I got attacked by a goose.

943
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,120
I got bitten by a turtle.

944
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,000
Actually I ate one piece

945
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
of that toad skin.

946
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,800
Guys, I'm sorry.

947
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,640
Here's the thing.

948
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,440
My master heard that I live in a bungalow,

949
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,760
so he got me a goose.

950
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,120
Your master is full of fun.

951
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,920
Why didn't he go to the Flower and Fruit Mountain

952
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,840
to get you a monkey?

953
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,240
Why didn't he?

954
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,920
Calm down.

955
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,320
Stop.

956
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,920
How about this?

957
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,080
I'll do the chores for today and tomorrow.

958
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,080
I'll do it all, okay?

959
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,680
No need.

960
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,920
Leave Buwenzhong now.

961
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,800
- Deal.
- Deal.

962
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,280
One day.

963
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:28,760
Just for one day.

964
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
We'll chuck her out once she finishes her work.

965
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,840
Sorry.

966
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,540
(Why?)

967
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,440
I do think that she's the Monkey King
from the Fruit and Flower Mountain.

968
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,280
With Jin Xiaoyu around,

969
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,120
life is trouble-free.

970
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,200
What's on her head?

971
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,360
- Jin Xiaoyu, time to cook.
- Jin Xiaoyu, time to cook.

972
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,520
Okay. Right away.
