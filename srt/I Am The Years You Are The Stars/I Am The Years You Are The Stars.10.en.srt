19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,520
There's a new computer science girl.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,040
Several seniors asked me for her information.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,120
A new girl?

22
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,440
How come I didn't know?

23
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,600
That

24
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,040
big-eyed girl

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560
with black, long hair

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,200
who wears a cute hat.

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,400
And she has long legs.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
I'm going to the lab.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
I'm really busy lately.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,960
You go ahead and go to work.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,960
You're back.

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,040
Are you Tan Yueran?

33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
You're wearing makeup.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,160
Are you going out?

35
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,280
I'm a bit busy lately.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,440
So I won't live in the dorm anymore.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,240
Black, long hair. Big eyes.

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
Wearing a cute hat.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,800
Long legs.

41
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,920
Are you talking about Tan Yueran?

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
The way she looks,

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
the way she lies,

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,680
every move of hers is suspicious.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,800
She always wears a fake smile.

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,600
She carried her luggage

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,880
while telling the person
on the other side of phone

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,960
that she was going to the lab.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,480
Tan Yueran in the past

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,640
used to be gloomy.

51
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,440
But she wasn't a bad person.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
The Tan Yueran right now

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,440
feels strange.

54
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,320
But many boys start to

55
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
take fancy to her.

56
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,120
Many

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,400
asked me for her information.

58
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Was Cai Miao such a player?

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,600
No.

60
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
I think it's more like
a histrionic personality disorder.

61
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,480
So

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
you think she will get into trouble

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,080
because of the sharp change?

64
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,440
It's because she got into trouble

65
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
that she changed so sharply.

66
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,960
She had a heart transplantation surgery, right?

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,720
We all think

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,480
she's controlled by the former owner

69
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,840
of the heart.

70
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,200
What kind of graduate student is she?

71
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:18,800
Ghost?

72
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
What was she talking about?

73
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,480
You're materialistic.

74
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,360
She isn't.

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,520
I'm scared of ghosts.

76
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,840
I grew up in the funeral home.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,800
If there was a ghost,

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,320
I'd be the first to subdue it.

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,240
Your nickname is Little Yama.

80
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
Ghosts are scared of you, you know?

81
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,080
All right.

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,600
What do we do?

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,640
To see Tan Yueran's doctor?

84
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,080
I'll make a phone call

85
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,000
with Chief Fan right away.

86
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
But I won't make it

87
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,680
to the shooting on Sunday.

88
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,640
Don't worry.

89
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,080
That's my territory.

90
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,400
Okay.

91
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,680
Here.

92
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,880
Relax.

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,120
Good.

94
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,760
Stay relaxed.

95
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,640
Don't be scared if you fall asleep.

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,360
It's okay to fall asleep.

97
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Who asked you to fall asleep?

98
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,360
Get out.

99
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,440
Doctor.

100
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,440
It's so comfortable here.

101
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,080
It doesn't matter

102
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,440
how many people sleep.

103
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,240
You keep treating him.

104
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,200
Don't mind me.

105
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,760
Come on.

106
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,320
Get out.

107
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,200
This isn't the place for you to sleep.

108
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:29,960
Get up. Get up.

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm in the middle of a treatment.

110
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
Get out. Get out.

111
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
I need treatment, too.

112
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,280
Man, just get out.

113
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,160
I need treatment, too!

114
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,840
Are all shrinks so grumpy?

115
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,000
So rude.

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Here to steal specimens again?

117
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
What specimen?

118
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
You're the handsome guy's friend, right?

119
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,840
The man Jin Xiaoyu is dating.

120
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,800
About that dude,

121
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
what did Jin Xiaoyu tell you?

122
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,680
Nothing.

123
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,200
Which makes me more worried.

124
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,960
Good.

125
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
Let me introduce myself.

126
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,640
I'm Dao Ruifeng.

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,280
My English name is William.

128
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,400
Jin Xiaoyu calls me Will.

129
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,720
I'm offering you an opportunity

130
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,640
to call me the same.

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,720
Jin Xiaoyu

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,080
wouldn't call you Will.

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
-You're lucky that she calls you William.
-I...

134
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,840
Hello. I'm Cheng Weilan.

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Nice to meet you.

136
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,040
Wait.

137
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Did you steal her boyfriend?

138
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,160
No.

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
Did she steal your boyfriend?

140
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,120
No.

141
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,160
Then you're not BFFs.

142
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Nice to meet you, too.

143
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,520
I'm more certain that

144
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,800
Jin Xiaoyu would never call you Will.

145
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,080
Hey.

146
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,560
Capable of nothing.

147
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,360
Useless.

148
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,240
You're the one to talk.

149
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,640
You scampered, too.

150
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,920
That was because I...

151
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,880
I heard Mrs. Xu came.

152
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,840
She's working.

153
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,520
I tell you what,

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,440
every time she's here, I can't help but tremble.

155
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,080
Something big will happen.

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,040
It stinks so much.

157
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,280
Can she take it?

158
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
I admire only two people in my life.

159
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,800
One is Chief Cheng from the Second Hospital.

160
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
The other is Mrs. Xu
from Criminal Investigation Department.

161
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
One is a female chief in the emergency department.

162
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,440
The other is a female legal examiner.

163
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,760
Mrs. Xu said

164
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,520
she admires you, too.

165
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,760
Really?

166
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,960
Did she really say that about me?

167
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,240
You're backbone of

168
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,480
the funeral makeup department at a very young age.

169
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
I'm so flattered.

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,840
Um, where is Mrs. Xu?

171
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,800
I'd like to go help her.

172
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,240
Wait.

173
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,200
It's not your turn.

174
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,720
Why?

175
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,640
Quan...

176
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Quanzhan?

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,160
What?

178
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
I'm cool, and I know it.

179
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,200
No.

180
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,640
I wanted to say that...

181
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
It's so unusual.

182
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,360
When Mrs. Xu came before,

183
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,240
he'd hide in the bathroom.

184
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,480
Why did he volunteer this time?

185
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,800
It's because

186
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
the PhD girl hasn't been replying to his messages.

187
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
He has channeled his sadness
into passion for work.

188
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,920
He's addicted.

189
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,120
That woman again?

190
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,360
Stop pacing.

191
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,480
It's still early.

192
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,280
Come and sit.

193
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Your treatment failed?

194
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,200
You're so clever.

195
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
I gave up on the treatment.

196
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,840
This place

197
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:21,880
isn't for me.

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,520
I'm waiting for my friend.

199
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,520
What about you?

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,600
What are you doing here?

201
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,080
I came to see Chief Fan.

202
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
How much longer

203
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,160
does your friend need?

204
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,480
It's a heavy question.

205
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm guessing he will never be cured

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
for his entire life.

207
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,280
The trauma is severe.

208
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,680
I mean this treatment.

209
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,840
Soon, soon.

210
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,800
He'll soon be out.

211
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,160
How long have you known Jin Xiaoyu?

212
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,280
I've known her for 20 years.

213
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,520
20 years?

214
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,400
You seem 16 to me.

215
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,320
You look pretty.

216
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,080
Greasy.

217
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,160
But I'm happy.

218
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,040
I'm glad you are.

219
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,920
The most important thing in life is being happy.

220
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,320
But it has been 20 years.

221
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,320
Previously,

222
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,880
Jin Xiaoyu was my mother's patient.

223
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,320
When I became a doctor,

224
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,560
she becomes my patient.

225
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,680
I see.

226
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,720
An old client.

227
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I, too, hope

228
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,960
she'll grow old.

229
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,440
The older, the better.

230
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,520
Alright, I'll be taking some pictures.

231
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,440
Okay.

232
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,080
Okay.

233
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,440
Okay.

234
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,240
More.

235
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
More.

236
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,640
What?

237
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,600
Why are you two staring at each other like that?

238
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,880
What are you talking about?

239
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,920
What do you mean, staring at each other?

240
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,320
I tell you what.

241
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,160
The legal examiners are performing dissection
of a highly decomposed body.

242
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,480
It stinks like hell.

243
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Don't go in there.

244
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,240
Legal examiners?

245
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Highly decomposed body?

246
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
Dissection?

247
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Let's go have a look.

248
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:01,960
- Okay.
- Go.

249
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,880
Wait.

250
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,240
I bought drinks for you.

251
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:04,920
No need.

252
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,920
Forget it.

253
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,560
Let them go.

254
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,040
Thanks.

255
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
Cheng Weilan told me about

256
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,120
Tan Yueran and Fu Liang.

257
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,520
You were staring at him

258
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
because you wanted to talk to him, right?

259
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,800
Be honest with me,

260
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,720
are you a mind-reader?

261
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,560
Your mind is written on your face.

262
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
I didn't need to exert any effort.

263
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,640
What else can I do?

264
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,840
I have to tell him.

265
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
Only psychological intervention, I guess.

266
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,880
After Cheng Weilan talks to the psychiatrist,

267
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
we'll decide to tell him or not.

268
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,440
And,

269
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,440
even if we do,

270
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
it can't be you.

271
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,560
Got it?

272
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:49,960
Got it.

273
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,080
What?

274
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,080
Not happy about it?

275
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
I just don't understand

276
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,840
why people who don't follow rules

277
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
get what they want,

278
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,840
while those who do

279
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,520
have to compromise.

280
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Why?

281
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,480
It's because

282
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,440
we don't do the right things

283
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,280
in order to gain benefits.

284
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,480
The right things

285
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
are simply right.

286
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,160
That's all.

287
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
Aren't you a saint?

288
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,820
(Name: Tan Yueran  Gender: Female
Degree: PhD in Computer Science)

289
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,920
Look,

290
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,160
that's the donor's family.

291
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
Tan Yueran is next to him.

292
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,080
Cheng.

293
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,640
Please ask your brother to investigate someone.

294
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,640
I came to find Chief Fan

295
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,040
because that patient

296
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,120
was his patient.

297
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,240
And I may need to

298
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,240
ask him for something

299
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,080
that can be used for psychological intervention.

300
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,440
I'd like to ask you.

301
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,960
Did Chief Fan

302
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,840
give a patient

303
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,760
psychological treatment a year ago?

304
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,640
What's the patient's name?

305
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,320
I can't tell you that.

306
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,360
William, my brother said...

307
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,120
What did your brother say?

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,240
She's not Jin Xiaoyu's friend, right?

309
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,000
What's she doing here?

310
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,520
How do I know?

311
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
What did your brother find?

312
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,360
My brother said he's had new discoveries.

313
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,080
What new discoveries?

314
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,200
Curious weaklings.

315
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
That's who you all are.

316
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,840
If you can't handle that,

317
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,960
why do you all still have to go see it?

318
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
Come. Drink some water.

319
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,600
Humans

320
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
are always in pursuit of

321
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
novelties and thrills.

322
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
What's novel

323
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,680
about a highly-decomposed body?

324
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
It's just a piece of rotten meat.

325
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,680
What's to...

326
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,400
Just take them away.

327
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,200
No more picture-taking.

328
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,760
Okay.

329
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,880
Don't worry, Jin Xiaoyu.

330
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,920
We won't be here again before we die.

331
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,920
Take it easy.

332
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,600
Goodbye.

333
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,360
Uh...

334
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
I won't go with them.

335
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,120
I came by

336
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,080
to visit Cai Miao.

337
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,120
Do you need me to go with you?

338
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
No, thanks.

339
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,520
You're off work, right?

340
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,120
I won't take up more of your time.

341
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,560
Good.

342
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,320
Give me a lift. Bye-bye.

343
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm off.

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
My second uncle. My grandmother.

518
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,520
My third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth,

519
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,360
- ninth, tenth aunt.
- Shut up!

520
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,840
Okay, I'll go back home for now

521
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,080
in case I got murdered by the maniac.

522
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,800
If you can't find Fu Liang,

523
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,520
just call the police.

524
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,440
Waste no time.

525
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,120
All right. I'm hanging up.

526
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,800
Let's go.

527
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,440
I'm prone to carsickness. So drive slowly.

528
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,280
She's quite used to ordering people around, huh?

529
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,080
This is a girl's privilege.

530
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,460
The number you dialed is powered off.

531
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,660
Sorry...

532
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,040
His phone is turned off.

533
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,160
What should we do? Should I call the police?

534
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,440
I trespassed to find the clue.

535
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,520
If you call the police,

536
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,920
you think they'll arrest me, or her?

537
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,840
What do we do now?

538
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,680
We can only try to search every single place

539
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,880
to find Fu Liang.

540
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,000
Let's go to the cemetery,

541
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,080
then the café,

542
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,280
and eventually his house.

543
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,080
Why are you here?

544
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,760
You've been following me?

545
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,600
You're a good writer.

546
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,600
Such a waste that you're a barista,

547
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,760
Mr. Coffee.

548
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,120
What on earth do you want?

549
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,120
Was there a feud between us?

550
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,880
Or do you know my ex-girlfriend?

551
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,000
Ex-girlfriend?

552
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,760
Ex-girlfriend.

553
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,720
Cai Miao is still alive.

554
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Cai Miao's heart still beats.

555
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,560
You're

556
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,800
the recipient of Cai Miao's heart.

557
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,480
I am Cai Miao.

558
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,120
Nice to meet you.

559
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,480
You're not Cai Miao.

560
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,120
This is Cai Miao's heart.

561
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,640
I am Cai Miao.

562
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,640
You don't admit that I'm Cai Miao

563
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,920
because your love is gone,

564
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,480
right?

565
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,480
You want to escape.

566
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,480
My love remains the same.

567
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,160
And it will always remain the same.

568
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm just going to live a better life

569
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,440
as she wished.

570
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,960
I don't know what's wrong with you.

571
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,560
You tied me up

572
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,080
in order to intimidate me?

573
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,440
Intimidate you?

574
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm not that bored.

575
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
You have no idea

576
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,000
what the heart means to me.

577
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,360
You don't understand

578
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,800
what Cai Miao means to me, either.

579
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,740
(Certificate of Honor)

580
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
These certificates of patent

581
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:24,840
and certificates of honor

582
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,920
(Certificate of Honor)
are all mine.

583
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,120
Yueran, you were awarded again.

584
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,080
We envy you so much.

585
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,680
Yeah.

586
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,440
How about we go to KTV?

587
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,200
Yeah, yeah.

588
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,160
Let's go celebrate.

589
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll pass.

590
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,640
Then we're going to KTV.

591
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
You go back to the dorm on your own.

592
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,440
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

593
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,280
Since I was little,

594
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,200
no matter what award I got,

595
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,040
when they congratulated me,

596
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,320
they'd also show their pity on me.

597
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,040
It wasn't until I knew Cai Miao

598
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,480
did I start to learn about this world again.

599
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Tan Yueran.

600
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,040
Tan Yueran.

601
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,280
Let's go shopping together.

602
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,720
- Okay.
- Let's go.

603
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,040
I knew

604
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,160
I made the right choice.

605
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm thankful that you are able

606
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,560
to experience this beautiful world because of her.

607
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,360
But why don't you cherish her?

608
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,680
Cai Miao is so nice.

609
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,640
Why did you leave her?

610
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,780
(Closed)

611
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,840
Come on.

612
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
He's not here. Go to his house.

613
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,400
How would I know where his house is?

614
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,000
I already know.

615
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
How come you know everything?

616
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,520
Did you do something illegal?

617
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,280
You got it right.

618
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:35,960
Let's go.

619
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,400
All right, you guys can go back now.

620
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,880
So your home is right here.

621
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah, this is my neighborhood.

622
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
There are security guards. Don't worry.

623
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,320
You can leave.

624
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,320
Security guards aren't bodyguards.

625
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,040
I'll walk you home.

626
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,240
All right, just go.

627
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,760
Wait.

628
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,080
Why are you so panicked today?

629
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,640
I'm not panicking.

630
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm...

631
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,080
If my mom saw

632
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,440
two single young men,

633
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,800
both of you would have to leave your ID card.

634
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,920
Just go. Get in. Get in.

635
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,560
Then you be careful.

636
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,480
Go, go.

637
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,000
My foot, ow-ow-ow!

638
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,600
My foot, my foot.

639
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,640
I'm off. Bye-bye.

640
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,040
The night before I went to see you,

641
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,200
I didn't sleep the whole night.

642
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,120
I was worried if you would recognize me.

643
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,720
And at the same time,
I was worried that you wouldn't.

644
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,120
I love you so much.

645
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,640
How can you leave me behind?

646
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,480
Are you Tan Yueran

647
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,600
or Cai Miao?

648
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,440
I'm Cai Miao.

649
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,040
Why did you lie to me?

650
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,040
I thought you were dead.

651
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,160
That's why I chose to leave

652
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,080
this heart-breaking place.

653
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,160
If you told me that you were alive,

654
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,760
I wouldn't choose to leave.

655
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,800
But

656
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,840
my face has changed.

657
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,720
Everything has changed.

658
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,920
I've become another person.

659
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,360
It's your soul that I love.

660
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,800
Not your flesh.

661
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,080
As long as your soul remains the same.

662
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,000
Our love won't change, either.

663
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,560
You lied.

664
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,440
You went to the cemetery

665
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,880
to bid me farewell.

666
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,320
You were going to leave me behind.

667
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,280
When I went to the cemetery,

668
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
I didn't know you were still alive.

669
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,720
Now that you know,

670
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,160
will you still go?

671
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,760
Of course not.

672
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm going to be with you.

673
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,560
Forever.

674
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,360
Miao,

675
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,400
don't cry.

676
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,480
Untie my hands, okay?

677
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,680
I'd like to hug you.

678
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,080
You liar.

679
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,240
Tan Yueran.

680
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,520
Keep him here.

681
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,600
Keep him here forever.

682
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,600
Tan Yueran.

683
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:26,800
Wake up.

684
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,800
Keep him here.

685
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
Give him to me!

686
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,320
Tan Yueran!

687
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,320
Don't make a sound.

688
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,080
Who is it?

689
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,880
Cai Miao.

690
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,880
Delivery.

691
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I didn't order anything.

692
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,280
Leave!

693
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,680
Delivery for the dead Cai Miao.

694
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,520
Silence.

695
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,520
The deliveryman can't save you.

696
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,760
Help!

697
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,360
You!

698
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,080
You thugs!

699
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,120
Help!

700
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,480
Help!

701
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,080
Are you okay?

702
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,200
Let me go!

703
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,280
Thank you for finding me.

704
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm fine.

705
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,680
Let her go.

706
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,760
Fu Liang,

707
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,680
don't leave me!

708
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,480
Tan Yueran.

709
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,920
Look at me.

710
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,040
You're not Cai Miao.

711
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,480
You're Tan Yueran.

712
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,400
The one and only Tan Yueran.

713
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
No matter how good others are,

714
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,320
they are not Tan Yueran.

715
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,160
Yes, you have her heart,

716
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,880
but it wasn't meant to turn you into Cai Miao.

717
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,600
It was meant to make you be yourself.

718
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,880
No matter what happened between us,

719
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,320
you need to continue living.

720
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,080
I need to thank you.

721
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,640
Thank you for wanting to repay her.

722
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,400
But

723
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,800
this isn't what she wanted.

724
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,520
Before she died,

725
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,280
she said to the doctor

726
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,560
that she wished me to forget her

727
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,200
and start a new life.

728
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,760
Here.

729
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,400
What took you so long?

730
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,280
It was too far away.

731
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
Put it on me.

732
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,080
Can't you act more like a lady?

733
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,280
Shut up

734
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,520
and put it on me.

735
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,240
Why...

736
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,560
Why...

737
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,240
Why did you buy such a big diamond?

738
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,320
It doesn't matter

739
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,880
if you have her heart

740
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,560
or if others have her corneas.

741
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,200
Even if all her organs are on one person,

742
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,760
that person is not her.

743
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,600
Thank you

744
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,640
for bringing her heart

745
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,360
to visit me.

746
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,600
Would you like to listen to her heartbeats?

747
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,760
Now

748
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,600
the heartbeat is different.

749
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,680
It has completely become your organ.

750
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,400
Please take good care of it.

751
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,600
Is it really different from before?

752
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,040
I used to listen often.

753
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,440
It is different.

754
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,080
Different heartbeats?

755
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,760
- Tan Yueran!
- Tan Yueran!

756
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,600
- Tan Yueran!
- Tan Yueran!

757
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,680
Call an ambulance!

758
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,120
Tan Yueran!

759
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,440
To her,

760
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,440
being alive is more important.

761
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,480
Thanks,

762
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,200
Professor Lin.

763
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,240
No problem.

764
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,360
Here, the bag.

765
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:56,480
Thanks.

766
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,800
Is the apartment

767
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,560
ready?

768
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,400
Yeah. It's all sorted.

769
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
I'll rent my classmate's apartment.

770
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,840
My stuff has been mailed there.

771
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,080
My classmate will help me put things in place.

772
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,520
Your classmate is good to you.

773
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,600
Male or female?

774
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,800
Both.

775
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,960
They're a couple.

776
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,640
Good.

777
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,680
At least there are people to look out for you.

778
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,040
And,

779
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,680
they have a younger sister,

780
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,400
who is pretty and single.

781
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,200
Is she?

782
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,360
It couldn't be better.

783
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,040
All right.

784
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,560
It's about time for you to go.

785
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,360
When you arrive,

786
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
remember to send me a WeChat message

787
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,120
to let me know.

788
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,200
During the journey alone,

789
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,400
watch your cellphone and wallet.

790
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:29,960
Don't lose them.

791
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,400
Don't worry.

792
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Let's meet again sometime.

793
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,920
Take good care of yourself.

794
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,920
Go.

795
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,640
Bye.

796
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,120
Go home.

797
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,960
(Eternal Love)
Sir, railway station, please.

798
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,520
Let's look at this one.

799
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
X-Y=3-A.

800
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,920
X+2Y=5A.

801
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,000
So

802
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,000
why did you choose C?

803
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,480
They've all got the same length.

804
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,960
You couldn't have guessed, could you?

805
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,320
My bad.

806
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,440
Which one, then?

807
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,360
Tan Yueran.

808
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,280
Xiaoyu.

809
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,040
What are you doing here?

810
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,760
You and Cheng Weilan

811
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,840
are the two people
I'd like to see the least right now.

812
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
You may never

813
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,320
see the chief doctor
of the emergency department again,

814
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:25,920
but you'll see

815
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,840
a funeral home worker eventually.

816
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,320
So you'll never avoid me.

817
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,200
So scary.

818
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,200
I heard you'd be discharged soon.

819
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,000
Congrats.

820
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,000
Thank you

821
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,280
for sending me to the hospital in time.

822
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,720
Don't thank me.

823
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,160
Fu Liang carried you downstairs.

824
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,760
You have to remember what he said.

825
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,240
He convinced Cai Miao's parents

826
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,160
to donate the heart to you.

827
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,840
Cheng Weilan got up in the middle
of the night to deliver the organ,

828
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,800
and Dr. Zhou

829
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,920
worked more than ten hours.

830
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,120
All the efforts

831
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,440
are to

832
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,680
make you a better self.

833
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,480
The past days

834
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,720
have been like a dream.

835
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,120
I felt like I was an extra

836
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,760
forcefully placed in the leading character's seat.

837
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,280
Chief Fan said

838
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,680
I couldn't adapt

839
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,640
to the great joy,

840
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,080
so I needed to

841
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,600
cushion the shock with another identity.

842
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,240
After I came to my senses,

843
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,600
when I think of what I did,

844
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,960
I feel so ashamed.

845
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,760
Oh, right.

846
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,560
About the specific medicine...

847
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,520
It was recommended to me

848
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,880
by a friend I knew online.

849
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,640
After I came to my senses,

850
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,400
I realized the medicine was problematic,

851
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,560
so I gave it to Dr. Zhou.

852
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,280
A friend of mine

853
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,480
is also investigating the medicine.

854
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,480
Could you please

855
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,360
offer me some clues?

856
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,760
Sure.

857
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,000
I've done so many bad things,

858
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,320
but you never resented me.

859
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,880
I've got to do you this favor.

860
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
In your dreams.

861
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,920
As soon as Fu Liang heard you get off bed,

862
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,160
he immediately packed his stuff.

863
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,400
Right now, he's on his way to the railway station.

864
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,560
Our relationship

865
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,080
can never be repaired, can it?

866
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,200
It can be.

867
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,480
If you become

868
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,280
Quanzhan's girlfriend,

869
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,520
we can repair it.

870
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,160
It can be discussed.

871
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,360
You discuss with him.

872
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,360
If anything happens to me,

873
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,480
don't forget to contribute to my funeral.

874
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,240
Jin Xiaoyu,

875
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,840
aren't you nasty?

876
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:07,880
This is for you.

879

883

I can't live a life like this anymore.

884
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,320
I'm exhausted.

885
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,280
It's unlucky

886
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,080
of Qian Tu

887
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,160
to have a brother like you.

888
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,760
As long as I'm home,

889
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,480
it's all fine.

890
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,960
"As long as I'm home, it's all fine."

891
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,960
You masochist.

892
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:46,880
You know nothing.

893
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:47,720
I know nothing?

894
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,640
What do I need to know?

895
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,160
I'm a dude, why do I need to know you?

896
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,620
(Xue Pan Wanwan)

897
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,640
Xue Pan?

898
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,760
What kind of nickname is that?

899
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,520
Xue Wanwan.

900
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,960
She's got a big face

901
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,840
and a frail heart.

902
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,320
So calling her Xue Pan is appropriate.
[*The Chinese word "Pan" means plate.]

903
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,560
Xue Wanwan likes you so much,

904
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,280
and you treat her like this?

905
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,400
Where did your gentility go?

906
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,240
What gentility?

907
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,080
She and I grew up from kindergarten.

908
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,720
I even know how many times she wetted her bed.

909
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,680
What's the most important in a relationship?

910
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
The sense of mystery.

911
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,080
There's no chance between us.

912
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,580
(Thief Doctor)

913
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,160
Who is it again?

914
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,840
Why are all your nicknames so weird?

915
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,360
Weilan.

916
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
William, I was busy.

917
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,920
I saw your text message.

918
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,640
You wanted to donate to the volunteer association?

919
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,520
How much will you donate?

920
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
I may have used the wrong words.

921
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,080
I'm asking for donation.

922
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,240
I didn't offer to donate.

923
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,520
Weilan.

924
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,320
Can I have dinner with you?

925
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,760
I'm so tired,

926
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,720
and so hungry.

927
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,760
I happen to be near your hospital.

928
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,800
You're crazy.

929
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,800
Can you shut up?

930
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,120
The canteen?

931
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,560
Perfect.

932
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,880
I enjoy canteen the most.

933
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,360
Okay.

934
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,480
I'll be right there.

935
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,000
Dao Ruifeng,

936
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,120
are you wooing the doctor?

937
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,280
She's Jin Xiaoyu's best friend.

938
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,440
You'd die horrifically.

939
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,360
Uh...

940
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,680
My novel

941
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,840
is missing a female doctor character.

942
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,080
So I'm doing research.

943
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,360
Research?

944
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,320
This is obviously courting.

945
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,160
Please.

946
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,480
Can you not disturb me?

947
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,200
When your brother's here,

948
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,360
you two put things in place together.

949
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,480
Please. Please.

950
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,440
Please. Please.

951
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,720
I'll watch you die.

952
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:15,760
Ma'am,

953
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,520
half bowl of shredded potatoes.

954
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,480
You came out of thin air.

955
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,560
No, from your heart.

956
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,160
What do you want? Order yourself.

957
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520
I want this.

958
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,440
Braised eggplant.

959
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,080
And this.

960
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
Scrambled egg with tomato.

961
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,400
Can you order some real meat?

962
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
I can afford it.

963
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:34,760
Miss,

964
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,680
I want steamed pork belly with preserved cabbage.

965
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,120
Okay, this is it, then.

966
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
Is 200 grams of rice enough?

967
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,760
How much is that?

968
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,800
You sit there.

969
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,600
You'll soon find out.

970
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,760
Ma'am,

971
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
200 grams of rice for two.

972
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,440
Weilan.

973
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,120
You can't choose this pretty face.

974
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,000
He dines with you in the canteen,

975
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,360
and asks you to pay?

976
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,200
He's a leech.

977
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,640
Ma'am,

978
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,920
I'm not young.

979
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,160
My mom is pushing me to get married.

980
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,200
I don't get to be picky.

981
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,880
I don't mind if he's a leech.

982
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I don't care anymore.

983
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,920
I'm off.

984
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,600
Thanks.

985
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,280
My grandmother told me

986
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,840
I have a bad digestive system.

987
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,720
So I need to eat soft food.

988
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,920
But it's just a plate of steamed pork belly.

989
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,240
It's not too much, right?

990
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,480
There's a saying.

991
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,400
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

992
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,400
Same for dinner.

993
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,120
Last time,

994
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,080
you stole my specimen,

995
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,280
I haven't gotten even with you.

996
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,240
Just eat.

997
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,160
You stole my heart last time,

998
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,400
and I stole your specimen,

999
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,520
so we're even.

1000
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,880
- Right?
- I don't want your heart.

1001
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,480
Take it.

1002
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,360
Don't be like this.

1003
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,480
We're so openly together.

1004
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,640
You can't jilt me like this,

1005
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,120
right?

1006
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,960
I'll die with you.

1007
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,520
Okay?

1008
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:43,640
Sure.

1009
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,360
Oh, right.

1010
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,080
I have a serious question for you.

1011
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,920
Are Xiaoyu and your friend

1012
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
having a relationship?

1013
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,680
I'm kind of worried.

1014
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,840
It's none of your business.

1015
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,320
Whether they're having a relationship or not

1016
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,680
is their problem.

1017
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,720
Though my friend

1018
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,800
is less good-looking than me,

1019
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,040
and he's older than me,

1020
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,120
he's got a good heart.

1021
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
That's exactly

1022
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,560
why I'm worried.

1023
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,400
If,

1024
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,200
I mean if someday,

1025
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,160
Xiaoyu breaks his heart,

1026
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,680
you can't defame her.

1027
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,280
You must speak well of her.

1028
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,280
And try to get her some compensation
for the break-up.

1029
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,320
So you're worried about my friend

1030
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,040
instead of me.

1031
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,800
Yeah.

1032
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,600
Xiaoyu never had a relationship before,

1033
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,640
