(Qing'ai Group)

21
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,860
(Uncle Baiju)

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,320
Hello?

23
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,920
Is that a meteorolite in the picture?

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,640
Yes,

25
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,440
I have found it.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
It used to be large.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,120
But for some reason it has become so small.

28
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,520
We had always been trying to find a cure,

29
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,490
but all our efforts ended in vain.

30
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
But just now,

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,400
while I was standing by the meteorolite,

32
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,440
I felt my heart

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,920
pounding in my chest.

34
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,960
Something in my body seemed to be

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,200
eager to leave my body

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,360
to go back to the meteorolite.

37
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,960
If it went back,

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,760
perhaps I would be cured.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,600
Uncle Baiju,

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,960
would you become an ordinary man?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,520
Yes,

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,040
maybe.

43
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,920
I may also become a hundred-year-old man.

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,920
There is another possibility.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,480
That is

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,600
vanishing all together.

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,520
Jiang Baiju!

48
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Bring the meteorolite back.

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,920
We can make a decision after that,

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,440
okay?

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
There is no time for me to take it back,

52
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,200
Xiuxiu.

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
The gang leader
of the special drug has been caught.

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,360
They hid the meteorolite

55
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
in the Eternal Life Technology building.

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,680
The meteorolite will be
handed to the police soon.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,400
I have to give the thing in my body

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,400
back to the meteorolite
before the police arrive.

59
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,360
That's why

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,840
I might not be able
to bid you farewell in person.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,440
Are you saying,

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,960
you are leaving soon?

63
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,720
I don't know.

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,560
But if I really died,

65
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,080
you would have to take care of Qing'ai Group.

66
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,920
Please put away

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
all my manuscripts

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,640
and take good care of yourself.

69
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,720
Also,

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,560
take good care of Xiaoyu for me.

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,040
Jiang Baiju!

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,040
Jiang Baiju!

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,400
No! No! No!

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,040
Tell me where you are!

75
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,280
Where are you? Where are you?

76
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,080
I'll come find you immediately, okay?

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,320
Just tell me where you are!

78
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,640
You are such a silly girl.

79
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
By the time you come,

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,320
the police will have arrived.

81
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,320
Do we need to say goodbye?

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,520
This is also pretty good.

83
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,640
I won't be able to handle

84
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,600
the cries of two ladies on the same night.

85
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,200
What?

86
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,040
What do you mean by two ladies?

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
Is Jin...Jin Xiaoyu with you?

88
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
She was with me just now.

89
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,880
She had promised me that she wouldn't cry.

90
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,720
But she was weeping buckets.

91
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,680
Jiang Baiju!

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,040
You broke my heart.

93
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,440
I never want to break your heart, Xiuxiu.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,880
You are just like my daughter,

95
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,360
my family.

96
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,960
I am thankful I was able to

97
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,480
see you grow up till now.

98
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,080
But I am also sorry

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,200
for not being able
to accompany you any longer.

100
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,200
Xiuxiu.

101
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
If something bad happens to me,

102
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,280
this will be my goodbye.

103
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,320
All right?

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,080
Jiang Baiju, hang on!

105
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,950
- Goodbye, Xiuxiu!
- Uncle Baiju!

106
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,000
- Goodbye!
- Please don't hang up on me!

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,160
Please don't end the call!

108

(Baoxin Purification Equipment)

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,560
Jiang Baiju!

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Jiang Baiju!

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Jiang Baiju! Wake up!

112
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
Jiang Baiju! Please wake up!

113
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,840
I'm still young.

114
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,240
I don't want to be a widow.

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,480
You haven't left me
with any inheritance yet! Jiang Baiju!

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,040
Jiang Baiju! You are awake!

117
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,960
I woke up when I heard
the word "inheritance".

118
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,520
How are you feeling now?

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,760
I don't think you changed at all.

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
My body does feel heavier.

121
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
Your wound isn't healing!

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,680
It's still bleeding!

123
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,960
Are you an ordinary man now?

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,720
How are you feeling now?

125
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,760
I think I should change my wife.

126
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,640
No, you can't!

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,400
You have to make do!

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,120
After 100 years,

129
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm finally back!

130
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,560
Welcome back!

131
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,640
After all the ups and downs,

132
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
you will still pass away before me.

133
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,600
Well,

134
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,960
at least now you can say
the lines you memorized.

135
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,640
I have already said them!

136
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,940
♪I was born to be alone♪

137
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,290
♪I know that adoration is nothing♪

138
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,420
♪If everything has to return to the ground♪

139

♪It's also forgiveness♪

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,770
♪I'll leave you a love letter♪

141
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,640
Don't tell me you'll pass away right now.

142
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,240
Don't worry.

143
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,680
I won't give you the chance
to say those lines.

144
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,120
Wait! Where's Lin Nuoyan?

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,440
Where's the meteorolite?

146
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,440
What's going on?

147
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,840
Something is wrong.

148
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,640
Let's leave.

149
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,280
They are alive,

150
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,840
but unconscious!

151
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,920
We have to leave here right away.

152
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,880
But what's going on?

153
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,520
Has Zhao Shan kidnapped Lin Nuoyan?

154
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,840
That's not possible.

155
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,800
We really need to go now!

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,440
No, it won't do!

157
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,240
What about President Zhang?

158
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,960
The police will know

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,800
how to deal with him.

160
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,360
But we may be in trouble now.

161
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,440
Let's go!

162
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,400
Careful!

163
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,880
Xiuxiu!

164
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,200
I'm fine!

165
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,280
Don't worry.

166
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:40,840
Don't say anything.

167
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,720
Let's get in the car first.

168
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,160
Let's go.

169
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,960
You said you were dying, right?

170
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,200
Am I seeing a ghost now?

171
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,080
He didn't die!

172
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,400
He has become an ordinary man!

173
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Take a look at

174
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,560
his wound.

175
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,240
Take a look!

176
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,920
Yes.

177
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,040
What are you doing...

178
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,400
Wait!

179
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,840
You two are really

180
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,840
from the same family!

181
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,480
You are really an ordinary man now!

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
How are you feeling?

183
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,040
Why are the police here?

184
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,160
It was the automatic alarm.

185
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
I felt something was wrong
when I noticed the meteorite was missing.

186
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
So we quickly left the place.

187
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,960
Hold on.

188
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,840
Where's Lin Nuoyan?

189
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,840
I need to give Lin Nuoyan a call.

190
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,300
(Jin Xiaoyu)

191
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,480
Hello?

192
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,640
Lin Nuoyan.

193
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,760
Where are you?

194
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,800
When the alarm went off,

195
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,120
I ran out.

196
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you all right?

197
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,880
We are both fine.

198
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,680
Tell me where you are now.

199
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,440
We'll go pick you up.

200
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,400
There is no need to do that.

201
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
You guys should go.

202
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,400
What are you saying?

203
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,640
How could we go without you?

204
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,520
Listen to me.

205
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
The meteorolite is missing.

206
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,200
The police will surely
investigate it's disappearance.

207
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
So just tell me

208
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,560
where you are now.

209
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,320
We'll go pick you up.

210
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,960
Otherwise, the police might get to you.

211
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,080
Jin Xiaoyu.

212
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,640
Thank you for your concern.

213
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll be fine.

214
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
What are you saying?

215
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,560
Lin Nuoyan, I'm Jiang Baiju.

216
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,800
Where are you?

217
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,400
Nothing happened to you?

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,720
The meteorolite is missing.

219
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,600
Zhang Shan has run away.

220
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,680
Where are you?

221
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,320
Jiang Baiju.

222
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,000
Looks like you've gotten what you wanted.

223
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
You are an ordinary man now.

224
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,320
And I have also got what I wanted.

225
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,920
We should go our separate ways.

226
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,960
So, you took the meteorolite?

227
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,760
It actually belongs to me.

228
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,840
And the thing inside your body

229
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
also belongs to me.

230
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,600
Eighty years ago,

231
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,080
you, an outsider, intruded our holy land,

232
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,280
and took away the holy thing
in the Holy Stone.

233
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,920
This brought disasters to our village.

234
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,040
Let's have a look.

235
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
Chief, look!

236
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
He is dead.

237
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,200
Chief,

238
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,280
this stone from the sky

239
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,640
has been here for so long.

240
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I never expected

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,520
it to be broken

242
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,240
by a man from the sky.

243
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,360
What a pity!

244
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,240
I will gather some young men

245
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,800
to collect these broken-off pieces.

246
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,560
This man is in military uniform.

247
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
I hope he won't bring us the disaster of war.

248
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,960
How about

249
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,160
burying him?

250
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
What you said makes sense.

251
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,280
I will ask them to bring some tools

252
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,600
to dig a hole and bury him.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,840
Elder, please wait.

254
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,040
He was moving just now.

255
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
He is still alive.

256
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
How's that possible?

257
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,160
Chief!

258
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,760
He fell down from the sky.

259
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,800
How could he not die

260
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
from such a fall?

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,960
If he really came back to life,

262
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,720
he must be a monster.

263
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,360
In that case, he must be dealt with.

264
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,080
We have to bury him.

265
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,960
How's this?

266
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,040
You stay here to keep an eye on him.

267
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,200
I will go gather some men.

268
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,760
Elder Bai really said that

269
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,520
that man was from the sky?

270
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,560
My Dad also said that

271
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,960
that man is probably a soldier.

272
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,400
Our chief could tell that from his uniform.

273
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
Only the chief in our village
has gone to the outside world.

274
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,240
He has the most experience.

275
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,600
War is going on outside.

276
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,480
Who knows where he came from.

277
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,480
Who cares where he came from.

278
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
My father said we just need to dig a hole

279
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,280
and bury him.

280
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,240
Stop!

281
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,400
The dragon under the ground is turning over!

282
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,440
An avalanche is coming soon!

283
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,000
Hurry!

284
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,040
Bring the others down the mountain now!

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,720
We can't run!

286
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,240
My family is still at home.

287
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,040
Don't panic!

288
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,640
Bring them to find the stone
from the sky first.

289
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,240
Leave the monster.

290
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,560
I'll go back and inform the others.

291
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,120
You should

292
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,400
go down in the direction of the flower field.

293
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,360
- Don't panic! Come on!
- Hurry up!

294
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:26,960
Alright!

295
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,840
Let's go!

296
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,160
Take good care of the kids behind.

297
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,080
The village has been buried!

298
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,080
- My home is gone!
- My home is gone!

299
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,920
My home!

300
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,480
My home!

301
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,280
My home!

302
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,960
What remarkable concurrence of events, right?

303
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,120
You probably never thought that

304
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,800
your sudden appearance

305
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,280
would make a village that

306
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
has existed for hundreds of years
to suddenly disappear.

307
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,320
My ancestors narrowly survived the disaster

308
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,360
and came down with the Holy Stone.

309
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,360
Whoever touched the Holy Stone

310
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,520
began to have erythema soon.

311
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
Not only were they unsavable,

312
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,920
their offspring

313
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,480
were also born with erythema

314
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,320
and would die before thirties.

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,120
In order to save our people,

316
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
ever since the generation
of my great grandfather,

317
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
my family has been studying medical science.

318
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,200
Then everything changed
for my father's generation.

319
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,560
He and his colleagues

320
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,840
found a radioactive element in the meteorite,

321
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,360
which didn't belong to earth.

322
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,440
They studied the meteorite with great passion

323
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,760
and developed the medicine
that you guys called the special drug.

324
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,880
Yet a devoted scholar

325
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,680
like him

326
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,240
had to silently take

327
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,480
all the responsibilities

328
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,360
alone

329
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,920
(Court)
when they were faced with

330
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
vehement condemnation from the public.

331
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,160
Dad!

332
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,880
Son!

333
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,040
Study hard!

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,840
Take good care of yourself!

335
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,680
I understand, Dad!

336
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,400
(Police)
His motive to develop the medicine was to

337
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,680
cure difficult and complicated diseases,

338
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,280
especially for those

339
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,120
offspring of the villagers
who are still alive.

340
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,960
But you should know that

341
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
it is inevitable to see

342
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,920
the death of some individuals

343
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,840
in medical experiments,

344
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
especially in these experiments

345
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,000
that will lead to scientific wonders
benefiting generations to come.

346
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,600
Don't you think it's good
that there are people that are willing to

347
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,920
sacrifice themselves for this cause?

348
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,240
Zhao Shan

349
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,880
and Gao Guofu have been grateful to my father

350
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,000
for his sacrifice.

351
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
They carried on his study.

352
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,400
President Zhang who respects my father

353
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,640
also sent me abroad to study.

354
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,280
I devoted myself to

355
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,680
my experiments

356
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,400
in the laboratory day and night.

357
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,040
I did it! I did it!

358
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
Congratulations!

359
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,880
I have received many praise from my peers

360
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,000
as well as my teachers.

361
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,960
But only I know that

362
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,280
it was my father's sacrifice

363
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,720
that allowed me

364
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,080
to have the samples

365
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,240
and data!

366
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,680
That's why the moment I

367
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,560
returned home,

368
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,680
I knew with my capabilities that I could

369
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,680
fulfill my father's last wish

370
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
and clear their names.

371
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,400
I will have the nation approve of their work

372
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,080
and make all people know that

373
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,360
he is not a criminal,

374
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,320
but a real scientist.

375
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,600
So, Jiang Baiju,

376
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,840
all of this

377
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,160
is because of you!

378
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,080
The misfortunes of all those people

379
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,200
are because of you!

380
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,640
You should really be grateful to Jin Xiaoyu.

381
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,400
If it wasn't for her,

382
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,240
I wouldn't have spared your life.

383
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,880
Now,

384
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,640
I have merely taken back the thing
that belongs to me

385
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,280
to further my research.

386
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,360
I hope we can part ways amicably

387
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,040
and never see each other again.

388
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,640
And

389
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,200
tell Jin Xiaoyu

390
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
to wait for me.

391
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,440
I will complete my research

392
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,280
and find a cure for her.

393
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,680
Lin Nuo...

394
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,920
Uncle Zhao Shan,

395
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,240
let's go!

396
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,380
(South Exit of Lingjiang Road)

397
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,560
So,

398
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,080
he is an offspring of the village

399
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,280
and I'm an offspring of the village, too.

400
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,240
Lin Nuoyan was partly right just now.

401
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,200
All of this is

402
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,000
because of me.

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,680
Nonsense!

404
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,320
Nonsense!

405
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,120
You didn't fall down from the sky so as to

406
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,160
smash the stone.

407
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,800
That was during the war
and the whole country was in chaos.

408
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,200
All of this

409
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,000
is just destiny.

410
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,520
Yeah,

411
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,240
I agree!

412
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,360
I think

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,560
I'm bleeding too much.

414
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,320
Hurry!

415
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Drive to the hospital!

416
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,600
Even if we call the police,

417
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,440
(Fever Clinic)
it's difficult to explain things.

418
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,320
Do you expect the police to believe that

419
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,840
Young Master has lived for 100 years?

420
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,160
They probably will think that

421
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
we are crazy!

422
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,240
Lin Nuoyan kept saying on the phone that

423
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,920
their motive is to cure diseases
and save people,

424
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,560
making it sound as if
his father was a persecuted scientist.

425
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,720
How could he forget

426
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,040
all the terrible things
he and his family have done to others?

427
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,440
This man has planned this for twenty years.

428
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,200
He harms those who are thankful to him

429
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,640
and even kids.

430
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,680
To him, harming others

431
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,960
is just a means of achieving his goals.

432
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,600
In this world,

433
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
there are plenty of crazy scientists.

434
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Lin Nuoyan also said that

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
he would find a way to cure Jin Xiaoyu.

436
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,000
Can we believe him?

437
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,200
After all, they came from

438
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,600
the same village.

439
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,880
You are so childish!

440
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,080
How could you believe a crazy man?

441
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm still confused about

442
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,360
one thing.

443
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,760
What is it?

444
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,320
How could

445
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Lin Nuoyan

446
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,400
know that

447
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,360
Jiang Baiju is an undead?

448
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,280
Erm...

449
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,000
Uncle!

450
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,560
Grandma!

451
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,360
William!

452
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400
Why don't you let me answer that question?

453
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,280
Mother!

454
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,880
Why not listen to what he has to say?

455
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,320
Granny!

456
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,160
Don't you want to know

457
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,720
the person who revealed
Young Master's secret?

458
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,480
Come with me.

459
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,880
Let's go!

460
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,320
Come, Mother!

461
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,440
Mr. Qian Tu!

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,480
Uncle!

463
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,720
Take it easy.

464
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,160
You will see something scarier soon.

465
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,160
No,

466
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,560
what are you guys doing here?

467
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,840
Anyway,

468
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,520
Lin Nuoyan is the man
behind all those evil things.

469
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,680
But don't worry.

470
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,160
The police are going after him.

471
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,160
Dear, take it easy.

472
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,920
Lin Nuoyan

473
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,760
has escaped.

474
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Escaped?

475
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,320
How did he escape?

476
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,360
(Emergency Room)
Mr. Qian Tu.

477
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,520
What happened to you?

478
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,280
Lin's accomplice did this.

479
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,680
Fortunately,

480
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,640
William saved me.

481
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,120
Qian Tu,

482
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,680
are you okay?

483
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,720
You owe me big this time!

484
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,120
Wait,

485
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,040
how did you know he would run into troubles?

486
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,840
It's a long story.

487
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,440
But I believe you remember something.

488
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,520
Granny.

489
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,320
Weren't you curious

490
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
about the person
who revealed Young Master's secret?

491
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,600
That person is in this room.

492
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,960
It's her

493
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,640
who told Lin Nuoyan that

494
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,520
Young Master would never die.

495
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
How did this person

496
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,680
find out about it?

497
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,840
Many years ago,

498
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,400
this person

499
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,800
saw how Young Master came back to life.

500
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,040
She met Lin Nuoyan later.

501
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,720
They had something in common
and instantly became partners.

502
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Fortunately,

503
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Lin Nuoyan is a

504
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,360
crazy scientist that has his own conviction.

505
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,880
But the person inside

506
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,880
is the antisocial guy.

507
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,280
How did she see me?

508
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,600
Many years ago,

509
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
I only saved Qian Cheng.

510
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,760
Exactly.

511
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,480
Young Master.

512
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,600
It was that time.

513
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,000
And we all know this guy.

514
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,240
Let's get to know her again.

515
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,000
It's you?

516
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:23,960
Granny! Granny!

517
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,000
Granny!

518
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,920
It's not her.

519
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,080
She's an emergency doctor.

520
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,360
It's not her. It's not her.

521
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,640
Come here!

522
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,360
Ye Lai.

523
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,800
I was...

524
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,960
I was forced to do that.

525
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,320
I didn't mean to do it.

526
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,600
Lin Nuoyan said

527
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,240
if I didn't do as he said,

528
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,720
he wouldn't give me the medicine.

529
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,280
Without the medicine,

530
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,960
I wouldn't be able to recover

531
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,400
and come back to see Qian Cheng.

532
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,360
Calm down! Calm down! Calm down!

533
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,560
There are surveillance cameras here.

534
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,880
Let's go somewhere else to question her.

535
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,560
Let me do it.

536
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,120
Let's go.

537
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,200
I asked your uncle to watch outside.

538
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,000
Remember to be a law-abiding citizen.

539
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,000
Got it.

540
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,960
I'm leaving now.

541
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,560
Granny Dao.

542
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,240
I'm sorry.

543
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,480
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

544
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,920
I'm sorry! Please save me!

545
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,160
William!

546
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,720
Grandma, take a seat.

547
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:50,800
Ye Lai,

548
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,000
you are such a good actress.

549
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,360
This is your medical record

550
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
I obtained from the United States.

551
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,560
(Ye Lai's Medical Record)
You were sent to the US

552
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,080
not for

553
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,120
PTSD

554
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,920
but for APD.

555
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,440
Antisocial Personality Disorder.

556
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,920
Antisocial Personality Disorder.

557
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,280
As a patient of this disease,

558
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,560
it's difficult for you to

559
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,400
adapt to this society.

560
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,080
So instead, you are using your acting skills

561
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,680
and your lies

562
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
to cover up your inability to integrate

563
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
with society.

564
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,720
No, I'm not.

565
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,480
In the kidnapping ten years ago,

566
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,320
you weren't a victim.

567
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,840
You were the chief plotter!

568
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,400
Your targets

569
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,400
were Qian Cheng and me.

570
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,440
It's you who kidnapped my brother!

571
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,640
No, I didn't.

572
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,640
Dao Ruifeng,

573
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,600
are you crazy?

574
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,560
I was kidnapped

575
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
and raped.

576
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,600
The police's investigation can prove that.

577
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,840
Why are you making
false accusations against me?

578
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,440
Can you prove what you said?

579
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,720
(Police Report)
This is a police report from the US.

580
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,680
Five years ago, two prisoners

581
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,640
were released successively.

582
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,600
After they were released,
they both entered the US.

583
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520
Then both of them got into a car accident...

584
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,760
All those things happened
within half a month.

585
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,440
Both of them just had tourist visas

586
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,080
and they left their tour groups.

587
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,400
They wandered in the US
where no one cared if they died.

588
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,600
What's more interesting is that

589
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,400
these two people had their accidents

590
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,120
at the same place,

591
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,040
the street in front
of MD Anderson Cancer Center.

592
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,440
That's where Lin Nuoyan worked in the US.

593
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,120
And your mental health clinic

594
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
was on the same block.

595
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,520
That is why I suspect

596
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,160
that these two murders

597
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,400
were the first two crimes orchestrated
by you and Lin Nuoyan.

598
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,800
No, I didn't do any of those things.

599
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,040
Dao Ruifeng!

600
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
I think you need to see a doctor
more than I do.

601
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,800
You saw Qian Cheng falling off the building,

602
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,880
didn't you?

603
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,400
Did you kill him?

604
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,560
No, we didn't push him.

605
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,280
H-He jumped down.

606
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Y-Yes, he jumped down himself!

607
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,080
What are you saying?

608
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
Anyway, a dead man tells no tales.

609
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:53,880
You guys go first.

610
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,840
Okay.

611
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,320
Okay.

612
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,200
Qian Cheng!

613
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,400
Young Master!

614
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,120
Qian Cheng!

615
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,800
Young Master!

616
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:09,800
Qian Cheng!

617
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,440
Young Master!

618
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,680
Qian Cheng!

619
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:21,500
(Police)
(Public Security)

620
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,520
Qian Cheng!

621
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,680
Qian Cheng!

622
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,680
Qian Cheng!

623
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,960
You...You...

624
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,120
Don't scare me! Qian Cheng!

625
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,040
Police!

626
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,400
My brother is here!

627
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,920
Qian Cheng!

628
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,120
I am here.

629
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,040
Qian Cheng!

630
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,160
Young Master is dead.

631
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,000
Young Master is dead.

632
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,200
Uncle!

633
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,960
Uncle! Young Master is dead!

634
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,440
Turn around!

635
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,120
Close your eyes!

636
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Uncle!

637
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,160
Can the police find us?

638
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,640
We'll be ready in a moment.

639
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
A moment! Just a moment!

640
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,160
Uncle? What's that sound?

641
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,720
What sound?

642
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,560
I can't hear anything.

643
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,040
All right! All right!

644
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,400
It's all right!

645
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
- Young Master has come back to life!
- All right! All right!

646
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,320
It's all right!

647
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,600
There's nothing to worry about.

648
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,720
Young Master!

649
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,560
Young Master!

650
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,600
Young Master!

651
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,440
Come and help!

652
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,240
Young Master!

653
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,000
Where's Qian Cheng?

654
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,480
Qian...Qian Cheng is over there.

655
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,480
He should be fine.

656
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,520
He should be fine. He should be fine.

657
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,920
Young Master, you are still alive!

658
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,520
We are all fine.

659
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,280
Don't worry.

660
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,560
The police are coming.

661
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,280
We have to go!

662
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,000
Hurry!

663
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:39,960
Young Master!

664
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,400
After Qian Cheng wakes up,

665
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,360
will he tell others

666
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,240
about how you saved him?

667
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,200
So what?

668
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,800
He has no evidence.

669
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
As long as you don't tell anyone,
everything will be okay.

670
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,560
You hear what I said?

671
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,600
Yes.

672
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,880
Good boy!

673
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:53,960
Let's go!

674
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,440
My brother may be a fool.

675
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,440
But I am not.

676
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,920
The police

677
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,320
are coming.

678
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
You guys should quickly leave this place.

679
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,800
William,

680
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,760
thank you for saving my brother.

681
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,720
You guys should go.

682
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,200
You are welcome.

683
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,800
Qian Tu,

684
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,000
we'll leave everything to you then.

685
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,920
Ye Lai,

686
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,560
you saw everything that day, didn't you?

687
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
What did I see?

688
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,120
I found this on your bike.

689
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Lin Nuoyan gave me
this medicine for my illness.

690
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,720
That's what he's using to control me.

691
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,080
This medicine

692
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,520
isn't to cure your disease,

693
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,480
but to curb your drug addiction.

694
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,760
Right?

695
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,320
Don't tell me that

696
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,480
the track marks on your arms

697
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,280
were done by Lin Nuoyan, too.

698
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,200
I'll have you know,

699
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,680
I have obtained
your criminal record in the US.

700
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,680
You were arrested for taking drugs

701
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,840
more than once.

702
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,560
It's not me!

703
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,440
Just tell me,

704
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,120
it's also you that caused the fight

705
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,080
between Qian Cheng and Peng Zichun, right?

706
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,720
No.

707
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
If I'm not mistaken,

708
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,480
you have slept with Peng Zichun, right?

709
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,320
No, I'm not.

710
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,560
You made both of them think

711
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,720
that you had a crush on them.

712
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,560
Otherwise, Peng Zichun wouldn't have
attacked Qian Cheng violently

713
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,920
for a woman he hadn't seen for ten years.

714
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,560
No, I didn't do that.

715
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,040
That's all speculations on your part.

716
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,200
According to your logic,

717
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,520
was it my wooing that caused

718
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,160
your fight with Xue Zaozao?

719
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,880
You didn't woo us.

720
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,040
I asked Xue Zaozao to

721
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,440
fight with me

722
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,960
in order to show everyone how crazy it is for

723
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,720
two best friends

724
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,640
to fight for a woman that they haven't seen

725
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,160
for ten years!

726
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,240
Of course,

727
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,680
this is all speculations on my part.

728
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,000
Considering the influence of your family

729
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,360
and your acting skills,

730
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,360
you may get off with a light sentence.

731
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,240
I'm telling you,

732
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,520
I have decided to

733
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,360
keep you

734
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,520
until your drug addiction symptoms appear.

735
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,400
Then I will show all the materials

736
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,840
and all the evidence

737
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,720
to Peng Zichun.

738
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,160
Xue Zaozao will help me.

739
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,240
When the time comes,
the Peng family, the Xue family,

740
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,640
the Qian family

741
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,240
and my family,

742
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,040
we will all put pressure on your family!

743
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,120
When that happens, I would like to see
how you wiggle out of troubles!

744
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,560
Of course,

745
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,960
I don't know

746
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,320
your parents.

747
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,520
But I know that your symptoms

748
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,320
have nothing to do with you,

749
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,120
but it has everything to do
with your parents refusal to raise you.

750
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,240
That is why your disease is called

751
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,240
affection-less personality disorder.

752
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,920
You must have had a

753
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,760
very happy,

754
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
very easy childhood!

755
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,280
Otherwise, how could your parents have raised

756
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,000
such a cutie in the greenhouse.

757
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,440
Dao Ruifeng.

758
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,720
I didn't think you would be

759
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,120
the toughest one to deal with.

760
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,440
No,

761
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,880
it was because you were focusing
on the wrong person.

762
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,520
I'm Jiang Baiju's guardian.

763
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,680
But you focused on Qian Cheng,

764
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,040
which is a total waste of efforts.

765
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,880
Lin Nuoyan has escaped, right?

766
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,080
Otherwise,

767
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,760
all of you

768
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,240
won't be here talking to me.

769
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,240
So, just tell me

770
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,640
where Lin Nuoyan is.

771
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,920
He won't save you.

772
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
Will you tell your parents

773
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,120
or the police?

774
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,200
Dear,

775
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,320
you should just tell us where he is.

776
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,680
Even if you don't tell us,

777
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,280
we will know it sooner or later.

778
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,000
Lin Nuoyan,

779
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,840
if he gets what he wants

780
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,720
he will go to the snow mountain.

781
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,440
If he fails to get what he wants,

782
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,200
he will go abroad.

783
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
So, you know where
the snow mountain village is.

784
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,080
I don't know the exact location.

785
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,160
But I know that Lin Nuoyan's

786
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,840
real experimental base

787
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,040
is in the snow mountain.

788
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,560
He wants to get the thing
in the body of the undead.

789
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,400
And this thing

790
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,560
may be leftover

791
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,760
from the meteorite.

792
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,000
This thing

793
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,760
can co-exist with its host

794
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,280
to give the host the ability
to self-heal indefinitely.

795
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,120
So, Lin Nuoyan

796
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,160
wants to use it to

797
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,200
eliminate the side effects
of the special drug.

798
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,120
Can we believe her?

799
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,840
I don't know.

800
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,720
But I know if Lin Nuoyan runs away...

801
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,480
Since I have broken her legs...

802
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,480
If I can't find Lin Nuoyan,

803
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,120
I'll come back to you!

804
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,320
Feel free to come anytime!

805
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:34,640
William!

806
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,760
In any case,

807
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,960
she has told us something about Lin Nuoyan.

808
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,200
Send her

809
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,400
home.

810
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,760
Mrs. Dao,

811
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,720
I don't want to go home.

812
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,080
I want to go to the police station.

813
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,080
So you think the police station
is better than your home?

814
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,360
What a pathetic woman you are!

815
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,880
What are you talking about?

816
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,120
I'm not pathetic!

817
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,280
You people are the ones that are pathetic!

818
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
What the hell are you doing?

819
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,160
In order to save you,

820
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,280
my brother has become like that.

821
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,600
Do you have any conscience at all?

822
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,000
He was just self-righteous.

823
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
He thought he could save me.

824
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,600
But he got kidnapped.

825
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,640
He thought he could be a great hero.

826
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,480
And you,

827
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,240
you are also pretty arrogant.

828
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,400
Qian Cheng told you that

829
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,040
I was raped.

830
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,440
So, you hid the important evidence.

831
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,200
You,

832
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,480
all of you,

833
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,440
thought that you could save me!

834
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,520
Save me?

835
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,840
And my parents,

836
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,720
they are even more ridiculous.

837
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,000
They actually think that

838
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,160
it's my boyfriend that

839
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,680
has corrupted me.

840
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,360
Isn't that ridiculous?

841
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,520
It's really ridiculous!

842
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,600
Aren't you ashamed?

843
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,760
Have some common decency!

844
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,960
Don't you know you are bad guy?

845
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,880
Ten years ago, you hurt my younger brother

846
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,920
for a hooligan.

847
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,440
Ten years later,

848
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,680
you hurt my brother again

849
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,800
but for a hypocrite!

850
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,000
Qian Tu,

851
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,640
you are mistaken.

852
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,440
I will never hurt Qian Cheng

853
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,560
for a man.

854
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,120
Lin Nuoyan and I

855
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,600
are not in the kind
of relationship you guys believe to be.

856
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,680
We are business partners.

857
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,160
You think I'm a woman

858
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,680
so I must've done all those bad things

859
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,040
for men.

860
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Why are you men so narcissistic?

861
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
Can't I just be a

862
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,720
simple villain?

863
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
Ten years ago,

864
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,280
I planned the kidnapping

865
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,440
for money.

866
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,440
Ten years later, my goal is still money.

867
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,960
I won't be like Lin Nuoyan,

868
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,520
striving for some idealism,

869
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,800
wanting to cure diseases and cure people.

870
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,280
I just want to make

871
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,160
a special drug that can eliminate
the side effects of drugs.

872
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,440
Do you know what it means?

873
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,560
Do you know?

874
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,280
You don't know!

875
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,160
Nobody knows!

876
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,000
Nobody!

877
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,640
Once we succeed,

878
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,440
this special drug

879
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,960
would eliminate
the side effects of hard drugs.

880
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,200
I...

881
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,120
I

882
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,280
would legalize hard drugs

883
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,520
all over the world!

884
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,160
Who will do evil things for men?

885
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,960
You are so ridiculous!

886
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,600
Qian Cheng has become
like this because of you.

887
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
You are really a bad guy.

888
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,160
Yeah,

889
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,200
you are right.

890
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,640
Kill me

891
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,920
and you'll go to jail.

892
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,240
For a bad guy like me,

893
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,360
it's not worth doing that.
