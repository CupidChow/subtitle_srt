19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,760
I

20
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,280
always wanted to be cured since I was a child.

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,320
I always thought that normal people

22
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,240
must have it good.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,360
So I always believed that when I'm cured,

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,640
there will be countless good days
waiting for me.

25
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,880
But when I grew up, I realized

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
even after being cured,
you're still just a normal person.

27
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,160
You have to work and you have to date.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,160
So I told myself,

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,000
being cured or not is no big deal.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,240
In the end, I'm still just a normal person.

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,480
Still, sometimes,

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,720
I do envy normal people.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,600
Me, too.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,080

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,560
If you haven't dated before,

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,760
do you want to try dating me?

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,320

38
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,680

answer my question!

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,240
I said

62
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,440
I wanted to date you.

63

Why are you here?

67
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,680
I...

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,720
Where would I be other than the operation room?

69
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,240
I just saw

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,920
you with a man.

71
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,840

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,160
A man?

73
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,240
Do you mean Lin Nuoyan?

74
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,320
He's gone back.

75
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
Not Lin Nuoyan.

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,080
It's a handsome guy.

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
A handsome guy?

78
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,960
Alive or dead?

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
Stop playing dumb.

80
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,880
Why would I need to see a dead man?

81
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,600
I didn't see a live one,

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,480
but there is a dead one.

83
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,360
See for yourself.

84
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
Goodbye, Master!

85
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
Good health and good fortunes!

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,880
Bye! Bye!

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,440
I wanted to say this last time,

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,920
your Master is pretty handsome.

89
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,960
D-Do you think you're a zombie?

90
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,240
Your shoes...

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,040
Does Baiju

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,320
not exercise with you?

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,760
In Buwenzhong,

94
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,240
playing a ball game means playing basketball,

95
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,840
and golf is just business networking.

96
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,960
This is a generation gap.

97
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,760
And generation gap brings social death.

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,440
So don't ask me to play with you.

99
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,360
The secretary told me you play ball games,

100
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,680
but which type wasn't mentioned.

101
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,600
Say,

102
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,880
should I fire him?

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Maybe you should.

104
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,440
Madame is here?

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,480
Madame, why did you come?

106
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't blame your secretary.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
It's not him who told me where you are.

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,400
I found out through William.

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,640
When I get back,
I'm cutting ties with Dao Ruifeng.

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,440
Show me around, would you?

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,320
So this is the new hotel at your resort, right?

112
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,120
Yes.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,120
Not bad at all.

114
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,480
I also saw a small garden just now.

115
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,200
Madame,

116
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,520
the small garden

117
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,760
doesn't belong in the golf field.

118
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,960
It is one of the venues
of the Central Botanical Garden.

119
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Normally,

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,680
it's just used for some small parties.

121
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,280
I thought

122
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,920
there were finally some changes to this place.

123
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,800
Madame,

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,560
did Young Master ask you to find me?

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,760
You're overthinking.

126
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,400
It was William.

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,160
Madame,

128
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,080
the one-week limit is not up yet,

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,880
I can't let him leave with you.

130
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,800
It's only a two-day difference.

131
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,880
Do this for me, please.

132
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,800
Yeah, Tu.

133
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,880
Please go easy on me.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
I haven't slept well in days.

135
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,640
I have to go to a doctor once I go back.

136
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,680
If you haven't been sleeping well for days,

137
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,160
why didn't you tell me?

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,280
I'll take you to the doctor.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
Calm down, my child.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,760
Jiang Baiju found a new guardian.

141
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,440
In a few days, you'll have the time

142
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,160
to take your brother to the doctor.

143
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,880
Really?

144
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,600
By the way, Madame,

145
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,600
if you are looking for smaller venues,

146
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,080
what do you think about my garden back there?

147
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,880
That garden did seem nice,

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,200
but I passed by in a rush,
so I didn't see it clearly just now.

149
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,440
That's simple.

150
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,080
Madame,

151
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,600
let's go.

152
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,080
Madame,

153
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
are you really here to fetch me?

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm here to find a venue for the anniversary

155
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,480
and to pick you up.

156
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,520
So you're selling me again!

157
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,760
To the same person.

158
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,160
To have a price

159
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,040
means that you are valuable.

160
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,520
Qian Tu,

161
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,360
you're really a sweet child.

162
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,800
Careful, Madame.

163
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,360
Okay.

164
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,020
(Buwenzhong)

165
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,640
Xiaoyu,

166
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,200
before going in,

167
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,040
I need to tell you

168
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,960
an important thing.

169
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,400
We, the Dao Family,

170
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,080
have been the guardian
of Master Jiang Baiju for 80 years.

171
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,520
You are the first one
who is not from within the family.

172
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,800
So there are some things

173
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to tell you beforehand.

174
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
Tonight between 11

175
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,120
and 1, during these two hours,

176
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,400
no matter what happens inside,

177
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,960
you cannot leave Young Master's side.

178
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,440
After the two-hour ritual,

179
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,160
you can

180
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,480
officially take over my job.

181
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,400
If I'm not wrong,

182
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,200
you must be

183
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
the shortest-serving guardian, right?

184
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,720
That would depend on how long you live.

185
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,640
Are you ready?

186
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,560
Yes.

187
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,640
I bid you good fortune.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,480
She's in?

189
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,120
She's in.

190
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,160
Hurry up and pack.

191
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
There's going to be a ruckus later for sure.

192
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
What about these books?

193
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,320
They're too heavy.

194
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Leave them.

195
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,560
If Young Master sees it,

196
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,120
he would know for sure

197
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,280
that we set the whole thing up.

198
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,040
That makes sense.

199
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,560
In terms of cunningness,

200
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,320
you are leagues ahead of me.

201
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,960
My grandma is senile for sure.

202
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,320
To let a little girl who is about to die

203
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,880
be a guardian,

204
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
it's clearly a ploy by my grandma.

205
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
My grandma is just using her as a tool.

206
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:06,920
And after she's dead,

207
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,720
I'll take up the duty again.

208
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,360
So tonight,

209
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,160
she's got a lesson to learn.

210
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
But Madame ordered her

211
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,120
to see the mutation

212
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,040
outside of the hibernation chamber.

213
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,400
If you let Young Master out now,

214
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,160
he at midnight is

215
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,520
nothing but a mindless monster.

216
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,840
If Madame knows about it,

217
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,560
we're both in big trouble.

218
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,560
And Young Master said before,

219
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,680
Jin Xiaoyu can suppress the mutation.

220
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,880
You probably won't scare her at all.

221
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,360
Come on, stop acting like that again.

222
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,600
Young Master knows Jin Xiaoyu
can suppress the mutation,

223
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,640
but she doesn't know about it.

224
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,720
Can you not chicken out

225
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,440
before we even get results?

226
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
What if something happens to her?

227
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,520
What could happen to her?

228
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,000
Young Master already sold you

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
to Qian Tu for her!

230
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,960
But Madame...

231
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,440
Didn't my grandmother sell you a second time

232
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,520
because of the anniversary venue?

233
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
Your brother lacks intelligence,

234
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,560
and now you're here

235
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,760
playing brotherhood drama with me?

236
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,640
Alright already!

237
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Hurry up and help with the cleaning!

238
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,240
Okay?

239
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,080
Jiang Baiju!

240
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,280
Jiang Baiju.

241
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,280
Where is he?

242
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,760
Jiang Baiju,

243
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,160
are you there?

244
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,240
Jiang Baiju.

245
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Get away, get away!

246
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,680
Don't come near me!

247
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,760
Somebody help!

248
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,840
I can promise after tonight,

249
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,640
Jin Xiaoyu will not dare to stay at Buwenzhong.

250
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
I hope she'll quit
after learning what she's facing with.

251
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,640
William, open the door!

252
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,840
William!

253
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,400
Jiang,

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,040
Jiang Baiju!

255
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,640
It's 11 o'clock. You should

256
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,920
go to bed according to the guideline.

257
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
I own the sanatorium,

258
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,600
so no one can order me

259
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
when to go to bed.

260
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,640
How did you get in

261
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
at this time?

262
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
My mother owns this place,

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
who would dare to stop me?

264
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,880
Mother.

265
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,000
I heard you're letting

266
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,480
an outsider take over

267
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,320
the role of the guardian?

268
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,120
Everyone at home is worried,

269
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,800
so I came to pay a visit on their behalf.

270
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,440
Are you worrying about me,

271
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,680
or about Young Master?

272
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,560
You're overthinking.

273
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,760
We're just worried about the money.

274
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,640
That's my son.

275
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,520
Love you.

276
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,400
Mother,

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,720
Young Master saw me grew up,

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,440
and I've been his guardian for 20 years.

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,040
Suddenly hearing you're letting an outsider do it,

280
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
in my heart,

281
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,280
I still feel reluctant about it.

282
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,680
Times have changed.

283
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,600
People have changed, too.

284
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,080
Kids nowadays

285
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,760
don't want to sacrifice themselves.

286
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,120
They don't want to repay, either.

287
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,720
So the Daos are becoming

288
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,720
more and more distant from Young Master.

289
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:45,840
Well,

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,560
if it was going to be an outsider anyway,

291
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,200
wouldn't it be better if it were Qian Cheng?

292
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,400
At least we know his background,

293
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,120
and he's loyal.

294
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,320
So you are here

295
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
to vouch for Qian Cheng.

296
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,840
I know, Qian Cheng is great.

297
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,920
That's why I don't want to
let his life waste away.

298
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,200
Think about it.

299
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,880
William is our kid.

300
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,440
But Qian Cheng is the same, too.

301
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,720
We've watched over him as he grew up.

302
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,000
William wants

303
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,480
his freedom and dreams,

304
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,680
and Qian Cheng deserves it, too.

305
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,240
But the girl,

306
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
doesn't she deserve it?

307
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,800
Young Master taught me when I was a kid,

308
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,560
all life is equal.

309
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,080
We can't judge life's value by its length.

310
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
But I believe

311
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,760
compared to two healthy young men,

312
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,120
sacrificing a sick child like Jin Xiaoyu

313
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,800
is a good trade off.

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,840
Maybe I'm a selfish hag.

315
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,840
And maybe

316
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,360
I should go to hell for this.

317
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,480
But to protect Young Master and you guys,

318
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,920
I don't regret a thing.

319
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,720
On this,

320
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,840
William

321
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,840
is quite like you.

322
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,040
Enough,

323
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,080
when it comes to picking a guardian,

324
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,560
you can trust me on that.

325
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,720
Do you know?

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,720
Your grandpa,

327
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,360
on his deathbed,

328
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,000
told me to protect Young Master at all cost.

329
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,400
Okay.

330
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,520
I always thought

331
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,440
Young Master had some ancestral ties
with your family.

332
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,560
Ancestral ties?

333
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
If that were the case,

334
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,360
I would for sure look more handsome now.

335
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,120
Has something happened to Jin Xiaoyu?

336
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,080
Why is it so quiet?

337
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,880
What? Are you worried about her?

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm not worried that
something would happen to her,

339
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
but I'm worried that Madame might get mad at me

340
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,960
if something happens to her.

341
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,600
My grandmother says

342
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Jin Xiaoyu is destined for Young Master.

343
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
Hope it's a beautiful love story.

344
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,280
What if it's a horror story?

345
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,440
Then that means my grandmother is wrong!

346
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,800
If she's wrong,

347
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,800
then what does it have to do with us?

348
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
You are a sociopath!

349
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,840
Get me an appointment

350
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,920
next time you visit a shrink.

351
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,520
So you don't know
about Young Master's origin, either?

352
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,760
After I became

353
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,200
Young Master's guardian,

354
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,160
my second uncle showed me these photos

355
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,920
and told me

356
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,680
all the passed-down tales.

357
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
Apparently in that war-torn era,

358
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,200
Young Master saved
my great grandfather many times,

359
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,560
and died multiple times for it.

360
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,360
Ever since,

361
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,040
my great grandfather swore

362
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,520
that the Dao family for generations to come

363
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,800
will protect its savior.

364
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,600
But

365
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,960
where he came from,

366
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
where he's going,

367
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,600
what kind of creature he is,

368
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,120
I have no idea.

369
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,640
Why do you think

370
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,560
Jin Xiaoyu

371
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
can suppress Young Master's mutation?

372
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,240
According to my great grandfather,

373
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,320
they met at the Shenlong Snow Mountain.

374
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,040
There is a secluded village there.

375
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
Maybe that's where he was from.

376
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,560
The Dao family has been wandering for ages

377
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,320
looking for the method to suppress the mutation.

378
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,800
Since Jin Xiaoyu can suppress his mutation,

379
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,440
maybe she is from there, too.

380
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,560
The Snow Mountain?

381
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,120
Yeah.

382
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,000
My grandma told me

383
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,160
after they came back,

384
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,320
they once went to the Snow Mountain.

385
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,960
But it had been seventy something years,

386
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,520
the Snow Mountain looked

387
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,840
completely different.

388
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,120
So for so many years,

389
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,320
there has never been

390
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,160
any person other than Jin Xiaoyu

391
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,040
that could suppress the mutation?

392
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,760
According to my grandma,

393
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,360
no.

394
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,160
What if

395
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,440
the only person who can suppress the mutation

396
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
is killed by Young Master?

397
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,760
You're so melodramatic.

398
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,880
Jiang Baiju is my good friend,

399
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,680
my brother.

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
The life or death of others,

401
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
I can't care less.

402
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,280
Jiang Baiju.

403
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,680

You must've been through so much.

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
(I can't accompany anyone.)

412
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,040
(And you are the same.)

00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,720
Not only do I know all about it,

421
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,760
I also got injured!

422
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,520
Pay my medicine bills.

423
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,720
Who let you in?

424
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:01,880
William?

425
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,880
I'll be upfront,

426
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,840
I'm your next guardian.

427
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,880
From now on,

428
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,880
let's get along.

429
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,120
You and Dao Xiuxiu...

430
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,800
So you and that silly girl

431
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,880
made a deal to live in Buwenzhong,

432
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,760
and also be my new guardian?

433
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,680
She sold me out because of her grandson!

434
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Haven't you heard the saying,

435
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,920
between one's first love and grandson,

436
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,960
the first love never wins?

437
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,560
That woman...

438
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,240
So you went to the lab

439
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,640
just to take over the guardianship?

440
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,360
Yeah.

441
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,080
I think

442
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,600
William probably doesn't want this
to go so smoothly,

443
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,320
so he unlocked your hibernation chamber.

444
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,360
He did it for Qian Cheng.

445
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:42,960
That's right.

446
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,800
That way whether I'm killed

447
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,760
or run away from fear,

448
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
Qian Cheng can then smoothly take over

449
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,880
the position as the guardian.

450
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
Why are your minions all so cruel?

451
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,040
Those two brats...

452
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Don't change the topic.

453
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,120
You...

454
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,200
Does this happen to you every night?

455
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,320
But you will go back to normal

456
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,680
when I touch you.

457
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,240
If that's the case,

458
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
then that one time at the morgue,

459
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,520
that one time with the chandelier,

460
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,000
and that one time at the unfinished building,

461
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,480
you risked your life to save me

462
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,000
because I'm your painkiller,

463
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,800
right?

464
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,800
The effect is pretty average,

465
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
but the costs are huge.

466
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,520
So before meeting me,

467
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
you spent every night like this?

468
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,000
Since when?

469
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,440
Every night.

470
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:31,840
Every month.

471
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,640
Every year, every decade.

472
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,600
Every time I have a fit,

473
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,680
I can feel my blood vessels going rampant

474
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,280
and the scorching pain.

475
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,040
From November 31st, 1938,

476
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,800
I was tasked

477
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,600
to bring the blueprints to Southern Yunnan

478
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,480
to help build the airport there.

479
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,800
But halfway,

480
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,280
I encountered Japanese planes

481
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,760
and was shot down.

482
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
With my parachute

483
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,160
and the blueprints inside a tin case,

484
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,640
I fell into the deep valleys
of the Shenlong Snow Mountain.

485
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,400
So aside from the midnight mutation,

486
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,840
you also have heart disease.

487
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Whenever my emotions are running wild,

488
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,720
my heart hurts.

489
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,000
It doesn't matter
if they're good feelings or bad ones?

490
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
No matter good or bad ones,

491
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,760
as long as my heart is pounding, it hurts.

492
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,200
No wonder you don't watch movies.

493
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,120
You remind me of something.

494
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,320
What?

495
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,120
You're suffering so much...

496
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,080
Yet I'm only getting paid 200 yuan
per hour for overtime!

497
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,920
I can't accept this. I want a raise!

498
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,880
Do you not have a heart?

499
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,920
Don't you want to know

500
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,320
why you can suppress my mutation?

501
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,040
I don't!

502
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,960
If you knew, you would've told me already.

503
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,680
The fact that you didn't

504
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,200
means you don't know, either.

505
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:06,920
Right?

506
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,200
So?

507
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,000
What happened afterwards?

508
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,640
Afterwards...

509
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,760
What a miracle!

510
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,440
Who are you? Where am I?

511
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,400
Kid,

512
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,960
I also want to ask you that question.

513
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,480
You fell from the sky,

514
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,080
and into the village of our Bai family.

515
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,920
You're still alive.

516
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,760
You're so lucky!

517
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,560
Here,

518
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,120
have a drink.

519
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,560
Slowly, slowly!

520
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,560
How are you feeling? Better?

521
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,360
Slowly.

522
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
Thank you for saving my life.

523
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
I guess you're a soldier fighting for the country.

524
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,600
Get on this horse

525
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,640
and find your comrades.

526
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,120
This is not where you should be.

527
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,240
Here, take this.

528
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,600
Go!

529
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
I have to bring the documents back.

530
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,440
I have to.

531
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,120
(The Japanese worried I might make it out alive.)

532
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
(So they bombed the mountain pass,)

533
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,040
(triggering an avalanche.)

534
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,360
(The snowy sacred place I've only seen once)

535
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,840
(disappeared in a second.)

536
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,340
Go!

537
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,240
Get on!

538
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:12,880
Go!

539
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,000
After I left the Snow Mountain,

540
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,960
I saved the ancestor of the Dao family,

541
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,720
Dao Xiuxiu's father.

542
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,160
So,

543
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
because you saved them,

544
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,880
they became your guardian.

545
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,560
But now you're in my hands!

546
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,280
Don't talk like

547
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,520
you are a human trafficker.

548
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm the one who can decide
whether you can be the guardian or not.

549
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,680
Old man, let me tell you.

550
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,720
I'm not only your guardian,

551
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,800
but also your one and only painkiller.

552
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,960
Painkiller.

553
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:47,720
You're a painkiller

554
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,840
with just less than a year to live!

555
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,960
One year to me

556
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,600
is a blink of an eye, a shutter.

557
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,400
I lived for 100 years,

558
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,680
travelled all across the world,

559
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,000
and found zero clues.

560
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,160
You think this one year,

561
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,720
less than one year,

562
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,960
could make a difference?

563
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,040
Well, you said it yourself!

564
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,480
If one year to you

565
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,640
is just a blink of an eye,

566
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,280
then why not

567
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,080
use this year

568
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,400
to find some clues with me?

569
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
You won't lose much, right?

570
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,720
What? You don't dare?

571
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,920
Because you're afraid

572
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,760
of feeling defeated,

573
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,080
and of falling into despair again, right?

574
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,280
Yes.

575
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,520
I'm afraid.

576
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm afraid it will amount to nothing.

577
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,200
I'm afraid it remains just a foolish hope.

578
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,120
You are able to die and move on.

579
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,000
You wouldn't have any burden,

580
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,960
but I have to

581
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
keep living forever and ever.

582
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,800
Alone.

583
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,320
Jiang Bai...

584
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,720
Jiang Baiju!

585
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,520
Jiang Baiju!

586
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,400
Jiang Baiju!

587
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,320
Let's figure it out together!

588
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,120
There is nothing we can do.

589
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
What do you mean there's nothing we can do?

590
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,000
If we dissect you,

591
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,360
see the insides of your body, maybe...

592
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:47,880
I know,

593
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,400
the special medicine you've been trying to find

594
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,520
must have something to do with your illness.

595
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,120
Right?

596
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,320
You don't want me in,

597
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,280
because you're afraid I'll get hurt,

598
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:53,800
right?

599
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,920
What are you doing?

600
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,360
I told you the stories

601
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,480
and satisfied your curiosity.

602
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,640
Go home and spend time with your family!

603
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,080
What I'm looking for

604
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,680
isn't going to turn up in a few days or months.

605
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,920
But many years!

606
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,600
How many times have I told you!

607
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,320
Jiang Baiju!

608
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:10,840
Oppa!

609
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,720
Oh no! It's silent in there.

610
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,120
She's dead for sure.

611
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,320
Even if Jin Xiaoyu is silent, it doesn't mean
Young Master should be silent, too.

612
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,040
What if the both of them...

613
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,880
Cut it out!

614
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,560
Uncle, Uncle.

615
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,160
Old man, bring me along.

616
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,360
Just give it a try, I won't be a drag on you.

617
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,200
You are too weak.

618
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:30,880
I can't bring you along.

619
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
How am I weak? I'm even not afraid of death.

620
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,280
Bring me along!

621
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,160
Stop speaking nonsense,

622
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,840
let me go first.

623
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,520
No, I won't!

624
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,200
If you go on like this, I'll yell!

625
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,320
- Go ahead.
- I'll yell at you.

626
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Let go!

627
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:39,920
Let go of me!

628
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,040
- I won't!
- Young Master!

629
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,720
Are you okay, Young Master?

630
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,520
Get the key card!

631
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Go, go!

632
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,360
Let go!

633
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,200
I won't!

634
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,640
I was your guardian last night.

635
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,560
If you don't say yes,

636
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,160
I'll be your super close bodyguard!

637
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,000
- Get your hands off.
- I'm telling you.

638
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,840
I don't know what Qian Cheng would say

639
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,440
if he sees this.

640
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,480
But I'm sure if William sees this,

641
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,280
he would definitely say,

642
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,920
"the forbidden affair
between my great grandfather and a young girl."

643
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,200
You!

644
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,960
Are you scared now?

645
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,600
Let go of me! You're being a brat!

646
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:57,920
So what?

647
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:58,640
You...

648
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,400
Fine! I'm saying yes!

649
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,400
Are you happy with it now?

650
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,000
Yes to what?

651
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,000
Searching for the clues!

652
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,360
Okay!

653
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,040
Young Master!

654
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,200
Young Master, are you okay?

655
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:09,960
Jin Xiaoyu,

656
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,200
you're fine!

657
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,920
I am fine.

658
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,360
But you are not.

659
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
My, my card!

660
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,240
Uncle...

661
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,520
Grandma...

662
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,600
Kiddo,

663
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,040
this time even I can't help you out.

664
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,000
I...

665
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,480
Grandma, stop cutting, I...

666
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,240
I was wrong, I...

667
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,920
My, my card!

668
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,700
I...

669
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,640
Granny!

670
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,760
Please don't, please don't!

671
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,120
I was wrong, please stop cutting.

672
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,080
No more, no more!

673
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,680
You're stalking me.

674
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,520
You're an easy man to find, after all.

675
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,680
So?

676
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,280
Do you work in travel development

677
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,240
or perverted stalking?

678
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,280
Whatever.

679
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,360
Oh, right.

680
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,920
Hold onto this.

681
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,000
At the front entrance of the hospital

682
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,240
is a convenience store.

683
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,720
The owner set up a camera

684
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,160
to prevent theft.

685
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,440
See if there's something useful.

686
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,080
You went through all the surveillance footage

687
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,800
of the downtown village?

688
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,560
I guess letting Qian Cheng

689
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,880
take a "vacation" with you really pays off.

690
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,840
Jiang Baiju,

691
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,200
to use your friend as a bargaining chip

692
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,920
isn't that a bit shameful?

693
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,040
For someone who's actively
enjoying the brotherhood

694
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,960
to be criticizing me,

695
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,800
that's even more shameful.

696
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,960
By the way,

697
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,160
that surveillance system is all new.

698
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,520
They seem to know

699
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,280
that you will come to them.

700
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,360
So they're waiting for me.

701
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,200
Can you take it more seriously?

702
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,920
We're not facing up against

703
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,000
petty paparazzi this time.

704
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,080
Be careful.

705
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,480
I wish they can kill me.

706
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,000
Thanks for worrying.

707
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,960
Take good care of it.

708
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,400
You really have poor taste.

709
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,880
Careful.

710
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,280
Hello?

711
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,200
Tu.

712
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,760
It's done?

713
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,120
I'll talk about it when William is back.

714
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,440
Okay, fine then.

715
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,960
I'll go find you right now.

716
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,480
Looks like your vacation

717
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
will become longer.

718
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,520
(Organ Donation)

719
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,000
Look.

720
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,720
I've rearranged the columns for you.

721
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,720
It looks better this way.

722
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,640
Thank you so much.

723
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,720
I only wanted you to

724
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,640
help with the pictures.

725
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,200
I can't believe you reorganized

726
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,120
the entire site for us.

727
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,440
No need for pleasantries.

728
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,880
There are really few customers on Mondays.

729
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,600
No wonder you asked me to come today.

730
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,200
You just want to skip work.

731
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,000
I've done everything I'm supposed to do,

732
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
without shirking my job.

733
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,200
By the way,

734
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,800
do you want anything else to drink?

735
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I'll treat you to another one.

736
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,720
I want something special.

737
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,520
If you want to have congee…

738
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,680
I want to make some coffee myself today.

739
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,840
Jiang Baiju, what are you doing here?

740
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,480
I can't believe I bumped into you
while buying flowers.

741
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,680
Talk about my bad luck.

742
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,000
What? You look like

743
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,800
you want to pick a fight.

744
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,800
Is your boyfriend cheating on you?

745
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,760
Look!

746
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,120
That's the donor's family.

747
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,360
Sitting next to him is Temper.

748
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,040
Temper?

749
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,360
Her last name is Tan?

750
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:30,920
Yes!

751
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,400
I see.

752
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,720
She's the doctoral student you told me about

753
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
who was looking for the donor, right?

754
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,000
And now she has found the donor's family.

755
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,280
Exactly.

756
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,920
That's why I'm so pissed off.

757
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,360
She was all over Quanzhan in the past a few days,

758
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,560
making him think he'd finally have a girlfriend.

759
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,320
And then she

760
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,320
dumped him before he knew it.

761
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,320
I bet she got

762
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,560
the information from Zhang Quanzhan.

763
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
That sneaky chick.

764
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm going to take her down!

765
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,560
Calm yourself, will you?

766
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,600
How am I supposed to be calm?

767
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,320
She broke the rules

768
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,520
and found the donor's family.

769
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,960
The barista sitting next to her

770
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,040
was the heart donor's fiance.

771
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,240
How did she find Fu Liang?

772
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,320
The dead's information comes along

773
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,800
with the corpse delivered
to the funeral home, right?

774
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,120
I didn't even think about that!

775
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,240
You work there,

776
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,360
yet you overlooked the most obvious detail.

777
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,160
So how did you know that?

778
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,000
I've been through it.

779
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,880
I'm so stupid.

780
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,840
Our funeral home is the only one in the city.

781
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,720
When Cai Miao's body

782
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
was delivered to us,

783
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,120
we made a note of her time of death.

784
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:31,840
And then we handed over

785
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,600
the body to the funeral home.

786
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,160
It'd be very easy for her to pinpoint

787
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,360
the donor based on such information.

788
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,640
True.

789
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,920
With the help of Internet nowadays,

790
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,280
you can look up almost everything.

791
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,400
I can't just let it be.

792
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,720
I have to talk to her.

793
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,080
Here's what I'm thinking.

794
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,480
She

795
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,760
just had a heart transplant.

796
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,520
And you

797
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,480
are dying.

798
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,320
If you guys fight,

799
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,240
who has better chance to win?

800
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,280
Jiang Baiju,

801
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,320
do you have a heart?

802
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,440
Then do you have a brain?

803
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,160
So you are going to pick up a fight with her

804
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,120
and then expose this...

805
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,960
what do you call her, a "tramp",

806
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,000
of the donor's fiance?

807
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,360
Yes.

808
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,560
First of all,

809
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,440
you don't have any proof

810
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,920
that she went to the funeral home

811
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,040
and stole the dead's information.

812
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,560
Second of all, your accusation

813
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,760
will embarrass

814
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,520
that barista more

815
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,360
than the "tramp".

816
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,520
Look.

817
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,720
They get along so well.

818
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,520
I'm sure the barista doesn't know who she is.

819
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
Do you really think it's appropriate

820
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,800
for you to confront her

821
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,880
and reveal the truth like that?

822
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,120
Then what do I do?

823
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,280
She's disturbing the donor's fiance's life.

824
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:30,760
We'll figure out something later.

825
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,640
Let's go.

826
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,600
I…

827
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,640
Come on. Let's go.

828
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,560
Hold on! Wait! Wait a sec!

829
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,880
(Under the stars)

830
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,960
It looks nice.

831
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,560
You are quite gifted.

832
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,600
Have a taste.

833
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,240
We had a deal.

834
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,240
You have to finish what you make.

835
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,040
Don't waste it.

836
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,240
Taste it. Just take a sip, okay?

837
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,520
It tastes good.

838
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,360
Really?

839
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,520
Let me try.

840
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,960
It tastes horrible!

841
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,520
It's so bitter. You liar.

842
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,880
It's called "going through
the bitterness together."

843
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,800
It's okay.

844
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,120
I'll come here often in the future.

845
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,440
And if you teach me, I'll pick it up soon enough.

846
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,480
After tasting your coffee,

847
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,160
I'm going to leave this city

848
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,480
and start a new career.

849
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,640
Is it really that bad?

850
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,840
Just kidding.

851
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,000
But

852
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,960
I really am going to leave this city.

853
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,520
It could be

854
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,880
my last time drinking

855
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,320
a horrible cup of coffee like this.

856
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Why are you leaving?

857
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,080
Actually,

858
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,920
I stayed here only for therapy.

859
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,800
Something happened to me

860
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,600
and I've been seeing a psychologist.

861
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,440
The psychologist told me that I should

862
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,920
take some time and forget what happened.

863
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,200
I think now it's time for me

864
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,400
to start a new life.

865
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,080
Do you have to leave here

866
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,480
to start a new life

867
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,120
and forget about your past?

868
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,880
I will try my best to forget about my past.

869
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,480
Why?

870
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,160
None of the memories is good?

871
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,920
It's because they are too good,

872
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,920
so I have to get over them.

873
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:16,920
Otherwise,

874
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,280
I'll be trapped

875
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,960
in those good memories for the rest of my life.

876
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,400
What if

877
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,720
you can have a future

878
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,360
that's just as lovely as before?

879
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
I'll let the future run its course.

880
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,880
But I do hope I'll have

881
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,280
a brand-new future.

882
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,480
Are you sure you are my real brother?

883
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:05,920
Hey,

884
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
isn't your reaction a little over the top?

885
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
Let me tell you the truth.

886
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm the biological son.

887
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,720
You

888
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,600
are adopted.

889
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,880
Nonsense.

890
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,720
You are no longer easy to be fooled.

891
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,720
You used to believe everything I told you.

892
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,560
And now you've grown up.

893
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,560
You become so boring.

894
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:27,600
Tu,

895
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,560
you said that the camera was newly installed
on the abandoned building,

896
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,840
and that means they knew

897
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,000
Young Master would be there.

898
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,280
But I don't think so.

899
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,600
If Young Master was their target,

900
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,600
they wouldn't have just put two men there.

901
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,360
Why are you so sure
that they were going to catch him?

902
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,040
Maybe they just wanted to observe him.

903
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,960
Think about it.

904
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,640
Their target was Young Master,

905
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,640
but they didn't ambush and catch him.

906
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,800
Were they planning to watch
how Young Master comes back to life?

907
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
That doesn't make sense.

908
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
How would they know
about Young Master's special ability?

909
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:05,840
Wait a sec!

910
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,480
We made a last-minute decision
that day about going there,

911
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,760
but Jin Xiaoyu didn't.

912
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,200
She had an appointment

913
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,720
with that doctor named Zhao Shan.

914
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,880
It could be so.

915
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,320
Young Master just showed up there by accident.

916
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,400
I knew that Jin Xiaoyu was trouble.

917
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,760
Young Master was caught

918
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,720
on camera this time because of her.

919
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,120
Who knows what kind of trouble

920
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,040
she'll get him into next time?

921
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,600
Qian Cheng,

922
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,840
do you know what a guardian's responsibility is?

923
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,680
To protect Young Master from being hurt.

924
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,000
Let me

925
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,720
tell you something about life.

926
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,440
To a gentleman,

927
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,360
girls will never cause him trouble.

928
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,200
They consider it

929
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,200
a sweet burden.

930
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,240
Got it?

931
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,240
Tu,

932
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,560
why don't we play a game from our childhood?

933
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,440
Sure.

934
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,640
Pick anything you want.

935
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,680
Let's do last-to-talk challenge.

936
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,680
Whoever talks first loses.

937
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,160
Just drink your water,

938
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,880
you little punk.

939
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,720
Shall we give her a call?

940
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,440
What if she's not available?

941
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,520
In that case,

942
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,480
we can ask around and find out

943
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,480
more information about her.

944
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,960
You want to pressure her in this way?

945
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,520
Yes.

946
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,720
This is the only way.

947
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,520
We don't have other choice.

948
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,360
Alright.

949
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,280
(Mu City University of Science and Technology)
(Girls' Dorm  Building No.3)

950
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
Tan Yueran has been staying outside recently.

951
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,880
Postgraduates are different from undergraduates.

952
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,880
Undergraduates

953
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,080
are not allowed to stay outside.

954
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,680
But postgraduates are.

955
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,280
As for doctoral students,

956
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,760
a lot of them don't even stay in the dorms.

957
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,480
How long has Tan Yueran been staying outside?

958
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,800
With her special condition,

959
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,880
she applied to move out

960
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,040
for her surgery.

961
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,720
After the surgery,

962
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,960
she came back a couple of times,

963
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,560
but didn't stay long.

964
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,800
We should've called first.

965
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:53,400
No.

966
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
We had to come in person to confront her.

967
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,320
If we called first,

968
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,160
she'd run away.

969
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,720
And we can neither call the police

970
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,840
nor let Fu Liang find out.

971
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,680
Why do you think she approached Fu Liang?

972
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,880
She wants to replace Cai Miao?

973
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,840
It's normal for a recipient like her

974
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,440
to suffer from some mental problem.

975
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,560
It would even take you several days

976
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,720
to accommodate to your new hairstyle,

977
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,560
let alone she has a new heart.

978
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,920
Recipients like her

979
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,960
tend to be nervous,

980
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:12,560
sensitive,

981
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,960
or even have nightmares.

982
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,120
It's all normal.

983
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,120
Excuse me!

984
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,320
Could you come here for a sec?

985
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,280
- You are talking to me?
- Yes.

986
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,360
Her room is

987
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,560
right across of the hallway of Tan Yueran's.

988
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,640
You two can ask her.

989
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,280
Hi.

990
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,840
I'm Cheng Weilan, a doctor of the Second Hospital.

991
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,240
Hi.

992
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm Jin Xiaoyu of the Organ Donors Association.

993
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,640
Why don't you call her if you wanna talk to her?

994
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,440
We want to meet her in person.

995
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,200
Don't worry.

996
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,080
We are both girls.

997
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,320
We won't do any harm to her.

998
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,640
You two don't look like bad people.

999
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,080
She's in trouble, isn't she?

1000
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,560
Why are you so sure that she's in trouble?

1001
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,520
With her behavior,

1002
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,640
she'll get herself in trouble sooner or later.

1003
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,280
Yeah.

1004
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,840
I just did laundry.

1005
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
I'll go sleep after folding them.

1006
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,040
Don't worry, Mom.

1007
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,160
Okay.

1008
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Mom, I have to go now.

1009
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
I'm going to sleep.

1010
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,120
Bye.

1011
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
Could you lower your voice?

1012
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,560
Or talk on the phone in your room?

1013
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,360
You woke me up.

1014
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,680
I'm sorry.

1015
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,640
It won't happen again.

1016
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,400
I'm sorry to disturb you, too.

1017
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,960
It's not that I'm bad mouthing her.

1018
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,280
Maybe she had heart disease,

1019
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,640
so she was quiet with whatever she did.

1020
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,640
Besides,

1021
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,560
she looked so pale

1022
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,360
and she had bluish lips.

1023
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,760
If you bump into her in the dark,

1024
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,160
you might just get scared to death.

1025
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,600
