(Qing'ai Group)

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,520
Could you stop rubbing your hands

21
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,480
like a fly?

22
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,480
And why are you

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,440
pacing the floor?

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,760
What?

25
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I'm rubbing my hands because you look like

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,840
a black-eyed chicken.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,680
You'll greet Yang Xue'er looking like this?

28
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,200
She's here to try on the clothes, not to meet me.

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,940
(Xue'er, you are the best!)
Xue'er! Xue'er! Xue'er!

30
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,420
Xue'er! Xue'er! Xue'er!

31
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,820
(Xue'er, you are the best!)
Xue'er! Xue'er! Xue'er!

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,460
Xue'er! Xue'er! Xue'er!

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,240
Mr. Dao.

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,720
Yes?

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
Yang Xue'er is here. She's on her way up.

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,640
Okay.

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,320
Young Master.

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,640
Sounds like

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,040
William is in a sour mood.

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,680
If we had him buried right now,

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,840
he'd die in peace.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,640
What if Yang Xue'er didn't come?

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,880
Then we'd have to ask Mrs. Dao

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,840
to invite another celebrity in France.

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
Alright. Got it.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,920
Nice to meet you, Miss Yang.

47
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
Please take a seat.

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,600
Xue'er

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,120
has a tight schedule today.

50
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,400
Why don't we get right
to checking out the clothes?

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
This is Dao Ruifeng,
the third generation designer of Qing'ai.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,240
You didn't sleep well last night?

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,280
Of course. You don't look like you have makeup on.

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,560
After I heard that you'd come today,

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
I got too excited to sleep last night.

56
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,480
Hope you don't mind.

57
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,640
I didn't put on any makeup

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,080
because I wanted you to see

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,000
my natural look. Hope you don't mind, either.

60
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,600
Of course not.

61
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,920
Yang Xue'er.

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,640
Dao Ruifeng.

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,680
Now, let's check out the clothes.

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,480
These are the new collections.

65
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,760
Messy, but very pretty.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
You are good.

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,120
I guess.

68
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,560
This one is prettier.

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,640
What's the collection called?

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,120
It's called
"The Nine Stages of a Decaying Corpse."

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
What does that mean?

72
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,600
The theory originated in China

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,440
and was carried forward by Japan later.

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
"The Nine Stages" refers to
the sequential decay of a corpse.

75
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Morishige Kinugasa's painting
of The Nine Stages of a Decaying Corpse

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
is housed

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
at the Etnografisch Museum in Belgium.

78
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,840
The nine stages are distension,
rupture, exudation of blood,

79
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,040
discoloration and desiccation,
consumption by animals, putrefaction,

80
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
bones, dismemberment, and parched to dust.

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,040
Hold on.

82
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,840
Any problem?

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,480
It sounds so...

84
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,280
Xue'er.

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,080
Don't you think it's strange?

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,920
There were so many themes he could choose from,

87
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,640
but he chose the theme of death.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,080
It's so strange.

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,940
People say that even the strong will decline over time.

90
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,040
And life is unpredictable, 
you never know when death will come.

91
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,320
The painting
of The Nine Stages of a Decaying Corpse

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
is usually seen in temples.

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,960
And it usually portrays a female's cadaver.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,680
It demonstrates the nature of the human form,
especially the female one.

95
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,480
The stunning appearance is just a disguise

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,760
and the seductive flesh is no different
from a decaying corpse.

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
A beauty will eventually grow old and die.

98
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,960
Eventually they'll go through the "Nine Stages"
portrayed in the painting.

99
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,000
But do you think

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,240
death can take love away?

101
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,160
Love will never last.

102
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,360
But memories will remain.

103
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,680
We never forget

104
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,120
those happy moments we experienced.

105
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Such as seeing the person you like, your kisses,

106
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,280
and the feelings of being in love.

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
The flesh will decay,

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,040
but love will last

109
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,280
forever.

110
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,760
Look at the patterns on the dress.

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
They are messy but beautiful.

112
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,320
Doesn't it feel like you're confronting

113
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,920
the tough love you've had?

114
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,480
Actually, the things
that are even worse than death

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,600
are betrayal, jealousy, and hurting each other.

116
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,160
It also includes negative emotions

117
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,440
such as the fear of death

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,320
and the reluctance to accept death.

119
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,280
The designer hopes that you can feel it,

120
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
and that you can

121
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,200
see through the ugliness hidden
beneath the beautiful facade.

122
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
Yet after seeing the ugliness,

123
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,240
you still choose to believe in beauty.

124
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,360
Who are you?

125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm Wei... Ruifeng's assistant.

126
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Wei Ruifeng?

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,560
Wei Ruifeng. You know?

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
This is Bai, my assistant.

129
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,360
He's become Crayon Shin-chan.

130
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,160
Your husband was really handsome.

131
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,440
Xiaoyu.

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,960
Why are you out here today?

133
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,320
My blood test results

134
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,320
were pretty good.

135
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,960
Really?

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,880
Come sit.

137
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
(Late Father He Luwei
Late Mother Xu Nan  Joint Grave)

138
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,920
So I got my attending doctor's permission

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,480
to come visit my late husband.

140
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
The carer is with me.

141
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,480
And I told my son-in-law about it.

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,960
But I didn't tell my daughter.

143
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,440
You do look much better now.

144
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:12,760
Really?

145
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,280
Yeah.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
It could be terminal lucidity.

147
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't say that.

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,120
I've thought about it.

149
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,240
I'll donate my organs.

150
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,600
I've signed the consent forms

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,120
and written a will

152
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
telling my daughter

153
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,400
to help me fulfill my last wish.

154
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
Don't worry.

155
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,720
After a body is donated,

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,440
it'll be cremated

157
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,840
after being used for medical teaching.

158
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,400
You can still be buried together
with your late husband.

159
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,160
The donated bodies will be used
for medical education.

160
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,640
The students call the donor bodies
"Silent Mentors."

161
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,440
"Silent Mentors"?

162
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,800
I've never done anything significant in my life.

163
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,160
I've been taken care of
by my husband and my daughter.

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,200
Who would've thought that

165
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,880
I'd become a "mentor" after I've died?

166
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,800
It's nice.

167
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,680
Xiaoyu.

168
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,920
I read online that euthanasia
is legal in some foreign countries.

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,480
People say suicide is a sin.

170
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,480
But in my case, I don't think

171
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,720
death is something unpleasant.

172
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,280
One should live well,

173
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,840
and accept death.

174
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,560
There's no need to be afraid of death.

You are right.

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,840
and accept death when it's time.

Hope my late husband hasn't gone far yet.

180
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,640
I'm sure he's waiting for you.

181
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,280
Just take your time.

Chief Xiao's community activity

185
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,560
was torture.

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,720
I heard

187
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,560
that they arranged over 20 blind dates for you.

188
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,280
The elders were quite fond of you.

189
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,560
I was being nice out of politeness.

190
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,920
I didn't think I would go on
so many fruitless dates.

191
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,200
Since I'm forced
to go on blind dates all the time,

192
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,800
I've figured out a way of rejecting them.

193
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,080
How?

194
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:21,760
First,

195
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
you talk about your work.

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,400
Then tell them about

197
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,880
your crazy interest in idol couples.

198
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,240
After hearing all that,
they would naturally back off.

199
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,760
That easy?

200
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,600
Yeah. Think about it.

201
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,080
You have a busy job

202
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,640
and you'd spend your spare time
adoring idol couples.

How could you have time for dating?

204
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,720
- That's a good idea!
- Right?

205
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Have you heard about it?

206

found out what it is,

of how it affects the human body.

I'm looking for a stone.

A stone?

261

A radioactive meteorite, to be specific.

262
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,440
Do you know about the Chernobyl disaster?

263

Yes.

264
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,680
After the release of the radiation material,

265
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,680
the radio contamination caused a great number

266
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,480
of plants and animals to mutate.

267
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,520
For example, a small mouse

268
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,520
could grow to the size of a horse.

269
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,840

270
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,280
of meteorite that can make a small flower

271
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,600
grow to the size of a basin.

In order to find it,

273
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
I've been paying attention

274
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,000
to the news regarding radioactive materials.

275
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,880
I've even visited many places

276
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
that are radioactive.

277
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,640
So how did you know this medicine

278
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,760
(Test Report of Radioactive Material)
contains this particular radioactive material?

279
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,560
Because of the illegal medical treatment case

280
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,600
that happened 20 years ago.

281
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,400
The news at that time

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,840
reported that the confiscated medical instruments

283
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,040
contained trace amounts of radioactive substances.

284
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,240
So I did my job and investigated the case.

285
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,200
In the end, I found
that the criminals were still at large.

286
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,000
They cleaned those

287
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,720
medical instruments containing

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,760
the radioactive substances

289
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,440
and then sold them off.

290
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,640
Let me guess.

291
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,880
The buyer must be

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
Through Zhao Shan,

295
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,800
I found his partner Gao Guofu,

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,000
that car repairman.

297
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,720
I thought I could find

298
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
some leads through him.

299
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,920
But,

300
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,560
he had no fear of death.

301
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
That's how the bus incident happened.

302
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,880
I see.

303

I thought it was quite strange,

486
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,040
and I found this in her ward.

487
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,400
I think this old lady must have taken

the special drug.

489
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,680
Yeah. She had late-stage cancer.

490
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
But she somehow fully recovered
and was discharged.

491
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,240
This is not a medical miracle.

492

506
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,840
It's okay.

507
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,760
Five more minutes.

508
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,960
Aren't you a little too old

509
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,440
to be taking advantages like this?

510
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,760
Every second counts for a successful person.

511
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,520
You are good at flirting.

512
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,440
Of course.

513
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,680
Unlike you,

514
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,080
you've just learned

515
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,840
some cheap lines from William.

516
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
How is it?

517
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,000
We hit the jackpot.

518
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,640
Mr. Wang's dog barks all the time!

519
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,720
I'll file a complaint against you tomorrow.

520
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,440
So you are afraid, huh?

521
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,320
Mom, what's wrong?

522
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,480
Kill the manizer! Kill the bad guy!

523
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Mom, what are you doing?

524
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,600
Miss He!

525
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,800
Mom!

526
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,280
Mom! Mom! Mom!

527
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,400
- What happened to you, Mom?
- Open the door!

528
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
Kill the manizer! Kill the bad guy!

529
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,120
Miss He.

530
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:53,920
Mom!

531
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,360
Kill...

532
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:54,920
Mom!

533
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,400
Kill the bad guy!

534
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,800
- Kill the manizer!
- I'm Meiman, Mom!

535
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,240
Kill the bad guy!

536
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,080
Kill the bad guy!

537
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,640
Kill the manizer!

538
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,880
Kill the manizer!

539
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,480
Kill the bad guy!

540
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,200
Mom!

541
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,400
Mom!

542
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Mom, what happened to you?

543
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,680
Mom!

544
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,880
Just focus on getting better.

545
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,720
Don't worry about the other things.

546
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,840
Thank you.

547
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,480
Miss He,

548
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,400
could you tell me

549
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,520
where you

550
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,360
got that medicine?

551
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,840
I was so desperate
that I went to the wrong person.

552
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,560
I didn't know things would become like this.

553
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,640
That medicine is illegal.

554
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Where did you get it?

555
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,800
I met a woman

556
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,200
the other day at the billing counter.

557
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,440
She told me that her husband
had pancreatic cancer.

558
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
And that he's been taking
this medicine to stay alive.

559
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,120
It was not expensive.

560
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,840
She said it's from Thailand.

561
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,280
That sounds like a scam.

562
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
How could you fall for that?

563
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,760
You don't understand.
Having a family member with cancer

564
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,240
is like carrying a mountain.

565
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,960
I can't give up on my mom.

566
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,960
I can't let her die.

567
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,200
My dad passed away half a year ago.

568
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,960
If my mom was gone,

569
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,040
I'd have no family left.

570
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
If I were the one

571
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
who had cancer,

572
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,720
my mom wouldn't give up on me, either.

573
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,360
I understand your feelings.

574
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,760
People always say a mother's love is unconditional,

575
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,040
and a father's love is eternal.

576
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,800
But seldom do people mention the children.

577
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,040
Actually they are just as devoted

578
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,040
as their parents.

579
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,040
The older you are,
the more you care about your parents.

580
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,920
If your parents are alive, then you feel at home.

581
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,640
Without your parents,

582
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,840
you'll be all by yourself.

583
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,960
True.

584
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,200
I can't live without my mom.

585
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,480
But kids need to grow up.

586
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,440
She is your mom,
but she also needs to live for herself.

587
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,160
Rarely can women live for themselves.

588
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,560
I work in the funeral home.

589
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,000
I often notice that

590
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,680
people only find out about

591
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,640
a woman's name

592
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,640
on their funerals.

593
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,400
In front of their relatives, friends,

594
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,360
and families,

595
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,280
a woman would take on different titles.

596
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,880
Until on the day of their funerals,

597
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,400
their names are finally

598
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,920
known by those people,

599
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,520
and then forgotten again.

600
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,520
After the ceremony,

601
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,960
they are still grandmas

602
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,800
and aunts.

603
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,440
But that's normal, right?

604
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,160
We can't just

605
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,840
address our relatives by names.

606
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,240
It's the same with everybody.

607
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,120
There's no difference when it comes to men.

608
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,320
They are all grandpas
and uncles to certain people.

609
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,280
Maybe they have a better chance

610
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,280
to be addressed by their names.

611
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Living in this world is all about compromise.

612
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
There's nothing we can control.

613
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,600
That's why

614
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,800
we need to communicate with our families
and get their understanding.

615
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,720
Mrs. Xu once said

616
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,880
that it's quite sad

617
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,960
that she couldn't

618
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,240
live on her own terms

619
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,480
or die on her own terms.

620
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,120
I think a short dress fits Xue'er better.

621
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,080
Okay.

622
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,240
We'll take out all the short dresses we have

623
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,440
for Miss Yang to try on.

624
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,040
Xue'er is quite interested in

625
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,160
Mr. Dao Ruifeng's assistant.

626
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,400
She even

627
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,400
asked me to arrange this dinner for her.

628
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,040
It shows how serious she is.

629
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,760
This dinner should be on us.

630
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,720
Xue'er is a strong-minded

631
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,360
and artistic type of girl.

632
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm just worried

633
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,000
if her invitation

634
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,800
will cause any inconvenience to Bai?

635
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,040
After all, he's just an assistant,

636
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,800
and Dao Ruifeng is the fashion designer.

637
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,360
I told her

638
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,760
that her interest in the assistant
may embarrass the designer.

639
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,960
This in turn will cause the assistant to suffer.

640
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
If she had taken your advice,

641
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,520
she wouldn't have texted me.

642
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,120
Yep. I said no,

643
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,560
so she contacted you directly.

644
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
What a stubborn child.

645
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,960
The theme of this collection
is called "The Jade Pond."

646
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,640
The dresses are more feminine.

647
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,400
Suitable for elegant ladies.

648
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,240
Pick something you like

649
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,440
and I'll give it to you.

650
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,560
Isn't that

651
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,880
too much?

652
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,280
Don't worry about it.

653
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,520
Here you go.

654
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,320
I've made a reservation.

655
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,760
This is the restaurant's information.

656
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,220
(About the Restaurant  Specialties)
You can find the dress code on it.

657
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,400
(Dress code: Formal attire is a must)
What kinda restaurant

658
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,560
would have a dress code?

659
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,680
Interesting.

660
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,920
Their family pays particular attention
to formalities.

661
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,120
Having dinner is like going to a feast.

662
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,400
The restaurant usually sends an invitation to customers
and expect them to be dressed formally.

663
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,880
But it shows how much

664
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,960
Yang Xue'er values you.

665
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,920
It shows

666
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,240
she's too demanding.

667
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,360
What if an assistant like me

668
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,240
doesn't have formal wear? Has she thought of that?

669
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,320
A lady like her

670
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,680
wouldn't usually think of that.

671
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,320
3,000 Yuan per person on average?

672
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,920
She won't let me pay for it, right?

673
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,360
I'm just an assistant.

674
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
I can't afford that.

675
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
To assure your safety,

676
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,520
William and I will go with you.

677
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,440
That's not necessary.

678
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,960
It's not appropriate.

679
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,960
We are your guardians after all.

680
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,760
Don't tell me you'll ask Jin Xiaoyu
to go with you.

681
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,320
It's work. I won't bother her.

Don't you wanna try my tea?

(Spring)

684
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,840
You are on duty today.

685
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
Don't forget to sort garbage.

686
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,120
You didn't do it again?

687
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,320
Since it's your job, why would I bother?

688
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,560
You are garbage!

689
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,660
(Spring)

690
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,840

(About the Restaurant)

692
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,500
(Dress code)
(Formal attire is a must)

693
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,360
There's dress code in a restaurant?

694
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,320
Funny.

695
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,600
Yang Xue'er invited Young Master for dinner.

696
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,560
Of course she'd pick a nice one.

697
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,040
Yang Xue'er?

698
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,200
The celebrity who just won the prize, right?

699
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:31,920
Yep.

700
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
Why would she invite Jiang Baiju for dinner?

701
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,960
Jiang Baiju always keeps to himself at work.

702
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,080
And he's just

703
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,600
an insignificant assistant in your company.

704
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,880
Insignificant or not,

705
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,720
it's up to Young Master himself.

706
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,120
Who wouldn't want to stand out

707
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,800
in front of a talented and beautiful lady

708
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,120
like Yang Xue'er?

709
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,840
Besides,

710
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,760
(Spring  About the Restaurant)
Young Master's charm is quite irresistible.

711
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,600
He didn't tell you?

712
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,800
He'll have dinner with Yang Xue'er

713
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,000
tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.

714
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Look at you! Can't wait to stir up trouble.

715
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,320
Young Master didn't even tell you

716
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,360
that he'd have dinner with a celebrity.

717
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,840
Looks like you aren't that close after all.

718
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,440
If I were you,

719
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,400
I'd go confront him right now

720
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,680
and ask for an explanation.

721
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,760
You know what?

722
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm not gonna let you get me.

723
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,560
You'd be thrilled if I went to confront him.

724
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
But a small matter like this,

725
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,320
I don't care.

726
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,880
Hey, you haven't sorted out the garbage!

(Unknown number)

729
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,480
Hello?

730
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,880
I'd like to make a reservation
for the "Louvre" at 6:00 pm.

731
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,720
Miss, please state your membership number.

732
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,680
What membership number?

733
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm not a member.

734
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm sorry, Miss.

735
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
Our restaurant is for members only.

736
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,360
We don't accept non-member reservations.

737
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,240
Thank you for calling.

738
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
Then I...

739
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,400
What kinda restaurant would be picky about guests?

740
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,320
What if

741
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,880
I humble myself

742
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
and ask Jiang Baiju directly?

743
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,280
No. It'd make me look bad.

744
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,200
But judging by how excited he looked

745
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,360
when he talked about it,

746
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,440
I'm sure that girl has a crush on Jiang Baiju.

747
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm still alive,

748
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,760
yet you've already moved on!

749
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,640
Jiang Baiju.

750
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,240
(Lin Nuoyan  Moments)
What a formal and special restaurant!

751
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,800
Thank you, mysterious friend!

752
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,240
I got it!

753
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,440
Careful now.

754
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,920
Let's go.

755
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,840
Okay.

756
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,360
Careful!

757
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,040
Thank you, Lin Nuoyan!

758
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,520
Don't mention it.

759
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,400
I posted

760
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
that on my Moments

761
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,240
just to thank my friend.

762
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,840
I didn't know it'd be useful to you.

763
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,240
What a coincidence!

764
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,000
Alright, the meal is on me today.

765
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,840
Is the food here expensive?

766
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,920
The water is free.

767
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,080
Then water it is.

768
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,720
Let's go.

769
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:07,800
Thank you.

770
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,640
Xiaoyu.

771
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,000
We made a last-minute reservation,

772
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,120
so only the tables in the dining room
are still available.

773
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,640
I heard you have to call

774
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,560
one week in advance if you want a private room.

775
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,800
One week?

776
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,600
I think here is good enough.

777
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,520
Good to know.

778
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,600
Very nice.

779
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,440
And they only offer

780
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,640
fixed dinner menu

781
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,000
including several pre-selected meals

782
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,160
with different set prices.

783
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,400
I've chosen

784
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,560
the most bang for your buck meal for us.

785
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,680
So today's meal

786
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,240
is on me.

787
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,880
No. I told you I'd pay for it.

788
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,480
Don't you remember that you

789
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,200
gave me a lesson last time?

790
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,400
I should thank you for that.

791
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,320
Don't you remember

792
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,640
that you gave me an incense burner?

793
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,600
We are even.

794
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,120
That incense burner was nothing.

795
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,240
Think of it as a small gift.

796
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,760
Look.

797
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,480
We've known each other for so long,

798
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,560
but we've never

799
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,520
had a meal together.

800
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,080
Mostly because a scientific researcher like me

801
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,880
doesn't have so much money to burn.

802
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,240
No, no, no.

803
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,960
Your talent is not about money,

804
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,520
but your handsome face.

805
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,760
Thank you.

806
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,480
Thanks.

807
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,000
Miss,

808
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,600
may I help you hang your coat up?

809
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,320
Thank you.

810
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,440
I rarely see you wear something like this.

811
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,280
Do I look good?

812
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,760
Yes.

813
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,760
Actually it's a nightgown.

814
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,080
I'm sorry.

815
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,400
I'm the one who should be sorry.

816
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,120
I don't have a formal dress,

817
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,320
so I had to wear this.

818
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
Why don't you

819
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
put my jacket on?

820
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,240
It'll make you

821
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,840
feel more comfortable.

822
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Right?

823
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,320
Thank you.

824
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,360
You know, you look like

825
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,720
a movie star when dressing like this.

826
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,760
Really? A movie star?

827
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,720
Yeah.

828
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,600
If you look online, you'll find

829
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,640
the celebrities all dress like this.

830
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,120
Nightgown with a suit jacket, gorgeous.

831
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,080
As a matter of fact,

832
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,560
do you know what's the best dressing tip?

833
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,560
What is it?

834
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,720
Be confident.

835
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,800
What do you mean?

836
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,240
You only dress up for the others to see.

837
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,800
As long as you don't feel awkward,

838
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,160
who cares how the others feel?

839
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,360
That makes sense.

840
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,480
Xiaoyu.

841
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,240
Do you see the door in the back?

842
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,920
I heard it's specially designed for the VVVIP.

843
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,480
What?

844
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,080
VVVIP?

845
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,920
Miss Yang.

846
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,680
Mr. Qian.

847
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,920
Let Assistant Bai sit next to me.

848
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,640
I'm just here to tag along.

849
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,560
The artists are more important.

850
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,800
Something's wrong here.

851
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,960
Nothing's wrong.

852
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
There's a parking lot behind.

853
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,240
You can park the car there

854
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,920
and come in through the door in the backyard

855
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,080
instead of the front entrance.

856
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,480
That's so cool.

857
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,440
Why don't they just drive them

858
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,560
right into the room, right?

859
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:46,920
I...

860
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,400
I need to use the washroom.

861
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,200
Alright.

862
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,320
VVVIP.

863
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,760
This is Australian lobster.

864
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,520
Thank you.

865
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,760
Miss Yang,

866
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,880
to Qing'ai.

867
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,160
And our cooperation!

868
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,240
To our cooperation!

869
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,960
Cheers!

870
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,520
- Let's eat.
- Go ahead.

871
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:14,840
Bai,

872
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,920
what's your full name?

873
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,680
My name

874
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,120
is...

875
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,160
Assistant Bai.

876
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
What kinda name is that?

877
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,560
My name is not important.

878
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,840
I'm Mr. Dao Ruifeng's assistant.

879
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,080
Please just call me Assistant Bai.

880
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,080
Your assistant is so loyal to you.

881
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,440
Miss Yang.

882
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,600
He was actually trained by my grandmother.

883
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,680
He was Mrs. Dao's apprentice?

884
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,520
Yes.

885
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,240
I didn't know that.

886
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,160
Bai.

887
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,440
May I have the honor

888
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,000
to have you design a dress for me?

889
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,640
I'm not a designer.

890
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,200
I don't think I can do it.

891
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,800
But I think you can.

892
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,640
I wanna hire you.

893
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,480
I'm just

894
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,440
a smooth-talking assistant.

895
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,920
Mr. Ruifeng is the professional here.

896
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,720
So please don't get your hopes up

897
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,040
or have certain imaginations.

898
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,560
It's not my imagination, it's my intuition.

899
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,720
My intuition tells me that you are

900
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,480
much more talented than you let out.

901
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,560
Miss Yang.

902
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,160
Bai is indeed talented,

903
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,880
but he's not ready yet for the real challenge.

904
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,960
Mrs. Dao valued him highly

905
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,720
and trained him for years.

906
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,640
She hoped that he could hone his skills

907
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,320
and become a true artist

908
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,960
instead of a commercial designer.

909
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,000
That's right, Miss Yang.

910
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,000
Bai is an artist
who's much more talented than I am.

911
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
My grandmother had high hopes for him.

912
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,480
It'll be great if you can model for him

913
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,840
when he makes his debut.

914
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,400
Would you be interested, Miss Yang?

915
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,600
As long as you invite me.

916
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,920
Then how about this year?

917
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,520
I happen to have some

918
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,720
unreleased designs to show you.

919
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,480
To show me only?

920
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,800
No...

921
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,840
Why not?

922
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,320
Okay.

923
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,320
Then I'll look forward to your

924
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,640
secret designs.

925
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,880
Here.

926
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,680
Cheers!

927
00:39:58,880 --> 00:39:59,880
- Cheers!
