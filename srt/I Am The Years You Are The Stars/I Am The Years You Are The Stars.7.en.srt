21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,200
Hey, you know what?

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,360
- The food in the canteen...
- Hold it.

23
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,600
The teacher said we aren't
allowed to dine in the lab.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,160
We're just going to eat right here.

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,640
We won't go over there.

26
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,120
That's right.

27
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,760
The canteen is too crowded.

28
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,520
And it's cold out there.

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,240
We'll finish really quickly.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,400
W-We've still got work to do after lunch.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,880
Hello, sir.

32
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,640
Go, go, go.

33
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,600
You're so fussy.
No wonder you don't have a boyfriend.

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,320
Sorry, sir.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,120
It's nothing.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,350
Just these for now.

37
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,810
Okay.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,720
My junior at work recommended
this shop to me.

39
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
She said the desserts here are great.

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
I don't like desserts.

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,200
They're fattening.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Then I'll order something else.

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,480
The one who hooked us up

44
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,000
told me you work
at the Civil Affairs Department?

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,120
Yes.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,920
What do you do exactly?

47
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,840
I do...

48
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
back-end stuff.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,120
Back-end?

50
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
A dispatcher?

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,920
Um, pretty close.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,640
Since we came to see each other
with the purpose of getting married,

53
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I'll be straightforward.

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,440
I'm a clean freak.

55
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,520
So I don't accept a dirty boyfriend.

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,160
But I think your department has good benefits,

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,360
and we get on well on WeChat,

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,080
so I came.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:19,880
Here.

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,960
Drinks.

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,480
Thank you.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,880
Thank you.

63
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,680
Gu Xiaole?

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,920
Fu Liang. It's been a long time.

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
You work here?

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
How's your grandfather?

67
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,880
I heard he's been unwell.

68
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
My grandfather...

69
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,680
He died two months ago.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,280
My condolences.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Let's talk later.

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,400
You two carry on.

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,200
Sorry.

74
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,840
My old classmate.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,320
We grew up together.

76
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,720
Where were we?

77
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
We were...

78
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Um...

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,440
Right, clean freak.

80
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,360
Yeah, clean freak.

81
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,880
Because of my mysophobia,

82
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,720
even during grandfather's funeral,

83
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
I could only stand in front
of the funeral service door.

84
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,560
I didn't even dare to go in.

85
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,880
Though we advocate the idea
of a simple funeral,

86
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,440
still,

87
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
certain ceremonies can't be avoided
when it comes to family.

88
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,400
I just don't like funeral home.

89
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,160
Actually,

90
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,520
no one likes it.

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Let's not talk about it.

92
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,040
Let's talk about your job.

93
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Actually...

94
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,400
What?

95
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,720
I'm a mortuary makeup artist.

96
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,560
So I guess I can't meet your requirements.

97
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,120
How about we just be normal friends?

98
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,840
Since you've already ordered them,

99
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,560
why not drink it?

100
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,640
This is a typical arranged date.

101
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
You have to meet each other's requirements

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,360
and have similar personalities.

103
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,960
I really don't want to lie to her.

104
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Even if she never goes to a funeral home,

105
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,160
or she never finds out what my job is,

106
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,400
I still don't want to lie to her.

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,600
Thanks, though,

108
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
for reserving the seats for us.

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,800
I screwed it up anyway.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,960
All right.

111
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,560
Cheer up.

112
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Treat yourself nicely.

113
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,400
(Bashi Hotpot)
The coupon for the hotpot next-door.

114
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,520
20% off.

115
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
Treat yourself nicely.

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,600
Bro,

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,640
though the date was a failure,

118
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,880
I'm still into women.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,080
What the heck are you talking about?

120
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,880
This is from Jin Xiaoyu.

121
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,960
She said, if your arranged date
turns out a success,

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
you can take the girl with you.

123
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,280
Otherwise,

124
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,480
you can eat alone.

125
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,360
Eat something nice.

126
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,040
Xiaoyu?

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,440
Manager.

128
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
Didn't we only reserve

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,000
a meal-for-one at the hotpot?

130
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,880
Shut up.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,480
Hello.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
Are you Tan Yueran?

133
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:18,920
Yes.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
Jin Xiaoyu, right?

135
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Take a seat.

136
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
I ordered a cup of coffee for you.

137
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,680
Thanks.

138
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,280
Didn't we meet before?

139
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,920
Yeah.

140
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,080
During your event at the mall,

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,200
I walked past by

142
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,320
and took a flyer.

143
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,320
There were too many people,

144
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,160
so I could hardly remember.

145
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,880
What is this meeting about?

146
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,080
I want to learn from you

147
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,120
about the donor of my heart.

148
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,560
According to China's regulations
on human organ transplantation,

149
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,880
medical workers
who engage in organ transplantation,

150
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,560
who disclose

151
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,040
the personal information of

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,840
the donors, recipients, or applicants

153
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,520
will be punished.

154
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,120
Didn't your doctor tell you about

155
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,120
the organ transplantation
non-disclosure agreement?

156
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
Before I came,

157
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,600
I did my research.

158
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,960
You are referring to

159
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,480
term 27 of the deceased donor
transplants regulations,

160
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,760
right?

161
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,400
This is what my doctor told me as well.

162
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,280
But Xiaoyu,

163
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
you aren't a medical worker.

164
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,800
Can you please help me?

165
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:21,960
But...

166
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,960
But I still can't disclose
any personal information.

167
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,200
Sorry.

168
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,680
Xiaoyu,

169
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
I read news previously

170
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,240
about promotional events
like the meetings

171
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
between donors and recipients.

172
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,480
I think I can participate in
similar events, too,

173
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,040
to help with the promotion.

174
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,040
Look,

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,920
I've got a PhD of Computer Science.

176
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,120
(Tan Yueran  Student ID)
This is my student ID.

177
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,160
This is my certificate of patent.

178
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:43,800
(Tan Yueran  Certificate of Patent)

179
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,720
I can help the volunteer association

180
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,240
with promotional events.

181
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,280
Or you can even ask me to sponsor your events.

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,520
Just let me

183
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,000
see the family of the donor, please.

184
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,680
My intention is pure and simple.

185
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,080
I just wish to express my gratitude.

186
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:58,840
Thank you.

187
00:07:59,360 --> 00:07:59,880
Thank you.

188
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,800
I...

189
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,920
had congenital heart disease since young.

190
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,240
I never could enjoy any outdoor activity.

191
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,880
I was often sent to hospitals.

192
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,760
Xiaoyu,

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,880
you have no idea how important 

194
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,200
this heart means to me.

195
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,000
Because of it,

196
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
I get to live a normal life.

197
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,200
I've also heard

198
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,000
the former owner of the heart

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,920
was a young girl

200
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,360
who died of a car accident.

201
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,400
I'd like her mother to

202
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,240
listen to her daughter's heartbeats again.

203
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,480
Here's the thing.

204
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,520
All those who go to the event

205
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,280
are selected strictly.

206
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,440
People like you

207
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,880
who have a strong desire usually
don't get a chance.

208
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,480
Now that you've got a new heart,

209
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,880
you should start a new life.

210
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,120
Sorry.

211
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,920
I can't help you.

212
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Xiaoyu,

213
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,520
please don't leave.

214
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,880
How about you finish the coffee?

215
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,640
I have a rare and serious disease.

216
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,920
I cannot consume strong drinks.

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,200
Sorry.

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,800
I didn't know.

219
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,360
It's fine.

220
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,280
You were kind enough
to order the coffee for me.

221
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,080
I appreciate it.

222
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,560
But you didn't know

223
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,520
that I can't drink coffee.

224
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,960
Your goodwill

225
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,000
may be a burden on others.

226
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,400
It could bring trouble.

227
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,080
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,160
(Mu City Municipal Funeral Home)
(Service Hall)

229
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Forget about this one.

230
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,800
I'll ask Xiaoxi to introduce
another girl to you.

231
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
One of her classmates from primary school
just broke up with her ex.

232
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
She's an exorcist.

233
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,280
Am I a spirit?

234
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
I'm just pulling your leg.

235
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,480
A nurse!

236
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,440
You two are occupationally

237
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,680
relatable, right?

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
I don't want a relationship.

239
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,720
Look at you.

240
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,640
Aren't you the one who wanted a date?

241
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,240
What I want is love.

242
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,120
(Service Hall)
And I want world peace.

243
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,440
I'll go ask Master
what he wants for lunch.

244
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,400
You go find seats for us.

245
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,500
(Ash Hall General Office Farewell Hall Crematory Room
Pickup Registration Reception Room )

246
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:03,960
Hi.

247
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,440
Which department are you looking for?

248
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
All right. Done.

249
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,240
Keep the drying time

250
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
within 30 minutes.

251
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,160
And it needs to be adjusted

252
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
based on how much hair she has.

253
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,360
One thing you must take note of:

254
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,000
The nozzle can't be too close
to the skin.

255
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
Leave a distance of 3 to 4 centimeters.

256
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,880
- Or you'll burn the skin.
- Okay.

257
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,040
The living may yell when they feel pain

258
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,920
but the dead don't.

259
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
So we need to be extra careful.

260
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,760
Lean in and look.

261
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Especially the hair on her temples,

262
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
and this part.

263
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,560
Look very carefully.

264
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,920
- This?
- This.

265
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,040
Xiaoyu!

266
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,120
Are you trying to

267
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,200
shorten my lifespan?

268
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
Master asked me to see

269
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,560
how things are going.

270
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,280
What are you two doing?

271
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,040
Xiaoyu,

272
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,640
a girl added me as her WeChat friend.

273
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
At the entrance of the registration room,

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
a girl added me!

275
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Shut up.

276
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,320
I can even see your tonsils.

277
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,880
I see you

278
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,040
hug girls every day,

279
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
so it's not like you haven't
seen everything there is to see.

280
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,840
Can you not act like a child?

281
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,240
All those girls are dead.

282
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,040
I'll send Wang Quande
a WeChat message

283
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
telling him that a girl picked me up.

284
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Can you be realistic?

285
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,080
This is a funeral home.

286
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,600
Who does pick-up at a funeral home?

287
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,960
Does this place

288
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,280
look like a dating spot?

289
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,880
She's a doctor

290
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,760
who came to collect information
at the funeral home.

291
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,240
She came to collect information,

292
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,480
not boyfriends. Okay?

293
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,720
It's a destiny that we met.

294
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,680
And since it's destiny,

295
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,960
I should seize it.

296
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,920
Do me a favor.

297
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,840
I just got her WeChat.

298
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,800
How do I start a conversation?

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,040
You know, it's very simple.

300
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,560
At midnight,

301
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,040
you send a message

302
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
saying you're on duty at the morgue

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,120
while having her on mind.

304
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,160
Done.

305
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,360
Knock it off!

306
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm serious, Jin Xiaoyu.

307
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,400
She's absolutely my type.

308
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
What's your type?

309
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,160
Anyone alive.

310
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Look.

311
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,280
So? Pretty, right?

312
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,920
I tell you what,

313
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,040
she went to the funeral home.

314
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,640
The fool Zhang Quanzhan

315
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,680
thought it was his lucky day.

316
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,880
But it's nothing like that.

317
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,440
Get this.

318
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,920
He added her WeChat

319
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,960
and told her his full name.

320
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,520
Clearly, this matter isn't over.

321
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,600
I don't get it.

322
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,160
Generally, it's the donor's family

323
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,280
asking where the organ goes.

324
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,080
I've never heard any recipient

325
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,880
who asks to know

326
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,320
who the donor was.

327
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,560
This isn't right.

328
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,320
The girl feels off.

329
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,440
How do I put it?

330
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
My instinct, you know?

331
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,400
The instinct of a woman.

332
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,920
I think it needs

333
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,040
to be reported.

334
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm going to

335
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,360
ask Chief Zhou

336
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,120
who her therapist is.

337
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,600
It's obviously

338
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,760
psychological rejection.

339
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Xiaoyu,

340
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,320
the next time you see her,

341
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,400
watch your attitude,

342
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,000
got it?

343
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,720
After all, she's

344
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,040
still in her convalescence.

345
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
You just hurry up

346
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,920
and execute your plan,

347
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,560
okay?

348
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,400
I'm hanging up.

349
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,920
Why can't the donor's information

350
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,800
be disclosed?

351
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,240
It's a complicated issue.

352
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,240
It's an internationally accepted rule

353
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,880
called double-blind.

354
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,840
Its purpose is to reduce mental stress.

355
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,000
If

356
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,720
you don't know

357
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,760
who the donor is,

358
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,920
you won't be mentally stressed.

359
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:31,920
For example,

360
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
after Princess Diana died,

361
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,240
many of her organs were donated.

362
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,120
Eight recipients.

363
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,280
If they knew

364
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,440
the organs were from

365
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,440
Princess Diana,

366
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,560
they'd be shocked.

367
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,320
Good point.

368
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,040
Secondly,

369
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,920
it's to prevent from the ugliness
of human nature.

370
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,000
Organ donation

371
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,520
is a major event in life,

372
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
but still,

373
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,400
it's just one stop during the journey.

374
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,520
There's still a long way ahead.

375
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,960
During the process,

376
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,160
if there's any dispute...

377
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,880
Like a friend of mine

378
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,880
who originally wanted to donate bone marrow,

379
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,000
but he changed his mind
halfway through.

380
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,920
And unexpectedly,
his information was disclosed.

381
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,800
Then the family of the recipient

382
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,080
could adopt some

383
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,440
despicable measures to force them.

384
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,400
This is the ugliness of human nature.

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
And thirdly?

386
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,240
It's to prevent organ trafficking.

387
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,280
You know Jobs

388
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,360
once had a liver transplant.

389
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,520
But the donor was a regular guy.

390
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,320
If the information was disclosed,

391
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,400
it would be possible that

392
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,720
his family went to Jobs,

393
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,120
and it might even
escalate to blackmail.

394
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,320
There's no fourthly.

395
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,960
So what you mean is,

396
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,520
if someone goes to a funeral home

397
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,240
asking about the donor's information,

398
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,440
it is illegal.

399
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,000
Right?

400
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

401
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
All kinds of people live in this world.

402
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,680
Even someone like you, right?

403
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Will this person

404
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,880
intend to harm you?

405
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,840
You want someone to harm me

406
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
or the other way around?

407
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,560
If I did want someone to harm you,

408
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,000
you wouldn't be sitting here.

409
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,200
In that case,

410
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,440
I could make your turtle

411
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,840
into a soup for Cheng.

412
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,120
And your goose

413
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,920
could be a stew.

414
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,040
And I could dump

415
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,320
all of your weird medicine

416
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
in the kitchen

417
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,480
right into the trash can.

418
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,320
I could make your room

419
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,400
my studio for drawing.

420
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,160
I can't be bothered to speak to you anymore.

421
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,640
Jin Xiaoyu.

422
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,440
What?

423
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,040
The way you made the speech

424
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,800
was kind of cool.

425
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,880
You dummy!

426
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,080
- I mean...
- You don't like sweet drinks...

427
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,200
- The fruits in the canteen are...
- and sugary drinks.

428
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,760
Xiaoyu. Come, come.

429
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
This is Dr. Tan.

430
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,400
I told you about her before.

431
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,520
What are you doing here?

432
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,840
The computer in our office
doesn't work well.

433
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,960
She has a PhD in Computer Science.

434
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,480
I invited her to come and check.

435
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,760
It's fine.

436
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,320
We've known each other since long time ago.

437
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,560
There's a misunderstanding between us.

438
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,800
I bought milk tea.

439
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,200
You want sugar-free or regular?

440
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,120
First of all.

441
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't call me Xiaoyu.

442
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,960
We aren't that close.

443
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,640
Secondly,

444
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,720
there's no misunderstanding.

445
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,120
Even if you threaten to kill me,

446
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,160
I won't help you.

447
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Just fix the computers

448
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
and buy the milk tea if you like.

449
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,640
I'm someone

450
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
who has a terribly thick skin.

451
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,680
I'll accept any favors
without feeling obliged to return them.

452
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:17,960
I'll drink the milk tea,

453
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,960
but I've gotten no information for you.

454
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,720
What's your problem,

455
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,240
Jin Xiaoyu?

456
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,360
Ignore her.

457
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,840
Maybe she's gotten a crush on me,

458
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
so she's hostile against you.

459
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,080
Zhang Quanzhan,

460
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,000
did you gather your confidence

461
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
from a recycling center?

462
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,880
Just get out of here already.

463
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,240
It's fine.

464
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,120
Enjoy your milk tea.

465
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
I'll help you check your computer.

466
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,320
Do you have wet wipes?

467
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
Could you please get me some?

468
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:43,920
Sure.

469
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Thanks.

470
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,640
Does Jin Xiaoyu...

471
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,760
have a crush on me?

472
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,320
You know?

473
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,600
When he saw Dr. Tan,

474
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,400
she was so agitated.

475
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,200
I don't know why
you're so confident about yourself.

476
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,960
When Nuwa made humans,

477
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,240
did she blow extra air into you?

478
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,320
Tan Yueran said it before, right?

479
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,480
They've met before,

480
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,360
so it must be something from then.

481
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,120
Otherwise Xiaoyu wouldn't be so unfriendly.

482
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,480
If I'd known earlier,

483
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,080
I wouldn't have suggested the idea.

484
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,560
Why?

485
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,880
Don't you get it?

486
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,720
It's like men

487
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,440
are more likely to detect
an unfaithful man.

488
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,080
Girls know girls

489
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,960
better than we do.

490
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,400
Since Xiaoyu dislikes her so much,

491
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,520
she must not be a good person.

492
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,440
What crap are you spouting?

493
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,480
What do you know?

494
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm telling you,

495
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,360
it's just because she saw me hook up with a pretty PhD,

496
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,120
she... I'm telling you...

497
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,480
I'm off.

498
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,440
You keep working overtime here.

499
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
You fool!

500
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,520
I've got no time to entertain you.

501
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,160
I'm going to bed after two
rounds of game.

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Is something wrong with the embalming solution?

511
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,680
Not the solution.

512
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,320
Something is wrong with the body.

513
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,560

The cause of his death is suspicious!

516
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,840
You scared me.

517
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,640
I thought they sent the wrong body.

518
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,640
His family sent the body over.

519
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,680
The police checked.

520
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,680
It was delivered after
all things got checked.

521
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,480
Also, yesterday,

522
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,280
the legal examiner had
an autopsy done.

523
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,800
The body has a change today.

524
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,800
What did he die of?

525
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,040
Hypoglycemia due to starvation.

526
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,600
Does anyone starve to death nowadays?

527
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,360
And look at the cyanosis on the body.

528
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,080
It shows that he died of
cardiac failure.

529
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,520
How could he die of starvation?

530
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,080
We asked his family

531
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,960
at the registration.

532
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,880
He studied in another city.

533
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,480
He lived in a rented apartment alone

534
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
playing games all day

535
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,880
without eating and sleeping.

536
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,720
It was a sudden death.

537
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,040
And he died

538
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,240
on the computer table

539
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,080
leaving the game on.

540
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,920
Okay, let me ask you.

541
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,520
What are the clinical features
of hypoglycemia?

542
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:19,920
I...

543
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,200
I returned all that to my teacher
after finishing the exam.

544
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,160
Palpitation. Panic. Cold limbs.

545
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,480
Chronic hypoglycemia

546
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,760
causes cerebral atrophy

547
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,760
and mental breakdown,

548
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,440
and seizure as a complication.

549
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,240
Look here.

550
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,680
The muscle on the corners of his
eyes and corners of his mouth

551
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,560
is asymmetric.

552
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,120
His lips were bitten.

553
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,000
He couldn't have bitten

554
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,160
his lips during eating.

555
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,200
And this person

556
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,920
might have facial paralysis
when he was alive.

557
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,400
I suspect

558
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,320
when he was alive,

559
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,400
he had epilepsy.

560
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,360
And what?

561
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,240
And

562
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,160
a young epilepsy patient

563
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,120
who played game like crazy

564
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,160
without hand tremor,

565
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,480
palpitation, or a seizure attack,

566
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,840
and he died of hypoglycemia.

567
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,240
Under normal circumstances,

568
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
before hypoglycemia,

569
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,920
he should have had
a seizure attack.

570
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:57,880
This man

571
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,360
clearly

572
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,800
died in his own house.

573
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,560
The police have confirmed that.

574
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,320
You...

575
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,480
Do you think you're Detective Conan?

576
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,360
All right, just do your job.

577
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,080
Don't waste time.

578
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,760
Cremation is on tomorrow morning.

579
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,880
How much left?

580
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,080
Look at this,

581
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,400
there are so many unfinished tasks.

582
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
What are you doing now?

583
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,600
Check the body.

584
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,880
The body doesn't feel right.

585
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,160
The muscle is too elastic.

586
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,640
It's similar to the one who

587
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,680
died in a bus accident.

588
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,920
I think two days later,

589
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,920
the cyanosis on his nails
will be clearer.

590
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,400
Another two days?

591
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,560
Impossible.

592
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,480
The cremation is on tomorrow morning.

593
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,960
I'll figure out a way, okay?

594
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,360
Quanzhan.

595
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,800
I think I saw

596
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
the doctor at the door.

597
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,120
Hey, you...

598
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,360
Why is she here again?

599
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,240
It's so nice of you

600
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,480
to buy me milk tea every time.

601
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,480
Thank you for
gathering the information,

602
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,880
and talking with me every evening.

603
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,040
Please sit.

604
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,280
We're just learning from each other, aren't we?

605
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,720
Jin Xiaoyu isn't around?

606
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,040
She's in the makeup room.

607
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:03,920
She's got work to do.

608
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,560
She does makeup on dead bodies, right?

609
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,360
Yes.

610
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,480
She's a core technician here.

611
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,720
When it comes to makeup,

612
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,360
girls are better at it.

613
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,640
Not many girls

614
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,680
work here,

615
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,240
so it's extremely difficult

616
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,000
for us to find a girlfriend.

617
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,160
You can go to arranged dates.

618
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,920
Still difficult.

619
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,360
Even our colleagues at the cemetery

620
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,120
can't find a partner,

621
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,960
much less us,

622
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,120
who work with dead bodies.

623
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,840
At lease you won't

624
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,880
lose your job,

625
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,680
and I heard you have good benefits.

626
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,560
If a girl dates me for benefits,

627
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,320
is she even genuine about the relationship?

628
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,320
That's true.

629
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,880
Don't feel down.

630
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,360
You're warm-hearted

631
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,200
and nice.

632
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
I'm sure you'll meet a good girl.

633
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,800
Here, drink the milk tea.

634
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,320
Then,

635
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,920
are you such a girl?

636
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,800
Actually,

637
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,440
I think...

638
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,360
Jin Xiaoyu,

639
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,800
which grave did you jump out from?

640
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,680
From your ancestor's grave.

641
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,720
Can't you see I'm here with a guest?

642
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,560
Go, go, go!

643
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,120
Tan Yueran,

644
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,720
I tell you what,

645
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,360
don't you think I don't know

646
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,200
what you came here for.

647
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,640
Jin Xiaoyu, what do you want?

648
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,480
I didn't tell him anything

649
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
because he thinks you're a good girl.

650
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
We barely know each other,

651
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,080
but if you dare to hurt his feelings,

652
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,920
I'll break you.

653
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,360
What are you doing?

654
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,480
Are you sure you don't
have a crush on me?

655
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,040
What are you doing?

656
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,720
Starting an open war?

657
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,480
Zhang Quanzhan,

658
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,880
what's wrong with your brain?

659
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,720
Stop fighting. Stop fighting.

660
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,160
I tell you what.

661
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,400
If you hurt his feelings,
I swear I'll break you.

662
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,080
Get out of here now.

663
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,680
Can you wake up?

664
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,680
Can't you shut up?

665
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,680
Let me go!

666
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,660
(Hongde Hall)

667
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,880
He won't listen to
a single word that you say.

668
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,640
Don't you understand?

669
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,720
In any case,

670
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,160
what does he have that is worth scamming from him?

671
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
At most only his feelings will be cheated.

672
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
As long as it's not about money, it's all fine.

673
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,760
Don't you know this?

674
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,400
If a girl doesn't like you,

675
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,640
she'll call you a good guy.

676
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,920
If not,

677
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,120
she'll call you a bad guy.

678
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,320
She just called him

679
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,400
a warm-hearted nice guy.

680
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,800
Don't you understand what it means?

681
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,120
It just goes to show,

682
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,040
being a good guy isn't
necessarily a good thing.

683
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll relay what you said to Xiaoxi.

684
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
No, no, no. Please don't.

685
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,080
You're good at snitching, huh?

686
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,400
All right, I'll give you 20 Yuan
as hush money.

687
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,520
- Good enough?
- 20?

688
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,000
Only 20?

689
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,080
50.

690
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,400
Fine.

691
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,520
I'll give you 50.

692
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,640
One more thing.

693
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,720
Xiaoxi is choosing her
wedding dress these days.

694
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,400
If she asks you

695
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,160
which one is better,

696
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,040
don't mention the expensive one.

697
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,360
Oh my god,

698
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,720
you're so cheap.

699
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
The wedding is the highlight

700
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,200
in a girl's life,

701
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,880
you know?

702
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,720
But if all the money is
spent on the wedding,

703
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,000
how do we live our future life?

704
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
It doesn't need to be too cheap.

705
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
Middle-grade is fine.

706
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,280
Unbelievable.

707
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,200
It makes me feel so, so, awful

708
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,560
to make money from such a dirty guy like you.

709
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,560
All right,

710
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll put an extra 50.

711
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,400
100.

712
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,680
- Good enough?
- So generous!

713
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,960
You've got long-term thinking.

714
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,240
Xiaoxi has found the right man.

715
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,200
Wish you a happy marriage. Bye-bye.

716
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
I've transferred the money.

717
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,640
Take it seriously!

718
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,600
I'm counting on you!

719
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,880
What?

720
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,960
I'd like to ask you a question.

721
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,480
If you want me to teach you
how to flirt with a boy,

722
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,360
I can't.

723
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,280
Because I'm handsome.

724
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,520
I'm always the one
being flirted with.

725
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,640
- I'm always...
- No.

726
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,040
What then?

727
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
Yes, I know everything,

728
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,400
but some is inborn talent,

729
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,200
which cannot be taught.

730
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,840
I'd like to ask you

731
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,800
how to let a man be aware

732
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,840
of the ill intent

733
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,960
of the girl who approached him.

734
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,680
I'll ask you a question instead.

735
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,160
Do you think a girl can't

736
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,160
tell whether a guy is a jerk?

737
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,480
I think we can.

738
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
We just don't like to admit it.

739
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,160
That's it then.

740
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,080
It's the same for boys.

741
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:02,960
Look,

742
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
the reason why people meet two-timers

743
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,640
is that there're too few choices.

744
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
Not me, though.

745
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
I've got too many options.

746
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,520
So I don't have these kinds of troubles.

747
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,000
Before I get tricked,

748
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,040
the next one is already available.

749
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,560
Now I get it.

750
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,800
Quanzhan has been tricked by Tan Yueran

751
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,520
because he has too few options.

752
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,400
Indeed.

753
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,040
Have you heard

754
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,000
ten-thousand-hour principle?

755
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,960
It works the same
when having a relationship.

756
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,880
Practice makes perfect.

757
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,800
Mr. William.

758
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,960
Mr. William.

759
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,600
What are you writing?

760
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,360
Here.

761
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,360
People live

762
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,200
because they can't die right away.

763
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,360
So they need something

764
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,440
to fill up the time.

765
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:44,800
Yes.

766
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,640
Including work, entertainment, love

767
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
and family.

768
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,120
Yes.

769
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,160
Is this a novel?

770
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:52,880
It seems so profound.

771
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,560
This is a serial story I'm writing.

772
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,160
I'm a good-looking,

773
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
talented man.

774
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,240
What's it about?

775
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,080
An undead man with immortality

776
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,040
meets a girl who has a fatal disease.

777
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,720
In the last year of this girl's life,

778
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,480
they meet each other.

779
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,960
That's me and Jiang Baiju.

780
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:10,880
All resemblances

781
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,800
are coincidental.

782
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,120
No way it's coincidental.

783
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,680
- I want my payment of royalty.
- I wrote it myself.

784
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,680
Let me have a look.

785
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,880
"Too Long A Man

786
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,640
and Too Short A Girl"...

787
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,560
What does this title mean?

788
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,280
Too long a life-span, and a short one.

789
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,400
Don't get it wrong.

790
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,320
Your title is misleading, okay?

791
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,120
Misleading how?

792
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,560
"Moistened Love", what is it?

793
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,400
It's a swimmer's story.

794
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,200
It's very passionate.

795
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Very inspirational.

796
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,080
W-What about that?

797
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,960
"A No-Man Village".

798
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,320
It's a story about a college student

799
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,880
leading the villagers to start up
businesses and make money.

800
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,800
Aren't you worried that you'll get caught?

801
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
Mr. Mo Yan has a book named

802
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,480
"Big Breasts and Wide Hips".

803
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,120
Have you read it before?

804
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,680
Don't interfere with a writer's career.

805
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,320
Do your cooking, chef.

806
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Aren't you a highbrow?

807
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,840
Highbrow, indeed.

808
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,240
No.

809
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:01,640
What?

810
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,160
You're on duty today.

811
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,040
Why must I cook?

812
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:04,960
Jin Xiaoyu,

813
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,000
would you dare to eat
the dishes that I make?

814
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,440
No.

815
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,280
Wait.

816
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,120
I can add a supporting role

817
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,560
who's obsessed with you

818
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,360
into my novel as you requested.

819
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,480
He cares about you.

820
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,240
He's faithful to you.

821
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,000
Really?

822
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,080
I want a long-legged,

823
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,040
lean,

824
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,840
but muscular guy.

825
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,760
No nude scenes in my novels.

826
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,600
Why?

827
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,560
A-At least a warm-hearted boy

828
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,280
who keeps animals.

829
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,800
Okay.

830
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,360
How about a guy who cooks animals?

831
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,400
No.

832
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,440
He must own a cat

833
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,600
with a warm smile

834
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,920
and wears white turtleneck sweater.

835
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,760
And...

836
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,480
What is this?

837
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,000
What's wrong with
your understanding

838
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,160
of male fashion?

839
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
If you keep objecting, I won't cook.

840
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Then I'll add

841
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,880
a black turtleneck guy for you.

842
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,680
Good boy.

843
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,160
Interfere with my writer's freedom.

844
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,380
(WeChat
Tan Yueran)

845
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,380
(Are you awake?)

846
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,720
Are you such a girl?

847
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,480
Jin Xiaoyu,

848
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,920
why are you such a jerk?

849
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,800
Why did you have to come in
at that time

850
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,760
to ruin the moment?

851
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,380
(Got a minute? You there? Are you awake?)

852
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,200
Quanzhan, wake up.

853
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,760
Quanzhan.

854
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,080
Quanzhan.

855
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,680
Quanzhan.

856
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,280
What?

857
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,920
You're still alive...

858
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,720
But my heart is broken.

859
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,120
You can speak, then you're fine.

860
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,360
Get up now.

861
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,360
It's 9:00 a.m.

862
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,520
Master will scold you.

863
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,360
Get up, quickly.

864
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,560
We've got much to do today.

865
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,160
I tell you what,

866
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,840
I won't work overtime tonight.

867
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,020
(Peach Blossoms Fade with the Water Flow
Bright Moon, Gentle Breeze, Where to Go)

868
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,840
Master.

869
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,000
What's the matter with Zhang Quanzhan?

870
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,200
He seems down-spirited.

871
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,960
He's lovesick.

872
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,280
Love is nonsense.

873
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,880
Everybody says they found love.

874
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,800
Who really did?

875
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,680
Master,

876
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,400
you're like a philosopher.

877
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,240
What do we do?

878
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,080
What do we do?

879
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,080
A man who's

880
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,840
abandoned everything because of love
is an embarrassment.

881
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Give this to Xiaoyu.

882
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,880
Don't tell her it was me, though.

883
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,200
What's this?

884
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,120
What?

885
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,240
Pajamas.

886
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,400
Just give it to her.

887
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,360
Don't be nosy.

888
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,440
Ask Pingping to do it.

889
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,840
Or Xiaoxi.

890
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,800
Why did you buy

891
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,080
her a set of pajamas?

892
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,160
Never you mind.

893
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,040
Just do as I say.

894
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,840
Got it?

895
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,600
Don't tell her it was me.

896
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,240
W-What's this all about?

897
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,920
You're saying Cai Miao was the donor?

898
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,480
Yeah.

899
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Two years ago, on the New Year's Day,

900
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,640
Cai Miao died in a car accident.

901
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,800
I was the doctor.

902
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,760
Her parents were there, too.

903
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
I did the donation inquiry

904
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,280
with them.

905
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,040
Fu Liang was there, too.

906
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,080
It was Fu Liang who helped me

907
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,120
convince her parents.

908
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,640
Afterwards, Chief Zhou personally

909
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,200
transplanted the heart.

910
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,800
After I delivered the heart,

911
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,640
I left.

912
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,640
I didn't pay attention to

913
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,040
the recipient's name.

914
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,600
I just remember she had a PhD.

915
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,040
What does she want?

916
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,000
Actually,

917
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,560
it's normal that the recipient gets

918
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,720
curious about the origin of the organ.

919
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,440
But it's very rare to see

920
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,440
someone as obsessed as her.

921
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Did you tell Chief Zhou?

922
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,560
I did.

923
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,160
But her approaching your senior colleague

924
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,320
doesn't mean anything.

925
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,920
We need more evidence.

926
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,120
And even if we do,

927
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
it's not like we can catch her.

928
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,000
How about we let Fu Liang know?

929
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,040
We can't.

930
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,400
Technically,

931
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,480
we don't know

932
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,000
if she has reached out to Fu Liang or not.

933
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,760
And once Fu Liang knows,

934
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,680
to me,

935
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,680
it's violation of rules.

936
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,000
No wonder Tan Yueran

937
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,080
wouldn't stop harassing Quanzhan.

938
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,320
And she's now gone

939
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,200
only after two days.

940
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,320
I don't know what she's up to.

941
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,240
I guess she harassed him

942
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,080
because she was after something.

943
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,680
And now, she suddenly doesn't speak to him.

944
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,800
There are two possibilities.

945
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,000
One, she realizes she can't get
the stuff she wants

946
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,160
from Zhang Quanzhan.

947
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,960
Two,

948
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,800
she might have found it.

949
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,600
How about I

950
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,080
speak to Chief Zhou later?

951
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,180
(Three years ago)

952
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,080
Sir, I want a cup of hot drink.

953
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Wukong,
(*Here's a joke of salutions of Journey to the West)

954
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,280
I'm off work.

955
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,640
Can you please get me a cup of hot water?

956
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,880
What about milk?

957
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,680
Sure. Thanks.

958
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,400
How much?

959
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,000
The machine was just turned off.

960
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,960
I can't be bothered to turn it back on.

961
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,160
It's my treat.

962
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,520
Thank you.

963
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,240
Sir.

964
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:35,300
(Closed)

965
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,920
It's cold outside.

966
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,240
Come eat inside.

967
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,160
I'm eating river snail rice noodles.

968
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,080
It stinks.

969
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,360
It's fine. Come on.

970
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,560
The smell is too strong.

971
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,920
Your store would be full of the smell

972
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,400
tomorrow morning.

973
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,200
Tomorrow, I'll

974
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
tell them that

975
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,720
the toilet is clogged.

976
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,120
I'll ask them to use more air freshener.

977
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,440
It's warm inside.

978
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,240
It's better than the outdoors.

979
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,400
Also,

980
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,400
you're so stinky.

981
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
There's no way I would do anything to you.

982
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,840
All right.

983
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,000
Come on.

984
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,920
I'll leave right after I finish.

985
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,760
Here.

986
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:26,920
Warm yourself up.

987
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,400
Are you an angel, sir?

988
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,760
I'm not an angel.

989
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,440
I'm a considerate guy.

990
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,720
Just eat.

991
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,760
It stinks like hell.

992
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,120
Thank you.

993
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,120
Are you a student?

994
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,720
Why don't you go home at late night?

995
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm not a student.

996
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,520
I'm a scriptwriter.

997
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm a rookie, though.

998
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,120
I write low-budget commercials

999
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,160
or short scripts.

1000
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,160
Do scriptwriters not go home when it's so late?

1001
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,920
Isn't it nicer to order takeout at home?

1002
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,080
I just finished a meeting in the company.

1003
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,240
We had meetings all day long,

1004
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,280
and I only ate one meal.

1005
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,400
It was close to the midnight snack time,

1006
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,200
then the meeting was over.

1007
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,320
I was nearly starved to death

1008
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
and my phone was dead.

1009
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,360
I only had less than 20 Yuan on me,

1010
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,200
so I thought I could eat some noodles

1011
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,160
before I take a walk home.

1012
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,760
So you never

1013
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,120
intended to pay me.

1014
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,360
I have money.

1015
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
In my phone.

1016
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,200
I thought

1017
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,640
if you asked me for money,

1018
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,920
I can then ask to borrow a charger from you.

1019
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,640
But you didn't,

1020
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,720
so my plan felt through.

1021
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,000
All right.

1022
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,920
Give me your phone.

1023
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,520
I'll help you charge it.

1024
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,160
Thank you, sir.

1025
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,800
When you go out,

1026
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,480
you should at least
take 100 cash with you, right?

1027
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,040
No one takes so little cash with them.

(Portable Charger)
Also,

1029
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,040
I've got portable chargers here,

1030
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,520
you could've borrowed one.

1031
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
My cell-phone was dead, remember?

1032
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,800
How do I scan the QR code?

1033
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,920
I need to scan the QR code

1034
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,000
to get a portable charger.

1035
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,760
If my cell-phone hadn't been dead,

1036
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,520
I would've ordered a cab home.

1037
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,720
It seems like a bug to me.

1038
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,320
You're right.

1039
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,550
But you could ask your colleagues

1040
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,200
to help you order a cab.

1041
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,720
You're a scriptwriter,

1042
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,200
you should be smarter.

1043
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,280
I was dying to escape from that place!

1044
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,080
I didn't want to spend one more minute

1045
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,320
in the client's company.

1046
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,360
That bad?

1047
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,080
You know what?

1048
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,600
The senior writer and I

1049
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,080
took a TV show job.

1050
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,880
The client's way too imaginative.

1051
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,200
They wanted the female lead
to regain her youth

1052
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,760
and have double personalities.

1053
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,400
And the male lead has to

1054
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,200
have a mysterious birth.

1055
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,840
It's supposed to suspense drama
in which they cultivate into immortals.

1056
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,000
It sounds brilliant.

1057
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,600
I'm actually interested in watching.

1058
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,880
You like this genre?

1059
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,000
It is quite awesome.

1060
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:04,080
(Now)

1061
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,920
Please come again.

1062
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,280
Sure.

Sir, a cup of hot drink, please.

1065
