00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,280
This way.

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,760
Okay.

They're going up to the second floor.

They're on the second floor.

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,120
Well?

32
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,320
It's good.

33
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Isn't it better than the one you just wore?

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,960
The shoes don't look good.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,320
Try another pair of shoes later.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,160
Look at the way I'm wearing it.

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
I've tucked my shirt in.

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,760
Do I look like a celebrity?

39
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Celebrities wear it this way for events

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,120
and magazine shoots.

41
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,120
It stands out too much

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,200
and isn't practical

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,920
in real life.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,720
It also makes you seem so pretentious.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,520
Isn't it better to have it out?

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,600
Hello.

47
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,480
I'll take this dress.

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,360
Okay, sir.

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,800
No, no, no.

50
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,520
I just have a year left.

51
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,600
There's no use getting new clothes.

52
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,640
There's no need to buy it for me, really.

53
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,320
It's okay.

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,320
It's not very expensive.

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,960
Consider it as your hard-earned money.

56
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,640
Okay.

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,600
I'll buy you something, too.

58
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,600
This one is nice.

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Why are you giving me this?

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,960
I don't like scarves.

61
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,480
Don't move. Don't move.

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,280
- That's it.
- I don't like

63
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,440
- the scarf.
- That's it.

64
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,080
It doesn't have...

65
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,720
Wear it.

66
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,120
It's cool to make poses with it.

67
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
Posing is disgustful.

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,640
Forget it.

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,360
Change your clothes.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,600
Oh.

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,040
Oh.

72
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,520
The color of that scarf isn't that good.

73
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,520
Remember to buy blue ones and white ones.

74
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,540
(Bingo)

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,040
Hello.

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,680
This is the latest style in our store.

77
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,920
See if there is anything you like.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,920
I'll introduce it to you.

79
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,080
Okay.

80
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
This is a fish, right?

81
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,800
Yes, it is.

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
Let me show it to you.

83
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,520
Sir, you have good taste.

84
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,200
This is a limited edition.

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,760
It's a small fish like me.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,440
Yes, it is.

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,680
You're a gold fish.

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,720
It's a silver fish.

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,480
(Lukfook Jewellery)
You both have a poor memory.

90
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,880
Let's see.

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,720
How is it?

92
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,440
It really suits you.

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,000
Is it?

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,240
You look gorgeous.

95
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,400
Not bad, right?

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah.

97
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,360
Let's go with this one.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,280
What?

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,960
No, no, no. Sorry.

100
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I can't accept such an expensive gift.

101
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,800
Listen to me.

102
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,320
This would be

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,680
a gift for your funeral.

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,440
Sir, this way please.

105
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,400
This is too much.

106
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,620
(Bingo)

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,760
Thank you.

108
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,400
Thank you,

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,760
for taking me out to dinner and shopping.

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,280
Life without work

111
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,400
is so corrupting.

112
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
It makes me want to become a degenerate.

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,280
In fact, you

114
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
don't have the right

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,600
to become a degenerate.

116
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,560
Can you say something pleasing during dinner?

117
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
But you're dying.

118
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,280
Should I lie to you?

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,920
Don't.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
I'd like to die with a smile on my face.

121
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,200
I don't think you're a person
who likes to be lied to.

122
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,640
But I think you're a person who likes to lie.

123
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:02,960
Come.

124
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,840
One day you will tell me your name, right?

125
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,320
Which one do you want to know?

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,280
Your original name.

127
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,560
Your real name.

128
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,120
My real name.

129
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
What were you like

130
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,000
at first?

131
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,320
I forgot.

132
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Come.

133
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,820
(Bingo)

134
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,080
Qian.

135
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
They've finished eating.

136
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,640
The girl took Jiang Baiju's glass away.

137
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Why did she take it?

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,360
Are you stupid?

139
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
The young master's saliva is on that glass.

140
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,200
Stop her.

141
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,160
There's no need to make a fuss.

142
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,480
I'll take care of the rest.

143
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,120
Where are you taking me?

144
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
(Blood Donation)

145
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,840
Let's go on the carousel.

146
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,560
It'll be fun.

147
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,880
Let's go.

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,320
Why do you want to ride this thing here?

149
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,080
Because it's fun.

150
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,320
You're riding a carousel in a mall.

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,640
This is not a theme park.

152
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,440
Yes.

153
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
It's fresh to me.

154
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,320
I'll go in for a bit.

155
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,120
Qian.

156
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
I saw her get on the blood collection bus.

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,080
That belongs to the blood center
of the Health Bureau.

158
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll follow her and take a look.

159
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,260
(Blood Collection Area)

160
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,680
Doctor.

161
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,040
What? What's wrong?

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,360
I want to

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:31,640
donate blood.

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,520
What's wrong?

165
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,640
I think I saw a friend.

166
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,680
Are you sure it's this place?

167
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,560
This is it.

168
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,960
Don't move.

169
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:41,960
Your acquaintances?

170
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,920
Don't talk. Don't talk.

171
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,080
A friend of one of my friends, you know?

172
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,880
Do they know about Yu?

173
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,360
I've told them.

174

I've had someone look at her medical records.

272
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,640
It's a very strange chart.

273

It has all sorts of symptoms.

274
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,480
And they are conflicting too.

Several doctors

said this person should have
died a long time ago.

277
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,000
I looked into her consultations in the city.

278
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,320
There are some discrepancies

279
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,800
between those medical records and this one.

280
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,120
I suspect there's something wrong
with the medical records she gave us.

281
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,080
That's right, Young Master.

282

Are you sure you want to keep her alive?

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
Although she can stop your mutation,

284
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,840
she can't cure you.

285

If she dies one day,

289
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,600
it'll be harder for you.

290
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,840
I agree.

291
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,680
Even if we want to investigate,
we can do it secretly.

292
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,840
You can't let her stay by your side.

293

00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,160
All right, tell me.

357
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,200
Why did you ask for me?

358
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,720
I just wanted to listen to some oldies with you.

359
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,440
You're kidding.

360
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,120
I only have one day off.

361
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,680
Yet you want me to come here
in the middle of the day to listen to songs?

362
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,280
Then what?

363
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,240
We can also have dinner together.

364
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,920
No.

365
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,280
You're so strange.

366
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,000
Your time will stop in a year.

367
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,240
My time will never end.

368
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,160
But we'll both be young forever.

369
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
He's so strange.

370
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,440
Don't think about the alien.

371
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,560
Come back and have some delicious food.

372
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,560
I'll be right back to pick you up.

373
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,760
Watch out!

374
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,880
Young Master.

375
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,680
Are you okay?

376
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,200
Jiang Baiju.

377
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,880
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

378
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,920
Do you need to go to the hospital?

379
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,600
Let's go now.

380
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,200
You must have broken a bone.

381
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:17,880
Let's go to the hospital.

382
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,680
It's just flesh wounds.

383
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:19,880
It's okay.

384
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,280
Cheng, are you okay?

385
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,040
It's you again.

386
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,040
The chandelier fell on you.

387
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,920
You should really go to the hospital.

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
I know if

389
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm okay.

390
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,160
It's all because of you.

391
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
Calm down.

392
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,120
By the way,

393
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,280
there are guests downstairs.

394
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll go greet them.

395
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,960
William.

396
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,040
I'll leave this to you.

397
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,800
Miss.

398
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,360
There's medicine in the bar.

399
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,080
Go take it.

400
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,720
Oh.

401
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,640
Okay.

402
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,240
Young Master.

403
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,480
What happened to them?

404
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,320
Didn't you hear Qian Tu

405
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,480
just called me by my full name?

406
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,840
Then Jin Xiaoyu would have heard it, right?

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,840
That's what I said.

408
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
No, William will help me.

409
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:03,720
Thank you.

410
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,400
I'll do it.

411
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,040
You have to go to the hospital.

412
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,720
Get out and wait for me.

413
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,920
No, you got hurt saving my life.

414
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm not going anywhere.

415
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,000
I need to change my pants and dress my wound.
Do you want to see that?

416
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,280
President Zhang.

417
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,680
(Qing'ai Group)
Mr. Qian Tu.

418
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,360
It's a pleasure to meet you.

419
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,000
Nice to meet you.

420
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,240
I heard that Mr. Zhang was here.

421
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,360
So I came to join in on the fun.

422
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,080
You don't mind, right?

423
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,800
It would be great to have you with us.

424
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,920
Let me make the introductions.

425
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,240
This is the head of our collaborative lab.

426
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,760
Lin Nuoyan.

427
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,360
How are you?

428
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,200
How are you?

429
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,840
I guess I don't need to introduce this person.

430
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,760
Our Vice President.

431
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,920
He's an old friend.

432
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,480
Qian Cheng has something to deal with today.

433
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,840
I'll take care of you.

434
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,600
Okay.

435
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:41,640
- This way, please.
- This way, please

436
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:42,640
After you.

437
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,160
You must've broken a bone.

438
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,120
Let's go to the hospital.

439
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,320
I said there is no need.

440
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,840
But the chandelier, your hand...

441
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,760
Thank you

442
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,520
for saving me again.

443
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,200
I remembered what I was going to ask you.

444
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:20,800
What?

445
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,480
At first it was one thing.

446
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,240
Then it became two things.

447
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,080
What is it?

448
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,280
First,

449
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,960
who are you working for?

450
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:32,960
Second,

451
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,800
this chandelier thing today
was an accident, right?

452
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,960
Are you saying I made the chandelier fall?

453
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
When you were dating me,

454
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,760
didn't you want to take my sample?

455
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,480
Yes, but...

456
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,880
Were you going to collect my blood today?

457
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,400
But I didn't have anything
to do with the chandelier.

458
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,560
Who are you working for?

459
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:50,920
Myself.

460
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,880
I want to know who you are.

461
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,760
You said you didn't want to know before.

462
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,120
Now you're curious?

463
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
I thought you were the one who saved me.

464
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,800
But I don't believe it now.

465
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,480
I found out about something.

466
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
On the day of the accident,

467
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,480
you talked to that madman

468
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,240
in the back, right?

469
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,080
And then you were investigating that madman.

470
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
Can you say

471
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
you have nothing to do with it?

472
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,840
Silence is consent.

473
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
Jin Xiaoyu.

474
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,160
You act like a harmless person.

475
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
But behind my back, you set me up.

476
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
Jiang Baiju, you're the same.

477
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,760
You seem carefree.

478
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,240
But behind the scenes,
you're plotting against everyone.

479
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,880
There were two murderers on the bus that day.

480
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,280
One of them was the madman.

481
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,640
The other was you who made the madman go nuts.

482
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,200
Good.

483
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,240
Now that everything is out,

484
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,120
let's talk about it.

485
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,640
The medical records you gave me were fake, right?

486
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,000
Yes.

487
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's a lot of inconsistencies.

488
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,680
You never wanted me to treat you
from the very beginning.

489
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,080
Right?

490
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,360
Because I didn't believe you.

491
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,040
How could I possibly

492
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,080
show you all my cards?

493
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,480
You've got a lot of sly ideas.

494
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,440
I'm dying anyway.

495
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,800
When a monster endangers public safety,

496
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,920
I should have called the police.

497
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,360
But the police didn't believe me

498
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,440
because you had dealt
with the surveillance tape.

499
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,640
So I had to come here to see

500
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,640
what you really wanted.

501
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,720
You mentioned

502
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
a banned drug that's sold on the darknet.

503
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,760
Is it true?

504
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
I doubt it's true.

505
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,080
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

506
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,520
You asked me that the first time.

507
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,720
If you wanted to kill me,

508
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,200
you would have done that in the elevator.

509
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,600
I'm still useful to you.

510
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,320
Right?

511
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,440
Why would you want to hurt others?

512
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,080
I wasn't trying to hurt anyone.

513
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,440
It was really just an accident.

514
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,720
Okay.

515
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,520
Take off the mask of warm and fuzzy capitalism.

516
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,320
Tell me.

517
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,280
What do you want?

518
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,280
What do you want?

519
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
What do the people behind you want?

520
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,280
I don't want anything.

521
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,840
I just want world peace.

522
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,320
Life on Earth is fragile.

523
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,840
If you try to create trouble,

524
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,160
I'll cause you trouble.

525
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,800
You?

526
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,240
You're dying.

527
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,440
And you care about the Earth?

528
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
I do.

529
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
I care about my family.

530
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,160
If you can hurt me,

531
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
you can hurt my family too.

532
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,360
Let me repeat myself.

533
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,160
It was an accident.

534
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,920
Let me repeat myself

535
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,960
I don't believe you.

536
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,240
I've seen it with my own eyes.

537
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,880
You put innocent people in danger.

538
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,080
It was William and Qian Cheng

539
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,520
who attacked me that night, right?

540
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,880
I could smell the perfume on them.

541
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,240
The three of you set me up

542
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,440
to gain my trust, right?

543
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,680
You think you're worthy?

544
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,920
What do you think you have
that deserves our effort?

545
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,600
Are you pretty?

546
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,240
Wealthy?

547
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,200
As you just said,

548
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,640
I work for someone.

549
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,200
If I'm not wrong,

550
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
they should already be investigating you.

551
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,000
You are afraid that I am one of them.

552
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,840
Take this broken chandelier

553
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,960
to the basement storage.

554
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Remember, nothing should be left behind.

555
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,320
Got it?

556
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,840
Yes, sir.

557
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,560
Go on.

558
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:36,920
Did you take your medicine?

559
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm not in pain.

560
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,440
I'm talking about mood control pills.

561
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,320
I took them.

562
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,760
Good.

563
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
Luckily your brother came

564
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,080
and handled Mr. Zhang and the others.

565
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
I told you we can't keep this girl alive.

566
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,960
Look at this mess.

567
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,800
I don't think what happened today
was an accident.

568
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
Of course it's not an accident.

569
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,720
Did Jin Xiaoyu and Young Master say anything?

570
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,520
How do I know?

571
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,440
Don't you know the young master really well?

572
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,600
Don't you know the young master really well?

573
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,480
It seems that the young master's

574
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,920
left and right-hand men
are not seeing eye to eye today.

575
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,800
That's right.

576
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,320
I can stop tracking down the people behind you.

577
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,000
I can kill you and the people behind you.

578
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,560
Do you believe me?

579
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,640
I've already thought of it.

580
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,040
I wanted to run away long ago

581
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,640
when I knew you were a murderer.

582
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,560
But I didn't

583
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,600
because I knew you would never let me go.

584
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,760
So I thought of a way.

585
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,280
I took a lot of photos and videos of you

586
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,760
when I was working with you overtime.

587
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
They are all on my computer.

588
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
I also wrote a suicide note

589
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,600
set to be sent on a certain time.

590
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,480
If I die,

591
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,560
my death, your story,

592
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,120
will be sent to many people.

593
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,400
All the major video media outlets
and news outlets.

594
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,560
I believe many people

595
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,000
will be interested in this.

596
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,760
I really underestimated you.

597
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,840
I doubt it.

598
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,280
Didn't you steal all the samples back?

599
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,280
Come.

600
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,440
Let's each take a step back.

601
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:03,960
Okay.

602
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
Back to when we were strangers.

603
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,840
Okay?

604
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,520
How can you guarantee that?

605
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,080
You must have looked into my background

606
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,840
and know about my family and friends.

607
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,760
That's my weakness.

608
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,520
I have proof of your existence.

609
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,480
That's your weakness.

610
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,720
Let's each take a step back.

611
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,160
You don't harass my family.

612
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,880
I will not disclose this evidence.

613
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,280
Let's go separate ways.

614
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,120
Let's go back to our own homes.

615
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:23,960
See you later.

616
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,600
Why didn't I just let the chandelier kill you?

617
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,440
Wait.

618
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,920
If he wanted me to die,

619
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,080
why didn't he let the chandelier kill me?

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Don't be reckless with your life.

681
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
Why do you want to take down the machine
just after waking up?

682
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
Another hour of operation at most.

683
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,520
Also thanks to Jin Xiaoyu

684
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,880
for making it possible
for us to train the team again

685
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,160
so that our interns could observe on site.

686
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,320
You flatter me.

687
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,600
I am the one that should be thanking you guys.

688
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,960
You have to rescue me again next time.

689
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,000
Thank you. Thank you.

690
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,640
Thank you all.

691
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,160
- Hello, Master Ge.
- Thank you for your hard work.

692
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,120
Thank you all.

693
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Since Master Ge is here,

694
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,400
we'll go.

695
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Good.

696
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,800
Have a good rest.

697
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,640
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

698
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,720
- Thank you, thank you.
- Bye.

699
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,800
Thank you.

700
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,760
Yu, how are you feeling?

701
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,360
Master.

702
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,040
Do you feel better?

703
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,640
You know how I am,

704
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,280
as long as I don't die
on the resuscitation table,

705
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,720
I'll be in great spirits the next day.

706
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,880
You always push yourself too hard.

707
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,040
From now on,

708
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,920
you really need to take care of your health.

709
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,280
Well.

710
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,400
I mean.

711
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,400
What kind of doctor are you?

712
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,000
Get up.

713
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,760
Master.

714
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,360
She didn't sleep much all night

715
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,600
because she was trying to save me.

716
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Please let her sleep.

717
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
She's exhausted.

718
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:56,920
Young Master.

719
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,720
Have you always looked this good?

720
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
I can't increase your allowance anymore.

721
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,840
Let's move on to the next topic.

722
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,640
The next topic is about Jin Xiaoyu.

723
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,400
She was admitted to the emergency department.

724
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,200
Did her illness act up?

725
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes.

726
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,120
Was it serious?

727
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,200
Not really.

728
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,040
But

729
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,640
her illness

730
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,160
comes and

731
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,840
goes quickly.

732
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,040
The most important thing is,

733
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,800
she has many friends.

734
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,640
The doctors in the hospital who were free,

735
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,520
all went to visit her.

736
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,360
She?

737
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,720
She can be very sweet

738
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,000
when she wants to.

739
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,080
Young Master.

740
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,240
How do you know she is sweet?

741
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,040
You've tasted it?

742
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm kidding.

743
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,720
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

744
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,720
Just kidding. Just kidding.

745
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,320
Just kidding. Just kidding.

746
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,040
Are you crazy?

747
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,240
Do you know what time it is?

748
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,520
Why are you boxing in the middle of the night?

749
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,480
I'm under a lot of pressure.

750
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,720
If you're stressed, take your medicine.

751
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,680
Why is the bottle empty?

752
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,880
I took them all.

753
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
You took them all?

754
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,720
Are you mad?

755
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,000
I am mad.

756
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,920
What are you yelling at me for?

757
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,440
Oh no.

758
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,720
Everyone in this household has gone crazy.

759
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,120
Jin Xiaoyu was hospitalized.

760
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,200
The young master tried to drown himself.

761
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,720
You're having a tantrum.

762
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,440
I'm so unlucky!

763
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,400
Young Master.

764
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,720
I'll take Qian Cheng to see a doctor first.

765
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
Make your own dinner, okay?

766
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,360
Let's go.

767
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,300
(La Reveuse  Tea Lounge  Dreamy girl tea)
This beautiful flower.

768
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,860
Bubble machine.

769
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,520
(Give hope to others and make yourself eternal)
Come and see.

770
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,040
(Volunteer)
A very cute doll.

771
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,400
Take a look, everyone!

772
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,280
Thank you.

773
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,800
You're up and about

774
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,520
after feeling better.

775
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,040
If Master Ge finds out about this,

776
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,800
he'll scold me again.

777
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,120
Look at me.

778
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,600
I'm completely fine.

779
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,480
I really can't do anything to you.

780
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,840
Jin Xiaoyu.

781
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,760
Lin Nuoyan, Fu Liang.

782
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,120
Why are you guys here?

783
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,660
(Organ Donation)

784
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,920
I forgot you are the spokesperson.

785
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,920
Professor Lin is not only the spokesperson.

786
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,560
He is also the one that brought us together.

787
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,240
I'm free today.

788
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,680
That's why I brought
some new students here with me.

789
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,120
Fu Liang is my driver.

790
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,920
Good for you.

791
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,200
Professor Lin.

792
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,400
I think our association

793
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,080
should organize more activities
like this in the future

794
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,360
and publicize it

795
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,080
for the benefit of patients.

796
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,200
Okay. You guys chat.

797
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,760
I'll have to go.

798
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,880
Professor Lin is so handsome.

799
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,080
Fu Liang, move aside.

800
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,600
Don't crush Dr. Cheng's moral integrity.

801
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,000
What are you talking about?

802
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,240
You're so annoying.

803
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,320
You two chat.

804
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,080
I'm going to help.

805
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,960
Stomp, stomp, stomp.

806
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,000
By the way,

807
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,160
how did you and Dr. Cheng meet?

808
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,200
We're childhood friends.

809
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,080
Her mother is the head
of the emergency department.

810
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,600
When I was a kid,
I was always sent to the emergency room.

811
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,040
And she was always there to do her homework.

812
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,320
We got to know each other over time.

813
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,480
There's also another interesting story.

814
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,120
When I was a kid, her mother rescued me.

815
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,680
Now that I am grown up, she rescues me.

816
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,360
And you?

817
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,440
Do you know

818
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,120
the first thing Dr. Cheng said to me?

819
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,600
What was it?

820
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,320
The classic line.

821
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,560
I'm sorry. We did our best.

822
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,560
You're the donor's family?

823
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah.

824
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,800
A year ago...

825
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,200
No.

826
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,600
16 months and 4 days to be exact.

827
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,320
My girlfriend died in a car accident.

828
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,480
She was the one who tried to save my girlfriend.

829
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,520
She was also the one
who asked me if I wanted to donate.

830
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,560
I'm sorry for your loss.

831
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,080
So much time has passed.

832
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,480
I'm not that sad anymore.

833
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,200
You know what?

834
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,520
We had just gotten engaged

835
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,800
the day she died.

836
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,600
We were going to get
our marriage certificate the next day.

837
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,280
But I never thought

838
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,160
we got a death certificate the next day.

839
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,320
Fu Liang, I have something to do.

840
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,160
Can you take over for me?

841
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,880
- Okay.
- Thank you.

842
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,320
All right.

843
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,120
Officer Su.

844
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,240
What are you doing here?

845
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,240
I can go by myself.

846
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,120
What's going on?

847
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,420
(Captain Su)

848
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,720
Captain Su, we're going into the city.

849
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,920
The provincial inspection center will receive

850
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,840
Gao Guofu's body early tomorrow morning.

851
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,440
The report can be made
next week at the earliest.

852
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay.

853
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,120
Be safe on the road.

854
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,040
Hello?

855
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,760
Hello?

856
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,440
The traffic accident

857
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,960
was really strange.

858
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,320
You must stay alert.

859
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,040
Thank you.

860
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,560
So,

861
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,240
were all the remains burned?

862
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,680
I just came from the scene.

863
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,080
The driver is dead, the car is ruined.

864
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,440
And the remains were all burned.

865
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,280
So all the major clues about this case

866
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,320
have been cut off.

867
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,960
I came here this time,

868
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,920
hoping you

869
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,680
can recall

870
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,720
anything from the bus accident.

871
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,600
See if there are any significant circumstances

872
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,680
and special details.

873
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,600
If you think of something,

874
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,600
get in touch with me.

875
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,600
Got it.

876
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,560
I'll try to recall any
of the fragmented information.

877
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,440
In the meantime,

878
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,760
you must stay alert.

879
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,640
Try not to be alone.

880
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,960
And go home early at night.

881
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,000
Thank you. You stay safe too.

882
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,400
I need to go.

883
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,280
See you.

884
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,960
Your love luck is pretty good.

885
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,160
There are so many cute guys around you.

886
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,720
What are you kidding me?

887
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,640
He's a policeman.

888
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,720
He's here to investigate the bus case.

889
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,480
He is a good-looking policeman anyway.

890
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,400
You...

891
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,960
Look at this place, why did we pick here?

892
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,000
I mean.

893
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,920
You're changing the subject so unnaturally.

894
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
What's wrong with the place?

895
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,920
Nothing.

896
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,400
Bad location.

897
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,440
Very bad. Very bad.

898
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,520
(FOOD-Element  Light Food Convenience Store)
I thought one case of water was enough.

899
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,960
I didn't expect these people to drink so much.

900
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,880
I didn't drink much.

901
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,160
Hello, where is the mineral water?

902
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,040
Over there.

903
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,800
Okay.

904
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,120
There's ice cream.

905
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Come on.

906
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,440
I loved this when I was a kid.

907
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,840
We loved this when we were little.

908
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,360
But the taste

909
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,480
must be different now.

910
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,800
Let's try something new then.

911
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,360
- Okay.
- It'll be my treat.

912
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,960
I can't let you do that.

913
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,760
I'll pay for it.

914
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,800
Don't decline.

915
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,000
Consider this compensation
for hurting your head.

916
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,600
All right?

917
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,680
All right.

918
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,920
