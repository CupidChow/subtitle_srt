(Mu City Municipal Central Hospital
Outpatient Building)

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,280
I've gotten used to

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,440
seeing Jin Xiaoyu now.

22
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,680
Sometimes when I don't see her at home,

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,320
I even feel strange.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,560
The dishes she cooks are fine.

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,640
To you, accepting the changes

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
does take some time.

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,760
This is the first time in a decade
that you made a new friend.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,120
How do you feel?

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,480
She's not a friend yet.

30
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,920
To you, what is a friend?

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,040
A person who shares adversities together.

32
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,480
Are we friends?

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,200
We are now

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,720
sharing some difficulties.

35
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,400
No.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,840
There are some things that I cannot tell you.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
As friends,

38
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,680
honesty, trust, and sharing are essential.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,840
But honesty and trust can't be built in your heart

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,600
because you're afraid to be hurt.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Which I can understand.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,720
We can take our time. There's no rush.

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,600
Chief Fan.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,480
You've been telling me
not to rush things for a decade.

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
The pain that some people have

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,560
can never

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,840
be cured.

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,880
Qian Cheng,

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
are we friends?

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,040
We are.

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,680
Qian Cheng,

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,160
thank you for protecting me.

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,840
I miss you.

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,680
But

55
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,960
I may never come back again.

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,720
Maybe what I miss isn't you,

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,200
but the past.

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
Back then, I was quite healthy.

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,920
We were both fine.

60
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,840
Sorry

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,000
that I caused you trouble.

62
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,880
Sorry

63
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,520
that I didn't protect you.

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
We'll both get better.

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:34,920
Right?

66
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,760
Perhaps.

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,720
Qian Cheng,

68
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,640
I hope you get better.

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,000
You should have a new life,

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
and new friends.

71
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,280
I now have a new friend.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960

What a coincidence.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,080
Hello.

82
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,040
My lab is
in the First Central University next door.

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,560
Why are you here?

84
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,360
I got a cold.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,760
It is the flu season lately.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
I suggest you put on a mask when going out.

87
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,880
Let me have a look.

88
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,600
I happen to have some.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
Consider this my gratitude

90
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,560
for your generous support
to the First Central University.

91
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,600
Oh, right. Professor Lin.

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,000
Excuse me but I'd like to ask.

93
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,480
Do you have a good friend?

94
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,160
A good friend?

95
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,640
You mean in China?

96
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,320
I guess Jin Xiaoyu is one.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Also...

98
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,760
I see you as a friend, too, Mr. Qian.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,320
Me?

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,040
Yeah.

101
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,280
You seem like an honest and good person.

102
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,160
Though your facial expressions don't change a lot.

103
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,840
I'll take it as a compliment.

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,000
All right.

105
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,520
Let's have some drinks someday.

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,680
I don't drink in private.

107
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,680
See?

108
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,920
Like I said, Mr. Qian is honest.

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,320
I was being courteous.

110
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,680
I don't drink, either.

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
How about coffee, then?

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,640
Sure.

113
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,040
Then

114
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,160
let's work to become friends.

115
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Friends.

116
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,180
(Medical Mask)

117
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,760
I think Jin Xiaoyu's on duty today.

118
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,480
(Emergency Department)
Are you here to see Su Jiafan?

119
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm here to visit Officer Su,

120
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,680
but I really am not the mistress.

121
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,440
My friend is the coordinator
of the Organ Donation Association.

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,080
If you don't believe me, you can ask her.

123
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,280
Do you know about the boy?

124
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,960
I've seen many girls like you.

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,320
I suddenly feel a sense

126
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,200
of familiarity.

127
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,440
Could you please tell me what your occupation is?

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,600
A middle school teaching director.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,480
A teaching director?

130
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,920
Please tell me, Director,

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,520
what if someone had a child outside the family?

132
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,560
There's no need for what if.

133
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:40,960
You...

134
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You know about the boy?

135
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,840
You think I got suspicious

136
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,720
only based on a phone call?

137
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,120
I found him suspicious long ago.

138
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,320
I took a group of students
to a summer camp during the vacation.

139
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
When I came home, I found many problems.

140
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,400
There were strange tissues at home.

141
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,560
Strange tissues?

142
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,720
They were tissues for children only.

143
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,320
There was even an extra set

144
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,480
of tableware for children.

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,320
On the spoon, there were also bitemarks.

146
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,680
Hair was not only on the floor,

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
but also on the lint roller.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,520
It seems the kid came often.

149
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,200
Little girl.

150
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Married women are extra sensitive.

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
You didn't say anything
despite all that you noticed?

152
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,960
I thought you were the mistress,

153
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,160
so I wanted to trick you.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,920
So you pretended to be mean, right?

155
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,720
If you were the mistress,

156
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
I would have given you a good beating.

157
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
Oh, I'm so scared.

158
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,600
How has my girlfriend offended you?

159
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,280
The coquettes nowadays

160
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,600
are all this lousy?

161
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,400
You? The two-timer?

162
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,200
Qian Cheng,

163
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,000
what are you doing here?

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,680
You are not needed here.

165
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
Just step aside.

166
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,520
Really?

167
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,080
You're on duty today.

168
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,320
You dealing with her would be a waste.

169
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:57,560
I'll be quick.

170
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm not afraid of fights.

171
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,640
I won't cower if we do fight.

172
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,240
But I reckon

173
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,160
you're a smart woman.

174
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,160
I don't think you'll do anything to the kid.

175
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,320
Have you seen the kid?

176
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,720
Daddy,

177
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
what are you going to donate?

178
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,120
Daddy is going to donate his eyes.

179
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,960
If something happens to me,

180
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
you'll have my eyes

181
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,200
so that you can see the world.

182
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,160
This is why your husband

183
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,920
called me at the critical moment.

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,360
He planned well.

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
He's already severely injured.

186
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,360
Even if he did cheat on you,

187
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,520
he was punished.

188
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
But the boy is innocent.

189
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:36,520
Can you...

190
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:36,880
No.

191
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,360
Director Wen.

192
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,680
I shouldn't have said that, should I?

193
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:46,680
What?

194
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,680
"The boy is innocent".

195
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,230
If you can't aim, maybe calibration is off center.

196
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,930
Face the controller down to reset it.

197
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
Oh, I see the door.

198
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,760
This is it.

199
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,280
Where is Xiaoyu?

200
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,320
I don't know.

201
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,280
Maybe she's spending her time
in the lab thinking about her life.

202
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,240
I went to pick her up earlier
at the Second Hospital

203
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,800
and saw the wife of the policeman

204
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,600
giving her trouble.

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Giving her trouble?

206
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, right.

207
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Mrs. Su even thought that she was the mistress.

208
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,800
Simply put,

209
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,640
married women are monsters.

210
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,920
Don't worry.

211
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,920
No one will marry you.

212
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,680
Oh.

213
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,920
How is she doing?

214
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,040
She?

215
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,280
Not good.

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,200
But if you give me some money,

217
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
I'll teach you how to cheer your girlfriend up.

218
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,080
For real?

219
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:46,720
Of course.

220
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,200
Try it on me first.

221
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,320
I'll think about how much I'm going to pay.

222
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,560
This move of mine

223
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,240
always works.

224
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,240
You know what I'm saying?

225
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,760
Young Master.

226
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,960
You need to pay for the lesson!

227
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,240
Young Master!

228
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,800
Though I've seen many deaths,

229
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
I still feel sorry for Officer Su.

230
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,360
Regardless of his moral quality,

231
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,840
he, after all, had the accident
when chasing a criminal.

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,320
Organ donation was his last wish.

233
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,160
How come even death cannot resolve the hate?

234
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
You're back.

235
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,840
I heard from Qian Cheng that

236
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
you ran into Mrs. Su.

237
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,160
Don't mention it.

238
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,000
The fact that he got
an illegitimate son was exposed.

239
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,560
And his wife might have known
about it a long time ago.

240
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,320
But it's confirmed after his death.

241
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,680
Now the organ donation is not going to happen.

242
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,200
Come here.

243
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,680
Can you give me

244
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,360
Su Jiafan's medical report?

245
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,240
It's the patient's private information.

246
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,920
I mean,

247
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,080
you're not his doctor, right?

248
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,200
Take it as you heard about it accidentally

249
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,040
and happen to talk about it

250
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,800
with someone irrelevant.

251
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,360
I refuse.

252
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,320
Just do me this favor.

253
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,120
Seriously.

254
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
This is so difficult.

255
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,080
I don't even know what to do.

256
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,960
Wait! Wait a minute!

257
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,880
Button up.

258
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,400
Don't try to seduce me.

259
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
It's Cheng Weilan's patient.

260
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
What if anything goes wrong?

261
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,120
It would be too much of a responsibility for her.

262
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,000
I just wanted to help with

263
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
the special drug case.

264
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,920
Instead of spending time on this,

265
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
you should think about

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,400
how to make them sign the donation paper, okay?

267
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,240
I've got a solution.

268
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,240
What?

269
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,960
In the middle of the night,

270
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
I'll sneak in, and...

271
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,000
You know...

272
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,880
I just feel like

273
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,240
he's dying,

274
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,840
she should be over it
no matter how much she hates him.

275
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
But some relationships are just like this.

276
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,320
The more things are like this,
the more she hates him.

277
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,400
My life...my life is so hard.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If I found out that

279
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,520
my dying husband cheated on me,

280
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
I wouldn't even dig into it.

281
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,440
He's dead. His organs were donated.

282
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,480
She can move on.

283
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,480
Just remember the good stuff.

284
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,960
These bad memories aren't worth it, you know?

285
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,040
Let me ask you.

286
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Do you know what marriage means?

287
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,080
Making babies.

288
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,120
And?

289
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,800
How to make babies.

290
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,880
I'll teach you a lesson.

291
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,600
Listen to me carefully.

292
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Marriage

293
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,440
is the subtlest bond in this world.

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,520
Two people that are not blood related,

295
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
yet they are going to make a bloodline.

296
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,160
The two are the closest,

297
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,120
but

298
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,200
they can also be betrayed
by the spouse at any time.

299
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
In a marriage,

300
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
time is insignificant.

301
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
Because ten years,

302
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,360
even twenty years
might pass in the blink of an eye.

303
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,800
Yet it is also these moments

304
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,080
that may change their whole lives.

305
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
Su Jiafan!

306
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:18,880
Over here!

307
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,920
How did you get out?

308
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,120
I walked, obviously.

309
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,920
Bring the watermelon back. It's for everybody.

310
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,520
W-What are you doing?

311
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,320
I'm going to eat the watermelon.

312
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,040
Like this?

313
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,560
Share with them?

314
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,360
I'm not up for that.

315
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,240
Let's share it.

316
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,560
How long is your training going to last?

317
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,600
I'll be training the whole summer vacation.

318
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,360
You didn't get caught by the teacher, did you?

319
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,560
Even if they do see me,

320
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,840
they can't catch up with me.

321
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,160
Bragging.

322
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,120
Once you choose marriage,

323
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
you've chosen to share all of your secrets

324
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,840
with your partner.

325
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,760
Though you can

326
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,040
do the same with your friends,

327
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
they can't continue your lineage.

328
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,760
You and your partner can share wealth.

329
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,000
It means

330
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,320
the partner you choose

331
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,080
represents the future you'll have.

332
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,200
You're so cheesy.

333
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
You're making me cringe.

334
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,480
When they approve my marriage leave,

335
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,920
we'll go take wedding photos.

336
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,040
Forget it.

337
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,680
When you get your marriage leave,

338
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,960
let's go on our honeymoon.

339
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I don't even want a wedding.

340
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,400
That's too much trouble.

341
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
No.

342
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
Wedding is the happiest moment

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,640
in a man's life.

344
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm going to marry you in the coolest fashion.

345
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,400
I'll make every man in the world envy me.

346
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,640
Su Jiafan,

347
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,680
the hell with you.

348
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,800
Su Jiafan,

349
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,080
go to hell!

350
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,080
So at this time,

351
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,360
if you're betrayed,

352
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,960
other than the hate for your partner,

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
you actually hate yourself more.

354
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Because this is a complete denial

355
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,880
and trampling over yourself.

356
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:28,880
Fine.

357
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,720
Let's put Officer Su aside

358
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,160
and whether he has

359
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,040
betrayed his partner.

360
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,240
The fact that he woke up
during emergency treatment

361
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
and told Cheng Weilan that

362
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,000
he had to donate his corneas to his son,

363
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,960
shows that it means a lot to him.

364
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,880
I just feel bad for the patients.

365
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,680
Because

366
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,560
I know all too well
about a dying person's despair.

367
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,800
Maybe, at the time, he was like you.

368
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,960
He just wanted to save someone.

369
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,160
Yes.

370
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,040
I can't force anyone,

371
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,720
nor use morals to persuade them.

372
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,240
It's good that you know.

373
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,920
So?

374
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,080
Want to work with me?

375
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,360
How?

376
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,840
I'll get his family to sign the papers,

377
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,640
and you help me get his medical report.

378
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,960
I really want to know what happened

379
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,200
the night he had the accident.

380
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,680
The medical report has all the details.

381
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,240
No.

382
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:19,720
No?

383
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,160
Without me,

384
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,760
you can never get his family to sign the papers.

385
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,680
It's still a no.

386
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,400
You don't believe me?

387
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,560
Go have a try.

388
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,880
Wanna bet?

389
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,720
Bring it on.

390
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,120
Wen Xin.

391
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:32,960
Director Wen.

392
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,600
Tie up your hair.

393
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,880
I didn't bring a hair band.

394
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,960
Watch your appearance next time.

395
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:39,880
Okay.

396
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,280
Bye, Director Wen.

397
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,800
Director Wen.

398
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,520
What?

399
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,880
The mistress came to visit me at my workplace?

400
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,400
If I were the mistress,

401
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,720
I would get a portion
of the family property, right?

402
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,960
I need to head to a class.

403
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,680
What do you want?

404
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,600
About organ donation...

405
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,040
Goodbye.

406
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,320
Director Wen!

407
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,000
Director Wen!

408
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:05,800
I...

409
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,240
You're the newest on the team.

410
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,560
Unlike Liu and the other old dogs,

411
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,240
I trust you more.

412
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Be honest with me.

413
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,280
Have you ever met the woman?

414
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,560
Mrs. Su,

415
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,520
I really don't know
what woman you're talking about.

416
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,160
And about Captain Su,

417
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,920
I'm too low-ranked to know.

418
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,120
I want you to help me investigate something.

419
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,360
Would you agree?

420
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,200
Mrs. Su,

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,640
I won't break the law.

422
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,680
If you want me to obtain
another person's personal information,

423
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,760
I'm afraid I can't do it.

424
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,600
I haven't even said anything.

425
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,280
How do you know what I want?

426
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,640
Previously, you asked
Captain Liu and Zhou for help,

427
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,680
they turned you down.

428
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,680
It wasn't because they were covering for anybody,

429
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,880
it's simply against the law.

430
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,880
Sorry, but I can't help you.

431
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,440
Hi.

432
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
You're starting to annoy me, you know?

433
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
But I still want to try.

434
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,240
Your husband's organs
can at least save four people.

435
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,680
Will the recipients

436
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,320
know that they received the organs from a man
that has cheated on his wife?

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,680
All information about the donor and the recipient

438
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,080
is classified.

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
But I won't let him get what he wants.

440
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,160
As for that illegitimate son of his,

441
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
it's best that he stays blind forever.

442
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,600
Organ needs to be paired.

443
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,640
Sometimes, even the father and the son

444
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,600
don't pair up.

445
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,720
- And...
- If you keep talking,

446
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,000
I won't be civil with you!

447
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
Please hear me out...

448
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,760
before you walk away.

449
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,920
Though

450
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,320
it's not right to differentiate
women by their marital status,

451
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,520
I still have to say

452
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,680
that a girl can't beat a married woman.

453
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,840
Why is that?

454
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,560
I don't accept it.

455
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,640
Even marriage didn't scare her,

456
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,680
what else can possibly scare her?

457
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,240
Chief Zhang,

458
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,240
how is the patient looking?

459
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,800
He's out of danger for now.

460
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,520
But it still doesn't look good.

461
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,440
You go find his family.

462
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,440
Thank you, Chief Zhang.

463
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,840
Another operation?

464
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,000
My life feels so dark.

465
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,280
Professor Lin is so handsome.

466
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,360
My life is full of joy.

467
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Your attitude towards life

468
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,000
changes quite quickly.

469
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,640
Xiaoyu,

470
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
why are you here at the surgical department?

471
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,640
(No Smoking)
A friendly visit.

472
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,320
Professor Lin, what are you doing here?

473
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,680
(Quiet Please)
I'm taking the doctors in my lab

474
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,400
to this meeting.

475
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,000
Once the papers are signed,

476
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,800
it means in a day,

477
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,800
there will be four organ donation operations.

478
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,240
Four.

479
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,840
All right. Just relax.

480
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
What we can do now is

481
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,600
make sure that everything is ready,

482
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,280
even if she signs the papers in the last second.

483
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,240
Hurray for the medical workers.

484
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,360
Okay.

485
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Guys, here comes the wife.

486
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,400
Be prepared.

487
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,120
OK.

488
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,200
This is his wife.

489
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,040
Their relationship is extremely complicated.

490
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,360
When I told her about the illegitimate son,

491
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
it turned out she already knew

492
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,280
and she tried to trick me
by pretending to be a shrew.

493
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,080
She's a tough opponent.

494
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,200
What do you mean?

495
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,640
We're involved in

496
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,560
the patient's personal business.

497
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
It's okay. Leave her to me.

498
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,800
A cute girl and a coquette.

499
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,880
What kind of a combination is this?

500
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,840
A combination that can beat you up.

501
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,200
Will you beat me up

502
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,240
if I don't sign the paper?

503
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,320
Hello.

504
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,520
I'm in charge of the Organ Donation Association.

505
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,560
Can we have a talk?

506
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,480
You brought a new negotiator?

507
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,680
This way, please.

508
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,600
This way, please.

509
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,780
(Duty Room)

510
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,680
What are you guys doing here?

511
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,320
We came to bring you home.

512
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,480
Really?

513
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,080
You guys came to get information, right?

514
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,600
Don't downplay our love for you.

515
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,360
We came specifically to bring you home.

516
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,400
Alright, let's go.

517
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,400
Wait.

518
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,160
We're here already, might as well

519
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,920
wait a bit longer.

520
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,720
Love can disappear, right?

521
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,720
Aren't you a volunteer?

522
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,640
Why didn't you go in there?

523
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,040
I'm neither a doctor

524
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,320
nor a volunteer coordinator.

525
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,720
I'm not qualified to stay in the hospital,

526
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,360
nor am I qualified to negotiate with his family.

527
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,760
If so,

528
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,120
you going to her school

529
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,840
was harassment, right?

530
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,720
Go away. We'll break up if you keep this up.

531
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,400
Wait.

532
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,920
I won't sign it! I won't sign it!

533
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,720
I just won't!

534
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,480
Let's go.

535
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,360
Mrs. Su,

536
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,160
I hope you can reconsider.

537
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,160
Doctor,

538
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,480
for the last time,

539
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,880
if you keep pushing me,

540
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,440
I'll send his parents home.

541
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,520
Next time when there's an emergency,

542
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,400
I, the only family member,

543
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,360
will refuse to sign the papers.

544
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,880
Professor Lin,

545
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
don't feel bad.

546
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
The hardest thing in the world

547
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,600
is to make a woman say "I will".

548
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,160
I'm going to make my preparations.

549
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,400
How about

550
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,680
we talk to Officer Su's parents.

551
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I tried.

552
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,360
Though they respect their son's will,

553
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,520
they want their daughter-in-law
to sign the papers.

554
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
And they don't know

555
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,560
about their ruined relationship yet.

556
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
If the illegitimate son was exposed,

557
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,280
there would sure be a drama.

558
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,200
True.

559
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,080
If they knew about their grandson,

560
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,400
they'd take him home.

561
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,040
Gosh.

562
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,640
I can't even think about it.

563
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,400
Will you try again?

564
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,360
I'll think about it.

565
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,480
I'm off.

566
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,760
I'll bring her home.

567
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,520
You keep a look out.

568
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,360
Yes, sir.

569
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,860
(Outdoor Parking)

570
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:25,960
I think humans

571
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,360
are the most emotional creature in the world.

572
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,160
I don't believe anyone can be so heartless.

573
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,920
Some people like to
keep their emotions to themselves.

574
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,280
It looks like you've reached a dead end.

575
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,160
You have no idea

576
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,080
how dreadful it is once a married woman

577
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
finds out that her husband has cheated on her.

578
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
Now a short lifespan is a good thing.

579
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,960
Because you don't have to experience
all the pointless vicissitudes of life.

580
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,240
I'd rather trade twenty years of my life

581
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
for those pointless vicissitudes of life.

582
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,440
Well? Do you want to trade with me?

583
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,560
I devote myself to medicine! I love my country!

584
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm loyal to the people, abide by medical ethics,
respect my teachers, and follow the rules!

585
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,240
I shall study diligently, tirelessly,
and pursue perfection

586
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,920
and overall development!

587
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,560
I decide to exert all my efforts
to relieve human of sicknesses,

588
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,280
and aim for perfect health!

589
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,880
I uphold the holiness and glory of medicine!

590
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,120
I shall save the sick
despite all hardships! I shall persevere!

591
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,160
For the development
of China's medical and healthcare services,

592
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,040
and the physical
and mental health of the entire human race,

593
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,920
I shall work hard all my life.

594
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,000
Cheng Weilan!

595
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,240
You...

596
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,320
- William.
- D-D-Don't

597
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,600
jump from the roof.

598
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,280
I tell you what, don't do this to yourself!

599
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,840
I'll pay you however much the hospital owes you!

600
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Just don't jump!

601
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,200
Don't come close! I'm going to commit suicide.

602
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:51,600
You...

603
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
It's very dangerous!

604
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,440
I'm going to kill myself!

605
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,240
Come die with me!

606
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,880
I won't jump with you!

607
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,640
It's so high!

608
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,520
If I have to jump,

609
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,240
I want the entire hospital to jump with me!

610
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,320
I was pulling your leg.

611
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,500
(Stay True  Remember Missions)

612
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,120
You know what?

613
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
It's quite a view.

614
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,680
Yeah.

615
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,480
Before my mother retired,

616
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,600
she was the chief
of the emergency department of the hospital.

617
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,120
She found

618
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,160
this place.

619
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
Every time something troubled her,

620
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,360
she would come here to think about stuff.

621
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,000
Back then when my family was trying to name me,

622
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,040
she would come here when she was too stressed.

623
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,200
And then...

624
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,320
And then you were named Cheng Weilan.
[*Weilan means the color of the clear blue sky.]

625
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,000
Correct.

626
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,720
Nice name.

627
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,360
You bet.

628
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,680
I heard your colleagues call
your mother Chief Cheng.

629
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,000
You took your mother's family name?

630
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,280
Yeah.

631
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
My father and my mother

632
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
met each other in this hospital.

633
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,560
My dad had appendicitis,

634
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,240
my mother was the doctor on duty
in the emergency department.

635
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,920
They fell in love at first sight.

636
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
And then,

637
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,040
my dad repaid my mother

638
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,520
with himself.

639
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,160
So

640
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,040
I took the family name on my mother's side.

641
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,920
So romantic.

642
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,280
Yeah.

643
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,440
What's wrong?

644
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,280
A stomachache.

645
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,800
I'll push you off the roof. Try me.

646
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,680
You're quite smart.

647
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,200
Master,

648
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
you wanted to speak to me?

649
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,720
Xiaoyu and Cheng Weilan

650
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,760
have been troubled

651
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,040
because of Officer Su.

652
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,000
I can't disturb them, can I?

653
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,480
You think she'll talk back to you, right?

654
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,160
Why ask when you already know!

655
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,160
As your beloved apprentice,

656
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
I'll help you.

657
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,400
What nasty ideas have you got in mind?

658
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,720
I got some information from Cheng Weilan,

659
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,000
and I'll give it to you for free.

660
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,400
It can be your weapon against Xiaoyu.

661
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,720
Xiaoyu won't be happy if she knows.

662
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,400
I heard from Cheng Weilan

663
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,480
that Xiaoyu's boyfriend is a costume designer.

664
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,360
A costume designer?

665
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,960
A clothes-maker?

666
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,720
There are different levels.

667
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,400
The one who runs a small shop
near your home is called a tailor.

668
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,840
The one works in Qing'ai Building
is called a designer.

669
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,440
Would it be possible that he likes guys

670
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,160
and is only using Xiaoyu as his front?

671
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,040
Master,

672
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,080
don't make wild guesses.

673
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Cheng Weilan told me that

674
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,360
he's very nice to Xiaoyu.

675
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,360
He's very thoughtful.

676
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,560
Handsome, rich, talented, and faithful?

677
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,800
And treats Xiaoyu nicely?

678
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,360
Yes.

679
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,240
I guess Xiaoyu has traded her lifespan

680
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,440
for this boyfriend.

681
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,280
Director Wen.

682
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,920
What do you want?

683
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,520
Su Jiafan was investigating

684
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,640
an illegal drug case.

685
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,760
How much do you know?

686
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,720
How do you know this?

687
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,040
I saw some messages on his phone
about you and the case.

688
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,400
Do you know anything about it?

689
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
I only provided him with some information.

690
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,600
He didn't tell me much about the case.

691
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,360
And now that he's had an accident,

692
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
the case has been turned over to someone else.

693
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,760
Director Wen,

694
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
about the organ donation...

695
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,120
No.

696
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,120
I will never agree to it.

697
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,640
And he can't donate.

698
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Just forget about it.

699
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,960
Director Wen.

700
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
You said he can't donate.

701
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,040
This is the real reason
why you refuse to sign the papers, right?

702
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,160
It's not that you don't want to.

703
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,560
It's because he can't.

704
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,920
Though you make a big deal
out of the mistress incident,

705
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,280
it just constantly eats at me.

706
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,560
As the wife of a police officer,

707
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
it shouldn't be hard for you
to find a mistress, right?

708
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,280
You tried to ask Officer Su's men for help.

709
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,800
I heard your conversation.

710
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,960
He's a rookie.

711
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,320
Why didn't you go to the

712
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,360
senior officers?

713
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,200
I don't believe

714
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,560
they'd cover for him anymore at this point.

715
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
I think

716
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,480
you're bluffing.

717
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:43,920
What are you hiding?

718
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,480
Officer Su and I barely know each other,

719
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,320
but my gut feeling tells me

720
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,680
that he's a decent person.

721
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,120
That he wouldn't cheat on you.

722
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,320
I don't believe

723
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,280
he has moral flaws.

724
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,120
I don't want to believe it even more than you do.

725
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,240
We were classmates in high school.

726
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
We dated for eight years.

727
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,360
The man who I've been with for so long

728
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,160
suddenly turns into a different person.

729
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,840
Do you know how it feels?

730
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,840
Marriage means you'll

731
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,400
share all of your secrets with your partner.

732
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,320
You can choose to be friends,

733
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,240
but then you cannot continue your lineage.

734
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,600
On the other hand,
a couple can have a common descendent.

735
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,760
You're choosing your own future.

736
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,920
You need to be confident.

737
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,040
Hello?

738
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,600
Have you seen this drug before?

739
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,480
I haven't,

740
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,880
but I think I know what it is.

741
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
You know it?

742
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,360
He found the evidence,

743
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,120
but he didn't turn it in.

744
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,240
You mean...

745
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,480
He may have a relationship

746
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,160
with the seller.

747
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,440
You're right.

748
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,160
I am doing my best to protect him.

749
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,320
I got a phone call.

750
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,360
The seller threatened me

751
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,720
and wanted me to give them
all the information about the case.

752
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,960
They even said
they would expose his illegitimate son.

753
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,360
It wasn't until then

754
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,480
did I know in order to keep a mistress,

755
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,560
he was colluding with the drug seller.

756
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,240
If this gets exposed,

757
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,800
his image would be tarnished,

758
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,480
so will our family's

759
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,280
and the reputation of the police.

760
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,040
That's why you made a big deal
out of the mistress thing.

761
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,840
I didn't make a scene in the police station.

762
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,760
I want to find the woman on my own.

763
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
Maybe she knows about it, too.

764
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:26,840
Besides,

765
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,320
I'd rather expose the matter myself

766
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
than let them threaten me with it.

767
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,800
This is personal, not a public matter.

768
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,760
Have you ever thought that

769
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,960
maybe someone might have framed Officer Su?

770
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,600
If you had given the evidence

771
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,160
to the police station earlier,

772
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,160
the truth would have come to light.

773
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,560
I didn't dare take the risk.

774
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,040
The odds are 50/50.

775
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,400
He took the drug with him,
but didn't turn it in to the police.

776
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,200
And the child.

777
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,600
What if it's true?

778
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,760
Then everything would be over.

779
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,840
Then...

780
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,760
About the organ donation,

781
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,400
will you...

782
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,880
If he took the drug,

783
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,920
then his organs are abnormal

784
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
and cannot be donated.

785
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,720
But you won't be able to find out the truth

786
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,640
without any help.

787
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
Then I'll let the matter pass.

788
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,920
His colleagues will take over the case.

789
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,680
And he'll die as a hero.

790
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,680
I also heard that

791
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,640
the drug came from abroad.

792
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,760
It might take years to solve it.

793
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,840
If that's true,

794
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,480
I don't know what to do.

795

(Buwenzhong)

796
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,840
Get it out of here! Get it out of here!

797
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,640
What?

798
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,240
Are you scared?

799
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,160
I don't want it to be around me.

800
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,760

You admit defeat?

803
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,560
(Portfolio)
Then it's the power of love.

804
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
It's the power of organs.

805
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,040
I tell you what,

806
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,080
the mistress isn't the only reason

807
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,200
why Wen Yu refuses to sign the papers.

808
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,360
(Su Jiafan  Personal Information)
The drug seller reached out to her,

809
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
telling her that Officer Su was working with them.

810
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,800
Also, she found the special drug

811
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,920
in Officer Su's pocket.

812
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,920
Firstly, she doesn't want the reputation
of the police force to be damaged.

813
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,720
Secondly,

814
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,120
she's worried that Officer Su
did do something bad.

815
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,880
So the mistress thing is just a smoke screen.

816
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,440
She just wants to find out

817
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,640
who the drug seller really is.

818
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,600
I don't think girls

819
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,880
should be involved in such things.

820
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,320
It should be a job for men.

821
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
I'm not in the mood

822
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,280
to listen to an old man talk about equal rights.

823
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,000
I've told you the story

824

look terrible.

828
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,240
What happened?

829
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,320
Tell me about it.

830
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,200
Nothing.

831
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,680
I'm just a bit upset.

832
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:22,800
Upset?

833
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,400
Well, why don't we...

834
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,560

Nothing.

840
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,720
It took a look at me.

841
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,600
No, it didn't.

842
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
It did. It really did.

843
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,240
It didn't.

844
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,040

00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Xiaoyu knows him well.

851
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,600
She says he's decent and kind.

852
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,440
After all those deaths you've seen,

853
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,680
it's rare to see you like that.

854
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,400
He sacrificed himself for the lives of others.

855
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,380
(Su Jiafan  Personal Information)

856
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,480
If he were not a policeman,

857
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,640
it wouldn't have had anything to do with him.

858
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,640
Hold on.

859
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,920
An illegitimate son?

860
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,440
December 7, there was a campaign
in the Central University.

861
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,560
Su Jiafan brought a boy
who is suspected to be his illegitimate son.

862
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,400
to the campaign.

863
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,640
The policeman has and illegitimate son?

864
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,680
Still in question.

865
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,240
If we find the boy,

866
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,120
it may be helpful.

867
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,080
The campaign was in a university.

868
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
All roads on the campus have surveillance cameras.

869
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,120
I'll look it up.

870
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,000
What's on your mind?

871
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,800
You scared me.

872
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,320
Something feels wrong.

873
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,160
What?

874
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,600
Give me a pen.

875
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,840
Look.

876
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Su Jiafan brought a boy
who is suspected to be his illegitimate son.

877
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,840
to the campaign.

878
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,960
And he had a car accident that very night.

879
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,360
When Wen Yu withdrew the money,

880
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,240
she found a large amount of money.

881
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,800
At the same time, she noticed her husband

882
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,720
had been making a monthly transfer
to a certain bank account.

883
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,600
Then Wen Yu got a phone call that threatened her.

884
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,080
It was related to the case.

885
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,640
Putting all the pieces together...

886
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,760
Cheng Weilan, Jin Xiaoyu.

887
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,960
What are you doing?

888
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,280
Dummy, what are you doing here?

889
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,920
I'm here to befriend my love rival.

890
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,120
I wish I could be as cheerful as you are.

891
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,000
What were you doing?

892
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,440
Can I have a look?

893
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,600
What is this?

894
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,640
This is about what happened

895
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,160
to a poor lady after her husband

896
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,840
had a car accident.

897
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,120
Car accident. Found a large amount of money.

898
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,320
Her husband had been making a monthly transfer
to a certain bank account.

899
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,240
A mistress in question?

900
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,080
A phone call that threatened her?

901
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,760
She learned that her husband
might have broken the law?

902
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,600
Knowing so many secrets

903
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,920
after her husband's accident

904
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,760
would drive a woman crazy.

905
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,440
Yes.

906
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,920
Yes, it would.

907
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,120
As far as I know,

908
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,320
some policemen,

909
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
for example, narcotics police,

910
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,720
are very strict
at keeping their personal information

911
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
classified.

912
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,360
They fear the criminals might want revenge.

913
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
I get it.

914
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,680
Let's say Su Jiafan committed a crime,

915
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,200
then why was the money

916
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,800
transferred to his bank account after his death?

917
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,000
To comfort an accomplice?

918
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,800
Do you think everyone's nice like you?

919
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,400
Even if they are,

920
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,640
why did they

921
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,960
call Wen Yu to threaten her

922
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,120
to hand over all the information
about the case to them?

923
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Why would her wife have any information
about the case?

924
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Is his wife a police officer, too?

925
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,120
See? Even a fool knows something's off.

926
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,400
Hey, was that supposed to be a compliment?

927
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,360
The point is, how come Wen Yu

928
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,400
had the information about the case?

929
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,520
I think

930
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
that phone call meant to tell Wen Yu,

931
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,000
"Your husband is having an affair."

932
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,240
What kind of a criminal

933
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,200
would do such a thing

934
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,840
after transferring so much money
to the man's bank account?

935
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,240
Like you said,

936
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,120
who would be so nice?

937
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,640
No one would believe it.

938
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,840
From a third-person perspective,

939
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,920
what's your opinion?

940
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,480
I think the wife is lying.

941
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,600
The policeman colluded with the criminals,

942
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
his wife was afraid of exposing it,

943
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,000
so she lied.

944
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,280
She said she got a phone-call,

945
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,040
who was there with her?

946
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,680
That's right.

947
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,120
Throughout the whole thing,

948
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,320
the only thing that really exists

949
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,720
is the money in the bank account.

950
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,480
Nothing backs Wen Yu's words.

951
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,800
People will only assume
that Su Jiafan is the bad guy.

952
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,840
They wanted to frame Su Jiafan.

953
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,760
One important thing
is the information about the case.

954
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,480
If Su Jiafan is a suspect,

955
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,400
then his credibility decreases.

956
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
And his case will be transferred to someone else.

957
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,480
In that case,

958
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,840
the progress would become much slower.

959
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:54,800
Sir.

960
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:35,920
What?

961
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,120
Are you hungry?

962
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,200
I'm warning you,

963
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,720
don't even think about doing anything to my pet.

964
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,800
Give yourself a break.

965
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,800
How about this?

966
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,200
You get another pet.

967
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,080
I'll give you a llama.

968
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:49,640
No need.

969
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,800
You keep it to yourself.

970
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,120
Here's the information.

971
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,920
The whole thing

972
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,520
(Su Jiafan  Personal Information)
is easier than we thought.

973
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,720
