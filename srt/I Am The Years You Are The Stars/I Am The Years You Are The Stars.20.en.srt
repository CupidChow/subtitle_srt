To be honest,

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,160
I don't really want to
accept your birthday present.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,520
Every year you give me the same thing.

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,240
It's so boring.

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,080
I see.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,520
But

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
I spent so much time preparing this.

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,080
I don't believe it.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,160
It surely will be a surprise.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
It won't disappoint you this time.

33
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,520
Really?

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,880
Just open it and see.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,880
Ta-da!

36
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,160
Of course it won't be different.

37
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,640
Prince Baiju!

38
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,480
Happy Birthday.

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,680
I'm really...

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,760
Can you stop giving me

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,160
the same gifts every year?

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,840
I did tell you that

43
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,120
I like crystal balls.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But you send me a crystal ball every year!

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,240
Is it fun?

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,240
Look!

47
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,800
This prince is a match for the princess.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,000
They are pretty cute.

49
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,040
That's what I'm talking about.

50
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
Shouldn't you say something to me?

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,480
Thanks.

52
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,160
Of course,

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,080
I have prepared something else for you.

54
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,340
(Invitation)

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,240
I'm telling you beforehand.

56
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,120
I only allow you to make a fool of me

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
once on my birthday.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,200
If I were fooled twice,

59
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,240
I would jump down from here.

60
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:16,920
No, I won't.

61
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,140
(Qian Zhonghai and Wang Meiting are holding their
40th wedding anniversary celebration at Mewes Hotel.)

62
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,000
An invitation?

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,720
Yes.

64
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,400
My parents are having a party
to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary.

65
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,480
I'm extending an invitation to you.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,040
Their 40th anniversary?

67
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,400
It's a ruby wedding.

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,400
Of course.

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,640
Splendid!

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,280
What's on your face?

71
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
Envy and jealousy!

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,840
To be honest,

73
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,320
I'm really envious of them.

74
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,760
I assure you that

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,760
I'll be there.

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,920
Will you really be there?

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
You were invited
to the 30th wedding anniversary celebration.

78
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,680
You sent a gift, but you didn't come.

79
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,960
Will you be there this time?

80
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Romance really changes people.

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,200
Don't put me in a difficult position.

82
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
How can I bring you to such an event?

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,600
If I go there with you,
it's as good as telling others we are a couple.

84
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
But we are bros.

85
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,520
Grandma!

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,600
You expect me to find you a granddaughter-in-law?

87
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
You can hire a girl

88
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,200
to pretend.

89
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
Why do you care what I will wear?

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Don't be so demanding.

91
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
- You're making things difficult for me.
- I will be in my pajamas.

92
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,360
What's going on?

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,480
I know.

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you even talking about?

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Cheng's parents

96
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,280
are celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary.

97
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,600
Every invited man needs a date.

98
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,440
The Qian family is well-connected.

99
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Such wedding anniversary parties

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,280
are important social occasions

101
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,840
for their business partners.

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
So, it's very important to find the right date.

103
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,760
It shouldn't be taken lightly.

104
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,080
But it sounds fun.

105
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,360
Tomorrow,

106
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
go to the company

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,600
to pick out your favorite dress.

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
They have invited me.

109
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,640
And you will be my date.

110
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,400
What's wrong? Is the potato chip bad?

111
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,720
I mean.

112
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
What's the point of me
going to such social events?

113
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm not a sociable person.

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,320
Besides,

115
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,080
shouldn't you refrain from going to public events?

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,960
Aren't you afraid of being exposed?

117
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,840
Imagine this.

118
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
What if in ten years time,

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,760
people still find you looking the same?

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,880
It will cause chaos!

121
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,360
But don't you just want me

122
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,280
to live like an ordinary man?

123
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,040
I just want to be ordinary.

124
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
But this party is extraordinary!

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,320
OK, I'll end it here.

126
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,000
My phone is running out of power.

127
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,240
Young Master.

128
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,320
Xiaoyu.

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,360
- What's up?
- What's up?

130
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,520
I need a date.

131
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,040
A decent one.

132
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
I need a date.

133
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,360
Any alive one will do.

134
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,280
This one was never displayed at the anniversary.

135
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,920
It was made for museum display.

136
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,080
No one has worn it yet.

137
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,200
This is a classic of Qing'ai designed by Mrs. Dao.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,400
The original one.

139
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,720
It's the only one of its kind.

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,560
And that one

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,600
was designed by William.

142
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,960
It's the signature piece
of the third-generation designer.

143
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,600
It's so beautiful.

144
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
William is really talented.

145
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,760
Cheng,

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,200
you are offering me so many valuable dresses.

147
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,800
Are you asking me to do anything tough?

148
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
Are you terminally ill?

149
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm very healthy, thank you.

150
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,680
Well,

151
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,600
erm,

152
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
my family is hosting a party in a couple of days.

153
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,240
Could you be my date?

154
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,520
Xue Wanwan!

155
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,680
Cheng!

156
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,520
Are you out of your mind?

157
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
I've never thought of you as a man.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
And I don't think
I'm a woman in front of you, either.

159
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,200
We are bros.

160
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,280
If I go to the dinner party with you,

161
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
it's as good as announcing to the whole world that

162
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
we are a couple, isn't it?

163
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
I am out of options.

164
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,640
If I could find anyone else,

165
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,880
would I bribe you with

166
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
the classic dress made by Mrs. Dao?

167
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,120
Even if you couldn't find any other girl,

168
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,640
don't use me as your fake girlfriend.

169
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,760
I already have someone in mind.

170
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,080
William is your bro.

171
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,320
William is also your bro.

172
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
I don't care what he thinks.

173
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,400
I have my own principles.

174
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,800
I will never have an affair with my bro's bro.

175
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,800
William won't take you to my house.

176
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,240
If you go there with me,

177
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,080
you will be considered
a potential minor lady of the house.

178
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,160
How honorable would that be!

179
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,360
Are you hearing yourself?

180
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,360
A potential lady of the house?

181
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,600
And a minor one?

182
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Do you think a Xue family member
wants to be your minor lady of the house?

183
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
If William brings someone else,

184
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,360
I can bring another man with me.

185
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,680
You aren't my option.

186
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,760
It's really not suitable.

187
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,760
My cousin just failed to date your brother.

188
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,880
If it's announced that we're dating,

189
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,240
my cousin will kill me.

190
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,760
Why not ask my cousin to go with you?

191
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,320
She is single right now.

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,920
You said she was rejected by my brother.

193
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,760
If I ask her to be my date,

194
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,840
wouldn't it make my brother look bad?

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,880
Your cousin won't agree either.

196
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,600
Then...

197
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
I met the daughter of Cao Guangming,
an e-commerce tycoon,

198
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,520
at a tea party the other day.

199
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,160
It seems that she has no boyfriend.

200
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,280
Is an e-commerce parvenu

201
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,960
worthy of my family?

202
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,400
There are only a few families
who can come to our party.

203
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
You are the best candidate.

204
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
Your mom thinks I'm a fine young man, doesn't she?

205
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,880
And your brother also likes me.

206
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,560
That's why

207
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
I can't go with you.

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,760
Xue Zaozao will force me to marry you on the spot.

209
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,920
Give me a break!

210
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,520
Xue Wanwan!

211
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,200
Bro.

212
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,480
Young Master.

213
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
Could you please help me
come up with another plans?

214
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,440
What else can I do?

215
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,960
I have even given you
the classic collection of dresses.

216
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,200
Sorry.

217
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,040
Why is her phone switched off again?

219
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,920
Today, Chief Qiu said that

220
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,880
Jin Xiaoyu's consultation is scheduled.

221
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,760
It will be next month.

222
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,880
Have you heard about it?

223
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes, I have.

224
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,440
It's not easy for so many experts

225
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,440
to get together.

226
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,600
When my department had a meeting that day,

227
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,560
we were all talking about Jin Xiaoyu.

228
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,680
It was just like a Martial Arts Assembly.

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,040
Everyone was running around telling the news

230
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
and participating in the grand event.

231
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,880
Even some of the busy experts

232
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,840
would also make an appearance

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,880
in order to learn about her case.

234
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,600
I hope this consultation

235
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,720
will help.

236
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,680
Her health

237
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,840
is getting worse and worse.

238
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,320
Her nosebleeds have become more frequent recently.

239
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,400
I suspect it might be a blood related disease.

240
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,080
Before the cause is known,

241
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
all are just conjectures.

242
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,440
I think

243
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
she looks quite energetic.

244
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,320
She surely will

245
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,040
live through this year.

246
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,000
No one knows her health

247
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
better than me.

248
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,960
She is now enjoying
the happiest moment of her life.

249
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,320
She found a new boyfriend recently

250
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,600
and is still in the honeymoon phase.

251
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,960
You know that

252
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
I'm not superstitious at all.

253
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,640
But for her,

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,880
I've prayed to all sorts of deities

255
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,840
in hopes that she can have a longer life.

256
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,960
Jin Xiaoyu isn't going to tell her boyfriend

257
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,800
about the consultation and her health yet.

258
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,320
Come with me.

259
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
You better not tell anyone

260
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,040
about what you heard today.

261
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,280
Don't affect the relationship
between Jin Xiaoyu and Bai.

262
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,520
Bai is a very sentimental person.

263
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,120
If he knows about it,

264
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
he probably will die for love.

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,720
Are you threatening me?

266
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,600
I'm not threatening you.

267
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,880
I just want to make a deal with you.

268
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,040
I won't date you.

269
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,680
I won't date you.

270
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,240
I just want you...

271
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,560
You can't have my body, but you can have my soul.

272
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,680
I don't want your soul.

273
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,560
I just need you

274
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,360
to be my date.

275
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,160
Are you in an upper-class society

276
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,520
or a senior activity center?

277
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,240
Why are you always looking for a date?

278
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,800
It's just like the elderly dance class
my mother goes to.

279
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,960
Qian Cheng's parents
are holding a wedding anniversary party.

280
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,920
They require all the guests to have a date.

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Why not ask Xue Wanwan to go with you?

282
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,760
She likes you, doesn't she?

283
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,040
Why should I go with her?

284
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,800
She likes me,

285
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,640
but I dislike her.

286
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,360
And this is a very formal occasion.

287
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,080
Going there with her is as good
as announcing that we're a couple.

288
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
If Xue Wanwan's brother finds out about that,

289
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,240
he will surely break my legs

290
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,440
and kill me.

291
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,880
What a popular person you are!

292
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm indeed a popular person.

293
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
But I have few options in my social circle.

294
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,480
Half of the girls are my bros.

295
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,840
Besides,

296
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
I must find an excellent

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,560
and independent female outside my social circle.

298
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,920
That's why

299
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,720
you have come to me today.

300
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,240
I thought I could
discuss the matter with you first.

301
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,920
But things are different now.

302
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
You have to promise

303
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,880
to go to the party with me

304
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,800
as my date.

305
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,120
And I will keep that secret for you.

306
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,160
Are you threatening me with Jin Xiaoyu's matter?

307
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,720
I'm not threatening you.

308
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,800
If you and Jin Xiaoyu are fake friends,

309
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,760
you can refuse.

310
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,000
But her health

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,840
is getting worse.

312
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,400
And a break-up

313
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,120
may...

314
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,680
Dao Ruifeng, are you even a human?

315
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,160
I don't want to be human.

316
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,120
I just want to be with you.

317
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,880
In front of you,

318
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,920
I only want to be a beast.

319
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,840
You're so annoying!

320
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,200
How about this one?

321
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,840
Why do I feel that this dress

322
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,960
is falling down?

323
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
There is an anti-slip strap here.

324
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,280
How could it fall?

325
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,520
What are you doing?

326
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,520
Are you wearing jeans inside?

327
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,600
Take off your jeans. Hurry up.

328
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
It's the first time

329
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,280
I've heard a handsome man
saying such things to me.

330
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,280
It's my first time

331
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,960
seeing

332
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,520
a girl wearing jeans under her dress.

333
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,640
What do you want me to do?

334
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,280
Shall I take off the jeans now?

335
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,040
No, thanks.

336
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,720
It's unnecessary.

337
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,040
I don't want to be critical.

338
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,520
But these dresses either show my shoulders

339
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,160
or my thighs.

340
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,800
Don't you have something to keep me warm?

341
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
You know nothing about fashion.

342
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,800
You know nothing about arthritis.

343
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,240
Do I need to try on

344
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
all of these dresses?

345
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,280
Don't worry.

346
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
I know you are too lazy to try them all.

347
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
I only selected three for you.

348
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,000
Others

349
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,240
are for Qian Cheng.

350
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,360
Qian Cheng?

351
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,480
Are you sure Qian Cheng can wear this dress?

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,640
What's the matter?

353
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,800
Are you kidding me?

354
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,960
How could Qian Cheng wear dresses?

355
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
That's what I'm saying.

356
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,840
The dresses here have such thin waists.

357
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,760
How could he wear them?

358
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,920
By the way,

359
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,800
has he found his date?

360
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,040
I have kept several classic dresses for him.

361
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,440
But he hasn't found a single lady
that's willing to go with him.

362
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,960
You see?

363
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm not the only girl who dislikes him.

364
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,960
Perhaps

365
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,120
you should prepare men's clothes for him.

366
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,280
Prepare men's clothes?

367
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,980
(Lin Nuoyan)

368
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,840
Young Master,

369
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,960
Lin Nuoyan usually doesn't call me.

370
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,080
Can I answer it?

371
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,120
Go ahead.

372
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,800
Thank you!

373
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,320
Hello?

374
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,040
What?

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,120
Hospital?

376
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,360
Let me see.

377
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,720
Near the hospital?

378
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,360
There is an amusement park to the east.

379
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,320
It is called Bajiao Amusement Park.

380
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,640
Why don't you call them first?

381
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,080
I'll head over now, okay?

382
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,680
Okay, don't panic! Don't panic!

383
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,160
I will be there very soon.

384
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,480
What's wrong?

385
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,360
The kid, Bella, has run away from the hospital.

386
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,440
Lin Nuoyan is her friend

387
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,600
and he must be very worried.

388
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,440
He wants me to help him.

389
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Okay, quickly get changed.

390
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,480
Well,

391
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,960
I'm going to the amusement park with you.

392
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,480
No.

393
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,840
There are crowds of people in the amusement park.

394
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
And you can't appear in public.

395
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,520
It would be dangerous for you.

396
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't let you go to the amusement park

397
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
alone with Lin Nuoyan.

398
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,480
Come here, honey!

399
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,200
- I want this.
- Here you are.

400
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
- Chocolate one.
- Thanks, Daddy.

401
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,120
Here you go.

402
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Thanks.

403
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,240
You are welcome.

404
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,840
Look at the girl over there.

405
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Doesn't she look like little Mingyue
in the "Legend of Mingyue"?

406
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,120
How can the adults let her come here on her own?

407
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,920
That's true.

408
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,520
And no one is accompanying her.

409
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,080
I searched the water world,

410
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,200
and this park.

411
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,720
She's not in these two places.

412
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,800
Jiang Baiju and I separated.

413
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:45,920
How about you?

414
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,080
I'm with Wang.

415
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,920
We have checked
the Ferris wheel and merry-go-round.

416
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,560
She wasn't there, either.

417
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,520
OK, let's continue.

418
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,480
What are you doing?

419
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,480
It's you.

420
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,200
Come with me.

421
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,560
Mom, help me! He's a pervert!

422
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,480
Mom!

423
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,760
- Louder!
- Mom!

424
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,960
Let's see who'll get into trouble

425
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,760
when your mother comes.

426
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:25,920
Go ahead!

427
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,040
How did you recognize me?

428
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,920
We're indoors,

429
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,000
and only you and I are wearing sunglasses.

430
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Why would a normal person wear sunglasses indoors?

431
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,840
Uncle,

432
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,560
let me go, please!

433
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,200
I'm as old as your grandpa.

434
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,680
All right, all right, Grandpa.

435
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,760
Let me go, please. Please!

436
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm still young.

437
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,960
I know I was wrong.

438
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,880
I won't do it again.

439
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
You look so sad.

440
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,520
In that case,

441
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,240
let me call the police.

442
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:51,960
No! No! No!

443
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:52,760
Uncle.

444
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,440
The hospital sent you, right?

445
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,800
Then you must know I have leukemia.

446
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,880
I won't live long.

447
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Look at my hair. I'm almost bald.

448
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,240
I'm not sent by the hospital.

449
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm...

450
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,120
a friend of Lin Nuoyan.

451
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

452
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,360
What would happen then?

453
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,400
Please take me to Lin Nuoyan now.

454
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,160
No.

455
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,200
Wait a second.

456
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,880
Take a train ride with me first.

457
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
Everyone is worried sick looking for you.

458
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,560
How could you still want to take a train ride?

459
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,840
Send a message through WeChat to Lin Nuoyan

460
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
and ask him to find me there.

461
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
I don't have him on WeChat.

462
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,080
Grandpa!

463
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,080
Are you senile?

464
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,040
I want to take a train ride

465
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,320
with Lin Nuoyan. Now!

466
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,720
I don't want to see him
take a train ride with his girlfriend.

467
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,400
Does he have a girlfriend?

468
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,000
Jin Xiaoyu.

469
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,440
Let me tell you something.

470
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Jin Xiaoyu isn't Lin Nuoyan's girlfriend.

471
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,320
Did you hear what I say?

472
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,200
I don't care whose girlfriend she is.

473
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,360
I just want to take a train ride

474
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,400
with Lin Nuoyan today.

475
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,880
I promise to go back after that.

476
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,400
Okay.

477
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,540
(Old Man)

478
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,840
Hello, old man.

479
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,040
I've found Bella.

480
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,040
I'll see you at the Romon Train later.

481
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,640
Okay?

482
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,280
Okay.

483
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,480
Then I'll tell Lin Nuoyan right away.

484
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,000
See you later.

485
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,680
Lin Nuoyan! You are here!

486
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:12,680
Old man!

487
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,400
Bella!

488
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
Why did you run out again?

489
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,400
Let's go.

490
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
Your mom has arrived at the hospital.

491
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,960
I don't want to go back.
I just want to take the train ride.

492
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,240
Go away!

493
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:21,720
Bella!

494
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,080
Don't be impolite.

495
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,360
Lin Nuoyan.

496
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,120
I'm begging you.

497
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm really dying.

498
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,720
I just want to take a train ride with you.

499
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,600
This is my only wish.

500
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
Please!

501
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,720
How can you refuse a kid who says that?

502
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,840
Take a train ride with her.

503
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,200
Only once.

504
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:50,640
Let's go.

505
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
I'll wait for you guys here.

506
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,880
What's the point of taking a train ride?

507
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,440
Kids love this.

508
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,560
So do I.

509
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,120
Has this kid been

510
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,760
brainwashed by Lin Nuoyan?

511
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,600
What are you saying? Be nice!

512
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,760
Bella is just precocious.

513
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,560
Besides, she has been acting since she was young.

514
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,760
So she doesn't have many friends.

515
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,680
She just

516
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,560
regards Lin Nuoyan as someone
that can give her emotional support.

517
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,080
Got it?

518
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,440
I see.

519
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,600
So, he is a well-dressed villain
that has many female friends.

520
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,760

the benefit of this train ride.

You are much better than Jin Xiaoyu's boyfriend.

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,960
She really has bad taste in men.

534
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,600
Bella,

535
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,560
after this,

536
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,000
you should apologize to Wang.

537
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,600
You hear me?

538
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,840
Yes, I did.

539
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,720
And

540
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,760
after we go back to the hospital,

541
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
you should also apologize to your mom.

542
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,320
No, I won't apologize to her.

543
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,560
Be a good girl, Bella.

544
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,160
Mom lied to me.

545
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,920
She said

546
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,480
she would bring Daddy to see me.

547
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,040
She also said

548
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,120
she would take a train ride with Daddy and me.

549
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,040
She promised me many things,

550
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,560
but none has been carried out.

551
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,640
She only cares about money.

552
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,680
She cares about what show I will act in.

553
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,000
She cares about what products I will endorse.

554
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,040
Bella,

555
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,560
you should believe that in this world,

556
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,200
no one loves you more than your mother.

557
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,160
She cares about money

558
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,520
because she wants you to stay in a better hospital

559
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,680
and have better doctors

560
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,880
to cure your disease.

561
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,480
Lin Nuoyan,

562
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm a kid,

563
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,320
but I'm not stupid.

564
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,040
I know.

565
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,200
If

566
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,960
I die,

567
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,280
my mom will give birth to another child.

568
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,520
She will forget me.

569
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,840
Silly girl,

570
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,200
your parents are already divorced.

571
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,800
Who is she going to have a baby with?

572
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,840
She can have children without getting married.

573
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,920
Sometimes I wonder

574
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,960
what's in that little head of yours.

575
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Though you are just a kid,

576
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,920
you seem to know everything.

577
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,520
Yet what you say

578
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,760
still sounds like a bunch of nonsense.

579
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,080
Lin Nuoyan,

580
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
will you forget about me?

581
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,480
How could I forget you?

582
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
You are my girlfriend, aren't you?

583
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,800
Jin Xiaoyu said

584
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,040
if I were your girlfriend,

585
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,720
you would be a giant baby.

586
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,480
So, let's just be friends.

587
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
You are my second friend in this world.

588
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,920
I'm your second friend?

589
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,920
Who is the first one?

590
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,880
It's Wang.

591
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm so exhausted.

592
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,200
I have made up my mind.

593
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,520
I won't have any kids in the future.

594
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,480
I agree with you.

595
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,720
What's wrong?

596
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,160
I'm fine, Jiang Baiju.

597
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,680
Give it here.

598
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,240
Really.

599
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
It's because Dr. Huang over-prescribed
traditional Chinese medicine.

600
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,440
I became heaty after consuming too much of it.

601
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,080
You know what I'm saying?

602
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,080
I can tell.

603
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,680
You do look heaty.

604
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,360
Jiang Baiju!

605
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,640
In fact...

606
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,160
In fact,

607
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
compared with the train rides
in the amusement park,

608
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,200
I like activities for adults more.

609
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
What activities for adults are you thinking about?

610
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,000
Watching a movie!

611
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,600
What did you expect?

612
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:52,760
Young Master?

613
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,720
Where are you?

614
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,800
Kids are so annoying.

615
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,640
I couldn't agree more!

616
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,960
(Outpatient)
I spent so much money hiring you.

617
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,520
Even if you are just hanging around doing nothing,

618
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,560
you could at least guard the gate!

619
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,080
You can't even look after a child!

620
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,680
Mom.

621
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,600
What's up, baby?

622
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,120
Give me a hug.

623
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,920
Wait for a moment, baby.

624
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,200
I'll come over after I deal with this matter.

625
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,360
Shouldn't I deduct your pay?

626
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
Am I going too far if I deduct your pay?

627
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,800
Good night, Bella.

628
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,320
Good night,

629
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,440
Mom.

(Qian Zhonghai & Wang Meiting's
40th Wedding Anniversary Celebration)

631
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,520
Previously you appeared unannounced
at the Qing'ai's anniversary celebration

632
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,240
in a seductive dress.

633
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,280
This is just my parents'
wedding anniversary party.

634
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,320
Why are you pretending to be so nervous?

635
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,160
Hey,

636
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,040
what do you mean by pretending?

637
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,200
At that time,

638
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,080
Jiang Baiju and I had a fight.

639
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,160
I was not in the mood. Okay?

640
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,800
Whatever.

641
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,680
Why bother explaining it to you?

642
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,600
Let's go.

643
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,200
Wait.

644
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,640
Let's wait for William.

645
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm telling you, Qian Cheng.

646
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,600
William surely will have

647
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,480
a matching date.

648
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,520
And his date will be a lady.

649
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,480
Impossible!

650
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
I've already asked.

651
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,560
Let alone a girl,

652
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,560
he won't even have a male date.

653
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,760
Who won't even have a male date?

654
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:47,880
Excellent!

655
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,920
What are you doing here?

656
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,400
It's all because of you.

657
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,520
He threatened me that

658
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,640
if I didn't come here with him,

659
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,240
he would tell Bai about your consultation.

660
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
Such a despicable baby!

661
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,320
Yes, I'm a baby.

662
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,640
Let's go.

663

- Welcome!

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,360
Shall I knock your brother out and drag him away?

669
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,000
Why don't you lend Jin Xiaoyu to me?

670
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,080
Books and girlfriend...

671
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,400
Both of them shall not be lent.

William,

699
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,960
could you give me a ride home?

700
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,400
Xue...Xue Zaozao told me

701
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,520
not to give you a ride.

702
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,280
Impossible.

703
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,080
I just asked my brother and he agreed to it.

704
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,760
Your brother doesn't want you to get hurt.

705
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,240
But he will hurt me.

706

I'm going to ride a bicycle.

715
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,160

I have always been

736
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,520
concerned about his personal life.

737
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I'm very happy to see that

738
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,920
he has

739
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
your company now.

740
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,040

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,040
Very happy.

742
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,760
We know about Mr. Jiang very well.

743
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,880
He saved Qian Cheng.

744
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,200
So, we keep his matters

745
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,480
strictly confidential.

746
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,400
I wish the both of you a happy life.

747
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,240
Qian Tu.

748
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,080
Dad.

749
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,120
Make Mr. Jiang and Miss Jin feel at home.

750
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,080
Okay, Dad.

751
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm entertaining the guests with your mother.

752
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,840
Excuse me.

753
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,000
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

754
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,880
Excuse me.

755
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,720
Look after your brother.

756
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
What's up? Little Tutu?

757
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,720
Why do you look so sad

758
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,560
that even your hair is becoming flat?

759
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,760
On my parents' wedding anniversary party,

760
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,160
my brother and his first love
are staring at each other lovingly.

761
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,000
I don't think your parents
have said anything about them.

762
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,680
Right!

763
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,400
While you were chatting,

764
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,560
did my parents mention Ye Lai?

765
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,240
They didn't say a word about her.

766
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
Their attitude is very obvious.

767
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,360
Didn't you always hope Cheng

768
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,520
could find a girlfriend?

769
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,320
What's wrong?

770
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,520
Aren't you happy to see him having a girlfriend?

771
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,800
Don't bring that up.

772
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Look at Dao Ruifeng.

773
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,320
He brought two dates with him to such an occasion.

774
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,960
No one could do that except for him.

775
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:24,840
Indeed,

776
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,680
it's the first time
that he has brought only two girls.

777
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,200
He usually has 10 girls that like him around him

778
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
and he can make them get along with each other.

779
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,120
Can you?

780
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,400
Don't you envy him?

781
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,840
No, I don't.

782
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,560
I think

783
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,720
Qian Cheng wouldn't

784
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,240
have a panic attack that easily, right?

785
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,240
How did you find out about that?

786
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,840
William told me about it before.

787
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,440
And Cheng Weilan met Qian Cheng
in the psychology department.

788
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,920
Combining the two occurrences,

789
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,040
Qian Cheng

790
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,240
probably won't have a panic attack.

791
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,480
You are very smart.

792
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,520
I dare not lie to you
about anything in the future.

793
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,360
You are terrifying.

794
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,240
Don't you dare lie to me!

795
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,920
I won't drink too much.

796
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,160
You said it!

797
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,720
Alright, alright!

798
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,000
Mr. and Mrs. Qian!

799
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,120
- Congratulations!
- Welcome!

800
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,360
That's Qian Cheng's parents.

801
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
Uncle Qian

802
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,800
is an economist in our city.

803
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,280
Aunt Qian's family is also very influential.

804
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,040
You know what I'm saying.

805
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,640
Cheng's grandfather is also very excellent.

806
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,040
He once got involved
in building aircraft carriers in the US.

807
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,120
In the eyes of Qian family,

808
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,520
Qing'ai is only a tailor shop.

809
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,400
That's why Cheng's brother has been dissatisfied

810
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,520
with Cheng's work in Qing'ai.

811
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,880
She is the youngest daughter of the Ye family.

812
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,320
I haven't seen her for years.

813
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,760
She hasn't changed much.

814
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,120
She looks good with Mr. Qian Cheng.

815
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,720
I heard they were already in love

816
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
when they were in senior middle school.

817
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,480
The Qian family wouldn't let Cheng marry Ye Lai.

818
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,800
How pitiful he is!

819
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,920
Why is that?

820
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,000
I think they look good with each other.

821
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
They look like an ideal couple.

822
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,040
You should look her up in the tabloids.

823
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,720
What happened?

824
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
Ten years ago,

825
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,000
Cheng and Ye Lai were kidnapped.

826
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,760
It was big news.

827
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,920
Though I don't know much about the details,

828
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,840
we all know that

829
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,640
in order to save Ye Lai, Cheng

830
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,080
was thrown from top
of the building by the kidnappers.

831
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,720
He survived
even though he fell from a great height.

832
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,080
It's a miracle.

833
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,520
After that,

834
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,000
Ye Lai went to study abroad.

835
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,520
Cheng also disappeared.

836
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,280
No one knows where they went those years.

837
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,200
After hearing what you said,

838
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,200
I have more reasons
to think that it's just natural

839
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,440
for Ye Lai to love Qian Cheng.

840
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,680
But it is also natural for the Qian family

841
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,920
to dislike Ye Lai.

842
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,600
Will Aunt Qian allow a girl
who almost killed her son

843
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,160
to be her daughter-in-law?

844
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,960
True. Cheers!

845
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,240
We made a deal.

846
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,200
You gave him to me.

847
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,880
Yeah, it's a deal.

848
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
Then I'll find my William.

849
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,040
Get yourself something to eat.

850
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,520
Go ahead.

851
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,600
I think he doesn't like Ye Lai.

852
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,840
But he doesn't seem to mind it at all.

853
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,600
In front of so many people,
he has kept a poker face.

854
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,200
Yes.

855
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,520
Ye Lai is also a young lady
of a prestigious family.

856
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,200
Even if he doesn't like Ye Lai,

857
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,760
he will show due respect to her family.

858
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,440
Very pleased to meet you!

859
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,600
- Very pleased to meet you, too!
- What are you doing here?

860
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,960
I basically got Qian Cheng to work in Qing'ai

861
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,520
by tricking his parents.

862
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,720
I must come as a representative
of Qing'ai to show our gratitude.

863
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,960
Quite right.

864
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
- Come here.
- What's up?

865
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,280
Come here.

866
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,600
Attention please!

867
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,000
I'm going to marry William!

868
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Your brother will kill us.

869
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,160
Your family members are all here today.

870
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,480
Your brother is here, too!

871
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,440
I'm leaving!

872
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,480
See you! See you!

873
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,320
William!

874
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,840
Don't run!

875
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:29,880
Stop!

876
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,920
It's so good to be young!

877
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Let's get some fresh air outside.

878
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:42,920
Oh!

879
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Is this the same Qian Cheng
who fights with me every day?

880
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:46,680
Yes,

881
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,520
this is Qian Cheng before the accident.

882
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,280
This is Qian Cheng who has found his love.

883
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,480
He used to be like that.

884
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Ye Lai

885
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,360
has brought him back.

886
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
Congratulations!

887
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,080
Congratulations!

888
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,680
It's almost done.

889
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,240
The ceremony will begin in half an hour.

890
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
It will be done after some make-up on the cheeks.

891
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:19,260
(Make-up Area)

892
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,160
Poor little girl!

893
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,720
When the kid was declared dead, her mother

894
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,320
burst into tears.

895
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,160
It even became a trending topic.

896
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,640
It breaks my heart just hearing about it.

897
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,400
Master always said,

898
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,840
"Honor your parents when they are alive

899
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,760
or whatever you do
after they are dead is just nonsense."

900
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,840
This quote works for children, too.

901
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,280
If a child lived a lonely life,

902
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,880
the tears of a mourning parent

903
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
is nothing but emotional outburst.

904
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,240
May you become

905
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,640
an ordinary girl in your next life.

906
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,560
Have a free life

907
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,160
and be loved by everyone.

908
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,440
Come on.

909
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,160
Let's dress her up so that

910
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,680
she can go on her way decently.

911
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,880
It says that

912
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,320
this girl died of leukemia

913
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,120
and we have prepared a wig for her.

914
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
But it seems that

915
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,600
she still has a lot of hair.

916
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,640
Do we need the wig?

917
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:12,960
No,

918
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,960
I will braid her hair.

919
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,240
Why the hell am I

920
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,480
doing this with you?

921
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,560
Since I gave you the position of

922
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,320
William's date,

923
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,720
you should be grateful for that.

924
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,760
You don't want to

925
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,040
be his date at all.

926
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,400
You gave me something you dislike.

927
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,440
Why should I be grateful?

928
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,360
William is a living man, isn't he?

929
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,280
And I gave him to you.

930
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,640
Stop complaining.

931
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,080
Why do you dislike William?

932
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,360
It's not William that I dislike.

933
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,280
I dislike everyone.

934
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:10,120
Dating isn't as interesting
as shipping drama couples.

935
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,520
No matter whom you are dating,

936
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,240
it may result in a break-up.

937
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,800
But shipping drama couples is not the same.
How good is that?

938
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
But the couple you ship may go solo.

939
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,480
It doesn't matter.

940
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,120
There are so many couples.

941
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440
I can find a new couple to ship.

942
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,640
You are such a bad fan.

943
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,120
Yes, I'm a faithless couple fan.

944
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,600
I'm happy and willing.

945
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,640
What are we putting into these bags?

946
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,460
(Continuation of Life
Are You Willing to Be a Donor?)

947
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,760
Organ donation.

948
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,680
You doctors!

949
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,000
When you fail to save the patients,

950
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,720
you sell their organs.

951
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:43,560
Come here.

952
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,240
Come closer.

953
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
Dummy!

954
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,160
- Watch your mouth!
- Ouch, it hurts!

955
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm just kidding.

956
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,080
Hello, Wang Quande.

957
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,880
What's the matter?

958
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,480
OK, I see.

959
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,080
Look after her.

960
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,360
I'm going to find someone to help.

961
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,000
What's wrong?

962
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,680
I'm calling William.

963
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,440
What are you going to do?

964
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,200
What are you doing here?

965
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,920
Wang Quande told Cheng Weilan.

966
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,720
Cheng Weilan told William.

967
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,520
Then William told me.

968
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,000
That's how I got the news that

969
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,720
my girlfriend broke down at work

970
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,440
and called the police.

971
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,760
This shows that

972
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,920
our friends are not good at keeping secrets.

973
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,600
This shows that

974
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,320
our friends are concerned about you.

975
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,080
What happened?

976
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,760
Do you remember the girl

977
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,520
we searched for at the amusement park?

978
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,760
She passed away.

979
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,920
Though I have accepted life and death,

980
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,560
the death of a kid

981
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,160
still makes me sad.

982
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,040
But I found cyanosis caused by

983
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,400
the special drug on her body.

984
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,280
What?

985
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
That's why I called the police.

986
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,520
The medical examiner is examining her.

987
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,960
The drug used this time has been further upgraded.

988
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,120
The cyanosis on the nails couldn't be seen at all.

989
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
There was only a small patch on her back
and on her skin close to the neck.

990
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,720
She was just a kid.

991
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,560
Are you sure it was cyanosis
caused by the special drug?

992
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,320
The color of the cyanosis was very light.

993
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,360
But I just felt that something was wrong.

994
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,360
The child had chemotherapy,

995
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
but she didn't lose much hair.

996
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,960
Not only that, she and Mrs. Xu
were both in VIP wards.

997
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,600
Take this for testing.

998
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,000
If I'm not wrong,

999
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,080
more than one patient in the Second Hospital

1000
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,000
is taking the special drug.

1001
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,640
Fortunately, her mother didn't
sign the donation consent form.

1002
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,720
Otherwise, her organs

1003
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,240
would be transplanted to another patient.

1004
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Maybe somewhere we don't know,

1005
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,480
some donors who had taken the special drug

1006
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,320
have completed the donation.

1007
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,800
I don't even want to think about the outcome.

1008
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,920
While working here,

1009
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,040
I've heard plenty of

1010
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,240
good and bad stories.

1011
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,640
But I never thought that

1012
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,080
people would be so insane

1013
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,840
to use a 12-year-old girl

1014
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,120
who had terminal illness

1015
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
for drug testing.

1016
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,280
As a man,

1017
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,720
I really want to beat their brains out.

1018
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Ye Lai!

1019
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,480
Ye Lai!

1020
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,920
Get up!

1021
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,360
- Let me go!
- Get up!

1022
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,400
Let me go!

1023
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,320
Let me go!

1024
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,880
Ye Lai!

1025
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,440
Where are you?

1026
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,720
Where is Ye Lai?

1027
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,880
- What did you do to Ye Lai?
- Stop yelling!

1028
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,040
Let her go!

1029
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Stop yelling!

1030
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,600
If we can't get the ransom,

1031
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
both of you will die.

1032
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,240
What? Do you want to try me?

1033
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,480
Do you want to have a look

1034
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,720
at how your girlfriend is being tortured?

1035
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,160
Qian Cheng!

1036
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,440
All of you who are dating

1037
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,800
should stop hurting me!

1038
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,160
Are you OK?

1039
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,960
Are you OK?

1040
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,160
I'm fine.

1041
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,760
I just had a nightmare.

1042
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,440
Why are you sweating so much on your forehead?

1043
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,000
And your hands are so cold.

1044
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,680
Shall I make an appointment with Chief Fan

1045
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,920
to give you some counseling?

1046
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:12,880
No, thanks.

1047
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,680
I'm just a little tired.

1048
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,040
Qian Cheng,

1049
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,520
do you still love Ye Lai?

1050
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,240
I don't know.

1051
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,240
When I saw her,

1052
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,240
I felt like I had gone back in time.

1053
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,440
It was as though those awful things

1054
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,560
never happened.

1055
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,360
And we were still the same as before.

1056
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,320
But just now,

1057
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,840
I had a nightmare.

1058
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,960
Where is the Young Master?

1059
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,400
Just like you,

1060
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,680
he is spending time with his girlfriend.

1061
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,200
Why do all of you

1062
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,920
like dating so much?

1063
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,280
All of you are indulging in love
and can't control yourselves.

1064
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,160
I'm the only one left

1065
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,320
taking care of Qing'ai.

1066
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,280
I'm supporting it
with my handsome face and talent.

1067
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,520
It would be nice if you could support yourself.

1068
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Xue Zaozao called me to let you know that

1069
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,880
if you keep pestering his sister,

1070
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,680
you will have another compensation.

1071
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,400
Ask Xue Zaozao

1072
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,200
how much he is going to pay me this time.

1073
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,320
Not only that,

1074
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,440
it is his sister who pursues me.

1075
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,680
How could he blame me for it?

1076
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,720
You must protect me.

1077
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,040
Don't worry.

1078
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,880
I'll buy you an electric wheelchair.

1079
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,160
Should I be grateful to you?
