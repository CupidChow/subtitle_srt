00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,560
You've spent all your money on her.

174
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,000
What would you do

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,640
if she passed away?

176
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,160
She's never met her father

177
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,800
(Bad stomach will lead to bad sleep)
since she was born.

178
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,120
Her mom passed away, too.

179
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
I rescued her from the womb

180
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,160
of her dead mother.

181
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,760
I guess it's destined.

182
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,160
I'll take care of her for the rest of her life.

183
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,480
I'll take care of her as long as she is alive.

184
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll take care of her anyway.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,080
I saved her at that time after all.

186
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,640
(Traditional Chinese Medicine Department 2)
Hello.

187
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,360
Is this the second room
of the Chinese medicine department?

188
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, where should I queue?

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,040
Who should I give my registration number to?

190
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,200
Okay, thank you.

191
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,360
What disease are you here for?

192
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,040
A rare disease.

193
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,800
What is it?

194
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,240
Master.

195
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,480
Girl.

196
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
Can I add you on WeChat?

197
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,800
Let's be friends.

198
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,920
Can you contribute to my funeral?

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,160
Yes.

200
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,440
Then I'll add you on WeChat.

201
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,800
Here.

202
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,040
Good friends. Come on.

203
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,320
Keep in touch, okay?

204
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,080
Okay.

205
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,480
You master will definitely not agree to you

206
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,240
having a boyfriend who is anemic
and suffers from migraine.

207
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,080
Even if we're normal friends,

208
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,240
he should contribute 500 Yuan at my funeral.

209
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,440
You don't get it.

210
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,640
I'm making the last bit of money
I can for my master.

211
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
Of course, I need make some more friends.

212
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
You don't get it.

213
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,200
Master, wait for me!

214
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,040
Jin Xiaoyu.

215
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,720
Jin Xiaoyu.

216
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,280
This is Officer Su.

217
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
He's in charge of the case of the bus
that fell off the bridge.

218
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,280
He wants to take your statement.

219
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,800
Oh.

220
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,720
Hello, Officer Su.

221
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,200
Hello, my name is Su Jiafan.

222
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,360
I'm here to ask you

223
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,280
about the bus that fell off the bridge.

224
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,280
Yes, I see.

225
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,420
(Morgue)

226
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,840
Is Xiaoyu okay?

227
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,080
Master said she suffered only minor injuries.

228
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,120
She should be back soon.

229
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,600
Sorry,

230
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,160
you can't come here.

231
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,120
Let us take another look!

232
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,040
We're going to start working.

233
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,840
- Could you wait outside for a moment?
- Please, let us have a look!

234
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,640
Let us have another look!

235
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,440
- The make-up artist will come later to do the make-up.
- Just one more look!

236
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,280
Could you wait until the make-up is done?

237
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,560
He'll look different with the make-up.

238
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
He'll not be him with the make-up.

239
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,560
Let's have another look, please!

240
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
Hurry up, then.

241
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,960
Thank you.

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,640
Son.

243
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,240
Son.

244
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,080
Son.

245
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,880
He's still alive!

246
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,140
Doctor.

247
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,400
(Funeral processions not allowed)
He's still alive. Look.

248
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,200
Please be quiet.

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,480
Look, he's still alive!

250
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,720
He's still alive.

251
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
Ma'am, please give way.

252
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,240
- Ma'am, let me check on him.
-Please help him!

253
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,840
Please help him!

254
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
Please help him!

255
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,200
He reacted just now!

256
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,880
- Ma'am.
- Please save him!

257
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,080
I'm very sorry
for the untimely death of your child,

258
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,480
but I've just checked.

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,800
He doesn't have a pulse.

260
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,760
That's impossible.

261
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,360
He must still be alive.

262
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,360
A dead person's muscles would gradually relax.

263
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,400
Thus air would often come out,

264
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
causing vomiting

265
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,680
or burping.

266
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,600
We call it fake life.

267
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,560
This is also often seen in the emergency room.

268
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,120
I have a friend who is
the chief of the emergency department.

269
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,800
Every year,

270
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,480
they would see this four or five times.

271
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,280
No, he's not dead!

272
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,200
I know how you feel.

273
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,080
Let's see.

274
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,000
How about this?

275
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
We'll postpone the cremation.

276
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,160
And if you're still not sure,

277
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,480
you can make an emergency call again.

278
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,760
Call now!

279
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,200
Call 120!

280
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,120
How many times has our master told you?

281
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,800
Firstly, family members
are not allowed to enter the morgue.

282
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,560
Secondly,

283
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,520
when you encounter an issue, don't panic,

284
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
don't retreat, and not scream.

285
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,600
What's going on?

286
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,320
I heard you guys screaming.

287
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,880
I could hear it from the front door.

288
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,960
I-It wasn't my fault.

289
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,800
The body moved just now.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,560
The family members said they'd call 120

291
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
and have them come check it out.

292
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,800
What's so strange about a corpse moving?

293
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,080
I've even witnessed a corpse sitting up
while having its make-up done.

294
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,320
I didn't act like you two.

295
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,120
Can you two be more professional?

296
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,280
Call the director as soon as possible.

297
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,160
Deal with it promptly.

298
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,360
- Okay.
- Okay.

299
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,080
Take the body away.

300
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,040
Please cooperate.

301
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,520
Let a doctor check on him.

302
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,520
Son.

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
My son.

304
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,840
These kids are such wimps.

305
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,600
What are you two doing here?

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,440
Two bodies were sent from the second hospital.

307
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Master asked me to bring them here.

308
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,080
Do you know them?

309
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
He saved people in the bus this morning,

310
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,400
including me.

311
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,280
I waited for him at the hospital for so long.

312
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,280
I guess karma doesn't always come.

313
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,200
No wonder.

314
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,120
Master asked me to bring them to you.

315
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,360
He's young

316
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,440
and handsome.

317
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,920
And so warmhearted.

318
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,960
Bad things happen to good people.

319
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:57,520
And this one?

320
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,080
One saved lives.

321
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,200
One harmed others.

322
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,680
Neither the hero nor the wicked survived.

323
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,040
Master didn't know who

324
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,800
I was waiting for.

325
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
So he asked you to bring them both to me.

326
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,840
Where are his family members?

327
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,200
They didn't come.

328
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,000
The hospital doesn't have
any information about him, either.

329
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,240
The coroner sent it to us after the examination.

330
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Let's wait for his family to come and get him.

331
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Master also bought him a cheap suit

332
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,600
for him to change into later.

333
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,480
He saved your life.

334
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,920
Master said we should give him what he deserves.

335
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,600
That's very considerate of our master.

336
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's do it.

337
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,520
Thank you

338
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,400
for not giving up on me just because
I'm nearing the end of my life.

339
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,400
If you were still alive,

340
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,520
you would have had a better and longer future.

341
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,020
(Life can end. Devotion never ends.)

342
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,520
This is the Qing'ai Group.

343
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,120
The fashion empire that's cofounded by

344
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,160
Jiang Baiju and Mrs. Dao.

345
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,000
Four generations of the Dao family
have guarded Jiang Baiju.

346
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,520
Not long ago, Mrs. Dao

347
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,640
handed over the position
of the fourth-generation guardian

348
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,320
to her grandson, Dao Ruifeng.

349
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,240
Put it down.

350
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,680
You scared me.

351
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
How many times has the young master told us

352
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
not to touch his work desk!

353
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,240
I haven't seen him for a day.

354
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,520
I'm just reminiscing about him.

355
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,440
I found the young master.

356
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,600
You found the young master?

357
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,720
Let's go!

358
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,320
Go get him.

359
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,560
What are you waiting for?

360
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,040
We can't go.

361
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,520
Why?

362
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,400
He is staying in a place
that's not proper for us to go during the day.

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,560
We'll go rescue him at night.

364
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,120
I'm telling you.

365
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,560
In this world, there is no place I can't go to

366
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,240
except for the ladies' room.

367
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,360
It's a morgue.

368
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
A morgue?

369
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,480
I will do the make-up according to the photo.

370
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,640
The ceremony is tomorrow, right?

371
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,520
Yes, it is.

372
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,320
(Cosmetics)
Sorry for your loss.

373
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,320
Although he is my father,

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm not sad at all.

375
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,480
There are times when people feel this way.

376
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Sometimes the death of a loved one
hasn't hit you yet.

377
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,160
Grief can sometimes be delayed.

378
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
Maybe it'll hit you

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,280
when you go back home and look at

380
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,480
the things you two shared

381
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,120
and recall the things you two did.

382
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,000
We didn't live together.

383
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,840
The things he left behind are also few.

384
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,320
Miss Jin.

385
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,880
The police told me

386
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
he almost killed a bus full of people.

387
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,040
Finally, it was a courageous passenger

388
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,360
that sacrificed himself to save everyone else.

389
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
I couldn't believe what they told me.

390
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,480
He left home when I was very young.

391
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,920
I remember him as a very dedicated doctor.

392
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,520
He always told me that
he must save lives and help the injured.

393
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,280
He would try to save every patient.

394
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,880
Who exactly is this man?

395
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,880
How could my father harm anyone?

396
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,360
He did almost kill us.

397
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,240
I was on the bus.

398
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,920
I understood something after working here.

399
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,640
Everything becomes pointless after a person dies.

400
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,080
It doesn't matter if the person was good or evil
when he was alive.

401
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,480
The moment he died,

402
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,600
nothing matters anymore.

403
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,040
He's gone

404
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,920
if you love him.

405
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,680
He's gone if you hate him.

406
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
All the joy and sorrow

407
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,160
fall on us living people.

408
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,320
They don't feel anything.

409
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,240
I'm sorry.

410
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,440
Whatever he's been through all these years

411
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,680
is no reason for him to do harm to other people.

412
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,520
I apologize for what he has done.

413
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,440
It's not necessary.

414
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,200
You are who you are.

415
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,240
Your father was who he was.

416
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,160
Like I just said,

417
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,880
a person feels nothing after they are dead.

418
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,200
Our love and hatred can't do anything to him.

419
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,480
And there is no need

420
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,040
to let a dead person
affect the lives of the living.

421
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,680
You still have a long life ahead.

422
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,000
Don't worry.

423
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,640
Thank you.

424
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,780
(Mourning Hall)

425
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,960
Thank you, Master.

426
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,800
That's the least I could do.

427
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,280
He saved your life.

428
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,920
We're supposed to burn some joss paper for him.

429
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a token of appreciation.

430
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,600
All right.

431
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,920
I'll do the rest.

432
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,920
You should go home and rest.

433
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,160
I'll be on duty tonight.

434
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,960
Those cowards.

435
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,920
They put a girl on duty again.

436
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,160
But

437
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,680
there are people from
other departments on duty, too.

438
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,440
Remember to call them if anything happens.

439
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Don't you believe I can work at night?

440
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,720
Go home and rest.

441
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,920
I'll leave now.

442
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,720
Handsome John Doe.

443
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,080
Thank you for saving me today.

444
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,000
I hope you won't meet any crazy people again

445
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,280
in your next life.

446
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
Be safe and sound.

447
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,080
Be healthy and well.

448
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,160
Don't be so handsome in your next life, too.

449
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
Just look average.

450
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,320
Also, I hope you don't encounter any hardships.

451
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,080
Just live your life peacefully

452
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,160
as an ordinary person.

453
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,400
I will definitely go to your funeral.

454
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
I'll contribute some money

455
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
and pay my respects to you.

456
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,600
Where am I?

457
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,160
What time is it?

458
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,200
No way.

459
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,400
It's eleven o'clock.

460
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,720
I have to go back now.

461
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,620
(Life can end. Devotion never ends.)

462
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,180
(Bus drowned  Male)

463
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
Help! He's risen from the dead!

464
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,320
Help!

465
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,480
Help!

466
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,200
He's risen from the dead!

467
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,520
Help!

468
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,160
Help!

469
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,240
Help! He's risen from the dead!

470
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,280
Help!

471
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,560
He's risen from the dead!

472
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,400
He's risen from the dead!

473
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,320
He's risen from the dead!

474
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:26,800
This doesn't look good.

475
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,240
Let's go.

476
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,160
Take it.

477
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,760
I can't do it.

478
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,440
I can do it.

479
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,400
Young Master.

480
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,440
Is there no better way

481
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,760
to stop this mutation?

482
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,160
Luckily, we got here in time.

483
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,600
Yes, there is.

484
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,800
You resign immediately

485
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,640
when he wakes up.

486
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,220
(Make-up room)

487
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:21,920
You're here.

488
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
My brother's men
will come here later to take care of things.

489
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,800
He'll nag at us again.

490
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,600
It's time.

491
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,280
My dear princess.

492
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,720
Let me pull...

493
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,400
Stop your nonsense.

494
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,960
Hurry up.

495
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,840
Pull out the knife for you.

496
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,520
What's taking him so long to wake up?

497
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,080
How old is our young master?

498
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,560
You think he can recover

499
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,440
so quickly like me?

500
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
Who stabbed me just now?

501
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,720
- He did it.
- He did it.

502
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,800
He did it.

503
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,280
Not bad.

504
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,360
Eight rings.

505
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,440
Thank you for your compliment.

506
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,320
Sorry, Young Master.

507
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,360
We came late.

508
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,600
We didn't expect you to have an accident.

509
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,120
Neither did we expect you to take the bus.

510
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,480
That's right.

511
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,000
That's why it took us a while to find you.

512
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,840
I got your information while I was buying flowers.

513
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,600
And then I went straight there.

514
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,800
Young Master.

515
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,560
Why did you fall into the water to save others?

516
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Don't bring it up.

517
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,840
I didn't get any information
from the person I was looking for

518
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
and almost killed the people on the bus.

519
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,520
Where is the girl?

520
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,640
William hit her.

521
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,120
Qian Cheng stopped her before I did it.

522
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,200
She saw the way you mutated.

523
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,080
She must be dealt with.

524
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,640
Young Master, this is too much risk.

525
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,480
It's too dangerous to keep her alive.

526
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,800
She must be physically destroyed.

527
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
He's risen from the dead! Help!

528
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,400
He's risen from the dead!

529
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,280
Leave her.

530
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,760
Leave her?

531
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Is this the love at first sight experience

532
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,320
we've heard about in stories?

533
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,920
Young Master, I'm serious.

534
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,640
It's too dangerous to keep her alive.

535
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,480
He's right.

536
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
She saw the way you mutated.

537
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,680
If word gets out, I'm afraid it'll cause trouble.

538
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,920
I believe

539
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,160
you two can handle it.

540
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,080
I want to resign.

541
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,160
Why is there so much water?

542
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,440
Master!

543
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,040
Oh my!

544
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,280
You scared me.

545
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,480
You're a girl.

546
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,080
Can you not always be so impatient?

547
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,760
Where is he?

548
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
Where is the body? The body ran away?

549
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,440
You're out of your mind.

550
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,120
Can a corpse run away?

551
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,040
His family took the body away.

552
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,120
His family?

553
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:20,520
Yeah.

554
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,800
No way.

555
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,760
No.

556
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,720
It wasn't a dream.

557
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,080
Master, where is the registration form?

558
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,640
At the office.

559
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,640
I need to go.

560
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,680
What's wrong with this kid?

561
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,640
She's so strange.

(Corpse registration)
(Name of the dead: Qian Jin  Address: Qing'ai Building)

563

Qing'ai Building.

564
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
Why are you taking a picture of this?

565
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,200
This is the man who saved my life.

566
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,800
I have to go find him.

567
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640
I'm leaving now, Master.

568
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,720
You haven't had your medicine yet!

569
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,200
Chief Zhang.

570
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,320
Let me ask you something.

571
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,440
Can you show me

572
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
the surveillance footage of the morgue last night?

573
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,240
What's the matter?

574
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:17,880
Nothing.

575
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,200
I just lost something there.

576
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,320
Wait a minute.

577
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,040
I'll show it to you.

578
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,600
Thank you.

579
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,440
Take a look at last night's surveillance footage
of the building next to us.

580
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,320
Okay.

581
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,800
What happened?

582
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,160
Xiaoyu.

583
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,480
The surveillance system in your building
broke down last night.

584
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,440
Did something happen?

585
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,680
The surveillance system broke down?

586
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,360
It stopped working at around eleven.

587
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,600
If you hadn't come to me,

588
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,960
I wouldn't have known it was broken.

589
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,040
I need to take someone to check it out.

590
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,800
Lou, stay here and stay guard.

591
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,240
Okay.

592
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,920
Thank you.

593
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,040
Something is wrong.

Hello.

- Hello.
- Excuse me.

599
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,280
Is your president working today?

600
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,120
I don't know.

601
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,800
You can make your enquiries at the front desk.

602
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,400
This way.

603
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,240
Okay. Thank you.

604
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:12,920
You're welcome.

605
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:15,840
Hello.

606
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,040
Hello.

607
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
How can I help you?

608
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,720
I'd like to speak to Mr. Qian Cheng.

609
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,920
Do you have an appointment with Mr. Qian?

610
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,560
I called him but he didn't answer.

611
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,720
So I came to see him.

612
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm sorry.

613
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,680
I suggest you make an appointment
with Mr. Qian in advance.

614
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,640
Otherwise, we can't let you go upstairs.

615
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,560
It's like this.

616
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,280
I'm here for Qian Cheng's brother.

617
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,160
Maybe it's his younger brother.

618
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,760
Anyway, he has a brother, right?

619
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
You're talking about the senior Mr. Qian?

620
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,680
He doesn't work in our company.

621
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,920
Yes, that's right. The senior Mr. Qian.

622
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,400
The senior Mr. Qian.

623
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,320
He's dead.

624
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,120
What?

625
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,800
Did something happen to him?

626
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,560
Don't you know?

627
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,960
Oh, no.

628
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,120
Is this a secret?

629
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,080
Anyway,

630
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm here to see Qian Cheng

631
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,440
and ask him about his brother's funeral.

632
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,360
No way.

633
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,520
Didn't the senior Mr. Qian go on vacation?

634
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,520
He left last week.

635
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,480
He hasn't come back yet.

636
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,440
Did something happen to him abroad?

637
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,080
Wait a minute.

638
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,840
You said

639
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Qian Cheng's brother

640
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,000
went abroad last week and hasn't come back yet?

641
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,160
Don't you look through the news on Weibo?

642
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,720
The senior Mr. Qian has a Weibo account.

643
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,120
His big brother's name is Qian Jin?

644
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,160
No, he's not.

645
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,640
His name is Qian Tu.

646
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,040
He's the president of
Zhaoyan Tourism Company Group.

647
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,200
Thank you.

(OnMyWay)

650
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,880
I checked Qian Jin's medical records for you.

651
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,920
Our hospital system has no record of this man.

652
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,400
He didn't come to our hospital
for medical treatment before.

653
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,400
Weilan.

654
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,320
Do you know about the Qing'ai Group?

655
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,200
Yes.

656
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,960
It's an impressive fashion group.

657
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Its clothes are very expensive.

658
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,480
Why do I feel like I've heard

659
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,680
you talk about this company before?

660
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,080
Oh, yeah.

661
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,280
The company

662
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,560
has worked with the Disability Association before.

663
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,600
They hired disabled employees.

664
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,440
When our group was first established,

665
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,920
they spent a lot of money

666
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,960
to help us advertise.

667
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,680
It's a company
that's very willing to do charity work.

668
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,600
You know what?

669
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,760
The CEO of the group, Qian Cheng,

670
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,120
once won the Outstanding Youth Volunteer Award.

671
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,880
Ten years ago,

672
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,640
he saved a female student who was kidnapped.

673
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,240
And he was injured

674
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,080
when he fought with the criminal.

675
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,720
Why do I always feel that

676
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,400
that guy is not Qian Cheng's brother?

677
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:35,960
That won't be true.

678
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,320
Brothers?

679
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
They don't look alike.

680
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,480
They didn't have a memorial service at the morgue?

681
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,360
No, they didn't.

682
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,960
They just took the body away.

683
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,720
But I really wanted to know

684
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
who was the man that saved my life.

685
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,120
So I called the number
that was left on the register.

686
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,320
But the secretary answered.

687
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,360
I didn't get any useful information.

688
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,200
Then I went to his company and walked around.

689
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,880
I didn't see him there, either.

690
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,200
But I still feel suspicious.

691
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,280
I think

692
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,600
you should visit Dr. Xu
of the psychology department.

693
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,280
I think you have post-traumatic stress disorder.

694
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,240
What?

695
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,320
What stress disorder?

696
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,280
Why don't you believe me?

697
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,120
I told you.

698
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
I saw a corpse

699
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,320
come back to life.

700
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,120
Coincidentally,
the surveillance didn't work that day.

701
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
How can there be such a coincidence?

702
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,720
Come on.

703
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,760
Your profession at least

704
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,360
has something to do with medical knowledge.

705
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,400
Can you stop fooling around?

706
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,000
Didn't you say

707
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,680
there is some kind of charity staff position
in Qing'ai Group?

708
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,320
What do they do?

709
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,960
There are long-term and short-term positions.

710
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,440
I don't know much about it.

711
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,160
You need to talk to
their contact person to find out.

712
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,080
Then if I want to do it,

713
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:35,800
can you help me?

714
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
Do you have a fever?

715
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,670
I'm going to work. Wait a minute.

716
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,840
I haven't finished yet, Weilan.

717
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,640
Weilan! Weilan!

718
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,200
What's the situation?

719
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,800
The patient is bleeding profusely.

720
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
Take him to the emergency room.

721
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,920
What's going on here?

722
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,720
He consumed fake alcohol.

723
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,600
(Emergency Room)
It's all right.

724
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
Doctors really have it hard.

725

(Qing'ai Group)

728
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,600
(Order for Arrest)

729
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,480
A wanted man?

730
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,760
(Gao Guofu's personal information sheet)
After he died,

731
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,520
his family saw the photo on the news

732
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,440
and came to identify the body.

733
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
Only then did they unearth
the criminal record of that year.

734
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
Twenty years ago, the country's internet

735
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,920
wasn't as developed.

736
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,760
Many places were not well-informed.

737
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,760
So the police

738
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,040
(Li Changcheng's resident ID)
didn't find out his true identity.

739
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,920
No wonder he was so emotional.

740
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,760
Dozens of people died.

741
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,600
It's been 20 years.

742
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,960
We should still be careful next time.

743
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,360
I was too reckless this time.

744
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,360
The problem is that the information
you're looking for

745
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,280
is really too long ago.

746
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
From the Liberation until now,

747
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,160
there were wars,

748
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,880
social unrest

749
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,680
and economic reform.

750
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,440
A lot of information is no longer available.

751
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,600
Let me and William help you.

752
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,840
I can do it myself.

753
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,160
Just let your brother help me check the news.

754
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:38,960
Where is William?

755
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,120
Boss.

756
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,440
Have you forgotten

757
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,680
about the unprecedented debut show

758
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,800
by our third-generation designers tonight?

759
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,120
I've been paying attention to this.

760
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,200
I totally forgot about "Princess" William.

761
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,920
I don't know if it's unprecedented.

762
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,400
But I do know

763
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,400
if William messes up this show,

764
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,600
his grandmother will make his family extinct.

765
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,040
Yeah.

766
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,120
That's why he's trying his best
to memorize the questions right now.

767
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,600
(Qing'ai Group)
What about the second-generation designer Dao Lan?

768
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,160
His nephew is in the new designer competition.

769
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,640
Why isn't he here yet?

770
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,960
Mr. Dao's flight for tonight is delayed.

771
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,080
But don't worry.

772
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,480
He can make it to the finale in time.

773
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,240
Did you find out the identity of the girl?

774
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,920
Jin Xiaoyu. She's from this city.

775
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,800
(Jin Xiaoyu's personal information)
24-year-old.

776
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,440
Blood type B, Aries.

777
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,880
She's a mortuary makeup artist.

778
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,600
Her mother died giving birth to her.

779
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,400
No information about his father.

780
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,440
She has two emergency contacts.

781
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,360
One is named Ge Dacheng.

782
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,520
The other is Cheng Weilan.

783
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,320
She suffers from a rare disease

784
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,200
that could not be cured.

785
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,960
(Jin Xiaoyu's appointment records)
She made several phone calls

786
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,000
to the number I left.

787
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
She also came looking for me at the company.

788
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,400
I neither answered her call

789
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,280
nor met her.

790
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:46,960
It's okay.

791
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,120
She'll find a way to find me.

792
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,880
So you're saying she'll come back?

793
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,640
We already cleaned up the place.
Is she still suspicious?

794
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,600
Or maybe she was on that bus on purpose.

795
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,280
I have a hunch

796
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,720
we'll see each other again.

797

(Make-up Room)

(Make-up and Beauty Area)

800
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:35,840
Ready?

801
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,120
Second senior brother.

802
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,760
Come take a look.

803
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,480
What's wrong?

804
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,360
This man died from drowning.

805
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,280
A person that has drowned

806
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,680
would usually look bloated.

807
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,760
And the color of livor mortis would also change.

808
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,320
After ten to twelve hours,

809
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,280
livor mortis would usually set in.

810
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,000
But look at him.

811
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,480
His body feels very elastic.

812
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,920
The muscle elasticity
is similar to that of a living person.

813
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,960
And look at his fingernails.

814
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,440
Looks like there are toxic residues.

815
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,840
Don't you think it's strange?

816
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,880
Didn't the coroner already examine the body?

817
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,960
All the sampling and testing

818
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,980
must be done

819
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,000
before it was sent to us.

820
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,680
Are you done?

821
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,320
Yes.

822
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
Then take it away.

823
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,200
It stinks.
