19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,360
How's she?

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,280
She won't pull through, I'm afraid.

21
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,880
None of her relatives has appeared.

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,440
I didn't know until today

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,320
that she has no family.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Last Wednesday,

25
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
she signed the donor files.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,080
I had expected that she

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
at least could live through this year.

28
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,520
This is a gift from Bed 13's patient.

29
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,840
All doctors and nurses that she knows

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,360
have received her gifts.

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,200
This is yours.

32
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,920
(Checkers)

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,760
The three young men

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,760
in your company must have been bewitched.

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,000
A master is needed

36
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,840
to drive out evil spirits.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,480
I only occasionally played checkers with her.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,080
I didn't expect that she would give me a gift.

39
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,860
(Operating)

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's play checkers tonight
to get through the midnight.

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,900
(Checkers)

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,760
So childish.

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,680
It's not 11 p.m. yet.

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,040
You won't be charged

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,080
for the extra time tonight.

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
You haven't told me

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,600
how was your day?

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,920
Just like that.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,560
Just like that?

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,600
Like what?

51
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,600
Why bother asking?

52
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,560
Are you my boyfriend?

53
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,480
As a friend,

54
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,880
can't I...

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,920
can't I ask?

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
Why will a friend bother asking so many questions?

57
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,640
Besides,

58
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,880
you have no idea about my business.

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes, I have no idea.

60
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,640
But

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,640
if I don't understand,

62
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
you could tell me about it.

63
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,640
You wouldn't understand even if I did.

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,640
Yes, I wouldn't.

65
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,960
If I can't, who can?

66
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,320
Can Lin Nuoyan understand?

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,040
Jiang Baiju, what are you doing?

68
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm feeling down today,

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,960
so I asked you out to play.

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,520
Why are you giving me an attitude?

71
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,560
Yes,

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
I'm just a puppet to amuse you.

73
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,040
I got it.

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm not qualified to share your feelings.

75
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,160
For me, sharing feelings

76
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
is a privilege given to my boyfriend.

77
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,360
You are not my boyfriend.

78
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,440
Why should I bother telling you that much?

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,400
What?

80
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,080
You want to enjoy the rights of a boyfriend

81
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,280
without being one?

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,080
And you,

83
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,440
who are you?

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,680
What about your Professor Lin?

85
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,000
You share your hardships at work with him.

86
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,760
And let him accompany you
to exorcise evil spirits,

87
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,800
and plant flowers together.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
You are enjoying your rights

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,880
as a girlfriend of him;

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,760
while asking me

91
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,480
to be your boyfriend.

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,160
How could you?

93
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,880
Why do you involve Lin Nuoyan in our relationship?

94
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,840
Why should I not involve him?

95
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,360
He just came to visit me.

96
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
There is nothing between us.

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,240
All right. All right.

98
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,280
Oh,

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,960
I shouldn't have

100
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,960
told you that much.

101
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I already told you.

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,680
I only want to date you.

103
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I've done nothing shameful.

104
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm perfectly open in all my actions.

105
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
I'll never be a two-timer.

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,520
It's eleven o'clock now. Where are you going?

107
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,600
To you,

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm just a tool to accompany you
to get through the midnight.

109
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,800
Right?

110
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,400
And to you,

111
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
I'm just a puppet for love.

112
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Right?

113
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,800
Jiang Baiju,

114
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,520
are you trying to pick a fight?

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,280
I don't want to pick a fight.

116
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,120
But that's what you're doing.

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,920
No, I'm not.

118
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,560
Yes, you are.

119
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,480
All right, let's have a fight then.

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,760
Don't you think it's a little despicable

121
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,520
for us to do that?

122
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,520
A little?

123
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,040
It's extremely despicable!

124
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm a little worried about Young Master.

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,080
Again!

126
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,640
You are always worried about him

127
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,160
after your mischief.

128
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,280
Then, why did you do that?

129
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,280
So hypocritical.

130
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,280
Why doesn't Young Master

131
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,360
dump Jin Xiaoyu?

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,640
Nonsense!

133
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,320
Jin Xiaoyu is the painkiller of Young Master.

134
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Jin Xiaoyu is taking advantage of that,

135
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,320
and enslaving the young master.

136
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,160
Poor Young Master.

137
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,200
Cheers!

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:23,920
Cheers!

139
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,960
You are rich.

140
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,520
You are handsome.

141
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,320
You have everything.

142
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,760
But God is not fair.

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,760
If God gave me beauty and wealth,

144
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
I could also

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
make you unable to leave me.

146
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,760
How shortsighted you are!

147
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,960
Shortsighted?

148
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,440
You think that so long as you are good-looking

149
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,320
and rich,

150
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,880
and live long,

151
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,040
you can do whatever you want to do,

152
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,920
and take whatever you are offered, don't you?

153
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,680
I just can't understand you.

154
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,760
You obviously have feelings for me...

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
You are leading me on.

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,600
Why?

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,480
I just want to

158
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,320
be in a relationship with you.

159
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,600
Why do you play cat and mouse with me?

160
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,600
I do love you.

161
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,200
What?

162
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
I do love you.

163
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm not leading you on.

164
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
Since you love me,

165
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,080
why do you...?

166
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,600
It's because you are not honest enough.

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
You just think your life is short,

168
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,880
and out of sympathy for life,

169
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,240
you want to have a relationship with me.

170
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,400
And you also know that

171
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
I don't come in contact with others

172
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,960
and won't be attracted to them.

173
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,280
These are all the reasons that

174
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,440
you want to be with me.

175
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,040
I know.

176
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,680
Yes,

177
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,960
the reasons are partly right.

178
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,040
But I do love you.

179
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,000
My love truly exists.

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Can't you feel?

181
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,160
I've told you.

182
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
For me,

183
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,040
if I get a soul mate, that will be my fortune.

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,920
If not, my fate.

185
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
Just a pair for a lifetime.

186
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
I'm not a puppet for love.

187
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,000
Neither am I the one

188
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,120
to play a daily kiss and cuddle game with you,

189
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
nor the one to hold you high.

190
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:43,920
You were right.

191
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,720
I don't understand you.

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,520
But you don't understand me, either.

193
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,960
Since we can't understand each other,

194
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,320
why do we have to be together

195
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,320
just for this objective reason?

196
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,520
Have you ever considered this?

197
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,200
Do you really love me,

198
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,360
or you have to love me?

199
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,120
I...

200
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,320
There may be other options for me.

201
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,920
That's right.

202
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,760
You want to be with me

203
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,360
just because you feel assured.

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
You can keep me in control.

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,000
I...

206
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I didn't respond to your love

207
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,840
just because

208
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,840
I still hadn't known

209
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,240
whether I truly love you

210
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,160
or you are my only option.

211
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,880
But today,

212
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,080
I'm quite clear that

213
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,680
I do love you!

214
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
But I can also love others.

215
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,920
Jiang Baiju, it's nearly midnight.
Where are you going?

216
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,600
Leave me alone for a while!

217
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,400
Jiang Baiju.

218
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,160
Let me tell you again!

219
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,000
I hate tricks!

220
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,520
Young Master.

221
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,440
Jiang Baiju!

222
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,160
Young Master,
are you sleeping in the dormant cabin tonight?

223
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,520
Jiang Baiju, Jiang Baiju!

224
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,360
Qian Cheng!

225
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
Jiang Baiju!

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Jiang Baiju!

227
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,200
I have something to write

228
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,120
in my serialized novel today.

229
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,440
Instead of being a busybody,

230
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,520
can't you do something else?

231
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,240
Not only am I a busybody,

232
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,720
I can also be a mischief-maker.

233
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,840
You were the one that talked about Lin Nuoyan?

234
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,720
It was Qian Cheng.

235
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,360
Not me!

236
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,720
I was just a supporting role.

237
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,760
Qian Cheng was the leading player.

238
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,720
You and Qian Cheng,

239
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
can't you two just be normal?

240
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,160
Brilliant!

241
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
Jiang Baiju...

242
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,520
(Clinic)

243
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,160
Zhang.

244
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,280
About the laundry,

245
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,760
don't be mad at my daughter.

246
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,680
Neither her father
nor I did well in educating her,

247
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
letting her develop

248
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,080
such a hot temper.

249
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm your care worker.

250
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,040
It's my responsibility to take care of you.

251
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,000
I will do well in

252
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
what I should do.

253
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,240
As to other affairs other than work

254
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,080
I will talk with Mrs. He.

255
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,080
Please take it easy.

256
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,800
All a man's life,

257
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,400
we have no command over ourselves.

258
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,040
We can't choose to live by our own will.

259
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
Neither can we choose

260
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,320
when and how to die.

261
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,600
Life and death are decreed by fate.

262
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,720
Wealth and rank are bestowed by Heaven.

263
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,280
How lucky you are!

264
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,720
You have such a filial daughter as Ma'am He.

265
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,920
Actually, it's rare.

266
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,960
Indeed!

267
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
All of them are filial kids.

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Zhang.

269
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Do you know anything about euthanasia?

270
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:05,920
It's nothing.

271
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,920
Don't be afraid.

272
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
I'm just curious.

273
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,200
Mrs. Xu,

274
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,400
I know nothing about euthanasia.

275
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,360
You'd better go to bed early.

276
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,360
As long as you follow the doctors' instructions,

277
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,040
you will recover very soon.

278
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,360
Tomorrow,

279
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,720
I will take you to bask in the sun again.

280
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,760
And we are going to

281
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,360
the lounge to chat with the others.

282
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,120
Just take a good rest today.

283
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,320
Don't be worried.

284
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,920
You keep saying

285
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
that you'll have a meal with me.

286
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,320
But it seems that

287
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
you have lost your appetite.

288
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,880
I do have no appetite.

289
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,720
I sense an emotional injury.

290
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
Why don't you tell me about it?

291
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:45,920
Yesterday，

292
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I might have hurt an innocent youth.

293
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,080
No.

294
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,720
Not a youth.

295
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,120
He should be an innocent grandpa.

296
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
Anyway, be it a youth or a grandpa,

297
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,560
he scolded me yesterday.

298
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,920
He said I treated him as a tool for love,

299
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,880
and that just because he is handsome and rich,

300
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,680
I neglected his inner beauty.

301
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,440
Isn't it ridiculous?

302
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,720
A handsome face and wealth

303
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
certainly, will attract all our attention.

304
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,600
I'm telling you,

305
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,160
just one word, go.

306
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
More words, go for him.

307
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,760
I can't have a conversation with you today.

308
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
I didn't do it on purpose.

309
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
(Lounge)
You didn't put your thermos cup at the right place.

310
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,720
How could you blame others for it?

311
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,560
Besides,

312
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,200
you didn't cover it properly.

313
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,080
There are so many people
going in and out of this lounge.

314
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,280
Who is to blame?

315
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,680
You're unreasonable!

316
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,200
I placed the cup beside me.

317
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
How's that not the right place?

318
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,920
Your daughter kicked my cup down,

319
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
yet you're behaving so rudely?

320
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,960
You know what?

321
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,720
Many precious herbs have been used for this soup.

322
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,600
How are you going to pay for it?

323
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,160
You two.

324
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,720
We're all here
just because we have patients in our families.

325
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,680
You were anxious.

326
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
And now, you are anxious too.

327
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,160
Could you two be more considerate
and stop arguing?

328
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
- Right.
- He is right. Right.

329
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,480
- No.
- No more arguing.

330
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm not arguing with her

331
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,640
because of this cup.

332
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,800
You allowed your daughter to run around.

333
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
If your child wasn't running about,

334
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,840
the soup wouldn't spill.

335
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,160
Is that humane speech?

336
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,600
My daughter is seriously ill.

337
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,760
It's only today

338
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,920
that she's slightly more energetic!

339
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:54,920
What's the matter with you?

340
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
If you don't want to stay here,

341
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,200
just go out.

342
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,480
Why should I go out?

343
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,000
Is your daughter the center of the whole world?

344
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,920
Yes, she is.

345
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,400
What's wrong?

346
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,200
- What's the matter?
- Dear.

347
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,240
The soup I made for Mom

348
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,120
got spilled by her daughter.

349
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,240
Isn't it just some water?

350
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,080
- I'll pay for it.
- Cool down, cool down.

351
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,760
Go ahead.

352
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,360
Stop!

353
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,600
It took me a whole night to make the soup.
How will you compensate for it?

354
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,440
Just go.

355
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,480
- Stop pulling me.
- All right, all right, all right.

356
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,160
It's just some water!

357
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,200
- Stop pulling me.
- It's just some water!

358
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
Look at her. How disgusting she is!

359
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,320
The kid just made some water spill by accident.

360
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,320
Disputes are inevitable.

361
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
- Look at her. How could she be so mean?
- Enough, enough.

362
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,880
Be tolerant.

363
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,040
Why did she get so mad?

364
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,400
It's just some water spilled by a kid.

365
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,760
- All right. Not a big deal.
- Wasn't it just some water?

366
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
Look at her!

367
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Unbelievable!

368
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm sorry.

369
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,280
It's all right.

370
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,080
I'm Bella.

371
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,240
I'm an actress.

372
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,560
What do you do?

373
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,440
My family name is Xu.

374
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,960
You can call me Granny Xu.

375
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,640
You aren't my granny.

376
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,440
You are trying to take advantage of me.

377
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,560
You look familiar.

378
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,440
I have acted in many shows.

379
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Just tell me.

380
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,800
What's your name?

381
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,880
Xu Nan.

382
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,560
Xu Nan.

383
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,240
Glad to meet you, Xu Nan.

384
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,760
We are friends now.

385
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,360
After I die,

386
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,760
I will meet you there,

387
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,480
and you must take good care of me.

388
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,520
Sure.

389
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,360
Sure.

390
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,280
What an unlucky day!

391
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,600
I haven't had a free meal,

392
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,920
and got involved in a quarrel.

393
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I'm speechless!

394
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,200
Xiaoyu.

395
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,640
Would you like to

396
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,880
have afternoon tea with me?

397
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,000
No, thanks.

398
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,840
I will do it myself.

399
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,360
Thank you.

400
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,320
Thanks.

401
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,400
We're both running out of time.

402
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,280
So, let's get straight to the point.

403
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,720
I heard you and Jiang Baiju
aren't getting along well.

404
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,880
What is the key problem?

405
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,240
We have nothing in common.

406
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,680
He doesn't understand me.

407
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,480
It seems that I don't understand him either.

408
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,480
Does it matter?

409
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,720
Look at me.

410
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,880
My husband,

411
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,360
he can't understand

412
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,800
my relationship with Jiang Baiju all his life.

413
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,680
Neither can he understand

414
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
my idea of running a family.

415
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,120
However, we love each other so deeply

416
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,320
that our love will never change until death.

417
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,720
But I heard from William that

418
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,680
at the nursing home,

419
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,200
three old gentlemen had a fight over you.

420
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Men are born

421
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,560
to fight over women,

422
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,280
just like women

423
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,840
willing to give birth to children for men.

424
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,640
Well...

425
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,520
Dear, you see...

426
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,240
It's like the two of us,

427
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,040
we have different ideas.

428
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,240
But this doesn't

429
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,200
make me like you less.

430
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,840
That's why,

431
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,680
for those who are in love,

432
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,920
they can overcome everything.

433
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,440
If they can't overcome it,

434
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,960
it only means they are not in deep love.

435
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,160
Not in deep love?

436
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,240
But I think

437
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,680
I'm already very sincere.

438
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
But I still can't become

439
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,600
a soul mate

440
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,920
just like what Jiang Baiju said.

441
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,480
"If I get a soul mate, that will be my fortune;

442
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,320
if not, my fate.

443
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,040
Just a pair for a lifetime."

444
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,560
I don't want to be...

445
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,600
I don't want to be that devoted.

446
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,120
Even if I am going to die very soon,

447
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,640
I still have many things to do.

448
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,560
I want to work hard and make money,

449
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,520
to save more money for my master.

450
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,040
And hang out with my friends.

451
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,480
He can't be the only focus

452
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,520
in my life.

453
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,440
I...

454
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,920
Poor kid.

455
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,440
Actually, you're not wrong.

456
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,160
Love is something that

457
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
can't be simply judged to be right or wrong.

458
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,600
Whom you love

459
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,760
and how to love,

460
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,560
it's just like dancing.

461
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,760
You can see that

462
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
what kind of dance steps we have,

463
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,000
and how well we danced,

464
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,360
only our partners

465
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,560
are qualified to judge.

466
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,400
Jiang Baiju said he loves me.

467
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,520
He finally said it?

468
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,240
He said he hadn't said it before

469
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
because he didn't understand whether

470
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,800
it is love or need.

471
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
But when we quarreled that day,

472
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,480
he said he loves me.

473
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
I was happy to hear that.

474
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,320
However, he said

475
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,280
something else later,

476
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,240
which made me feel that

477
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,120
my love

478
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,560
is not as passionate as his.

479
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,440
I do love him,

480
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
and he also loves me.

481
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,600
But Jiang Baiju and I...

482
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,080
I...

483
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:29,600
I...

484
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,560
It's just like

485
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,320
you saw a precious item,

486
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,040
but

487
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,520
you have no money to buy it.

488
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,240
Yes.

489
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
His love is so sincere,

490
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,160
so passionate,

491
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,600
and I feel that I'm not worthy of his love.

492
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,520
At that moment, I got to know that

493
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,120
my love to him

494
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:49,840
is not deep enough.

495
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,800
I didn't know how to

496
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,560
respond to him at all.

497
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,400
Let's have some food first.

498
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,820
(Data Sheet of Analysis on Radioactive Substances)

499
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,760
I only want to date you.

500
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,000
I've done nothing shameful.

501
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm perfectly open in all my actions.

502
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,280
I'll never be a two-timer.

503
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,680
It's eleven o'clock now. Where are you going?

504
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,400
To you,

505
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,080
I'm just a tool to accompany you
to get through the midnight.

506
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:24,960
Right?

507
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,600
Young Master.

508
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,360
Young Master.

509
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,240
Are you OK?

510
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,160
Does your heart hurt again?

511
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,400
What's up?

512
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,560
Is the report out?

513
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,440
Yes.

514
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,400
The second uncle has gathered

515
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
all data from the lab,

516
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,680
and an unknown

517
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,560
radioactive substance has been found.

518
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,480
Take a look.

519
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,160
Radioactive substance

520
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,040
has been found

521
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
in the extracts

522
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,280
from the murderer of the bus case

523
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,680
and the body of the epileptic

524
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,000
at the funeral home.

525
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
But I haven't found out what it is.

526
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,200
Qian Tu has made an appointment with Tan Yueran.

527
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,640
I don't know how it's going now.

528
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,080
The doctor named Zhao Shan

529
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
gave me a special medicine.

530
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,000
I didn't dare to take it at first.

531
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,840
Later, because of cardiac rejection,

532
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,960
I really couldn't bear the suffering any more.

533
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,200
So, I took one pill.

534
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,760
It alleviated my suffering very quickly.

535
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,240
From then on, I got addicted to it.

536
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,480
(Recording)
I knew it's bad to take medicine indiscriminately.

537
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,560
But I was really in low spirits

538
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,880
at that time.

539
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,320
Do you regularly go to the hospital

540
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,840
to fetch the medicine?

541
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,240
Yes.

542
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,760
Zhao Shan asked me to see him regularly.

543
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,160
And every time I went there,

544
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,960
a complete physical examination will be conducted.

545
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,520
Was...

546
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,280
Was there a physical examination
every time you went there?

547
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,800
Yes,

548
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,360
every time.

549
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,120
And a detailed examination as well.

550
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,120
Zhao Shan said that

551
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,920
they should be responsible for the patients.

552
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,040
Seeing that they are very careful,

553
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,760
I gradually gained confidence
in the special medicine.

554
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,120
Since you began to take the medicine,

555
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,120
when did you begin to have the dreams?

556
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,200
About

557
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,640
a month.

558
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,520
At that time,

559
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,520
I became interested in donors.

560
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,720
I also went to see a play.

561
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,000
It was a story of

562
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,680
a girl who had a heart transplant

563
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,440
dating the boyfriend of the donor.

564
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,400
Sounds awkward, doesn't it?

565
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,640
A little.

566
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,080
The play's name is "Amber".

567
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,880
It's very interesting.

568
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,560
Well,

569
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,160
I got to know

570
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,920
all that I need to know.

571
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,160
Thank you very much

572
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,320
for your help with our survey.

573
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,400
You're welcome.

574
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,880
I'm doing this for Jin Xiaoyu.

575
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,400
Thank you.

576
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,680
Madam.

577
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,160
You are a master of love.

578
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,360
Why don't you teach me?

579
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,640
How can love be taught?

580
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,240
Everyone has his or her own way.

581
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,080
Actually,

582
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,360
I don't think Jiang Baiju and you

583
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,480
have nothing in common.

584
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,520
If that was the case,

585
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,800
why did he fall in love with you?

586
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,720
It's just that you live in different times.

587
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,360
so, you have different views on love.

588
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,440
He

589
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,800
wants to share all his life

590
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,880
with you, and only you.

591
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,800
While you

592
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,680
want to share your life with

593
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,480
the whole world.

594
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,040
However,

595
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,040
if you really love each other,

596
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,720
these obstacles can be overcome.

597
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,720
I think that there is a wall

598
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,800
standing between Jiang Baiju and me.

599
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,320
I thought that if I had got to know him,

600
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,000
I would understand him.

601
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,360
But we are completely different.

602
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,840
I want to live, but he wants to die.

603
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,120
We are fundamentally

604
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,040
different.

605
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,440
What should I do?

606
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,320
You know what?

607
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,040
Jiang Baiju wanted to build a steel plant.

608
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,960
Such an old man!

609
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,480
He wants to try everything.

610
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,400
The reason why he wanted
to build a steel plant is that

611
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,360
he wanted to jump into a steelmaking furnace.

612
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,480
You're saying that

613
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
he wanted to commit suicide?

614
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,040
He said

615
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,960
when

616
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
he jumped into the steelmaking furnace,

617
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,720
he would destroy himself and rest in peace,

618
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,320
and even his strong self-healing power

619
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,000
could do nothing to it.

620
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,120
He's so cruel to himself!

621
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes.

622
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,680
You know what?

623
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,160
He has worked out many

624
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,760
similar suicide methods.

625
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,400
I have also read

626
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,320
many materials about this.

627
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,400
I can only say that

628
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,080
humans are terribly creative

629
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,200
in self-destruction.

630
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,280
Then why

631
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
didn't he manage to do that?

632
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,440
At first,

633
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
my father kept an eye on him.

634
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,600
My father was

635
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
an illiterate man living in the mountain.

636
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,360
His understanding of life is that

637
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,360
a living dog is better than a dead lion.

638
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,120
And Jiang Baiju

639
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,720
had been educated in college, which was rare.

640
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,320
You can image that my father would never

641
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,280
let such a man of national treasure

642
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,400
die just like that.

643
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,320
So,

644
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,760
he kept watching him every day.

645
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,080
Impossible!

646
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,200
Jiang Baiju is so stubborn!

647
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,120
Yes, you are right.

648
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,640
But my father

649
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,120
knew his

650
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,480
inner desire.

651
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,000
Young Master, don't!

652
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
I don't know who you are

653
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,000
and I don't know why

654
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
you're trying to do this.

655
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
I only want to ask you a question.

656
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,200
Do you want to live a life of an ordinary man

657
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,880
just like me even for just a day?

658
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,880
You can cry or laugh.

659
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,880
You can spend it with your beloved girl.

660
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,600
So long as you are alive,

661
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,240
you still have the chance to!

662
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,880
So,

663
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,560
sometimes, the most straightforward

664
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,720
and the simplest person,

665
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,880
is the craftiest one.

666
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,640
He can capture the secrets deep
in a man's heart even more.

667
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
My father

668
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,760
knew the young master's weakness.

669
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,520
He just wanted to live

670
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,560
like an ordinary man.

671
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,420
When I took my father's place

672
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,560
as the guardian of Young Master,

673
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,360
I got that spell from my father.

674
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,000
And now,

675
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,840
I'm passing this right

676
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,040
to you.

677
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm passing this spell to you as well.

678
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
So long as you are alive,

679
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,040
you have the chance to

680
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,840
become an ordinary man.

681
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,480
All right.

682
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,120
Jiang Baiju!

683
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,200
Jiang Baiju!

684
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,280
Jiang Baiju!

685
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,880
Jiang Baiju, come on!

686
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,080
I'll never say words like

687
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,520
I love you ever again!

688
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,520
I was wrong.

689
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,800
Silly girl.

690
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,840
I jumped because it hurts too much.

691
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
I want to be comfortable for a while.

692
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,520
I don't want this!

693
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,960
I don't want you to die!

694
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,080
No!

695
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
My Dad said...

696
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,920
My Dad said that so long as you are alive,

697
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,160
you have the chance to become an ordinary man.

698
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:22,920
He said...

699
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,240
He said his life's greatest wish is

700
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,360
to see you live a life of an ordinary man
even if for one day.

701
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,880
You will bleed.

702
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,880
You will get sick.

703
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,720
You will go to see a doctor.

704
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,760
For my sake,

705
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,160
for Dad's sake,

706
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,280
why don't we try harder together?

707
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,440
Xiuxiu.

708
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
I can't stand it anymore.

709
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
It really hurts.

710
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,920
Stop crying.

711
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,200
Your heart will hurt more.

712
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,440
Xiuxiu.

713
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,280
When my legs and ribs are broken,

714
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,800
my heart hurts less.

715
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,800
Help me!

716
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,440
Let me die!

717
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,440
I will let you die!

718
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
- I will let you die!
- Let me die!

719
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,600
- I will let you die!
- Let me die!

720
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,160
- I will let you die!
- Let me die!

721
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,360
I promise.

722
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,680
As long as I live,

723
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,560
I will think of a way to see you off.

724
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,040
Whether it's cutting your head off,

725
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,760
or burning you to ashes.

726
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,160
I will find a way.

727
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,240
But will you promise me?

728
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,320
Before I die,

729
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,600
let's try harder together, alright?

730
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,120
Don't give up on yourself.

731
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,720
Please!

732
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,400

00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,840
No!

735
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,080
I don't want you to die!

736
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Jiang Baiju, wake up!

737
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,600
Jiang Baiju!

738
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,280

Jiang Baiju, I love you!

741
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,320
You told me that

742
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,040
life is not valued

743
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,960
by its length or quality.

744
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,520
You told me that

745
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,680
human beings define love

746
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,840
in the same way whether men or women.

747
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm too young to

748

understand the feelings of your generation

749
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,280
or even your feelings.

750
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,840
But I love you.

751
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,680
It may not be as noble,

752
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,720

Our anniversary celebration

842
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,440

843

All celebrities have to take part in charity.

844

What they are fighting for

845

is the lead role,

846
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,800
and the chance to have their faces on the cover.

847

I think

848

we can just ignore them.

853
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,560

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
We invited more famous ones.

858
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,520
is limited to one third.

859
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,160
This target has basically been achieved.

860
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,000
In terms of cast,

861
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,880
we actually need

862
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
a female star that stands out.

863
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
We have Qin Rong, don't we？

864
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,520
Don't mention her.

865
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,640
Miss Xue threatened to have Qin Rong banned.

866
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
I don't know where she got

867
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,520
the evidence of data fraud

868
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,960
and threatened to discredit Qin Rong.

869
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,320
To appease Miss Xue,

870
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,160
Junior Mr. Dao is sending Qin Rong abroad

871
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,840
to stay away from trouble.

872
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,560
She is leaving today.

873
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,280
Dao Ruifeng.

874
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,880
Don't let me see you.

875
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,960
Take good care of yourself,

876
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,600
all right?

877
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,440
Wait for me to come back.

878
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:46,960
I'll wait for you for the rest of my life.

879
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,040
Let me tackle Xue Wanwan first

880
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,800
before having you back.

881
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,400
When you are abroad,

882
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,360
enjoy your time there for a while.

883
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,880
Okay?

884
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,320
Okay.

885
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:56,920
All right.

886
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,120
Go ahead.

887
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
Bye.

888
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,040
Bye.

889
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,760
Bye.

890
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,920
Dao Ruifeng!

891
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,960
Wanwan, why are you...?

892
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,720
You are such a jerk!

893
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:28,920
What are you doing?

894
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,680
Tell me what are you doing.

895
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,800
Seeing your love rival off.

896
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,560
Since you know she's my love rival,

897
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,520
why are you still seeing her off?

898
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
If I don't see her off,

899
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,880
will you have a chance?

900
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,800
I have sent her thousands of miles away.

901
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,760
All right,

902
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,280
we're both on our own from now on.

903
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,720
So, my little brother,
what do you want to eat for dinner?

904
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,360
It's my treat.

905
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,240
No, thanks.

906
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,920
You're eating.

907
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,560
You're eating!

908
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,200
How dare you say no?

909
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,640
Xiaoyu.

910
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,920
What are you doing here?

911
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,800
I have good news for you.

912
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,480
I'm going to be in a journal.

913
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
But not a medical journal.

914
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,920
A fashion one.

915
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,840
Finally, you are changing fields

916
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,680
to fashion,
selling your body rather than your arts.

917
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,480
It goes like this:

918
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,800
a fashion company

919
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,680
is having an

920
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,800
anniversary charity celebration.

921
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,560
Because we have worked with them before,

922
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,720
my hospital has been listed
as one of the sponsors.

923
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,760
And as one of the leads,

924
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm going to have an exclusive interview, and

925
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,880
will be on one of the inner pages.

926
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,960
I have never been in a journal before.

927
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,160
So, I'm a little nervous.

928
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,400
Why are you nervous?

929
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,040
You are one of the most handsome professors.

930
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,880
Really？

931
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,160
This won't do.

932
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,680
I still need

933
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,080
one of my peers beside me.

934
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,680
So, I've decided

935
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
to bring Dean Zhang with me.

936
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,840
The person we had a meeting with last time?

937
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,360
With him beside you,

938
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,920
you'll stand out like Daniel Wu,

939
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,080
and be absolutely outstanding!

940
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,400
Aren't I clever?

941
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,440
Come on.

942
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,000
What are we going to do on this floor?

943
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,080
To see a patient.

944
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,760
See that old man over there?

945
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
He's over eighty years old.

946
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,200
His family brought him here and went away.

947
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
They didn't pay the fees

948
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,760
or care about him.

949
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,200
They left him there to die.

950
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,160
What a pitiful man.

951
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,040
Then, who is taking care of him?

952
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,960
The kind nurses.

953
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,840
The hospital has called the police several times.

954
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,640
I heard from the nurses that

955
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,640
his family wants him to die here

956
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,520
so that they can extort the hospital.

957
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,280
Such horrible children!

958
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,800
That's why,

959
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,040
can't you see that Zhengchen and I are so filial?

960
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
Can't you cherish that

961
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,440
and cooperate with the doctor's instructions?

962
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,560
Stop thinking about
leaving the hospital all the time.

963
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,360
I understand now.

964
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,120
You brought me here

965
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,920
to see this old man

966
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,280
so as to teach me a lesson, right?

967
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,320
Look at how pitiful she is.

968
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,600
She got a kidney disease.

969
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,000
The father was a successful match.

970
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,040
But he ran away.

971
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,160
He would rather divorce

972
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,600
than to donate a kidney

973
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,760
to his daughter.

974
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
How miserable it is

975
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,320
to have such a family member.

976
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,520
Look at how well your mother treats you.

977
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,520
You should be more obedient from now on.

978
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,520
I will, I will.

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,560
It's best to finish work early in the morning.

993
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,400
Make sure the event goes smoothly.

994
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,120
Okay, okay.

995
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,040
Mr. Qian, Mr. Liu.

996
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,120
You worked hard.

997
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,000
It's our duty.

998
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,440
- Hello, Mr. Qian.
- Hello, Mr. Liu.

999
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,480
This is the buffet area.

1000
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,000
The activity space is in the middle.

1001
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,960
It will be marked out by the flower walls.

1002
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,640
The flower decorations will be

1003
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,240
completed on the morning of the celebration.

1004
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,400
Don't be too early.

1005
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,240
The flowers used for the previous event
were sent too early,

1006
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,840
and they were no longer fresh in the evening.

1007
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,960
We have used a new flower supplier this time.

1008
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,960
They can preserve the flowers better.

1009
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,720
The previous problems will be avoided.

1010
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,040
Qin Rong went abroad to see the doctor.

1011
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,160
Currently,

1012
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,840
we lack a first-rate female star

1013
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,080
that can captivate the whole venue.

1014
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:34,680
Right.

1015
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,480
It's a problem.

1016
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,760
So, do you know...

1017
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,320
- Mr. Dao.
- Mr. Dao.

1018
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,280
Mr. Dao.

1019
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:41,880
Continue.

1020
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,720
Qin Rong left.

1021
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
We lack a spokesperson because of that.

1022
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,200
Anything else?

1023
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,400
Several sponsors have withdrawn because of that.

1024
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,080
Let me tell you.

1025
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,960
Take it easy.

1026
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,880
I will have some buddies

1027
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,760
help us out.

1028
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,720
In no time,

1029
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,120
our guest for an inner page
is coming to try on clothes.

1030
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
I have to go now.

1031
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,720
I'm leaving you two in charge.

1032
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,000
Mr. Dao.

1033
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,360
These are

1034
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,000
all heat cleansing and thirst quenching.

1035
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,040
Trust me, dear.

1036
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,040
The way to a man's heart

1037
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,760
is through his stomach.

1038
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
Girls

1039
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,520
have no charm these days.

1040
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,680
They don't even know

1041
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,920
how to make soup or cook.

1042
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,480
Based on your logic,

1043
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,000
wouldn't chefs be the most charming people?

1044
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,200
Let me tell you, Madam.

1045
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,160
Boys

1046
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,800
cook for girls now.

1047
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,280
Independent women

1048
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,080
don't rely on cooking to find a boyfriend.

1049
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,560
Independent women and cooking,

1050
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,400
they don't conflict.

1051
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,360
Independent women also have to eat.

1052
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,760
Besides,

1053
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,720
cooking is

1054
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,120
a charming skill.

1055
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,080
A truly excellent girl

1056
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,720
wouldn't mind cooking and having children.

1057
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,720
She wouldn't mind sacrificing.

1058
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,680
Because,

1059
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,400
she knows how to fly a plane.

1060
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,640
She can be a judge.

1061
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,840
She can create an independent brand of her own.

1062
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,320
And then, become an elegant lady.

1063
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,200
She can do whatever she likes to do.

1064
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,160
Young Master.

1065
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,400
If there's nothing unexpected,

1066
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,960
I'm guessing you're thinking about Jin Xiaoyu.

1067
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,160
I paid for your school.

1068
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,240
But you spent your time studying fortune-telling?

1069
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,240
By the way,

1070
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,160
Lin Nuoyan is coming
for the meeting this afternoon.

1071
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,880
Be careful when you go out.

1072
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,960
Lock your door.

1073
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,280
Lin Nuoyan?

1074
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:46,880
Yes.

1075
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,600
He is one of the heads

1076
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,880
of the Association of Organ Donors.

1077
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,440
He's also the poster man.

1078
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,480
He is coming to try
on the clothes for the inner page.

1079
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,920
We'll discuss the contents of the interview too.

1080
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,680
Try on clothes?

1081
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,360
Will he wear the clothes I designed?

1082
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,480
Of course.

1083
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,720
Our clothes.

1084
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,680
The designer and the professor, his rival in love.

1085
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,360
What an interesting coupling!

1086
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,440
Young Master, watch out.

1087
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,920
You're back.

1088
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,000
How's the venue?

1089
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,840
Everything is going smoothly.

1090
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,920
Why are you so happy?

1091
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Did Young Master raise your allowance?

1092
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,840
Please call me the CP talent.

1093
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,480
Thank you.

1094
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
Isn't it Peter Pan in love?

1095
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,120
Masters are always changing their titles

1096
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,720
with the increase of their positions.

1097
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,480
You know that?

1098
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,800
Changing names frequently won't gather fans.

1099
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,760
Why don't you ask me

1100
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
why I have changed my title again?

1101
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,320
Have you hooked up with a new actress?

1102
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,960
Is she more popular than Qin Rong?

1103
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,160
Can she come to the celebration?

1104
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,840
Our brotherhood

1105
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,120
ends here.

1106
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,920
Goodbye!

1107
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,120
Win that girl over quickly!

1108
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:22,960
Mr. Lin.

1109
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,880
Please take a seat first.

1110
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,120
The designer is coming soon.

1111
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,040
Okay, thank you.

1112
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:35,840
Please enjoy.

1113
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,200
Thanks.

1114
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,720
Hello?

1115
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,520
Madam, I've arrived.

1116
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,560
Is there really no need to inform him?

1117
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,080
What is the most important principle
for a surprise?

1118
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,760
What is it?

1119
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,400
It's to not give him a chance to run away.

1120
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,000
OK.

1121
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,360
Hi, I'm the designer's assistant.

1122
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,400
Hi, I'm Lin Nuoyan.

1123
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,800
Shall we wait for the designer?

1124
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
No, I'll serve you.

1125
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,560
All right.

1126
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:30,960
Hi.

1127
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,960
I'm the designer.

1128
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,480
Professor Lin.

1129
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,800
Hi, Mr. Dao Ruifeng, right?

1130
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,080
Yes.

1131
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,800
We have met before.

1132
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,400
Yes.

1133
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,600
It was with Dean Zhang

1134
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,040
to see Mr. Qian.

1135
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,760
It was a short meeting.

1136
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,160
Yes.

1137
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,520
And this is...

1138
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm his assistant.

1139
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,760
The designer's assistant.

1140
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,800
Yes, my assistant.

1141
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,320
Bai.

1142
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,880
We introduced ourselves just now.

1143
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,920
Let's get started.

1144
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,960
You see,

1145
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,560
I have something on soon.

1146
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,800
Well, I'll let Bai

1147
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,640
attend to you.

1148
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,920
I'll be back later if I'm needed.

1149
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,960
Okay, see you later.
