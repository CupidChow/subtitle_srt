Professor Lin.

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,440
Mr. Qian.

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,280
Hello!

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,480
Hello, Professor Lin!

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,240
Hi!

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Are you here for the meeting?

27
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,160
Yes,

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,480
for a meeting with President Zhang

29
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,440
to discuss about the celebration.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,560
Such a hands-on boss!

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,160
I must do it myself
when dealing with President Zhang.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,680
By the way,

33
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,480
the assistant told me that day
that you had a girlfriend.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,480
Me?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,120
The assistant must have misunderstood.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
I do have a crush on a girl,

37
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,920
but it seems that she has a boyfriend.

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,160
I heard he is an employee of your company.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,440
Tell me his name.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,720
I will give him the sack immediately.

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,840
Well...

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,640
Just kidding.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,960
But I really admire Professor Lin.

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,960
You're young and capable.

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,760
Thank you.

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,300
(Spring  VIP Card)

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,120
What's this?

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,040
A gift.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,480
I gave one to President Zhang already.

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,720
And this is for you.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,200
Thank you.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,400
My pleasure.

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,880
I have two requests.

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,520
First, post about this in your Moments.

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,880
Second, don't tell anyone it was from me.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,840
No problem.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,640
I will post something about it immediately.

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,960
Thanks to...

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
a mysterious friend.

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,600
There's no hurry.

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,720
Just post it tonight.

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,200
This is sponsored by my elder brother.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
It's mainly to thank him.

64
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,320
All right.

65
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,040
In that case,
please extend my thanks to Mr. Qian Tu.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,840
I hope that through this cooperation,

67
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,280
we can become friends.

68
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
Yang Xue'er is so beautiful!

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,320
I've seen a lot of superstars.

70
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,240
I can say that she is among the top three.

71
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,480
She is really a natural beauty.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,120
Is that man

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
Yang Xue'er's boyfriend?

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,120
He is definitely not an ordinary person

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,160
since two bosses of Qing'ai group are with him.

76
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
I have never seen him here before.

77
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
Is he a star in the entertainment industry?

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,400
The four are all so good-looking!
Just like a scene in the movies.

79
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,720
So beautiful!

80
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,440
I have noticed that

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,440
many rich people are good-looking,

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,080
especially the rich kids like them.

83
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
What's the matter?

84
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
Have you lost your soul

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
in the bathroom?

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,600
I shouldn't have come.

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,760
Why?

88
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
Don't you think you're overthinking it?

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,480
Actually,

90
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
coming to such fancy restaurants occasionally

91
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,000
can just be regarded as new experiences.

92
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,840
To see more of the world.

93
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,000
That's all.

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,120
Don't put too much thought into it.

95
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,600
You don't have to be

96
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,640
necessarily connected to this place.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,920
For example,

98
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,320
when you travel to the Forbidden City.

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
You just take a stroll, look around,

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,120
and have some fun.

101
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,960
In the end,

102
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,240
you still have to go back to your life.

103
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,440
What else can you do?

104
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,960
No matter how much you love the Forbidden City,

105
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,360
you can't stay there forever.

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,440
I'm not unhappy about the luxury here.

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
So why are you sad?

108
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,760
Because I'm dying,

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
but the world is still the same.

110
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,840
Just like this restaurant,

111
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
there will be new guests coming when I go.

112
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,960
Yes,

113
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,080
this should be my possessiveness and meanness.

114
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,040
I used to think that

115
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm unique

116
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,520
and special.

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
But no one is irreplaceable.

118
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,640
Right?

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,040
All right.

120
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
I promise

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,040
from now on

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,560
I won't

123
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,600
take any lady out to this restaurant.

124
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,800
Why did you say that?

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,760
Because...

126
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,560
Because it is much too expensive here.

127
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,640
If it weren't for your short life expectancy,

128
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,440
I wouldn't be willing to spend
so much money on myself.

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,880
Thanks a bunch!

130
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,600
All right.

131
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,000
Forget those unhappy things.

132
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,120
Let's eat.

133
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
In fact, I was quite surprised to meet you

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,200
in Qing'ai Group that day.

135
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,480
The assistant told me that

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,960
you were there to meet your boyfriend.

137
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Yes, my boyfriend works there.

138
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,640
I don't mean to pry.

139
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,680
It's just that you look

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,760
a little unhappy.

141
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm not unhappy.

142
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Just a little down.

143
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
I used to think that I was unique for that man,

144
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,600
but now I feel I'm nothing to him.

145
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,880
I'm not the one that will die with him,

146
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,480
neither am I the one
who will accompany him forever.

147
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,040
He didn't even tell me anything.

148
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,720
The most ridiculous thing is that

149
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,640
I still understand him.

150
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,960
Even if you understand him in your heart,

151
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,080
you still want to hear it from him.

152
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,640
Right?

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,720
Do you remember what I told you?

154
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,800
I'll try my best to cure you.

155
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,240
Wait for me.

156
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,560
I trust you.

157
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,520
You two are standing in the way.

158
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,600
Mr. Qian.

159
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,760
Mr. Dao.

160
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,680
You are here too, Mr. Assistant.

161
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Professor Lin.

162
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
Let me drive you home.

163
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,280
Sure.

164
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,960
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
Would you like to drive me home?

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
My pleasure.

167
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,120
Let me explain.

168
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,640
It's cold outside.

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,880
And I've got some business to attend to.

170
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,480
Let's talk about it when we are home.

171
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,120
The gift you gave me

172
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,160
is pretty nice.

173
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,680
You are welcome.

174
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,280
The assistant...

175
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,800
is Jin Xiaoyu's boyfriend, isn't he?

176
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,400
I met him in the fitting room last time.

177
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,360
Mr. Dao also told me that he was his assistant.

178
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,320
But he looks more like the boss

179
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
than Mr. Dao.

180
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,680
Later, Jin Xiaoyu went there for him.

181
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,640
They just exchanged one look.

182
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,040
And I could tell something was between them.

183
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
You know Jin Xiaoyu has a boyfriend.

184
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,280
Why do you still have a crush on her?

185
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Well, it can't be helped.

186
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,840
Jin Xiaoyu is the kind of girl

187
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,240
who is very comfortable to be with,

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
even if you are not dating her.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
But as you get to know her better over time,

190
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,080
you will inevitably fall in love with her.

191
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,120
She is completely not my type.

192
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,840
So?

193
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,000
You want me to take her away

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,240
from that guy?

195
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,080
You like her, but I don't like her.

196
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,000
It's a win-win.

197
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,440
But that Mr. Assistant

198
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,000
seems to be your friend, too.

199
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,280
With all due respect,

200
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
is he just your friend?

201
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Not only is he my friend,

202
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,000
he is also my life-saver,

203
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
my mentor,

204
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,040
and a respectable elder.

205
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Jin Xiaoyu is not good enough for him.

206
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,280
She only causes trouble for him.

207
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,800
I hate troublemakers.

208
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,240
You seem like a caring person.

209
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,120
She won't live long anyway.

210
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Why don't you take over and take care of her?

211
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,160
I don't really agree with what you said.

212
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,400
But the last sentence

213
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,880
is what I have in mind, too.

214
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,720
I do want to take care of her
for the rest of her life.

215
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,120
It may not be long,

216
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,080
but I believe that I can take good care of her.

217
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,920
Very manly!

218
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
But I would only do that

219
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,480
if it isn't against Jin Xiaoyu's will.

220
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't want anyone to force her.

221
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,720
Mr. Qian,

222
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,680
Jin Xiaoyu is the girl I like.

223
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
Don't bully her.

224
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,960
Is Bai really your assistant?

225
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,440
If I say he is my half-brother,

226
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,120
will you buy it?

227
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,840
The girl at the door just now,

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,920
is she his ex-girlfriend?

229
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,960
I don't know if she was his ex-girlfriend.

230
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,640
But after tonight,

231
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,640
she probably will become his ex.

232
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,040
Xue'er.

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,440
If you have a wrong partner,

234
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,240
you surely will get a wrong result.

235
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,880
I don't understand what you said.

236
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,240
Do you really not understand me
or are you pretending?

237
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,000
There are always outsiders

238
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,760
who have some preconceived misunderstandings

239
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
about us designers.

240
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,440
They usually inquire
about sexual orientation in advance.

241
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,560
But I notice

242
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,520
you don't seem to be worried
about Bai's sexual orientation at all.

243
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,480
Why are you so sure he likes girls?

244
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,360
Intuition.

245
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,280
Intuition?

246
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,640
I guess your intuition is from Qian Cheng.

247
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Xue'er.

248
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't know what Qian Cheng told you.

249
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,920
But I want to tell you that

250
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Bai is more dangerous than you think.

251
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,320
Of course,

252
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,040
people engaged in art are basically like this.

253
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,560
But Bai is the most dangerous one I've ever met.

254
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,440
Don't expect that you can fall in love
with each other at first sight.

255
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
He

256
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,360
belongs to a different world.

257
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,200
Xue'er.

258
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
A beautiful girl like you

259
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
has many options around you.

260
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't waste your time on the wrong man.

261
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
And don't cause

262
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,960
unnecessary trouble for yourself.

263
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,960
Xue Wanwan told me that

264
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
you are a charming playboy.

265
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
I used to think that you were just a playboy.

266
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,880
Just now,

267
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,440
I suddenly found that you are somewhat charming.

268
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,360
Charm

269
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
always needs to be set off by others.

270
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,840
Miss Yang,

271
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,400
would you like to be my dance partner
at the anniversary celebration?

272
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,640
Forget it!

273
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Mrs. Xue is the confidante of my boss.

274
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,040
And everyone knows about you and Xue Wanwan.

275
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,520
If I agree to be your dance partner,

276
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm afraid

277
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,160
I may have my legs broken

278
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,440
before the celebration.

279
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,600
None of that matters.

280
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,080
What matters is Xue Wanwan.

281
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,040
Your Achilles' heel is Xue Wanwan, right?

282
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,360
Qian Cheng was right.

283
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,520
You really

284
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
have some hidden talents.

285
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,800
Miss Yang, so do you.

286
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,240
We have five minutes to talk.

287
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,600
After that, I have to work
on a document with William.

288
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:11,920
Okay.

289
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,240
I knew you were going to have dinner
with Yang Xue'er.

290
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,520
Actually, that was a trap set by Qian Cheng.

291
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,200
He deliberately let me see the invitation card.

292
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,880
I didn't know

293
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,000
there would be others with you at the restaurant.

294
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,120
I thought it would be just you and Yang Xue'er.

295
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,800
Then I found out that Lin Nuoyan
had a VIP card from that restaurant.

296
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,960
So I got him to bring me there.

297
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,320
Finished?

298
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,280
You can ask questions now.

299
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,880
A designer suit jacket.

300
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,360
Don't tell me it's your master's.

301
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,560
And this size can't be your senior colleagues'.

302
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,120
It's Lin Nuoyan's.

303
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Since I met you,

304
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
you've only worn nightdresses in front of me.

305
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,480
This is a nightdress, too.

306
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,040
Is it the nightdress that annoys me?

307
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,440
No.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,280
You are dressed so nicely

309
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,680
with another man's jacket
draped over your shoulders.

310
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,440
You went out with him

311
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,320
to a fancy restaurant
with a minimum charge of 3000 yuan per person.

312
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,520
No matter what reasons you might have,

313
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,000
others would only think you two were dating.

314
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,640
I...

315
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
Did he pay for the dinner?

316
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,560
Yes, but I didn't mean to have a date with him.

317
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,360
You didn't mean to date him

318
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,400
or were you just being mean?

319
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
You knew it was a trap set by Qian Cheng.

320
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,760
Why did you go there then?

321
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,880
You just wanted to see me
have a meal with another woman

322
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
and make yourself unhappy.

323
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,000
Then you went there with another man

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
to make me unhappy, too.

325
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,320
Why did you...

326
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
Don't be angry.

327
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,760
Look at you. You can't even quarrel without me.

328
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,680
Nonsense.

329
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,440
I just want to ask you.

330
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,880
Why did you wear such a nice...?

331
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,160
Why did you go out with Lin Nuoyan?

332
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,960
That's not the issue.

333
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,320
Don't forget that I was following you

334
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
because you were having a date with another woman.

335
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
You're a fine one to talk!

336
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,600
I was working.

337
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
There was a problem
with the artist invitation this year.

338
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,800
And it's William's first year in office.

339
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,840
I can't assign that task

340
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,960
to two young men.

341
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,720
They are only in their twenties
with little social experience.

342
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,440
Can't you try to understand me?

343
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,120
All right.

344
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360
I saw you were happy to help others.

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,080
I was happy indeed.

346
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,160
When I was sitting at the table,

347
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,360
I felt like an ordinary man.

348
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,920
Socializing for work.

349
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,320
I also thank you very much
for making me experience

350
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,680
the problem that all men may have.

351
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,840
That is, a jealous girlfriend.

352
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,080
But when did you begin

353
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,680
to have such senseless jealousy?

354
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,200
Yes!

355
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
I'm jealous of her.

356
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,240
I'm not jealous of her beauty or wealth.

357
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm jealous because she can live longer.

358
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,760
If I could live longer,

359
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,960
even if to my fifties or sixties,

360
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,200
I would stay with you longer!

361
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,640
Please,

362
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
stop worrying about that.

363
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
Ever since I first met you,

364
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,440
I knew that you wouldn't live long.

365
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
I've lived on my own for a hundred years.

366
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,840

No, you won't.

371
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,040
You'll kill yourself in the most horrific way

372
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,960
and turn to ashes to disappear from this world!

373
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,600
Right?

374
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,920
You have never told me anything

375
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,000
about what Mrs. Dao said,

376
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,240

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,480
The tortoise is fine.

393
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,880
How are you?

394
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
The tortoise and I are both fine.

395
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,920
Qian,

396
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,800
does Jin Xiaoyu really trouble you that much?

397
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,240
I told you why I hate her.

398
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,120
Well,

399
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
for the young master,

400
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,400
be tolerant.

401
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,360
I tried, but just couldn't help myself.

402
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,680
All right.

403
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,600
Qian,

404
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,040
Ye Lai probably won't come back.

405
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,240
The people who are with you now

406
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
are Young Master and Jin Xiaoyu.

407
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
You hurt people around you

408
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,360
for someone you'll never meet.

409
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,680
Is it worthwhile?

410
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,080
Will you hate me?

411
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,480
Of course not.

412
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
Even if you made Qing'ai Group bankrupt,

413
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,000
I would not hate you.

414
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,040
Qing'ai Group is not yours.

415
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,160
Even if you deleted the story I just wrote,

416
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,320
I would not hate you.

417
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,840
A true brother.

418
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,800
Not only me,

419
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,320
neither will Young Master hate you.

420
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,160
I believe

421
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,640
neither will Jin Xiaoyu hate you.

422
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,920
In fact, it's good to be sick.

423
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,080
Whatever you do,

424
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,600
no one blames you.

425
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,520
Oh, Qian.

426
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,040
Just take my advice.

427
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,520
Even if your trick works,

428
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,960
you still will feel bad.

429
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,440
I won't be softhearted.

430
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,040
Just wait and see.

431
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,320
You said Ye Lai would never come back,

432
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
but I think she is sure to come back.

433
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,480
I wish she wouldn't be back.

434
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,040
If she comes back,

435
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,880
Mrs. Ye will get worried.

436
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,440
I'll never forget that night

437
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,560
when you were sent to
the emergency room after the accident.

438
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
Mrs. Ye knelt on the ground and cried loudly.

439
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,760
I have the impression that

440
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,200
Mrs. Ye is an elegant lady.

441
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,120
She even sneezes gently.

442
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
But that night,

443
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,600
her cries could be heard
throughout the entire building.

444
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,880
It was terrible.

445
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,800
This reminds me of a saying I heard on TV.

446
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,960
It is not that mothers
don't have a sense of dignity,

447
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,160
but that they have something
more important to protect.

448
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,920
Oh, Qian.

449
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,840
Finally, you understand my feelings.

450
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,400
Son, get well soon.

451
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,600
Don't let Dad worry about you!

452
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,200
You know what?

453
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
If I killed you now,

454
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,560
I still could get my sentence reduced.

455
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,680
Really?

456
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,120
Take a look.

457
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
The corn here tastes better
than the ones in the city.

458
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,280
As soon as the lid is uncovered,

459
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,840
the smell of the cooked corn can fill the yard.

460
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
No fertilizer was used.

461
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,680
This is truly green food.

462
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,680
All right, Bella.

463
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
My mom has to take a break.

464
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,320
She will call you tomorrow.

465
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Please remember to send me some corn.

466
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,920
I will.

467
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

468
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,000
What a kid!

469
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,360
She's so playful.

470
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,960
What do you want to eat for dinner?

471
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,480
Pumpkin ball soup?

472
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,920
Whatever you want. I'm fine with anything.

473
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,320
It's easy to feed you.

474
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,040
I'm not a picky eater.

475
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,920
Unlike you, you have been picky
about food ever since you were young.

476
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,080
I've had countless quarrels with your father

477
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,080
regarding your eating habits.

478
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,760
We almost got divorced because of that.

479
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,080
My father was right.

480
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,760
If I don't like it, don't eat it.

481
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,720
You always forced me to eat what I didn't like.

482
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,000
You think I wanted to force you?

483
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
It was all for your health.

484
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,960
There weren't as many food options as today.

485
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,560
We only had seasonal vegetables
when you were young.

486
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
If I didn't force you to eat what you disliked,

487
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
you might have starved to death.

488
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,720
Why don't you

489
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,960
become my daughter in the next life?

490
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,000
You can be picky

491
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,040
and grumpy.

492
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,280
I will let you do whatever you want to do.

493
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,600
It would never do.

494
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
The kid will be spoiled like that.

495
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,520
And you'll definitely physically punish

496
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,440
your daughter for being picky about food.

497
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,080
You'll know when you really have a daughter.

498
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,680
Being picky about food, stubbornness,

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,920
and having a puppy love,

500
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,200
really can drive you crazy.

501
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,320
Let's make it a deal.

502
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,440
You will be my daughter in the next life.

503
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:07,920
Young Master.

504
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,400
I prepared this especially for you.

505
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,920
Have this.

506
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,040
Pickled radish is also very delicious.

507
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,520
Why should I eat pickled radish?

508
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,280

Here you are. You can have both.

510
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,320
You like to be a two-timer anyway.

511
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,600
Indeed.

512
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
You always eat tasty dishes

513
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
and look down at these side dishes anyway,

514
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,280
don't you?

515
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,680
I'm full.

516
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,160
I'll wait for you guys outside.

517
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,400
I'm full, too.

518

I'll wait for you guys outside.

519
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,360
Step back a little.

520
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,360
I stepped back just now.

521
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,160
Why don't you step back again?

522
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,760
I've already stepped back.

523
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,520
Why should I do it again?

524
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,240
It's your turn to step back.

525
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,200
I'm telling you.

526
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,480
If you, three bosses, are late,

527
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,320
you will lose ten million yuan.

528

If I am late, I will only lose a few hundred yuan.

- Who will suffer more?
- But

I can afford to lose ten million yuan.

531

Can you afford to lose just a hundred yuan?

532
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,000
A hundred yuan.

533
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,880
You think you're a big deal since you're rich?

534
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,240
Being rich is no big deal.

535
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Someone that's willing
to spend money is a big deal.

That's it?

Young Master,

543
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,960
I'm not asking whether your body is here or not.

544
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,840
I'm asking about your soul.

545
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,920
Both of my body and soul
don't want to talk to you.

546
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,480
That's great.

547
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,920
Then I'm only able to talk to your body.

548
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm excited just thinking about it!

Let me tell you something.

551
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,840
You need practice to deal with breakups.

552
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,880
You'll get better at it after several practices.

553
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
You are such a smooth talker.

554
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,160
What is it? Let me have a look.

555

We've received Yang Xue'er's contract.

The legal department is revising it.

557

Her agent told me that

558
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,920
she admires you very much.

559
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,600
And she wants to deepen the cooperation.

560
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,440
I think the cooperation is not her priority.

561
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,640
Her aim is to take a step further with you.

562

She wants to be the spokeswoman.

563

She can be our brand ambassador,
but not spokeswoman.

564
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,680
What Yang Xue'er wants
is not to be the brand ambassador.

565

Not only does she want to be the brand ambassador.

566

What she wants is business
and a personal relationship.

I know what a pun is.

570

One step further.

You seem to have been discouraged by something.

Young Master had a quarrel with Jin Xiaoyu.

589
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,720
A very terrible quarrel.

590
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,360
But Young Master
hasn't tried to kill himself this time.

what happens between the two?

Sago cycas bloom once every 60 years.

594
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
Young Master's love is more precious
than the blossom of sago cycas.

595

Don't you know that?

596

If cultivated by man,

sago cycas can bloom
once every ten to twenty years.

their relationship?

Why?

Because she is not a busybody.

No, you are wrong.

612

The reason why my grandma
can keep a healthy body is that

she is in love every minute, every second.

is just like drinking water,
only the one who drinks it knows its temperature.

Although you were the spark to their quarrel,

617
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,520
you were not the root cause.

it may not be a bad thing.

Why don't you go watch her cooking?

Why are you back?

630
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,120
This is my home.

631
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,400
I can certainly come back as I please

632
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,360
to see my parents and brother.

633
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,040
Did you annoy Jiang Baiju?

634
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,400
Jin Xiaoyu and Young Master may be breaking up.

635
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,120
Look at you!

636
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,320
I'll open a bottle of champagne
for you to celebrate.

637
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,360
So, you have been driven home

638
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,000
for your mischiefs
that caused Jiang Baiju's break-up?

639
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,520
No, I just wanted to come back.

640
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,520
He is trying to get over his break-up,
so he's not in the mood to talk to me.

641
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,280
I think I'd better leave him alone for some time

642
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,160
to go through his emotions.

643
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:16,760
What do you think?

644
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,080
If you weren't my brother, I'd beat you up.

645

That girl is terminally ill,

646
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
and her life expectancy
is less than one year long.

647
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,560
She finally has a boyfriend,

648
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,000
but you had to screw it up.

649
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,280
Don't you feel ashamed?

650
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,560
I don't agree with you.

651
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,360
Jin Xiaoyu shouldn't have been

652
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,240
in Young Master's world.

653
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,720
Though she has a short life expectancy,

654
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,880
she is very destructive.

655
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,920
She also has another fine man around her.

656
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,440
Do you remember Professor Lin

657
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,560
who came with President Zhang for the meeting?

658
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
He likes Jin Xiaoyu.

659
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,840
I think they are a good match.

660
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,160
And it won't cause much trouble
when they are together.

661
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,720
Tu,

662
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,840
you dislike Young Master, don't you?

663
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,400
Why have you taken his side this time?

664
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,720
My dear little brother,

665
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,960
when was the last time you dated someone?

666
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,880
Let me tell you a fact.

667
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,000
Some quarrels lead to break-ups,

668
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,120
while some quarrels

669
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,040
lead to better relationships.

670
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,040
Impossible!

671
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,360
They can't even stand each other's presence.

672
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,240
Midnight.

673
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,880
What happens after midnight?

674
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,680
Xiaoyu.

675
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,120
What's up?

676
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,680
Are you not going to make peace with Young Master?

677
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,560
Did Jiang Baiju tell you anything?

678
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,840
No, nothing.

679
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,320
But I'm so clever that

680
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,440
I have seen through everything.

681
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,600
Do you have nothing else to do?

682
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Have you pinned all your hopes

683
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,680
on me?

684
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,440
I have no material for my novel.

685
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
If you and Young Master have made up,

686
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,200
remember to tell me.

687
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,360
I need some inspiration for writing.

688
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,720
To put it simply,

689
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,000
a good horse will never turn round
to graze on an old pasture.

690
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
We have broken up.

691
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,560
Goodbye!

692
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,880
Young Master.

693
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,440
You came just in time.

694
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,480
You have just passed each other.
What a coincidence!

695
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,480
Young Master.

696
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,800
Don't worry.

697
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,320
Despite the break-up,

698
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,280
you must hold her hand at midnight.

699
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
Just take my advice.

700
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,360
All disputes in a relationship

701
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,720
can be resolved by kisses and cuddles.

702
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,760
If kissing and cuddling don't work,

703
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,000
then throw in a barbecue.

704
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,960
Physical contact is

705
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,600
the most important factor in a relationship.

706
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,440
It's a magic weapon, and a useful weapon.

707
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,360
Physical contact?

708
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,880
Yes.

709
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,880
Any part of the body.

710
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,600
Any part of the body?

711
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,200
Are you really going to do this to me?

712
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,600
Of course. We have broken up.

713
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Stay or leave, it's up to you.

714
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,360
How about more money?

715
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,240
No, I reject it!

716
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,600
There is a saying that we can see
a man's moral quality after breaking up.

717
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,440
You...

718
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,320
If I still hold my ex's hand after breaking-up,

719
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,280
then I will become a real piece of trash.

720
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,240
Five minutes to go. Up to you!

721
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,480
4 minutes 58 seconds,
4 minutes 57 seconds, 4 minutes 56 seconds...

722
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,640
- Who needs your hand?
- 4 minutes...

723
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,480
Why are your feet so small?

724
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,520
They are small. You got a problem with that?

725
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,820
(Lin Nuoyan)

726
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,720
What's so funny?

727
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,600
None of your business.

728
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,480
I'm just curious.

729
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Why didn't you date him at the very beginning?

730
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,920
Were you afraid of hurting a normal man?

731
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,280
I only date people I like.

732
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,560
So, has your love disappeared?

733
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,040
When the man is dishonest,

734
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
my love will disappear.

735
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:31,800
I...

736
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
Jiang Baiju, let's play a game!

737
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,640
Who talks first is a dog.

738
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,240
Three, two, one, start!

739
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,680
Come in, please!

740
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,120
(Funeral Processions Not Allowed)
Wang Quande told me you were not working.

741
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm practicing. Come in!

742
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,040
You're pretty good!

743
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,760
As skilled as a surgeon.

744
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,400
We need to be more skilled than a surgeon.

745
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,160
Because the wound of a living person will heal,

746
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,120
but it will not heal on a dead body.

747
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,920
Will you be scared if I ask you something?

748
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,080
No.

749
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,080
Are you an atheist?

750
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,400
Just the opposite.

751
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,160
I believe there will be another world after death.

752
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,640
I believe in the existence of the soul.

753
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,720
I'm not superstitious.

754
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,160
My master once told me...

755
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
Jin Xiaoyu.

756
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,680
Yes.

757
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,240
What you are doing

758
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,840
is the greatest deed.

759
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,160
Imagine that this man is right in front of you.

760
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,000
He is looking at you and accompanying you.

761
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,280
What you are doing is for his good.

762
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,760
So long as you are responsible, hard-working

763
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,400
and have a clear conscience,
everything will be all right.

764
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,040
Do you understand?

765
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,040
Yes, Master.

766
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,000
So, are you paying a special visit today

767
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,920
to comfort me?

768
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,600
No, I'm not.

769
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,320
Hot pot, my treat.

770
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,080
Would you like to go?

771
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:32,760
Go ahead.

772
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,680
What is it you want to ask me?

773
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,200
You know what I want to ask.

774
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,120
Why not

775
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,200
you tell me?

776
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,800
I have a boyfriend
and we haven't been on good terms lately.

777
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,040
You shouldn't have been so thoughtful.

778
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,080
Lin Nuoyan, actually I want to tell you...

779
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,880
I like you.

780
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,200
I like you, Xiaoyu.

781
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,800
To be honest,

782
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,720
I'm happy that you two are fighting

783
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,400
because of me.

784
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,720
I'm happy to see that you are angry with him.

785
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,640
I wish you would dump him

786
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
and be with me.

787
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,480
However, what I hope to see the most

788
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,040
is your happiness.

789
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,040
Even if you are not my girlfriend,

790
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
it doesn't matter.

791
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,040
You might laugh at me for this.

792
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,600
Actually,

793
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,160
I have always been

794
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,400
very proud.

795
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,480
I feel that I'm not bad

796
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,720
in all aspects.

797
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,360
But

798
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,840
when I saw you being so depressed that day,

799
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,680
I suddenly felt that my feelings

800
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,040
were not that important.

801
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,960
I guess this may be

802
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,600
love.

803
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,280
Did you prepare

804
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,120
what you said just now?

805
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,440
Yes,

806
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,040
I have a degree in English literature.

807
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,120
Awesome!

808
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,280
Very impressed!

809
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,640
I think we are adults.

810
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,560
We should be straightforward with our feelings.

811
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,040
It's my business that I like you.

812
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,600
It's your business
whether you have a boyfriend or not.

813
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,240
So long as you are not married,

814
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,400
everyone should have
the opportunity to compete fairly.

815
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,040
But,

816
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,280
if you think that

817
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,240
my affection

818
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,640
bothers you,

819
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,400
you can also

820
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,760
end our friendship today.

821
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,440
No,

822
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
I would never end a friendship over a hot pot.

823
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,280
Are you kidding me?

824
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,440
I knew it.

825
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,440
But,

826
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,080
since we're talking about this,

827
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,280
I won't talk to you about my relationship anymore

828
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,600
in the future.

829
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,040
There should be boundaries between friends.

830
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,120
When you say it like that,

831
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,880
I like you more.

832
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,240
I'm leaving.

833
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,960
Just kidding. Don't be annoyed.

834
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:20,880
Sit down.

835
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,360
All right,

836
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,840
I'll take your advice.

837
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,560
There should be boundaries between friends.

838
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,760
We will talk more about

839
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,640
work and professional topics.

840
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,120
All right?

841
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:35,800
Okay.

842
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,560
It's a deal.

843
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,360
Young Master.

844
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,360
Stalking your ex-girlfriend

845
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,720
is not cool in our time.

846
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,640
Neither was it cool in my time.

847
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,840
Then why...

848
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,400
To do something less cool
won't make me less charming.

849
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,080
Oh,

850
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,200
I almost forgot.

851
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,160
Do you remember the flowers you asked me to plant?

852
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,120
I managed to do it.

853
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,440
Amazing! Look at the sprout!

854
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,280
What are they doing?

855
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,760
Open the door!

856
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,400
Young Master.

857
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,120
It's unwise to ruin your image

858
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,600
just for a girl.

859
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
Does your heart hurt again?

860
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,600
Then I can't wait

861
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,840
for it

862
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,840
to bloom.

863
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,640
Lin Nuoyan, my cell phone!

864
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,080
Cheng,

865
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,120
you are an outsider.

866
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
You can see it better than us.

867
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,160
But Xiaoyu and me,

868
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,880
we are not ordinary people.

869
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,720
It's too hard for us

870
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,720
to be together.

871
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,680
Look at them, Professor Lin and Xiaoyu.

872
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,960
They understand each other very well.

873
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,880
There is no generation gap between them.

874
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,240
In addition, he likes

875
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,000
Xiaoyu's appearance and character.

876
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,920
He even appreciates

877
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,400
her work and specialty.

878
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,040
Both of them are also volunteers.

879
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,280
But Jin Xiaoyu loves you.

880
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,480
I've lived for centuries

881
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,400
and have seen many stories of men and women.

882
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,640
I know the helplessness
of love better than anyone else.

883
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
Many people live through their lives

884
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,320
not knowing the meaning of love.

885
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,960
Just as Xiaoyu said,

886
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,920
she is still young and has a liking for me.

887
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,320
Just like you.

888
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,880
But young people like you...

889
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,560
Young people like you

890
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,480
are always attracted
by things or people that are different.

891
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,320
But that is not love.
