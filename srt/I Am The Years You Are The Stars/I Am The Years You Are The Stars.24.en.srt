19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Young Master,

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,440
wait in the car for a while.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,440
I'll go find Xiang.

22
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,360
Okay.

23
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,720
(Combat organized crimes, clean up Society.
Build Harmony, create Peace!)

24
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,920
- He's so handsome.
- He's so handsome.

25
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Look, look at him.

26
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
He's coming. He's coming.

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,560
Hi, ladies.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,480
I'm here to see Xiang.

29
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,280
- Hello.
- I'll take you to him.

31
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,680
You told me just now that

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,880
William singlehandedly rescued Qian Tu

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
and found out that the ringleader was Ye Lai.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
Are you sure it was him?

35
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,040
Though it doesn't sound credible,

36
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,920
it is the fact.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,160
Dao Xiuxiu has a good eye

38
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
for successors.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
Hope he finds a good guide,

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,560
or else we'd be lost

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
before we reach the village.

42
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,240
Let me tell you,

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,000
I tried to find the Snow Mountain Village

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,240
based on my memories.

45
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,560
But I couldn't find anything.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
This time, with Lin Nuoyan's lab

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
as the new clue,

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,480
I have a feeling that

49
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,400
I can find it.

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,080
Come.

51
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,120
Xiang,

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,080
they're over there.

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,560
Let's go.

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay.

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,520
Hi.

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,120
Hi.

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,360
Young Master,

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,240
let me introduce him.

59
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,600
This is Xiang.

60
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,320
Xiang?

61
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,240
Hi, Boss!

62
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
A well-deserved name.
[*Xiang in Chinese means loud.]

63
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
We will be depending on you,

64
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Xiang.

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,240
Young Master.

66
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
Grandmother sent these bodyguards.

67
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,160
Nice to see you, Young Master!

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,800
Young Master,

69
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,440
let's move.

70
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:09,720
Okay.

71
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,400
Xiang,

72
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
how about you driving?

73
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,800
Sure.

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,600
Mother.

75
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,120
Ah.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,200
What's up?

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
The bodyguards told me that

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,960
they have gone into the mountains.

79
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,840
Okay.

80
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Oh, right.

81
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,320
How's Jiang Baiju's ID card coming along?

82
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,160
The information required has been

83
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,960
sent to them.

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,200
When they come back,

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,960
I should be able to have it.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,560
Hope this time,

87
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,240
he can pass.

88
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,080
Mother,

89
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,600
why do you

90
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,800
seem unhappy?

91
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm not just unhappy.

92
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
I'm crossed.

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,440
I've known him for many years,

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,240
but I've never seen him be so nosy.

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,920
He's now a regular man.

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,760
He shouldn't be involved in stuff like this.

97
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,360
I can't believe he...

98
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,200
I can't believe he went into the mountains.

99
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,120
Although I worked for him for twenty years,

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,440
I always felt like

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
there was a barrier between us.

102
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,960
It wasn't until the incident
that has happened recently

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,160
did I get to know him better.

104
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,240
People say,

105
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,000
you come back

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,960
a young man after spending
half your lifetime outside.

107
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,680
It describes him perfectly.

108
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,560
After 80 years of vicissitudes,

109
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
he's still

110
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,840
a young man of integrity.

111
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,640
Young Master's life

112
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,560
has been arduous

113
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,040
and unpredictable,

114
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,200
but at least he has someone beside him.

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
In this aspect,

116
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,520
I envy him very much.

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,680
I wish I could have a girlfriend

118
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,760
like Jin Xiaoyu.

119
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,280
Whatever you do,

120
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,280
she'd support you,

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,440
understand you, and be with you

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,480
instead of nagging about

123
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,240
all the dangers

124
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,920
all the time.

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,560
What's that look in your eyes?

126
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,400
Get out!

127
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:23,960
Okay.

128
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,560
Get lost!

129
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,160
Okay.

130
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,960
Careful.

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,080
This place has got loads of twigs and rocks.

132
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Take it easy, guys.

133
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,160
Watch your step.

134
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
I suppose

135
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,480
you're a local.

136
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
Lin Nuoyan is from the village.

137
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
So am I.

138
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,800
The thought of it

139
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,080
gives me mixed feelings.

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,360
Fortunately, you two are not together,

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,720
or you two would find out you are actually

142
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,000
brother and sister
like what happens in a drama.

143
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,160
Shut up!

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,280
You're so talkative.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,640
Jiang Baiju,

146
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,280
let me have a look!

147
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,400
It's fine.

148
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,360
Let's keep moving.

149
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:18,920
Yeah.

150
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,840
Come on.

151
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,200
Shenlong Snow Mountain is
the main peak of the Zhaoyao Mountains.

152
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
The place you marked

153
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,760
is behind that mountain.

154
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:32,960
Okay.

155
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
How are things over there?

156
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,560
Boss,

157
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,920
I'll be honest with you.

158
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,760
The place we're heading to

159
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,600
is called Phantom Decapitation.

160
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
There's a valley over there

161
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,280
that has the shape of a human,

162
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,400
but it looks headless.

163
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,480
The name

164
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,440
sounds ominous

165
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,600
and the paths are difficult to walk in.

166
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,640
Even the boldest travelers

167
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,600
wouldn't dare try it.

168
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,600
And the valley has had
frequent earthquakes in recent years,

169
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,440
so there are

170
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,920
many precarious rocks.

171
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,680
Landslides happen once it rains.

172
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Rockfalls are also fairly common.

173
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,040
So no one goes there then?

174
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,560
No one would dare.

175
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,520
It's too dangerous.

176
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,080
Think about it.

177
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,000
Even though the tourist attraction
we came from just now

178
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,160
has been fully developed,

179
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,240
no one dares go to that place.

180
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,320
In recent years,

181
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,840
the government carried out several
geological examinations of the mountains.

182
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,800
But because of the rockfalls,

183
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,800
they had no choice but to give up.

184
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,120
Do you have another solution?

185
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,520
Boss.

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,360
Luckily, you hired me.

187
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,200
I know a footpath

188
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
that goes through the forest,

189
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,160
so we can bypass the valley.

190
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,760
Look.

191
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,200
The village is still there.

192
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
That's impossible.

193
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,880
It was ruined by the avalanche.

194
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,840
Let's go and have a look.

195
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,080
Okay.

196
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,240
The houses can be a good cover.

197
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,720
Let's go.

198
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,000
Careful.

199
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,920
What an eerie place!

200
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
Something's in them.

201
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,240
What is it?

202
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,560
It's a forest grave.

203
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,600
These are ghost cocoons.

204
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,680
Ghost cocoons?

205
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
It's an ancient burial culture

206
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,280
of a special nomadic tribe in our country.

207
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,760
Look.

208
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,960
They shrouded the body with a white cloth,

209
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,920
tied it to a tree, and left it to decompose.

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,680
They thought this would allow

211
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,800
the souls of the dead

212
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,400
to run freely in the forest.

213
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,920
Run freely in the forest?

214
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,680
Can you calm down?

215
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,440
Burial culture is also a culture.

216
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,040
I'm uncultured, though.

217
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,600
Xiang,

218
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,720
let's get out of here now.

219
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,240
Wait a minute.

220
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,080
It's okay. It's okay.

221
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:08,720
Don't be afraid.

222
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,440
This person seems quite young.

223
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,800
Probably

224
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
in their thirties.

225
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,200
I don't think this person
was from ancient times,

226
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,880
but from modern times.

227
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,640
How do you know that?

228
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
The teeth.

229
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,000
In the past, people had poor dental products.

230
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
They couldn't brush teeth,

231
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,000
so their teeth were in bad conditions.

232
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
But modern people brush teeth twice a day

233
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
and eat refined food.

234
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,600
A 30-year-old person in ancient times

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,640
would generally be a middle-aged person

236
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,800
with poor dental health.

237
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,120
Does anyone even live here?

238
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:36,840
Alright.

239
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,040
Let's venture deeper.

240
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,280
Okay.

241
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,240
Let us

242
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,160
go this way.

243
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,520
Okay.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,400
Let's go.

245
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,600
What the heck is this place?

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:56,720
How is it?

247
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,360
No one's in the village.

248
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,080
Not a single person?

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,640
Nope.

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,520
The forest is full of skeletons.

251
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,200
Did everyone from the village die?

252
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,920
The houses were built afterwards.

253
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,480
Look,

254
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,920
the edges of the foundation
are particularly even,

255
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,040
I can immediately tell
it was the work of machines.

256
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,400
These rocks are old.

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,720
I think the ones who discovered the village

258
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,040
moved them here.

259
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
So

260
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,080
they discovered and moved

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
the entire village?

262
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,640
And I explicitly remember

263
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
that the person who sent me off told me

264
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,680
that my descent

265
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,640
would bring disasters.

266
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,040
Disasters?

267
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
Be calm!

268
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,720
Dead people are the safest!

269
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,520
I'll have you know,

270
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,760
the living is more dangerous than the dead.

271
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,760
I don't care!

272
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,040
I'll stick with you today.

273
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,520
I...

274
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
It is a strange village though.

275
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,280
It appears normal on the outside,

276
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,880
but there are no household goods inside.

277
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,800
Not just that,

278
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,760
there's no furniture, either.

279
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,880
No table or chair.

280
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,600
Nothing.

281
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
This place is for show.

282
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,360
It doesn't look like someone lives here.

283
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,560
Oh, no.

284
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,000
This is a ghost village.

285
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
It's better that no one lives here.

286
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's find two empty rooms for the night,

287
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,080
then we'll move out tomorrow,

288
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,480
okay?

289
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,120
Okay.

290
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,160
Hat Guy,

291
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:54,920
let's go there.

292
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,960
You two, search that place.

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,160
Stop following me.

294
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,160
I have to.

295
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,200
I'm a bit scared.

296
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,400
You're nearly glued on me.

297
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,040
I insist.

298
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,160
Oh, my.

299
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,280
What the heck is this place?

300
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Ugh!

301
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,000
Let me take a look.

302
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,800
There's no water in the well.

303
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,960
Be careful.

304
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,600
The village is unpopulated,

305
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
so it's natural that there's no water.

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This village

307
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
is a bit different from the one I saw before.

308
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
There has to be differences
after reconstruction.

309
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
The differences are glaring.

310
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,440
It looks nothing like what it used to be.

311
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,960
I guess the ones
who reconstructed the village

312
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
didn't see what it looked like originally.

313
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,280
Of course,

314
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
Young Master.

315
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,880
You're the only living person

316
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,680
who saw the original village.

317
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,480
I don't get it.

318
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,440
You're already in between us.

319
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Why do you have to hug me?

320
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm afraid to sleep on my own.

321
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,200
It feels safer hugging you.

322
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,440
Xiang is available, too.

323
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
Why don't you go hugging him?

324
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
He's out there on guard duty.

325
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,760
Also,

326
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,400
it feels strange

327
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,560
to hug him.

328
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,960
And it's not strange that you hug me?

329
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,560
Xiaoyu is even beside us.

330
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,480
No.

331
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,000
Don't you think

332
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,400
it's particularly thrilling

333
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,400
that I am hugging you

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,680
with your girlfriend beside us?

335
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,240
Xiang...

336
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:07,840
William.

337
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,480
Xiang...

338
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,280
Xiang...

339
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,160
Xiang...

340
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,880
Xiang, wake up.

341
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,680
Xiang.

342
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,520
Xiang, wake up.

343
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,480
Li. Li.

344
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,120
- Li.
- Wake up.

345
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:16,720
Wake up.

346
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,200
You're awake, Xiang.

347
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
How do you feel?

348
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,400
I need some water.

349
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:18,960
William,

350
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,520
m-m-my throat.

351
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,080
Water.

352
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,840
I can talk now.

353
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,480
Are you okay?

354
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,280
We're both fine.

355
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,400
But my boss' girlfriend went missing.

356
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,880
Jin Xiaoyu!

357
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,640
Jin Xiaoyu!

358
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,720
- Jin Xiaoyu!
- Boss,

359
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
I don't think she's here.

360
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,320
- Jin Xiaoyu!
- Jin Xiaoyu!

361
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,000
Stop shouting.

362
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
I don't think she went missing.

363
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,800
Lin Nuoyan must have taken her.

364
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
This guy really is a trouble-maker.

365
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,760
You should consider yourself lucky.

366
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,480
He only took Xiaoyu away.

367
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,440
He didn't kill you.

368
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,840
That's true.

369
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,520
Where is this fragrance coming from?

370
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,320
It smells so good.

371
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,480
The flower field should be close by.

372
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:00,920
It smells so good.

373
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,520
Let's keep moving.

374
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,240
Let's go.

375
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,840
Xiaoyu.

376
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,720
I knew

377
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,520
that you'd come find me.

378
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,400
Don't flatter yourself.

379
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
You kidnapped me.

380
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,160
Where is Jiang Baiju?

381
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,440
What did you do to them?

382
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,400
I'm a medical researcher,

383
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,240
not a serial killer.

384
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,400
I won't do anything to them

385
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,080
if they don't come.

386
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,680
What if they do?

387
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,840
I'll have to break his legs.

388
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,240
Let's change the topic.

389
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,240
Show me your garden.

390
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,440
So that was only a small meteorite,

391
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,240
right?

392
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,840
Yes.

393
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,480
I can't let anyone get close to it.

394
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,160
But you guys impressed me.

395
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
You journeyed through the mountains
overnight to get here.

396
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,880
Stay, Jin Xiaoyu.

397
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,040
Stay here

398
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
in replacement of Ye Lai,

399
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,800
so that I'd become your experimental subject?

400
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,200
No.

401
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
You're not the experimental subject,

402
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,840
but my partner.

403
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
Only I can cure you.

404
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,320
Look at this place.

405
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,280
This is our homeland.

406
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,720
Our people

407
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,040
once lived here.

408
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,160
They didn't get out
of the valley for centuries.

409
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,640
They didn't know

410
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,080
that the Han, Wei, or Jin dynasty existed.

411
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,440
This really is an utopia.

412
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,760
You were the one who rebuilt the village?

413
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,400
Yes.

414
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,960
According to the old address
passed down within our clan,

415
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,120
I found the place.

416
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,200
Though I reconstructed the village,

417
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,080
it's only a shell

418
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,440
and a form of solace.

419
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,760
So

420
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,120
you created the forest grave, too?

421
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,720
Yes.

422
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,560
When the relic was excavated,

423
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,520
there were many skeletons.

424
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,480
I laid them to rest in the forest

425
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,920
near the new village

426
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,200
according to the clan's customs.

427
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,840
And the bodies of those clansmen
who went outside,

428
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,920
I got them back as well.

429
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,680
Our clansmen

430
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,240
were born, raised, and buried here

431
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,680
for generations.

432
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,280
If it weren't for that intruder,

433
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,720
you and I would still be neighbors.

434
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,520
We are the real childhood friends,

435
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,320
Xiaoyu.

436
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:02,960
Forget it.

437
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,400
I don't think this life suits me.

438
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,400
It's stupid and boring.

439
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,120
I'll pass.

440
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,960
Are you still mad at me?

441
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,440
Bella was only twelve years old.

442
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
Mrs. Xu was sixty years old.

443
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
Tan Yueran suffered from a heart disease.

444
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,840
I can't believe you
could've done that to them.

445
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,200
I didn't offer the drug to Bella and Mrs. Xu.

446
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
It was Ye Lai.

447
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,080
She is lunatic.

448
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,240
And I can't control her.

449
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,120
I can't even tell

450
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,880
if she was born that way

451
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,240
or was it the side effect
of the special drug.

452
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,520
Xiaoyu,

453
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,160
I never held anything back from you.

454
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,760
I told you from the beginning

455
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,280
that medicine is great.

456
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,280
The capable ones

457
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
can alter the law of nature.

458
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,120
But everything needs to be built

459
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,120
upon the sacrifice of certain people.

460
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,360
Why don't you sacrifice yourself, then?

461
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,720
If you think it's so great,

462
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,880
why don't you sacrifice yourself?

463
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,680
Any sacrifice should
be based on voluntariness.

464
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,040
If I volunteer, that's sacrifice.

465
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,400
If I don't, that's murder!

466
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,120
Lin Nuoyan.

467
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,840
Everything you say sounds good,

468
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,560
but everything you do is repulsive.

469
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,160
Has anyone told you, Jin Xiaoyu?

470
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
Your thoughts

471
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,920
are sometimes quite annoying.

472
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,400
How does Jiang Baiju put up with you?

473
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,560
Because he never did anything guilty.

474
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,200
Fine.

475
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,440
If this is the case,

476
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,880
and if you despise me so much,

477
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,000
why did you come find me?

478
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,600
Do you honestly think
that I'd turn myself in to the police?

479
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,560
Do you think

480
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,480
I could be that naive?

481
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,920
You're quite naive, to be honest.

482
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,920
Am I?

483
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,240
Didn't frisk me?

484
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,000
Big mistake!

485
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,400
Jin Xiaoyu!

486
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,280
Be careful, guys.

487
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:14,840
Stay together.

488
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,480
Boss,

489
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,160
someone's here.

490
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,000
Get your weapons ready.

491
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,240
It's you.

492
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,600
What are you doing here?

493
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,840
Because I'm everywhere.

494
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,280
What the heck is this thing?

495
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,280
I told Lin Nuoyan
we shouldn't keep you alive.

496
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
But he kept saying you were his kin,

497
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,160
a precious family of his.

498
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,400
But how

499
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,280
can you treat him like this?

500
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,360
I never wanted to.

501
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,040
Our ancestral stone

502
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,560
is supposed to be worshipped.

503
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,600
Not for harming people.

504
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,840
If I allowed you to continue
with your illegal acts,

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,480
I would not be able to face my ancestors.

506
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,200
Sophistry.

507
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,440
Don't come any closer.

508
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,600
Aren't you supposed to be a doctor?

509
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,720
The way you hold that thing
makes you look like a serial killer.

510
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,480
I'll have you know,

511
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,760
if you take one more step,

512
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,480
you'll be in trouble!

513
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Don't come any closer.

514
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,720
I'm telling you,

515
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,280
if you

516
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,120
come over...

517
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I don't want to be covered in blood.

518
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,880
I don't want to be covered in blood!

519
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,080
I told you I don't want
to be covered in blood.

520
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,080
What are you doing here?

521
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,840
We have no time.

522
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,520
No more dumb questions.

523
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,280
My brother and I came to rescue you.

524
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,720
Your Brother?

525
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:28,840
Let's go.

526
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,040
Let's go.

527
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:01,840
Let's go.

528
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,560
Are you okay, Boss?

529
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,080
Boss?

530
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,120
Where is she?

531
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,720
They went that way.

532
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,520
Chase after them.

533
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,560
No.

534
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,120
I can't run anymore.

535
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,320
Let's find a spot to rest

536
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,960
and hide.

537
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,960
No.

538
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,000
I damaged their water pump.

539
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,400
It'll explode soon.

540
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,480
Once it explodes,

541
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,520
the reservoir will be filled.

542
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,520
What are you talking about?

543
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,840
And then what?

544
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,840
And then...

545
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,960
It's hollow underneath,

546
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,720
so the ground will collapse.

547
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,800
What?

548
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,560
Qian Cheng,

549
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,520
you're really a genius, aren't you?

550
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,280
We'll be dead

551
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,160
if it collapses!

552
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,760
I wanted to run away
after I destroyed the place,

553
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,840
but I didn't know that you'd get kidnapped!

554
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,440
My time was wasted on rescuing you.

555
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,080
It's your fault!

556
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,760
It's my fault for being kidnapped?

557
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,400
Or what?

558
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
I knew someone like you

559
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,440
wouldn't have a backup lover!

560
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,600
Lin Nuoyan is the bad guy!

561
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,600
I knew someone like you

562
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,320
wouldn't have a first-love.

563
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,120
Ye Lai is the worst of the worst ever!

564
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,600
Xiaoyu!

565
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,440
Xiaoyu!

566
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,840
Cheng, what are you doing here?

567
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,640
No more talking!

568
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Let's run! The mountain is going to collapse!

569
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,720
What have you done?

570
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,320
This guy damaged the water pump!

571
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,440
This place is going to collapse!

572
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,320
We'll all die soon!

573
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,840
You damaged the water pump?

574
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,880
Careful!

575
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:29,840
Mr. Zhao!

576
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,280
Be careful.

577
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,000
Jiang Baiju.

578
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Don't move, you two.

579
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,000
Instead of recuperating at home,
why did you come here?,

580
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
You're already dying,
so why did you come here?

581
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,720
Stop fighting!

582
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,640
Young Master,

583
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,040
I should've died ten years ago.

584
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,960
If it weren't for you,

585
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,400
I wouldn't have lived for so long.

586
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
I am already very thankful.

587
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,240
Stop talking nonsense.

588
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
I won't let go of you.

589
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,920
You're a man. Don't be sentimental.

590
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,520
Jiang Baiju.

591
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,560
I won't let go of you, either.

592
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,720
Jiang Baiju, listen to me.

593
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,960
I don't have much time left.

594
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,800
Even if I'm lucky enough to survive this,

595
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't know what the future holds.

596
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,320
I told you,

597
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,360
don't measure the value of life

598
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,640
with the time you have left.

599
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,680
I said, any sacrifice
is based on voluntariness.

600
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,840
Xiaoyu, don't let go!

601
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,280
I don't need you to save me.

602
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:15,960
Cheng!

603
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,520
Qian Cheng!

604
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,480
Cheng, catch it.

605
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,320
I'll pull you up.

606
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,240
Careful.

607
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,160
Careful.

608
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,520
Careful.

609
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,440
Watch it.

610
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,680
Be careful. Be careful.

611
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Pull. Pull.

612
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,240
Take it easy.

613
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,240
Are you okay?

614
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:41,840
I'm fine.

615
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,240
Your brothers always come to your rescue

616
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
at critical moments.

617
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,040
I'll pull Young Master up.

618
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,920
My home.

619
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,960
It's gone.

620
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,840
I lost everything.

621
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,120
Jiang Baiju.

622
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,960
What I can't get,

623
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,600
you won't get, either.

624
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,760
I never wanted anything,

625
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,320
otherwise, I wouldn't become a designer.

626
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,680
I obtained fortune, honor,

627
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,440
and power.

628
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,280
But I wanted none of them.

629
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,840
I want to trade everything I had

630
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,200
for a regular ID card.

631
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,160
Before I die,

632
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,560
I can watch a movie

633
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,520
with the one I love.

634
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,040
Get it?

635
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,840
But she doesn't have much time left.

636
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,840
But she's got her family, friends,

637
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
and us to love her.

638
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,680
The value of life

639
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,920
is never measured by length, wealth

640
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,160
or appearance.

641
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,840
This is something you might never understand.

642
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,020
(Dongqian Lake Water Park)

643
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,100
(Police)

644
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,760
When everything's settled,

645
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
will we cherish everything we have

646
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,760
and the people we love?

647
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,840
Faced with passionate love,

648
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,520
we should empower it
with the most glamorous life

649
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,200
and add a ray of sunlight to it.

650
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,440
That is hope.

651
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,640
Yes.

652
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:11,920
Being alive

653
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,240
means hope.

654
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,160
All indicators are good.

655
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,000
Let's go.

656
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,520
Doctor,

657
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
how is she doing?

658
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,720
She's doing fine.

659
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,280
Okay.

660
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,600
Happiness and pain

661
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,400
are both parts of life.

662
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,080
The desire for them

663
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,360
(For your family's joy)
ends up as the last straw

664
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,680
(Let change start from now)
that destroys your will.

665
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,400
Lin Nuoyan's obsession and madness

666
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,760
landed him in jail for life.

667
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,120
Losing something is a process.

668
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,200
The sad part is
that you can't start over again.

669
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,640
The good part is,

670
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,440
it won't start over again.

671
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,960
I'll show you my new ID card.

672
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,080
What do you think?

673
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,720
Congrats.

674
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,360
Though you blew up the lab,

675
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,840
the police found the shards of the meteorite

676
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,720
and your research report

677
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,000
when they excavated

678
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,360
and cleaned up the place.

679
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,120
Your mentor President Zhang

680
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,600
formed a research group

681
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,640
to recover your research.

682
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,440
They said your research was valuable.

683
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,920
They said my research

684
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
was valuable?

685
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,400
Very valuable.

686
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,440
Why did you come to see me?

687
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,040
President Zhang asked me to come here.

688
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,920
Do you think I wanted to see you?

689
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,120
You broke his heart,

690
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,160
but still, you're the son of his old friend.

691
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,800
He raised you up and still cares about you.

692
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,200
That's why he asked me
to deliver something to you

693
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,560
and to see how you're doing.

694
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,800
Now I can go back and tell him you're fine.

695
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,760
Please help me relay this to President Zhang.

696
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,800
He has to be careful
with the meteorite's radiation,

697
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,240
especially when extracting
the mineral substance.

698
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,120
Under no circumstance
should he touch the meteorite,

699
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,360
not even a speck of it.

700
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,640
You don't have to tell me this.

701
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,680
It's written in your report.

702
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Xiaoyu is still thinking about you.

703
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,320
Though you did many terrible things

704
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,360
and harmed quite a lot of people,

705
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,080
you treated her nicely.

706
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,240
I'm not even sure
if I should consider myself lucky

707
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,520
now that you're sitting in there.

708
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,400
It's about time.

709
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,840
I'm off.

710
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,800
Jiang Baiju.

711
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,720
What?

712
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,240
How does it feel

713
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,680
to be immortal?

714
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,040
Just out of curiosity,

715
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,120
if the unknown substance in the meteorite

716
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,880
wasn't radioactive,

717
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,320
would you enjoy your immortality?

718
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:06,600
No.

719
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,840
Immortality

720
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,880
means you're almost like God.

721
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,760
But men are still mortals.

722
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,960
A man needs a normal life.

723
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,600
He needs love, warmth,

724
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,320
regret, and loss.

725
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,560
You can learn
how to cherish and love something

726
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,840
in your limited life.

727
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,680
You really are a coward.

728
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,600
You are not

729
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,680
seeing the bigger picture.

730
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,440
Farewell.

731
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,320
I think every story

732
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,960
deserves a happy ending.

733
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,120
There's already too many troubles in life,

734
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,520
so a story needs to be beautiful.

735
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,040
I've broken off the fetters

736
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,960
and become a real writer.

737
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,520
I've also got a new home now.

738
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,440
You all have to buy my books,

739
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,000
because I have a mortgage to pay.

740
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,160
I don't think I liked her.

741
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,560
It was more like a sense of duty.

742
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,960
I feel like I was responsible for that woman,

743
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,840
or a desire to have her.

744
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,960
I felt like she belonged to me.

745
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,560
Now that I think about it,

746
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,040
I can't believe I ever wanted

747
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,200
such a vicious woman.

748
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,760
Please don't make your subjective judgment.

749
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,560
Just express your true feelings.

750
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,280
There is right and wrong in every action.

751
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,560
In every action?

752
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,040
The human mind
can reach the wildest of places,

753
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,440
but we're bound by law and moralities.

754
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,400
If you do something wrong,

755
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,840
then it has to be wrong.

756
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,200
Love at its purest stage

757
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,400
is exceptionally sweet.

758
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,240
So it is not about Ye Lai?

759
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,880
Everybody loves someone with a character.

760
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,160
A beautiful love

761
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,320
is the ultimate dream for all humans.

762
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,360
Chief Fan,

763
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,240
what type of woman do you like?

764
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,720
I, too, would love a woman with a character.

765
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,960
Would you fall for Ye Lai?

766
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,600
Qian Cheng's treatment
has been progressing rapidly

767
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,760
now that he has been able
to talk about his feelings honestly.

768
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,520
He is now able
to talk about the topic of love

769
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,640
with his doctor.

770
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,480
As we agreed,

771
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,680
he will continue working

772
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,080
in Qing'ai.

773
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,120
Are you having a toothache?

774
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,000
Why do you look glum?

775
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,200
The venue is too small.

776
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,920
This is Young Master's first launch event.

777
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,840
Young Master

778
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,080
is now a new designer.

779
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,960
This is good enough.

780
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,800
If he comes into everybody's view

781
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,960
as the fourth-generation designer

782
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,280
replacing William,

783
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,440
people will look into his history.

784
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,800
Jiang Baiju had his first launch event.

785
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,920
For the first time,
he stood in the middle of the stage

786
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,440
receiving applauses from everybody.

787
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,400
The man

788
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,360
who made Qing'ai stay
in the frontier of fashion for 70 years

789
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,880
has finally stepped forward on the stage

790
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,560
(Qing'ai Group)
as an ordinary rising designer

791
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,320
who would be judged, questioned, and attacked

792
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,240
by the public.

793
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,280
What are you doing?

794
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,320
The stuff's in the car.

795
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,040
Can you stop delaying?

796
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,440
Qian Tu,

797
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,320
I saved Qian Cheng's life.

798
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,920
Could you please be nice to me?

799
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,840
It's already very nice of me

800
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
to help you move.

801
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
Stop wasting time. Let's go.

802
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,320
Okay.

803
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,800
Oh, right.

804
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,840
There must be a wedding

805
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,880
in a happy-ending story.

806
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,760
♪In face of time♪

807
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,780
♪Break open a door♪

808
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,100
♪I still can't♪

809
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,000
Lovers finally getting married is cliche,

810
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,600
but it is also very beautiful.

811
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,720
In the future,

812
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,040
they,

813
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,440
like all ordinary couples,

814
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,320
will experience honeymoon,

815
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,120
the boredom for each other,

816
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
pregnancy,

817
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,240
baby-feeding,

818
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,880
climacterium and so on.

819
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,440
They'll grow old,

820
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:03,840
ugly,

821
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,280
boring,

822
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,800
and senile.

823
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,160
Eventually, they'll both pass away.

824
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,440
Yes, I do.

825
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,960
Yes, I do.

826
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,780
♪Who has been praying to God♪

827
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,840
But so what?

828
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,240
Be with someone you love,

829
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,240
and grow old,

830
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:30,720
turn ugly,

831
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,480
become senile,

832
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,640
and die together,

833
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,680
life is as simple as that.

834
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,880
It took Jiang Baiju 80 years

835
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,600
to obtain this ordinary and insipid life.

836
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,280
As for us,

837
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,000
we've always been

838
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,360
living an ordinary and insipid life.

839
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,200
Is everybody ready for the bouquet?

840
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:02,680
Which side?

841
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,360
Here!

842
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:04,920
Ma'am,

843
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,760
you're also a single lady.

844
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,440
You should fight for the bouquet as well.

845
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,120
I stopped doing this when I was young.

846
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,160
Besides,

847
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,320
getting married is boring.

848
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
A life of passionate love
is the most romantic.

849
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,680
I thought you didn't want to get married.

850
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,160
My mother

851
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,120
gave me an order that

852
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
I must get the bouquet from Jin Xiaoyu.

853
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,320
Oh,

854
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,200
what's the purpose of Chief Cheng?

855
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,280
All parents hold the same attitude

856
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:25,960
for their child's marriage.

857
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,720
Just go for it.

858
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,000
Don't fight me for it.

859
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,920
Don't jostle me.

860
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,880
Give it to me, Xiaoyu.

861
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,040
Here!
