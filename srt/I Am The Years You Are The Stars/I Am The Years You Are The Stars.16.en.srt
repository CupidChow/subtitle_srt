Weilan.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,840
Have you finished writing the report
for the community activity?

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,480
Still working on it.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,920
Hello! Hi!

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,520
This is William, who is here for a free meal.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,760
Yes, I'm William.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I write web novels. Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,040
Hi! Nice to meet you.

27
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:03,800
What's up?

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
Why did you bring him to the duty room?

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
If Chief Cheng knows he is here,
you will be in trouble.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,880
He's been here so many times.

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,800
My mother already knew.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,280
Did Chief Cheng say anything?

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,440
Nothing.

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,560
She's probably waiting to make her move.
Let's just wait and see.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,440
William, let's go for food.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,240
OK, I'm coming.

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,560
The community activities report. You are welcome.

38
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,800
You are my great benefactor! Great benefactor!

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm off.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,160
Bye.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,520
Wait for me.

42
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,160
Though he is a deadbeat guy,

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
he behaves politely.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,440
Take a look

45
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,720
at the stitches sewn by Xiaoyu.

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
It's as if there weren't any stitches at all.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,440
The skin is as flat as that on a living person.

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,840
Take a good look and learn from her!

49
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,520
Master, my work is also not bad.

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
Oh, Wang Quande! Wang Quande!

51
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,000
You are not skilled at all.

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,840
Work harder!

53
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,440
Master,

54
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,840
I think men are not

55
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,760
good at sewing by nature.

56
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,080
From your attitude,
I can see what makes Xiaoyu better than you.

57
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Although it's just the last short trip,

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,400
we

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,240
must let the dead rest in peace.

60
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,680
This is the last section
of their long journey in this world.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,800
We need to make them feel assured.
Do you understand?

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,840
Master.

63
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,160
My wedding with Xi is coming.

64
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
Can my wedding leave...

65
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,760
Look at your poor performance!

66
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Aren't you ashamed to ask for a leave?

67
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,800
Master!

68
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
You know

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,240
how difficult it is for people
in our profession to get married.

70
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,720
It's not easy for me to get a wife.

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,320
You might as well just ruin my love life.

72
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,400
Hold it!

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,880
Don't call that lady your wife
until you are married.

74
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
Remember not to mention

75
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,240
your wedding in front of Xiaoyu.

76
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,480
She had a break-up recently.

77
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,160
W-We haven't even noticed it.

78
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,600
How do you know?

79
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,640
Has she told someone?

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,080
I raised her.
Of course I can tell when something is wrong.

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,440
When she's in a bad mood,

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,800
she will concentrate on working.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
When she was a student,

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,560
she concentrated on doing her schoolwork.

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,880
Now, she focuses on sewing up pork.

86
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,520
How do you know she has had a break-up?

87
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,800
Do you think why she moved out?

88
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,400
We all thought that she might

89
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,800
have moved out to live with her boyfriend.

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,840
Isn't that a given?

91
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,480
She's really living with her boyfriend?

92
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,160
Shouldn't you do something about it?

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,440
You didn't even ask her about it.

94
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,040
If she was a normal child,

95
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,200
I would severely punish her.

96
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
But she isn't a normal child.

97
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,560
She may pass away very soon.

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,160
Just let her do whatever she likes.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,920
Besides, she knows right from wrong.

100
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
She won't do anything improper.

101
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,320
And your wedding leave,

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,160
I will have it approved earlier.

103
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,880
I don't know

104
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
if I can see Xiaoyu get married.

105
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,400
Jiang Baiju doesn't like durian.

106
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,000
What are you doing?

107
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,480
I bought it for you.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,760
Are you poisoning me?

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
Can you stop quarreling with Young Master?

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
You are not good at selecting durians.

111
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,800
And you are not good at selecting a boyfriend.

112
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,000
I always thought that

113
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
Jiang Baiju's wish for life was to die.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,800
But I thought that was too hard.

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,920
It's too difficult for him to die.

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,880
That's until I was told that

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,360
he had already figured out how to die.

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,200
He would jump into the furnace of a steel plant.

119
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,320
He would have himself beheaded
and his heart removed.

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,760
Before he met me,

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,840
he had such an agreement with Madam Dao.

122
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,480
And

123
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
after Madam Dao dies,

124
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,280
he will kill himself.

125
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,040
Don't you think it sounds like...

126
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Dying for love?

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,360
Maybe we should call it an agreement of death.

128
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,600
After he met me,

129
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,960
Madam Dao hoped I could

130
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,280
persuade him into changing his mind

131
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,320
and to assure him that he surely
will become an ordinary man someday.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
But I think he won't listen to me.

133
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,000
After I die, he will

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,520
destroy himself.

135
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,880
I told you already.

136
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,560
You are like a poison
that just gives him temporary relief.

137
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Just like the wonder drug Young Master
and my elder brother are investigating.

138
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,280
It seems to work temporarily.

139
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,400
In fact, it is harmful.

140
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Then what do you think I should do?

141
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,920
He should stop seeing you.

142
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,200
William was right.

143
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,160
You won't quarrel over me.

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
There is a deeper cause

145
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,120
for your quarrel.

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,920
When I saw him having dinner with Yang Xue'er,

147
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
I suddenly felt that

148
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,960
if he chose to be vulgar and indulge in enjoyment,

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,360
he would have fine dates.

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
I love him.

151
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,000
But he has a long past

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,080
without me.

153
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,080
And I won't even be able to

154
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
get involved in his future.

155
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,360
He has a soul mate who can die with him.

156
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,280
He also has beauties awaiting him.

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,080
What about me?

158
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,360
What role do I play?

159
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,840
I'm just a useless painkiller

160
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,880
that shouldn't have appeared.

161
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,400
What you said was right.

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,760
And the decision you made was also right.

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,280
Yes,

164
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,360
how can an abnormal person

165
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,400
expect to have a normal relationship?

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,120
(Service Hall)
Remember to come!

167
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,800
I will!

168
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,080
We should have a drink then.

169
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,520
My wedding is in a few days.
Here is an invitation.

170
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,200
Congratulations!

171
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,840
My wedding is coming...

172
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,880
Mr. Wang Quande,

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,280
I especially want to interview you about this.

174
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,720
It's too outdated.

175
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
Have you heard of electronic invitations?

176
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
This is just a waste of paper.

177
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,120
No.

178
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,240
I'll send the electronic invitation
to the group chat later.

179
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,440
A paper invitation is necessary
to invite people face to face.

180
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,440
It shows I'm serious about it. What do you know?

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Thanks.

182
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,240
It sounds like a great honor to be invited.

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,240
Zhang Quanzhan,

184
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
you don't understand it.

185
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,040
It is not easy for Wang Quande to get married.

186
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,920
So, it is necessary to make it look more formal.

187
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
That's right. Xiaoyu knows me.

188
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,200
Give it here.

189
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,080
Let me take one.

190
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,280
Exempt me from giving you wedding money.

191
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,600
And I'll exempt you from paying for my funeral.

192
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,360
- Bye-bye!
- No,

193
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,360
my wedding is a happy event.

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
Yours will be a funeral.

195
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,040
How can they be the same?

196
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,800
They are the same.

197
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,480
Remember what you said, take it seriously!

198
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,280
Master,

199
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,080
Wang Quande is sending his wedding invitations.

200
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,240
This is yours.

201
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,440
That brat!

202
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,680
I just told him

203
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,960
not to show off his wedding in front of you.

204
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,720
He has turned a deaf ear to my words.

205
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
He isn't showing it off in front of me.

206
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,800
He is showing it off to everyone at the hall.

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,840
He finally can get married.

208
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,680
Just let him show off.

209
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,080
It is impossible for Wang Quande
not to show off, isn't it?

210
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,160
This...

211
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,280
Your calligraphy is getting better and better.

212
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,240
How about it?

213
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,400
Is it okay?

214
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,200
Very good!

215
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,700
(Invitation)

216
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,040
There are so many invitations!

217
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,360
Let me have a look.

218
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,860
(Chief Cheng's invitation)

219
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,440
Is this young Chief Cheng?

220
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,400
This is the only time where I went to the wedding

221
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
of a person in another line of work.

222
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,680
What do you mean?

223
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,680
I was young and didn't know
about taboos at that time.

224
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,960
Actually, a lot of people

225
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,320
feel that we may bring bad luck.

226
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,000
You see, it was many years

227
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,880
before Chief Cheng got pregnant after her wedding.

228
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,400
She gave birth to Cheng Weilan
ten years after her wedding.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,160
I thought it was I

230
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,240
that brought bad luck to her.

231
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,840
So, since then

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,520
I have never been to any wedding
even when I was invited.

233
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Oh, they are just thoughts of feudal superstition!

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,520
Chief Cheng's late childbirth resulted from

235
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,560
her devotion to work.

236
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,000
What did it have to do with you?

237
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
We are fine, aren't we?

238
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,360
Xiaoyu.

239
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,880
Actually, I want to receive

240
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,640
an invitation to your wedding the most.

241
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,840
She was very beautiful.

242
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,440
Are you

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,160
having problems with your boyfriend?

244
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,760
No.

245
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:47,920
No, I'm not.

246
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,440
Well, you had no experience

247
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,760
in dating.

248
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,240
Some bickering in a relationship

249
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,840
can also be fun.

250
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,240
But you should remember

251
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,840
to cherish

252
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,160
the one who is sincere to you.

253
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,440
As to your boyfriend,

254
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,400
I don't know anything else about him.

255
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,360
At least he is healthier
with a longer life than you, isn't he?

256
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,920
Yes, he is very healthy.

257
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
In fact, he has been living for too long.

258
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,040
Look at you! Despite your health problem,

259
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,680
he still proceeds without hesitation.

260
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,240
It is accurate to use
"proceeds without hesitation" here.

261
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,440
He proceeds without hesitation to date you.

262
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,560
Making such a decision takes much courage.

263
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,480
In a relationship, it takes courage

264
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,360
whether the one at an advantage
or the one at a disadvantage.

265
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,320
One is running upwards.

266
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,680
The other is running downwards.

267
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,520
When the one running upwards is out of strength,

268
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,760
it is easier for him or her to slow down.

269
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,400
The one running downwards

270
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,920
gathers inertia,

271
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
which makes it difficult for the person to stop.

272
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,840
This is the reason why many people
that have an advantage

273
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,480
enjoy the pleasures of being wooed,

274
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,200
but they are at a disadvantage
when in a relationship.

275
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,960
That's how it always turns out.

276
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,840
Master.

277
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
You are really an expert of love.

278
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,240
But you have never been married.

279
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,320
Why is that?

280
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Hello, Chief.

281
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,880
Don't worry.

282
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
I've got the file.

283
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,880
Okay, I see.

284
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480
After I read it,

285
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,440
I'll send it to you.

286
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,400
Chief, I will call you later.

287
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,720
You're Cheng Weilan?

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,800
You're William's friend?

289
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm his girlfriend.

290
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,800
Then I'll call William to confirm it.

291
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,760
He hasn't officially announced it.

292
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,320
But I've always been with him.

293
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,080
Didn't you see that

294
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,680
I'm very close to him?

295
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, he is a player

296
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,040
and you are one of his love interests.

297
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,240
Looking at how you're dressed,

298
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,760
you must be his kind of people.

299
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,560
But judging from your silly look,

300
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,960
you must be a victim.

301
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,280
He has been coming here for free meals these days.

302
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,800
I figured such a handsome guy

303
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,040
must have a lot of girlfriends.

304
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,640
And now

305
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,640
you are here.

306
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,160
Don't think you're special.

307
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,640
Yes,

308
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,560
you are right.

309
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,680
He has no girlfriend.

310
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,920
But he has many bros.

311
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,640
Many bros?

312
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,000
Does he also go out with guys?

313
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,760
No.

314
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,120
He treats girls like us as bros.

315
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,160
Everyone is a bro.

316
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,360
So, you are a bro, too.

317
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
Well, since I'm a bro too,

318
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,280
did you come here

319
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
to be my sworn brother today?

320
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
I've been following you for a long time.

321
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,960
You nearly scared me to death.

322
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,280
Has William

323
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,480
invited you to be his dance partner
in the celebration?

324
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,840
Yes, but I refused.

325
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,760
I'm not much of a dancer.

326
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,840
You aren't his partner?

327
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,440
Then who can it be?

328
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you doing?

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
You look like a dummy. I couldn't help it.

330
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,280
Who did you say is a dummy?

331
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,360
All right,

332
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,240
I need to work.

333
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,920
Bye.

334
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,320
(Cleaning Room)
Don't go. Make it clear to me.

335
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,280
The Little King of Hell has come
to save the princess.

336
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,960
I don't think a kiss is enough to wake her up.

337
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,200
There are many ways to wake up the princess.

338
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,560
Well done!

339
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,800
Jin Xiaoyu.

340
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,520
Can't you do something proper?

341
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,080
I heard

342
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,520
William's little mermaid caused trouble here.

343
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,600
So, I came to show you some love.

344
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,760
Let me have a look.

345
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,160
Good, there are no scratches on your face.

346
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
Sigh,

347
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,320
I don't know why girls

348
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,760
want to hurt each other for men.

349
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,800
The men who cause us to hurt each other

350
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,240
are still footloose and fancy-free somewhere.

351
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,360
That's right.

352
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,320
William and I will keep an eye on

353
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,360
the charity auction.

354
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,880
You can come out at dinner.

355
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm just a backup.

356
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
I won't come out unless I'm needed.

357
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,520
The girl that will cause trouble
for you is coming to the dinner, too.

358
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,280
She doesn't like the media either.

359
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,160
I'm curious about his childhood.

360
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,640
How did he grow up to be like this?

361
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,680
I had a miserable childhood.

362
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,360
My family was very poor when I was young...

363
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,920
If you talk more nonsense,

364
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,040
your youth will be

365
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,720
very miserable, too.

366
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,800
Thank you.

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,080
And you will never reach your middle age.

368
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,360
People change so easily!

369
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,240
What are you sighing for?

370
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,680
The previous spokeswoman of Qing'ai Group

371
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,160
was Qin Rong.

372
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,440
Since she went to France to receive treatment,

373
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,480
no one has been talking about her.

374
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,920
You see, everyone is talking about Yang Xue'er.

375
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,400
No matter who the spokeswoman of Qing'ai Group is,

376
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,920
it doesn't matter.

377
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,760
That's because
there is only one founder of Qing'ai Group.

378
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,600
Who is that?

379
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
The founder of Qing'ai Group is

380
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:32,880
Madam Dao.

381
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,980
(30th Anniversary of Qing'ai Group)

382
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,100
(30th Anniversary of Qing'ai Group)

383
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,760
It's the anniversary celebration
of Qing'ai Fashion!

384
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,120
I heard that Wang Muyang has been invited.

385
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,200
William will do me fine.

386
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,920
He is talented and handsome.

387
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
I'm telling you guys,

388
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,160
I want to see Yang Xue'er.

389
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,560
A celebration with her won't be an ordinary one.

390
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,480
Let me guess.

391
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,120
William is the designer of Qing'ai.

392
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,160
He stole samples for your mysterious boyfriend,

393
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,120
which means they must be very close.

394
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,040
Will your mysterious boyfriend

395
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,000
go to the celebration of Qing'ai?

396
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,640
He won't appear in the media.

397
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
Besides, he's already my ex, OK?

398
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,200
So, you are going to just lie here all day?

399
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,920
And watch your ex-boyfriend on your cell phone?

400
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,520
Why don't we talk about

401
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,440
William the playboy?

402
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,480
Are you okay?

403
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,600
Why are you in there for so long?

404
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,120
I'm relieving myself.

405
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,320
Just a second.

406
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,640
I told you that

407
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,280
you can take a Bovine Bezoar Heart-Clearing Pill
when feeling heaty.

408
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,040
Constipation can be unbearable.

409
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,440
Got it. I will take it later.

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,120
Do you need Glycerine Enema?

411
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I'll be out in a minute.

412
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,000
All right.

413
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,200
I won't live long.

414
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,360
I've never done anything immoral.

415
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,160
Why? Why is it me?

416
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,320
Why do some people have a long life?

417
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,760
But I can only live
until I'm twenty-five years old.

418
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,160
There is even someone who will never die.

419
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,760
This is so unfair.

420
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,680
Jin Xiaoyu.

421
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,720
Are you constipated
because of your sentimentality?

422
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
I thought you were gone.

423
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,920
You've been in there so long.

424
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,760
So, I'm worried about you.

425
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,560
What's on your mind
that you can't even tell your best friend?

426
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,680
You would rather tell it to the toilet.

427
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,920
Am I worse than a toilet?

428
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,360
Do you want to get a drink?

429
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Let's go to the celebration, shall we?

430
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,720
Let's extend a big round of applause to

431
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,400
the CEO of Qing'ai Group,

432
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
Mr. Qian Cheng,

433
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,440
and the well-known designer of Qing'ai Group,

434
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,240
William Dao!

435
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,560
Hello, everyone.

436
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,040
Hello.

437
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,080
(30th Anniversary of Qing'ai Group)
Mr. William.

438
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,960
You have proven yourself
to be an excellent designer

439
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,680
with the collection
of Zhuangzhou Dreamed of Butterfly.

440
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,680
So in the next ten years,

441
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,240
what changes

442
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,160
are you going to bring to Qing'ai?

443
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,120
Taking oriental aesthetics as the pivot point

444
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,760
while combining design with classic factors

445
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,040
will be our lasting theme.

446
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,880
Also please pay attention to our

447
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,640
new fashion collection at the end of the year.

448
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,160
Thank you!

449
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,440
Yang Xue'er, the movie queen with numerous awards,

450
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,760
is also here.

451
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,360
Does it mean that Qing'ai Group will have

452
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,880
further cooperation with Yang Xue'er?

453
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,800
Exactly.

454
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,320
The combination of design and classic factors

455
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,920
has promoted this cooperation

456
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,880
with Miss Yang.

457
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,640
I believe Qing'ai

458
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,360
will give everyone a pleasant surprise.

459
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,840
Please continue to pay attention to us.

460
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,560
Thank you.

461
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,560
Mr. William.

462
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,560
It is said that Miss Qin Rong,
who has had a private relationship with you,

463
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,840
is absent from this anniversary celebration.

464
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,160
Is it because of Xue Wanwan?

465
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,760
Due to our limited time,

466
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,400
let's welcome the next guest. Please...

467
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,320
Hello,

468
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,120
how do I look? Is it beautiful?

469
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,720
You are such a playful child! I told you

470
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,120
to wrap yourself up a bit more
for this celebration.

471
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,440
You are still showing so much skin.

472
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
Are these the words of a designer?

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,080
They are the words of an elder uncle

474
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,280
entrusted by your father.

475
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,400
Put on this quickly.

476
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,920
You've been like this since childhood.

477
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,160
My father would pass away someday,

478
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,520
but someone just won't die.

479
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,960
You threw a fit and wanted to marry me
when you were a kid.

480
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,240
Do you dislike me now?

481
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,200
Don't believe what a girl says.

482
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,680
Didn't your girlfriend tell you?

483
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,640
She broke up with me

484
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,600
before she told me that.

485
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,000
She sounds like a smart girl.

486
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,000
A smart girl

487
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,720
never educates a man.

488
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,480
A smart girl runs away
when she sees things are not going well.

489
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,440
So, when you meet a smart girl,

490
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,360
you should behave yourself.

491
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,360
Otherwise, you will be dumped.

492
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,560
Who taught you all these theories
while you were growing up?

493
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,360
Didn't we break up because of you?

494
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
You found out?

495
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,040
You told her about our agreement?

496
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,560
Do you want to go back on your words?

497
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,720
Wait until I get her back.

498
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
Are you sure you can get her back?

499
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,440
That girls break up with you
without an explanation

500
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,520
means that there are chances
to get her back. You know?

501
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,440
Salute!

502
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
William taught you that.

503
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,800
The price is that I can't

504
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,960
tell you who his dance partner is for tonight.

505
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,640
It looks like there will be surprises tonight.

506
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
I heard you have brought a lot of clothes.

507
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,120
I'm going to pick out some clothes.

508
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,480
They are for the exhibition in the museum.

509
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,240
Don't make a mess.

510
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,680
You are always so energetic.

511
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,200
Clear!

512
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
Oh, my God!

513
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,040
It's ridiculous for us to wander around like this.

514
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
Can't you call any of them?

515
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,800
No, this is my last bit of stubbornness.

516
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,800
You and your last bit of stubbornness

517
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,680
should go to hell!

518
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
It is so beautiful here.

519
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
Is this a warehouse?

520
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,280
I don't know either.

521
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
Why there are so many clothes?

522
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,120
A wedding dress.

523
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,880
We can go from here to avoid people outside.

524
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,200
Let's keep our voices down.

525
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,440
Okay.

526
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,080
Someone's here.

527
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,560
I saw someone standing there.

528
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,200
Who did you see?

529
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,160
You scared me!

530
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,440
This is Qian Cheng's new business.

531
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,120
How could anyone be here?

532
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,440
Don't scare me again.

533
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,240
I...I'm sure I saw a red shadow.

534
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,720
A red shadow must be a red dress.

535
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,280
You are scaring yourself.

536
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,120
You are so lively!

537
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,640
Is she your friend?

538
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,960
She is my childhood friend.

539
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,920
She is a doctor.

540
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,440
A doctor?

541
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,120
She is so timid. How can she be a doctor?

542
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,120
Who says doctors can't be afraid of ghosts?

543
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,320
I'm here. Don't be scared.

544
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,680
Mrs. Dao. Why are you here?

545
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,240
Young Master is sending
these clothes to the museum.

546
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm here to pick out some beautiful clothes.

547
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,560
When I heard some noise,

548
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,640
I thought it might be a thief.

549
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,080
I didn't expect it was you two.

550
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,640
But

551
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,080
you can just take whatever you like?

552
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,160
Of course, the whole Qing'ai Group is mine.

553
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,680
Well, I have answered all your questions.

554
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,640
Now it's your turn to answer my question.

555
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,360
Why are you here?

556
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,000
I-I brought her here to look around the dresses.

557
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,080
It's very beautiful here, right?

558
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,880
Looking around?

559
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,800
Did you come for the celebration?

560
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,160
If you want to join the celebration,

561
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,200
you can just inform

562
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,880
any of the three.

563
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,720
Why did you

564
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,280
sneak in?

565
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,040
Little crying baby, you tell me.

566
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,400
I...I...

567
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,840
I've come with her

568
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,160
to find a man...

569
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,800
A man!

570
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Ex-boyfriend.

571
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,560
Ex-boyfriend?

572
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,800
It seems that I have missed a lot of stories.

573
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,960
Whether you are coming to see a man

574
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,040
or an ex-boyfriend,

575
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,960
it just won't do like this!

576
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,960
All right.

577
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,080
Come with me.

578
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,320
Hurry up!

579
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,840
Madam.

580
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,080
They are

581
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
my stylist, makeup artist, and hairdresser.

582
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,480
They were all trained by me.

583
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,560
They are all very skillful.

584
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,080
The two girls are my friends.

585
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,560
Do your best.

586
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm taking them to the banquet.

587
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,120
Do it within one hour. OK?

588
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,760
Yes. Madam.

589
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,780
(Qing'ai Group)

590
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,560
Xue'er.

591
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,960
Hi, Miss Yang.

592
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,880
Go and find Young Master.

593
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,200
Miss Yang has arrived as promised.

594
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,600
You should fulfill your promise.

595
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,800
Of course.

596
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,200
It's you.

597
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:16,800
Hi!

598
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,120
Were you invited by the company?

599
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,520
Yes.

600
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,400
Have you forgotten?

601
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,040
You selected the clothes for my magazine shoot.

602
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,840
I have forgotten.

603
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
This is William's assistant.

604
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,480
You have met him before.

605
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,320
You can just call him Bai.

606
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,720
I know. I've met him in the fitting room before.

607
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,560
This is Lin Nuoyan, Professor Lin.

608
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,720
Head of the Association of Organ Donors,

609
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,800
as well as the spokesman
for the Tissue Regeneration Laboratory.

610
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,760
Nice to meet you.

611
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,840
Nice to meet you.

612
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,400
Professor Lin,

613
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,120
isn't President Zhang coming with you?

614
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,400
President Zhang has something on today.

615
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,280
I came here alone.

616
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,720
It's okay. You don't have to keep me accompanied.

617
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,200
I can hang around on my own.

618
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,040
I thought I wouldn't see you tonight.

619
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,080
How could I let you down?

620
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,440
Bai is the most important treasure of our company.

621
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,880
I hope you can feel the sincerity

622
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,280
of Qing'ai Group and myself.

623
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,600
Excuse me. Have a nice chat.

624
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,800
Hi, I'm Yang Xue'er.

625
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,720
Let me introduce myself again.

626
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:31,880
Where are you going?

627
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,720
What's up?

628
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,280
You're gonna just sell Young Master to someone?

629
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes,

630
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,200
her agent will have to transfer money to me later.

631
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,280
- Hello.
- Hi.

632
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,520
I'm telling you.

633
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,400
What I have arranged tonight

634
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,320
is only for Qing'ai Group's sake.

635
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,920
Didn't you hope Young Master

636
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,880
would break up with Jin Xiaoyu?

637
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,280
Why are you hesitating now?

638
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,520
Just like a loving father,

639
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,240
I dislike Jin Xiaoyu,
but I care about Young Master.

640
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,200
Your roles are changing so fast tonight.

641
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,400
It pains you to see them sad,
yet you're also trying to make them sad!

642
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,480
What on earth are you doing?

643
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,960
Are you cordyceps sinensis with two faces?

644
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,520
Can't I suddenly get a conscience?

645
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,600
I saw Jin Xiaoyu crying sadly that day.

646
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,800
I have never seen her crying before.

647
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,560
Only after I saw her cry,

648
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,880
did I realize she's a girl.

649
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,640
You are talking nonsense.

650
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,760
Of course, she is a girl.

651
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,440
If Young Master hears this,
he will surely beat you up.

652
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,760
Though I dislike Jin Xiaoyu,

653
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,200
it seems that Young Master likes her.

654
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
And she likes Young Master, too.

655
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm feeling stressed again.

656
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,640
No, please don't feel stressed today.

657
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,240
Take it easy.

658
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,520
If you get sick,

659
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm going to be in trouble.

660
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,800
I can't handle all of this.

661
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,000
Let me tell you.

662
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,600
There is no media here
and it is forbidden to take photos.

663
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,280
All the guests here today

664
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,880
are top class resources in our circle.

665
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,360
You know?

666
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,640
If you and I both keep it as a secret,

667
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Jin Xiaoyu

668
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,480
will never

669
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,320
find out about what happened today.

670
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,400
Trust me.

671
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,480
Madam.

672
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,560
- Madam Dao.
- Madam Dao.

673
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,040
Madam.

674
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,960
I miss you so much.

675
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,880
Cutie pie!

676
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,280
Are you William's dance partner tonight?

677
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,480
I'm Qian Cheng's dance partner.

678
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,200
It's my great honor.

679
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,320
Cheng Weilan.

680
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,000
Who are you?

681
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,280
Dummy.

682
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,520
She is William's mermaid.

683
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,480
Don't call me a dummy.

684
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,520
Wait for a moment.

685
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
Is this a battlefield?

686
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,440
I shouldn't have brought you here.

687
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,120
You two might fight until someone gets hurt.

688
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,000
If someone's hurt, I'll sew them up.

689
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,280
If you are beaten to death,

690
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,360
she will sew you up.

691
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,280
Sure.

692
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,960
What are you doing?

693
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:32,400
Let's go.

694
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,240
Hang out with me.

695
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,160
No, I don't want to.

696
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,880
Come on.

697
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:35,840
Madam!

698
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,080
She made new friends so soon.

699
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,200
Aren't you going to take a look around?

700
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,080
You can look around now.

701
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,120
Thank you, Madam.

702
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,640
How are you? Did you miss me?

703
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,480
Yes, Madam.

704
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,200
Long time no see.

705
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,480
Where's William?

706
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,520
Isn't he always with you?

707
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,960
Let me bring you to him.

708
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,680
OK.

709
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,680
Which girl is William's partner?

710
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,480
The Xue's.

711
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,560
Xue Wanwan is the only daughter of the Xue's.

712
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,720
Does Xue Zaozao have any other sisters?

713
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,200
The girl is from Xue Zaozao's
entertainment company,

714
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,560
so she belongs to the Xue's.

715
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,720
Hello! Hello!

716
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,680
Enjoy yourself. Have fun.

717
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,400
William.

718
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,920
- Hello!
- William.

719
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,040
William.

720
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Long time no see.

721
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,480
I miss you so much!

722
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,960
You look even more beautiful!

723
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,520
You look gorgeous!

724
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
- Is William Monk Tang?
- Come on. Let's have a toast.

725
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,000
Why is he so popular with female devils?
(* A quotation from Journey to the West)

726
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
Just have fun.

727
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,780
- Madam, that's not true.
- Have a good time tonight!

728
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,280
Not only will female devils discharge,

729
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,000
- Pikachu also discharges.
- Oh, my God!

730
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
You have lost more weight!

731
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,000
In the eyes of William,

732
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,800
they are just a bunch of Pikachus.

733
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,680
Come.

734
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,440
Cheers!

735
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,440
Don't drink so much like last time.

736
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,600
You are not much of a drinker.

737
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,480
And you...

738
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,000
Right.

739
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,080
Didn't someone send you home last time?

740
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,920
Are they all his bros?

741
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,720
They are.

742
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,720
Good heavens!

743
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,600
I thought he was just like
in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms".

744
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,160
I didn't expect him to be at Liangshan with so many bros.
(*Liangshan, a place in Water Margin with over 100 bros)

745
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,000
Such a large group of bros.

746
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,520
Good for him!

747
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,480
Why have you become a blowfish?

748
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
He has so many bros,
but all I can do is stand by and watch.

749
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,280
What can you see so far away?

750
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,040
Let's go. Let me take you closer.

751
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,720
Let's go.

752
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,000
I think your makeup today...

753
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,560
I have another particularly important
announcement to make.

754
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,360
My novel

755
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,240
has been purchased by a famous film
and television company.

756
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,000
And then...

757
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,160
Later, I'll ask Xue Zaozao and Qian Cheng

758
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,120
to talk to your agents

759
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,880
to arrange an audition for each of you.

760
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:29,680
Is it all right?

761
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,640
- All right.
- I believe in you all.

762
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,120
You all will debut like a girl group!

763
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,320
Thank you, Mr. Dao.

764
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,000
Babes, a moment please.

765
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,120
A moment please. I will be back later.

766
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,560
You two got on very well!

767
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,360
What are you doing?

768
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,040
Miss Jin.

769
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Lin Nuoyan.

770
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,760
What brings you here?

771
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,080
Well.

772
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,360
Have you forgotten I'm a fashionable man
that appeared in the magazine?

773
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,640
Cut!

774
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,560
Aren't you going to compliment my beautiful dress?

775
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,560
A girl who has come all the way

776
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,680
to make up with her boyfriend

777
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
is beautiful even if she wears a sack.

778
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,680
Tell me.

779
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Are you going to cause trouble?

780
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,880
Causing trouble?

781
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Let's see how he behaves today.

782
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,160
Then we will decide whether to forgive him or not.

783
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,520
Deal.

784
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,480
Where is he? Where is he?

785
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:33,560
Over there.

786
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,880
Is it so hard to decide what to eat?

787
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,200
This wine tastes good.

788
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,120
There are 365 days in a year.

789
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,000
We have to think about what to eat for every meal.

790
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,920
Isn't it difficult?

791
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,600
If it's that difficult, then don't eat.

792
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,160
It's said that he is Qing'ai's new designer.

793
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,280
Are Qing'ai's designers all so handsome?

794
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
They've put on dance music.

795
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,600
Let's go.

796
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,800
Dance with me.

797
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,020
(Qing'ai Group)

798
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,960
Actually, I'm not good at this kind of dance.

799
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,600
It doesn't matter.

800
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,040
I'd love to try

801
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,280
your dance steps and your design styles.

802
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,440
Are you angry?

803
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,600
No.

804
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,600
I'm just thinking,

805
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,880
after I die,

806
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,200
if he still can live like this,

807
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,080
it will be pretty good.

808
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
Come on!

809
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,680
If you really think so,

810
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,360
you won't look at them like this.

811
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,040
Since you are so sad,

812
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
it is even more necessary for you
to make it clear to him.

813
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,680
What are you saying?

814
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,840
Are you a rival or an assistant?

815
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,800
It doesn't matter
whether I'm a rival or an assistant.

816
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,960
I just like to see your smiles.

817
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,080
Let's go spoil his show.

818
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,480
I can't dance.

819
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,280
Neither can I.

820
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,280
Worst case we'll just do square dance.

821
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,160
Madam.

822
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,320
Thank you.

823
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,480
What a bloody battle!

824
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,720
Is Jin Xiaoyu here for Lin Nuoyan?

825
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,400
I don't think so.

826
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,600
Doesn't she have an ex-boyfriend
who's much older than her?

827
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,400
I guess she has come
to make it clear to him face to face.

828
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,960
- What does she want to say?
- Make it clear?

829
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,680
I don't know, either.

830
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,920
She didn't tell me about it.

831
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,160
It's the smell of gunpowder.

832
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,600
After three battles,

833
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,800
the scene should just be like this.

834
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,640
Why haven't I seen someone old?

835
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,640
I really haven't.

836
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:21,600
What's wrong?

837
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,840
Jiang Baiju!

838
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,240
Jiang Baiju!

839
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Jiang Baiju! What's the matter?

840
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,520
William.

841
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,000
Grandma, excuse me.

842
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,440
Miss Yang.

843
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,480
Professor Lin, may I have a dance with you?

844
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,280
Let's go over there.

845
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:12,960
Okay.

846
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,360
What are you doing?

847
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,480
Why did you push my hand aside?

848
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,400
What great things have you done?

849
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,440
You are even staring at me!

850
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,200
What do you want to say?

851
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,960
Why are you snapping at me?

852
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,520
Am I?

853
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,240
Do you know how hard it is for me?

854
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,240
Do you know how fragile my heart is?

855
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,840
I had to build up my courage to come here.

856
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,400
But what did you do?

857
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,920
I saw you dancing with

858
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
that movie star.

859
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,400
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

860
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,480
This is my heart.

861
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,040
It's fragile like a piece of paper!
Breaking after one poke!

862
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,520
What paper is your heart made of?

863
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,040
Thin like glutinous rice paper!

864
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,080
Glutinous rice paper
breaks as soon as it is poked.

865
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,440
Okay, okay, Okay.

866
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,000
It's that thin.

867
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,600
I have lived for twenty-four years.

868
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
Every day I ask God in my heart.

869
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,600
Why me?

870
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,600
Why am I the one with the strange disease?

871
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,760
Until I met you.

872
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,880
You said you wanted to date me.

873
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,040
I felt then that

874
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,440
maybe this strange disease

875
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
is for the one I love.

876
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,160
I secretly forgave God in my heart.

877
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,760
But what did you do?

878
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,280
How could you do that to me?

879
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,520
I already told you.

880
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,600
I went there because

881
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,000
William can't manage it himself.

882
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,680
You didn't tell me about

883
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,600
dying together with Madam Dao,

884
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
neither did you tell me
about you and Yang Xue'er...
