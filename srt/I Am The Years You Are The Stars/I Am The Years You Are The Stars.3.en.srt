19
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,800
Do you guys know why I keep her alive?

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,640
No.

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,960
Because she can suppress my mutation.

22
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,320
- What?
- What?

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,960
That makes her even more suspicious.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
Think about it. All these years,

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,440
you've been looking for a cure.

26
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
How could someone
who is able to stop your mutation

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,800
appear out of nowhere like this?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,840
And she also

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,960
rode on that bus.

30
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
You mean,

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,280
there is someone behind her?

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Not only that,

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,800
but she's probably

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
in the same gang with that mechanic.

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,160
Didn't your brother investigate her?

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,320
She's just an orphan girl
with a terminal illness.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,800
She's ill and has no one to turn to.

38
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,520
Right?

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,120
Even if you two wanted to investigate her,

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,640
you shouldn't have followed her
to the morgue at night

41
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,840
and attacked her.

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,400
If someone was following her

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,960
or if she was hiding her true identity,

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,040
we'd be able to find out.

45
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,720
So did you?

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
You didn't, did you?

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,760
You two should stay out of this.

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,560
Just help me find clues about the hospital.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,320
I don't want to get you guys into trouble

50
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,920
because of me.

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,200
My life is yours.

52
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,000
If it wasn't for you,

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,520
I would have died ten years ago.

54
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Your life belongs to you.

55
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Technically it belongs

56
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
to your parents

57
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,440
because they gave birth to you.

58
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,040
Okay?

59
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,480
You should take this chance to visit your parents

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,120
and also settle the score with your brother.

61
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
You are punishing me!

62
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,280
You'll get away better by raising your thighs.

63
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,400
Perfect.

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,640
Young Master.

65
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Do you really want to punish Qian Cheng?

66
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,840
Cheng is a friend of our family.

67
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,600
I can't punish him.

68
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,200
But I have to punish you.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
How could you let him do those things?

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,480
I'll tell your grandmother.

71
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,480
Don't tell my grandmother.

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,840
What's wrong?

73
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,400
I did wrong.

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,520
It's my fault.

75
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Is that so?

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,720
If you know it's your fault

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,400
then why are you still gaming?

78
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,320
I can stop playing.

79
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,280
What the hell is this?

80
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:11,800
This is not

81
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,160
for me.

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:21,960
Hello.

83
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,920
I'm...

84
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,320
Well...

85
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,000
You must be Ms. Jin Xiaoyu.

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Mr. Qian is waiting for you upstairs.

87
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,840
Please follow me.

88
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,080
Thank you.

Has no one ever taught you

94
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,040
to knock before coming in?

95
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,440
I wanted to,

96
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,760
but your assistant didn't dare to show up.

97
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,920
She just let me come in like this.

98
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,600
So I...

99
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,560
Whose office is this?

100
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,200
Yours.

101
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,480
Then why didn't you knock?

102
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:04,960
Be sure to knock next time.

103
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:05,880
Okay, boss.

104
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
What did you want to see me for?

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Watch a movie with me.

106
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

107
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
Why do you want to watch such an old movie?

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,520
They said it's a funny movie.

109
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,120
So I thought I'd give it a watch.

110
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,440
Why didn't you watch it before?

111
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:22,760
I see.

112
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,160
You used to be blind, but now you can see.

113
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
From now on, the person that speaks is a dog.

114
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,320
Start.

115
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,560
Look at him.

116
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Look at him.

117
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,800
Look at the guy in green.

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,200
Isn't he funny?

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Look at them both.

120
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,760
They are so funny.

121
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
They are so funny.

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,580
(We, the four talents of Jiangnan,)

123
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,920
(came here today to have fun.)

124
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,040
(No wonder those women were going crazy.)

125
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,800
(That's right.)

126
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,960
(Be careful!)

127
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,840
I never noticed.

128
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,080
You're actually quite expressive.

129
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,560
(My little cockroach, what's wrong?)

130
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,440
(You can't die.)

131
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,120
Watch the movie. Don't look at me.

132
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
Don't you know
you're better-looking than the movie?

133
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,880
Don't develop any feelings for me.

134
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
That's what handsome guys like you are for.

135
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,560
Tell me, have you ever dated anyone?

136
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,760
No, because of health issues.

137
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,480
Health issues?

138
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
So it's

139
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,640
your...

140
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Don't get any funny ideas.

141
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
I didn't...

142
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
You're thinking too much into this.

143
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,640
You were the one with the funny ideas, okay?

144
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,160
Tell me.

145
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
Be honest.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,880
Are you an alien?

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
You can't fall in love with earthlings.

148
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,080
You can't eat.

149
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,760
Nor can you watch movies.

150
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,680
Have you ever watched a movie?

151
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,760
Do you know you're supposed to go to the cinema

152
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
to watch a movie,

153
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
where there's a lot of people

154
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,480
and everyone is eating popcorn?

155
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,240
That's what it means to watch a movie.

156
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,960
I know.

157
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,880
The more people there are, the better the movie is.

158
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,080
Come here.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Let me tell you.

160
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,560
I loved Stephen Chow when I was a kid.

161
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,280
I like him now too.

162
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,840
People say he is always very happy.

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
- But in fact, he is only happy in the movies.
- I'm afraid you won't live that long.

164
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,200
He's not like this in private.

165
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,340
What are you doing?

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,320
- I can feel it.
(- Pulling up my pants after taking a leak.)

167
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,200
If there is a machine

168
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,960
that could take the soul of a person

169
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,720
and put it in a movie...

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
What movie would you like it to be?

171
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,600
"Roman Holiday".

172
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,840
How do you do?

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,960
Living your life on repeat

174
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,640
in a movie.

175
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,720
Isn't that scary?

176
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
What are you talking about?

177
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,880
Trust me.

178
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,800
The best thing at the end of life

179
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
is to cease to exist and be forgotten.

180
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,360
Do you know this is sexual harassment?

181
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,280
You think I would harass you?

182
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
Sexual harassment is not based on a person's

183
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,040
looks, body type, or status.

184
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,760
What?

185
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,520
I can't believe there is still someone
carrying so much cash these days.

186
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,240
100 Yuan for 10 minutes.

187
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,960
No more talking.

188
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,320
What?

189
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
What do you take me for?

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,520
100 Yuan for five minutes.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,040
I'll take your silence as consent.

192
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,760
Thank you.

193
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,400
Having a good rest?

194
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,720
Where's Young Master?

195
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,520
He's getting a little carried away.

196
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,560
He's watching a movie with that woman.

197
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,640
He's watching a movie with her.

198
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,280
Why do I get the feeling
you're not happy about it?

199
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
You should think about

200
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,640
which company you want to make bankrupt next.

201
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,880
I don't want to work.

202
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,200
You're a bossy CEO.

203
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,280
You don't want to work?

204
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,440
Bossy CEOs in dramas

205
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,360
only need to date girls and throw tantrums.

206
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,560
They don't need to work.

207
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,160
The problem is you don't date girls.

208
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,160
I've decided.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
I'll let Qing'ai go bankrupt when fall comes.

210
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
Young Master asked you to take a vacation.

211
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,680
He didn't say he'd fire you.

212
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,960
Qing'ai needs you. We need you.

213
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,400
The young master needs you even more.

214
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,680
Your words of encouragement

215
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
are not good enough to make you the boss.

216
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,800
Come on.

217
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,520
Buddy.

218
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
Stop your self-pity.

219
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,360
Okay?

220
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,280
Look how blue the sky is.

221
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,960
Just let it go.

222
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,280
Don't be so stressed out.

223
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,840
Okay?

224
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
But the young master really wants to
keep the girl who knows his secret.

225
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,920
I have a hunch it's not that simple.

226
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,040
The young master's business

227
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,040
has never been simple.

228
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,960
He has no control over his life.

229
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,280
He can't even decide whether he lives or dies.

230
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,880
Me, you, my grandmother.

231
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,720
My second uncle.

232
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,200
Even the people in this world

233
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,920
are just passersby to him.

234
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,480
I'll have you know.

235
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,760
I don't want to be a guardian at all.

236
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,320
Even if I give all my life to him,

237
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,920
I would only end up as one of his memories.

238
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,240
Do you think it's worth it?

239
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
If it wasn't for him,

240
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,520
I would've long become one of your memories.

241
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,760
You can call it gratitude

242
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,960
or even curiosity.

243
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,040
I just want to be his guardian.

244
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,440
Forget it.

245
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,520
Don't try to be sentimental.

246
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,160
Okay?

247
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,280
You protect him, while I protect you both.

248
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,720
Come, I'll take you to the doctor.

249
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's go.

250
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
Be good.

251
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,360
Baby, love you.

252
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,800
(Emergency)

253
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,680
Cheng Weilan.

254
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,920
What's wrong with you?

255
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
I came back from the Qing'ai Building in a hurry.

256
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,080
Yet, you're dragging your feet.

257
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
Hurry up, will you?

258
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,840
Miss!

259
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,280
Who are you?

260
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
You saved me last time.

261
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,560
Oh my!

262
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,920
Thank you so much.

263
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,840
My daughter kept talking about a lady

264
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
that saved her life that day.

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,200
It was chaotic when it happened

266
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
and I couldn't find you.

267
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,120
It's nothing.

268
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,680
Let me see.

269
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,120
It's you.

270
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,080
Why do you have stitches?

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
You should make sure her scars are removed.

272
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,160
I'm already grateful

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
that she's alive.

274
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,160
I was so scared.

275
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,240
Why are there so many nut jobs nowadays?

276
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,240
He didn't want to live anymore

277
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,600
and had to take others down with him.

278
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,680
I can't agree more.

279
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,720
It was because that
guy started talking to the madman

280
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,400
that the madman started to act out.

281
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,600
Which guy?

282
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,640
The one who saved us.

283
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,120
Why did they disappear

284
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,240
after going to your hospital?

285
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know.

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
I don't know what you're talking about.

287
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,400
I can find you.

288
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Others can find you too.

289
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,320
I heard them talking.

290
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,080
The guy who saved us asked

291
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,880
(Li Changcheng, resident ID)
the madman to work with him.

292
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,320
(Li Changcheng)
After that, he started to act out.

293
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,880
God.

294
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,680
It gives me chills listening to this.

295
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,240
Why did he provoke the madman?

296
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
The man got himself killed as well, right?

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Thank you so much.

298
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,920
We'll be leaving.

299
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,480
Okay.

300
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,480
Say goodbye to her.

301
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,920
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

302
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
Thank you. Thank you.

303
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:15,920
Who was that?

304
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,640
The little girl on the bus.

305
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,360
Another survivor.

306
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,200
Why do you look so pale?

307
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,400
I've waited for you for so long.

308
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,280
How could I not be pale?

309
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,920
Hurry up!

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,680
Geez!

311
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,480
I was sleeping.

312
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,320
Why do you keep shaking?

313
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
Wake up. Look at this.

314
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,340
(The continuation of life)

315
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,920
(Needs your love and dedication)
What is this?

316
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,920
The new spokesperson of our association.

317
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,880
Isn't he handsome?

318
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,240
Who is this?

319
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,280
He's

320
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,800
the head of a private lab.

321
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,920
His name is Lin Nuoyan.

322
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Their lab

323
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,880
is studying the principles of tissue engineering

324
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,720
and artificially manufacturing organs.

325
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:56,760
He previously donated

326
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,560
a lot of money to our association.

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,440
This Professor Lin

328
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,960
is both handsome

329
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,040
and good at his job.

330
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,760
He is literally my idol.

331
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,880
I see.

332
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,040
He's the one who

333
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,880
grows human ears on rats.

334
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Am I right?

335
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,040
Yes.

336
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,240
If he can successfully grow ears on rats,

337
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,400
then it will be much easier to
transplant organs in the future.

338
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,420
(Having fun)
(My apprentice, Jin Xiaoyu, 24 years old.)

339
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,320
(Does anyone know of
any suitable young men of the right age?)

340
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,220
(Please introduce him to Xiaoyu.)

341
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Oh my God, look!

342
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,880
Mr. Ge is asking everyone in the WeChat group

343
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,920
to introduce you to someone.

344
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,200
Oh my God!

345
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,160
He has too much free time.

346
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,640
That's right.

347
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Isn't it good to just catch up on dramas

348
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
or play video games?

349
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,800
Why is there a need to be
in a romantic relationship?

350
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,800
Being in a relationship is not as good as
watching couples in dramas, right?

351
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
You're right.

352
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,240
I mean.

353
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,120
Can you stop it?

354
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,920
Are you suffering from hemorrhoids?

355
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:46,800
Can you drive?

356
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,560
I'll do it if you can't.

357
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,800
Dao Ruifeng.

358
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,200
You rear-ended me!

359
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,960
You're the driver.

360
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,640
You go and deal with it.

361
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,600
(Mu City Zuo'an Hospital)

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,720
I'll go to deal with the paperwork.

363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,880
Why don't you wait for me in the ward?

364
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,520
I want to head over to the morgue.

365
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,520
I have to teach my Mr. Ge some experience.

366
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
Don't go anywhere else.

367
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,640
I know.

368
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:15,800
Miss.

369
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,560
Where's the morgue?

370
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,320
Downstairs at the end of the corridor.

371
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Thank you.

372
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,400
It's okay.

373
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,600
Hello?

374
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,800
Where are you?

375
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,640
They just towed the car.

376
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,480
Where are you?

377
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
I just came out of the coffee shop.

378
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,360
The street where we had an accident.

379
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,400
There's an intersection ahead of you.

380
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,880
Turn south.

381
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
I'll wait for you there.

382
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,920
Southward of the crossroad?

383
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,300
(High School)

384
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,460
(High School)

385
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,880
It's okay. It's okay.

386
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
It's okay. It's okay.

387
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,680
Let's go to the hospital.

388
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,600
Where did you go?

389
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
The morgue.

390
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,800
I know you're timid.

391
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,280
That's why I came up in time to meet you.

392
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,240
Aren't I considerate?

393
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,360
Thank you so much.

394
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,160
Let me take a look.

395
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:46,920
She's still so young.

396
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,040
Yeah, poor kid.

397
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,000
She's only 12 years old.

398
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,320
But she only has two months left to live.

399
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,240
Even young people have to die.

400
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,680
What's going on?

401
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
Is this place really haunted?

402
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,360
It's possible.

403
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,680
Come on.

404
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,800
You're a capable doctor of the second hospital.

405
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,560
Why are you afraid of ghosts?

406
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,760
It's all your fault.

407
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,840
It's all because of
the ghost stories you told me while I was little.

408
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,880
- That's why I'm afraid of ghosts.
- I...

409
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,520
Xiaoyu.

410
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,880
The elevator won't fall

411
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,880
and kill us both, right?

412
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,720
Don't worry, Weilan.

413
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,640
If it falls,

414
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,640
I'll cushion you.

415
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,640
I won't live long anyway.

416
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,120
Xiaoyu.

417
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,440
If it doesn't fall,

418
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,520
give me 100 Yuan as compensation.

419
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,480
You're so annoying.

420
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,160
It's not much.

421
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,680
Let's go.

422
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,560
I've never been here before.

423
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,440
It should be the third underground floor.

424
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,760
How do we get out?

425
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,040
Why don't we go back to the elevator?

426
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,120
Are you crazy?

427
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,480
What if the elevator fell?

428
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,960
Let's see.

429
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,880
Let's look for an exit.

430
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,160
What are you looking at?

431
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,760
Where's Cheng?

432
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,560
His previous illness was acting up

433
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,640
while we were on our way to the hospital.

434
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
I knew something was wrong with him that day.

435
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
What did Chief Fan say?

436
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
The same thing.

437
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,440
He said the patient is hiding something

438
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,760
and is unwilling to receive treatment.

439
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,560
Chief Fan also said

440
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,440
his desire for control has stressed him out more.

441
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,280
Once the desire to be persecuted is raised,

442
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,040
he has to eliminate the intruder.

443
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,400
That is why Jin Xiaoyu
will have it tough this time.

444
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,720
I told him

445
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,520
to have a vacation

446
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,600
and take a break.

447
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,440
Of course he'll be stressed

448
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,480
when he's constantly watching over us.

449
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,200
Mr. Li.

450
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,240
Professor Lin, why are you here?

451
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,280
I came here today

452
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,280
to give the body donors a proper send off.

453
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:55,960
Well.

454
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
You didn't have to come personally.

455
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,280
There are two new students in the lab.

456
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
It's their first time doing this job.

457
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,600
I'm worried.

458
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,680
That's why I came along to take a look.

459
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,080
Plus,

460
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,800
it's been a long time since I've done this.

461
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,800
I miss it.

462
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,320
I didn't think you would still be working

463
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,480
after so many years.

464
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,000
That's right.

465
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,160
It's been so many years.

466
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,680
But this place

467
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,560
is still the same.

468
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,680
That's right.

469
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,760
Everything has remained the same,

470
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,840
except for me.

471
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,680
Professor Lin, take your time.

472
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,680
I need to handle some stuff.

473
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,400
Okay, please go ahead.

474
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
There's no signal here.

475
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,200
What should we do?
We're not going to die here, are we?

476
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,760
Can you stop scaring me?

477
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,240
We're here to find someone at the hospital, okay?

478
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,800
The hospital will be looking for us
if we disappear.

479
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,880
What should we do?

480
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:49,960
There's a door.

481
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,640
What's going on?

482
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,840
Why is it locked?

483
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,600
What do we do?

484
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,160
Let's see if we can get over there.

485
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,360
This door is also locked.

486
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,440
How do we get out?

487
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
Let me think, let me think.

488
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Come, you carry this side.

489
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll carry this side.

490
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,240
Go that way.

491
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,560
Support me.

492
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,040
Be careful.

493
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,400
Watch out.

494
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,800
Watch out.

495
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,360
Be careful!

496
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Xiaoyu, are you okay?

497
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm fine.

What are you doing?

502
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,840
I'm looking for an exit.

503
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,200
Give me a minute.

504
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,880
Anyone there?

505
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,360
Anyone there?

506
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,920
Anyone there? Open the door!

507
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,520
I don't believe it!

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,000
Professor Lin, I'm sorry.

512
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,120
I'm sorry.

513
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,920
We didn't know someone was behind the door.

514
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,760
It's okay.

515
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,320
You two didn't mean to do it.

516
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,400
The elevator was under repair.

517
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,640
Didn't you see the sign?

518
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,480
There was no sign at the elevator door.

519
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,120
Oh.

520
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:52,880
It's okay.

521
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
It's just a small wound. No need to stick this on.

522
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
I'll just put on a band-aid myself.

523
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,680
Oh, okay.

524
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,200
Thank you.

525
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,160
You're welcome.

526
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,440
Professor Lin.

527
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,920
We've already paid for the medical expenses.

528
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,320
Do we have to compensate you

529
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,000
for your injuries?

530
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,720
You're so kind.

531
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,000
Thank you

532
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,800
for paying the medical fees.

533
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,000
You're here to pick up a patient from
the second hospital, right?

534
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

535
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm going down there too.

536
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,400
Let's go.

537
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,040
- I'm really sorry.
- Professor Lin.

538
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,640
Professor Lin.

539
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,920
Why don't we exchange contact information?

540
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,840
In case...

541
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,280
Just in case your head hurts,

542
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,480
you can contact us.

543
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,560
All right.

544
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Here you go.

545
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:35,920
All done.

546
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,320
I'll give her your contact as well.

547
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,840
If you need anything,

548
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,640
you better call her.

549
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,480
She's a doctor.

550
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,360
She's a doctor,

551
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,560
what about you?

552
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm the one you go to if a doctor can't treat you.

553
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,320
Okay.

554
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Call me if you need anything.

555
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,520
- Okay.
- Okay

556
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,240
Bye, Professor Lin.

557
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,680
Bye-bye.

558
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,600
I got you his contact information.

559
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,320
How about 200 Yuan?

560
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,440
Remember to transfer the money.

561
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,320
Sure.

562
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,160
What?

563
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,160
Prince Baiju sent you back?

564
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,320
Young Master is thankful
that you came to the debut show.

565
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,880
Mr. Jiang never has any friends.

566
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,400
He trusts me a lot.

567
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,720
He treats me as a friend

568
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
and hands over his company to me.

569
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,320
I can't let him down.

570
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,000
So you just let me down?

571
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,840
Qian Cheng.

572
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,120
In his long years,

573
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,760
you are just a moment in his life.

574
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,240
His time stands still.

575
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,400
No matter how much you do,

576
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,440
it means nothing to him.

577
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,040
Do you understand?

578
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,680
His time does not stand still.

579
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,200
Qing'ai is always changing.

580
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,200
His designs drive trends

581
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,200
and change trends.

582
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,400
Qing'ai is recording the way people live

583
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
and change the way people live.

584
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,480
Say something real.

585
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,680
The undead is so cool.

586
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:13,960
Cheng.

587
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,800
My dear little brother.

588
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,640
How old are you?

589
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,520
Oh.

590
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,720
More than 20 years old.

591
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,400
Yet you're still living in a fairy tale?

592
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,680
I see.

593
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,000
You're the bossy CEO

594
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,920
when you're around Prince Baiju, right?

595
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,320
But at home, you're just an immature kid.

596
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,080
I'll give you one last chance

597
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,440
to convince me.

598
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,400
I don't have nightmares

599
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,880
when I'm by his side.

600
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
Have dinner at home today.

601
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,640
After we're done,

602
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,320
I'll take you back.

603
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,240
There is no need.

604
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,120
I can go back on my own.

605
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,760
I won't talk nonsense to Jiang Baiju.

606
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,040
Young Master is not at home today.

607
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,040
Cinderella is still not home yet?

608
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,240
Is he seeing someone?

609
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,720
He's found a girl who can stop the mutation.

You can leave work now.

624
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
If you saw that I was sleeping,

625
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
you could have changed my direction.

626
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,360
Why did you have to grab my feet?

627
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,680
It's okay.

628
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,760
I feel more secure if you are around.

629
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,680
It's the same.

630
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,320
My best friend, Cheng Weilan,

631
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,280
is a doctor.

632
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,200
She's been afraid of ghosts since she was a child.

633
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,080
But when she has someone with her,

634
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,800
she'll become braver.

635
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,320
I see.

636
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,840
By the way,

637
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,240
here are the medical records
you asked for last time.

638
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,280
(Case History)
I've got them for you.

639
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,360
Okay, I'll read it as soon as possible.

640
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,720
Okay.

641
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,720
I have a question.

642
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,240
Go ahead.

643
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,600
Do alien doctors

644
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,800
differ in terms of Chinese and Western medicine?

645
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,760
No Chinese and Western, just North and South.

646
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,080
Do you give injections?

647
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,840
Not only do they give injections,
we also prescribe medicine.

648
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,760
That's boring. They're the same as us.

649
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,600
Boring.

650
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,840
Boring.

651
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,680
What is this?

652
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,960
I think you earthlings

653
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,400
call this overtime pay.

654
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,560
Thank you, alien boss.

655
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,480
It's okay.

656
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,840
But...

657
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
What? Are you not satisfied?

658
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,080
Of course not.

659
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,680
I just want something else.

660
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
I can only give you money.

661
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,240
I really can't give you anything else.

662
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,120
I can't believe I'm hearing this

663
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
in my lifetime.

664
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,960
I feel so shy and excited.

665
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,120
You're making me shy.

666
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,120
Don't make me laugh.

667
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,120
If you don't agree,

668
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
I'll make you laugh every day.

669
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,240
I've already promised to cure you.

670
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,080
What more do you want?

671
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,920
I want...

672
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,320
I'll tell you when I've thought about it.

673
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,560

(Outpatient)

690
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,760
Have you thought about it?

691
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,240
Do you want situational reenactment therapy?

692
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,320
I know.

693
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,440
You haven't forgotten about those things.

694
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,440
It's just that you don't want to talk about it.

695
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,200
Well, you can keep your opinions to yourself.

696
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,760
We have the police records from the scene.

697
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,840
Your brother also left some information.

698
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,040
We should be able to

699
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,280
set up a complete treatment environment.

700
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,360
Would everything be the same?

701
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,480
As similar as possible.

702
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,680
Would she be there?

703
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,400
She...

704
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh.

705
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
Qian Cheng.

706
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,680
Have you ever called her during these 10 years?

707
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,800
No, I didn't want to disturb her.

708
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,800
Has she ever contacted you?

709
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,640
Every Christmas,

710
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,000
all my friends would receive postcards from her.

711
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,280
I am the only exception.

712
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,680
Do you miss her?

713
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,120
How was it?

714
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
Doctor and family time.

715
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,960
You brat.

716
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,480
Chief Fan.

717
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,680
How's the treatment going?

718
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,880
I asked him about

719
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,720
getting exposure therapy.

720
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,320
But he's not interested at all.

721
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,400
If the patient won't cooperate,

722
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,480
there's no point in the treatment.

723
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,080
My advice is

724
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,200
to hold off

725
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,400
on the treatment.

726
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,000
He seems more defensive recently.

727
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,240
I haven't seen him like this

728
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,960
for a long time.

729
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,720
Hold on.

730
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,360
Defensive?

731
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,040
Increased stress, refusal to communicate.

732
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,720
Occasionally he would subconsciously act out
in a provocative manner.

733
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,840
Has there been any changes

734
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,640
recently in his life?

735
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:22,680
For example,

736
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,640
a new family member.

737
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,640
A new boss.

738
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,200
Or changes in management?

739
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,080
Okay, Chief Fan.

740
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,640
I'm aware of the situation.

741
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,880
Thank you for your hard work, Chief Fan.

742
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,880
You're welcome.

743
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,200
Go to work.

744
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,680
Okay.

745
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,600
Lin Nuoyan.

746
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,840
How are you?

747
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,960
Jin Xiaoyu.

748
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,520
Professor Lin, what are you doing here?

749
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,720
The donor's body

750
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,480
has reached its limits.

751
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,480
We brought it here for cremation.

752
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,080
What about you?

753
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,560
You work here?

754
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,240
Yes.

755
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,880
Last time on the volunteer association meeting,

756
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,240
I ran into your friend,

757
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,000
Cheng Weilan.

758
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
I asked her what you do for a living.

759
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,400
She wouldn't tell me.

760
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,560
I'm a mortuary makeup artist.

761
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,000
Is that so?

762
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,840
That's impressive.

763
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,800
But I don't think

764
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,080
there are many women in this field.

765
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,680
Yes, that's true.

766
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,040
I'm the only woman in my department.

767
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,520
By the way, Professor Lin.

768
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,520
I remember you also came in person

769
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,280
the last time when body donors were sent here.

770
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,520
You're here again this time.

771
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Last time, I wanted to make sure
the new students didn't lose their way here.

772
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,480
This time I came of my own accord.

773
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,760
These body donors

774
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,360
gave their bodies for medical research.

775
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,520
They gave up their integrity and dignity.

776
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,000
No matter what other research institutions do,

777
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,440
I usually come to send them off personally.

778
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,240
That's very considerate of you, Professor Lin.

779
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,560
Are you saying that

780
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
because you think I'm pretentious?

781
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,840
No, I really don't.

782
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,280
Body donors are very scarce.

783
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,920
One donor has to help with
a lot of teaching courses.

784
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,240
I really respect them

785
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,000
from the bottom of my heart.

786
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,960
Tell you what.

787
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,200
When I dead,

788
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,640
I will also donate my body to your lab.

789
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,320
You have to be gentle though.

790
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,120
You're so young.

791
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,960
Why are you talking about such things?

792
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,200
Even if there's a shortage of body donors,

793
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,000
I wouldn't want to see someone as young as you

794
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,120
in the lab.

795
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,160
What if there is?

796
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,720
I heard from Cheng Weilan

797
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,960
you are suffering from a rare disease.

798
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
I remember reading your medical records

799
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,040
when she told me about you.

800
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,760
A colleague brought it to me.

801
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,280
She had attended your consultation.

802
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,440
We studied your case at the time.

803
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,720
But we didn't make much progress.

804
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,240
You studied my case? What a coincidence!

805
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,160
I heard

806
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,440
you've switched to
conservative treatment with Chinese medicine.

807
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,280
How do you feel?

808
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,120
Not bad.

809
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,200
I've been taking Chinese medicine.

810
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,040
Chinese medicine is a more wholesome treatment.

811
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,480
From head to toe,

812
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,200
all of it.

813
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,920
The doctor said

814
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,200
I have less than a year to go.

815
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm always ready.

816
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,480
I see that

817
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,000
you're in a healthy state of mind.

818
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,240
You can even continue working.

819
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,080
That's good.

820
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,160
If I have time to be sad,

821
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,920
why not think of something happy every day?

822
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,200
You're right.

823
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,200
If you have time,

824
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,400
you can come to our hospital for a checkup.

825
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,520
It's free.

826
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Really?

827
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,920
It is also a chance

828
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
to teach my students something new.

829
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,040
I'll call you

830
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,640
when I'm having my day off.

831
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,080
Okay.

832
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,480
You...

833
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:47,680
What's the matter?

834
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,560
Do you have any other wishes?

835
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,680
I will do what I can

836
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
to fulfill

837
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,240
your wishes.

838
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,160
You mean

839
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,920
a last wish list?

840
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,320
Sort of.

841
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,800
Food, shopping, going out, things like that.

842
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,400
If it's something I can do,

843
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,400
you can tell me.

Yes.

If it's something I can do,

863
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,520
you tell me.

864
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,160
You really don't have to.

00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,280
Professor Lin, you're too gentle.

866
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
You can't be so kind.

867
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,440
Don't say that.

868
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,400
I think

869
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,840

875
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,480
Family shame should not be publicized.

876
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:30,960
You should go.

877
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,560
I'll kill you.

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,120
A list of your last wishes?

879
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,880
Yes, a list of my last wishes.

880
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,920
I have less than a year left to live.

881
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,440
So I made a list.

882
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,080
One of them is to date a cute guy.

883
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,360
Don't worry, I'll pay for it.

884
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,080
The money is not a problem.

885
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,280
It's just that

886
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,520
I don't go out much.

887
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,200
Don't you aliens go shopping?

888
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,320
Men don't go shopping.

889
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,320
No matter where they are.

890
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,040
Act normally.

891
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,280
Can you speak properly?

892
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,240
I have less than a year to live.

893
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,160
And

894
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,720
last time you gave me a medical history bag.

895
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,080
You didn't tell me what to do with it

896
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,080
and you ordered me around.

897
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,120
- I...
- How about I tell you a joke?

898
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,560
Don't tell jokes.

899
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,120
It's a good one.

900
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,680
- I'll tell you a good one.
- Stop it.

901
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,680
- Stop it.
- There is a deer.

902
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
It's running hard on the highway.

903
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
While running,

904
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,720
it turned into a highway.
[*The Chinese word for highway and deer have the same pronunciation.]

905
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,520
You're easily amused.

906
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,880
That's funny.

907
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,080
Then I'll tell you another one.

908
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,520
No need.

909
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,080
- There is another one.
- No need.

910
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,960
Tell me, where are we going?

911
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,400
You mean

912
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,960
you'll let me make the arrangements?

913
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Would you let me dictate

914
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,040
your list of dying wishes?

915
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,920
If you're not experienced,

916
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,040
I can find you a teacher.

917
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,520
Who?

918
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,720
Princess William.

919
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,160
No thank you.

920
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,080
He's on the trending topics every day,

921
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:54,920
and always appears on tabloids.

922
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,600
If you ask him to plan it,

923
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,720
it'll end up

924
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,440
in a hotel.

925
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,280
I

926
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,000
don't have any money.

927
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,180
(Buwenzhong)
There's a difference between investing

928
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:06,840
and borrowing.

929
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,040
My boy.

930
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,960
An investment requires a return on the investment.

931
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,360
Even loans require interest, doesn't it?

932
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,680
How did you calculate the interest?

933
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,440
Interest?

934
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,200
It is written in the contract, isn't it?

935
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,160
In interest-bearing loans,

936
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,040
the interest rate can be higher
than the bank rate.

937
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,240
If the interest rate agreed by both parties

938
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,040
is no more than 24% per annum,

939
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
the court shall support the lender

940
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,320
in claiming that interest.

941
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,480
If the interest rate agreed by both parties

942
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,960
is more than 36% per annum,

943
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,920
then the interest rate agreed in
excess shall be invalid.

944
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,560
The courts will only support

945
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,920
interest rates no more than 36%.

946
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,080
You're trying to learn how to invest

947
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,360
before understanding investment and lending.

948
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,440
Young Master won't agree to it.

949
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,920
Qian.

950
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,280
It's fine if you don't support me.

951
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,760
How do you know
the young master wouldn't support me?

952
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I don't support you.

953
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:48,920
Young Master.

954
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,560
This is a very big project for me.

955
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,480
No matter how big it is, I can't support you.

956
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:54,920
Here.

957
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,480
How can I grow stronger if you don't support me?

958
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,520
How can I grow my business?

959
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,120
I know that

960
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
if I support you,

961
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,800
I will become

962
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,320
more and more worried.

963
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:11,320
Young Master.

964
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,760
I heard that Jin Xiaoyu has served you well.

965
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,640
I can too.

966
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,720
What are you talking about?

967
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:18,720
Young Master.

968
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,640
Have you found out

969
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,320
why Jin Xiaoyu is able to suppress your mutation?

970
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,360
Not yet.

971
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
But she recently said
she wants to go on a date with me.

972
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,200
- A date?
- A date?

973
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,440
Is it that shocking?

974
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,080
Wait, don't ask yet.

975
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,480
Which hotel?

976
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,120
Qian Cheng, come.

977
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,920
Let's gag him.

978
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,240
Where and what would you do on the date?

979
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,440
We'll go to the Qingtang Department Store.

980
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,560
Watch a movie, have dinner, and shop.

981
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Just ordinary things like that.

982
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,240
So which hotel is it?

983
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,200
There is no hotel.

984
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,080
But normally...

985
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,280
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

986
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,160
I think she wants to take you to a public place

987
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,560
and have her contact carry out the next step.

988
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,280
Yeah.

989
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,040
Perhaps she'll kidnap you or swindle you.

990
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,960
You can't go.

991
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,560
Take it easy.

992
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,760
Give me some more tea.

993
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,120
The reason I didn't agree with

994
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,600
you two testing her the last time

995
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,360
was because we didn't know her

996
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,360
well enough.

997
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,400
But this time

998
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,280
she took the initiative.

999
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,360
That means she's ready.

1000
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,960
If she really has some ulterior motive,

1001
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,600
she will definitely make her move this time.

1002
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,760
Many are not aware that

1003
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,000
Qingtang Department Store
is also our company's subsidiary.

1004
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
So even if she intends to make a move,

1005
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,280
we can get more people to keep an eye on her.

1006
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,440
But that's too risky.

1007
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,440
I've never trusted her.

1008
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,400
But there's one thing I can confirm.

1009
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,320
Even if she's a part of the group
that makes the special drug,

1010
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,520
she's being forced to do it.

1011
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,560
Young Master.

1012
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,160
I feel like
you're already finding excuses for her.

1013
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,000
That's not a good sign.

1014
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,320
Young Master, ignore him.

1015
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,200
By the way,

1016
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,520
have you made any progress

1017
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
on the matter you were investigating?

1018
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,480
Let me tell you.

1019
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,160
I am usually the person
that's looking for someone else.

1020
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,640
But recently I notice that

1021
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
I seem to be the target of an investigation.

1022
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
You want me to go?

1023
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,080
That's right.

1024
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,720
Do you remember

1025
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,520
the man who saved me on the bus that day?

1026
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,880
That cute guy?

1027
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,320
Yes.

1028
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,640
I think

1029
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,400
he's an alien.

1030
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,680
What?

1031
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,920
Why don't you believe me?

1032
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,800
Why?

1033
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,400
In short,

1034
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,120
the traffic accident was not an accident.

1035
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,520
What do you mean?

1036
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,880
Why are you asking so many questions?

1037
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,640
It's more important that I know what's going on.

1038
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,080
Anyway, I need to confirm

1039
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,840
the most important thing.

1040
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,920
