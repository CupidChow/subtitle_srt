Qing'ai Group's

20
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,320
(Qing'ai Group  Blooming)
third-generation designer, Dao Ruifeng,

21
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,680
is about to have his solo fashion design debut.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
Mr. Qian Cheng, CEO of Qing'ai Group,

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
is being interviewed by the media.

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,120
(Qing'ai Group)
Mr. Qian Cheng,

25
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,440
as the CEO of Qing'ai Group,

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,280
what is your design philosophy
and original intention?

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,920
The evolution of 100 years of history.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,000
The company has invited domestic supermodels

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,560
and first-tier celebrities.

30
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,580
(Oh my God, Ruifeng is finally doing his debut.)

31
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,020
(Is the stock of Qing'ai Group going up again?)

32
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,860
(Ruifeng is so handsome.)

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,300
(Looking forward to Ruifeng's works.)
(He's so handsome! I like him!)

34
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,940
(Confessions to Ruifeng! You're so handsome!)
(I really want to watch the show on set!)

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,660
(I believe the successor
of Qing'ai must be Ruifeng.)

36
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,540
(Go, Ruifeng. I believe your show will be great.)

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,460
(Hope Ruifeng can successfully
take over Qing'ai Group.)

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,860
(Looks like the third-generation
designer must be Ruifeng.)

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,020
(Ruifeng is finally doing his debut.)

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,700
(Happy Folk Restaurant)

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:40,920
What's up?

42
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,120
This is our group's profile.

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,400
It has our health-related information.

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,840
You'll have an easier time assigning tasks
after going through it.

45
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
She was afraid that you'd become flustered,

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,080
so she brought it here to you.

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,600
OK.

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,880
You're Jin Xiaoyu?

49
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,800
Yeah.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,320
Fortunately, you are leading the team today.

51
00:02:59,320 --> 00:02:59,840
Well,

52
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,640
don't worry too much.

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,200
They're just a little nervous.

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,200
Some of them have hearing-impairments,

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,720
but

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,880
our translation
and classification work is all ready.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,760
At first, I was a little worried.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,080
But after talking to you,

59
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm not that worried anymore.

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,360
Cheng Weilan said you have a rare disease,

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,040
but you look pretty healthy.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,360
And I'm also considerate and smart, right?

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
And you're also pretty.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,360
In that case,

65
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
you'll contribute money to my funeral, right?

66
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,960
Funeral?

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,280
Yeah.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,200
A memorial service.

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,960
Will you go?

70
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
It's fine as long as
you contribute some money.

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,400
I think I will.

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,440
Great.

73
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
I'll add you on WeChat.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,840
Let me scan your QR Code.

75
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,160
Okay.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,840
Where's Mr. Dao?

77
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,920
Which Mr. Dao are you looking for?

78
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,560
Which Mr. Dao can you find?

79
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,920
Mr. Dao Lan's flight is delayed

80
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,600
while nobody knows
where Mr. Dao Ruifeng has gone.

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,280
Then

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,160
can Mr. Dao Lan

83
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
make a final appearance?

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,440
How do I know?

85
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,080
Miss.

86
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,560
How about this?

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,120
I'll go and get Mr. Dao Ruifeng.

88
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,360
Go on.

89
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,440
I want to present a kind of beauty
that's harmonious yet unique.

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,080
Something different but harmonious.

91
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,480
The aesthetics of oriental fusion.

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,160
Using cotton, linen,
and silk as the main material.

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,040
Advocating natural flow...

94
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,480
Advocating natural...

95
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Principles of a designer
need to be passed down more easily!

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
How could I memorize something so long?

97
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
Advocating the flow of nature
and the power of balance.

98
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Young Master.

99
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,960
Is this line that awkward?

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,040
You're even holding a cheat sheet.

101
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,880
Do you think you're taking a test?

102
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,480
The best silk fabric is 0.11mm.

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
But I want 0.13mm to 0.15mm.

104
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
By looking at it and touching it,

105
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,040
then by weighing it and measuring it,

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm pretty sure

107
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,960
this dress is made from silk of 0.13mm.

108
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Can you differentiate with your eyes

109
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,280
whether it's 0.13mm or 0.15mm?

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,160
If someone took a magnifying glass

111
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
and counted it one by one,

112
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,240
you'd be in trouble.

113
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,080
Yeah.

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,600
I thought you were going to test me.

115
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,520
I want to tell you

116
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,720
that your uncle rarely

117
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,040
used silk.

118
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Remember,

119
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,680
that's the big difference between you two.

120
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,320
Okay?

121
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480
Young Master.

122
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,120
You designed all these clothes.

123
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,600
You have the ability and talent.

124
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,120
I'm just your puppet.

125
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
I will not

126
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,320
stop you from pursuing what you love,

127
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,040
but you have to listen to your grandmother

128
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,640
and be a good puppet.

129
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,880
Young Master.

130
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm already so good.

131
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,620
(Blooming)

132
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
These designers

133
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
are all gifted.

134
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,760
In this regard,

135
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm very optimistic about William.

136
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,720
After all, he is the nephew of Master Dao.

137
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,960
Thank you very much.

138
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,240
This is William's debut 

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,680
as the third-generation
designer of Qing'ai.

140
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,760
I wonder

141
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,760
if he'll continue the style of Qing'ai.

142
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm looking forward to it.

143
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,320
This is such a big event.

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,520
It would be nice
to invite Mr. Qian Tu to see this.

145
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,160
I need to leave.

146
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,440
You misspoke.

147
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,560
Why did you bring that up?

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,680
Four dishes and one soup.

149
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,440
That's it, right?

150
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,280
Yes, that's it.

151
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:50,880
Okay, hold on a second.

152
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,640
Thank you for your hard work.

153
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,880
Xiaoyu.

154
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,800
The Qing'ai Building

155
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,480
is the most luxurious building
in the East Side.

156
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,040
The front is even more magnificent.

157
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,960
Oh.

158
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,800
You seem to know the place.

159
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,920
The HR of their company

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
visits my coffee shop frequently.

161
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,080
We got to know each other over time.

162
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
And I was the one
who introduced the volunteer association

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,800
to them.

164
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,600
No wonder.

165
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,640
That's why

166
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,920
you became the person
in charge of the charity group

167
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,080
after only volunteering for one year.

168
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,840
I've been wondering the reason.

169
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,560
Their boss is very rich.

170
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,120
Really?

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,320
A big shot in the fashion industry.

172
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
It seems that he is also
in the real estate business.

173
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,200
He came to this show

174
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,560
to promote his third-generation heir.

175
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,800
The CEO's last name is Qian.

176
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,320
The designer's last name is Dao.

177
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,560
Why do they

178
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
sound familiar?

179
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Dao Ruifeng?

180
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,920
"Prince" William.

181
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,720
Don't you read tabloids?

182
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,600
Many actresses have fallen for him.

183
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,320
I remember now.

184
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,920
He's the guy

185
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,200
who's always rumored
to be dating female celebrities.

186
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,680
That's him.

187
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,120
Seriously,

188
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,040
a designer should focus on designing clothes,

189
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
but he often goes around dating girls.

190
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,560
You don't understand.

191
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,640
Designers rely on love to find inspiration.

192
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,560
Fu Liang.

193
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
Come and sign this.

194
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,760
Okay.

195
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,040
You're so pretty.

196
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,840
Gorgeous!

197
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
Who ironed this?

198
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,400
Why are

199
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,480
the dresses so messy?

200
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,080
How many times
have I told you about this dress?

201
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,200
You should change it!

202
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
How do I find him among all these people?

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,880
Are you looking for me?

204
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,840
Mr. William.

205
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,040
Can you see us?

206
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:34,960
Of course.

207
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,600
Why don't you come down and take a look?

208
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's a nice crown.

209
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,360
Wrong flowers.

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,840
What's wrong?

211
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,920
It should be the flowers
of pine, bamboo, or plum.

212
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,760
Those are peach blossoms.

213
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,760
What's the difference
between peach and plum blossoms?

214
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,600
The peach blossom crown is for the finale.

215
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,840
The hair style is also done wrongly.

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,480
Who made the peach blossoms?

217
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,400
I want pine, bamboo, and plum.

218
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
The Three Friends in Winter.

219
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
Why did you make me peach blossoms?

220
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,200
To attract women for me?

221
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,000
Sorry, sorry.

222
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,080
I'll change it right away.

223
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,680
Let's go.

224
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,800
How could you get this wrong?

225
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,480
Did you pay attention

226
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,760
to the make-up design classes I gave you?

227
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,160
Young Master.

228
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,120
I can't tell the difference

229
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,040
between plum blossoms and peach blossoms.

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,720
They're both pink.

231
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,040
Pigs are also pink.

232
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,080
Can you tell the difference?

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Yeah, there is a difference.

234
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,320
Pigs can understand my make-up design class.

235
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,160
You can't.

236
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,120
I get it now.

237
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,680
Young Master.

238
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,280
You and Qian Cheng can tell the difference

239
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,200
between a plum blossom
and peach blossom makeup.

240
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,880
So you two are the pigs.

241
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,680
Someone's coming.

242
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,720
(Qing'ai Group)
Are you ready?

243
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
- Someone's coming.
- Someone's coming.

244
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:46,960
Get ready.

245
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,960
This angle.

246
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,920
This way. Hold this position.

247
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,940
This way, please.

248
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,880
Sorry, sorry.

249
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,760
Mr. Qian Tu.

250
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
Mr. Qian Tu, please listen to me.

251
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
You can't go in without an invitation.

252
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,840
Mr. Qian Tu

253
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,760
doesn't need an invitation.

254
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,400
This...

255
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,200
Report.

256
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,200
Mr. Qian Tu is here.

257
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,560
He doesn't have an invitation,
but we can't stop him.

258
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,440
The pig is here.

259
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,320
He came so quickly.

260
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,760
My elder brother is here.

261
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,360
Why is your brother here?

262
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,840
Isn't your brother in Fiji?

263
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Yes, he should be.

264
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
I had my mother send him
to Fiji for a study tour.

265
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
I don't know why he got back.

266
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,680
This is bad.

267
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,040
He's going to shame me

268
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,800
in front of the investors.

269
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,040
Now I know why he posted on Weibo.

270
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,240
It was to fool me.

271
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
I mean, Qian.

272
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,520
How can you make such a silly mistake?

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,440
You are a very cautious person.

274
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,960
Don't you know who I am?

275
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,120
You dare to stop me?

276
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
(Invitation)

277
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
Look carefully.

278
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,760
Look carefully!

279
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,840
The invitation!

280
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,920
Mr. Dao. Mr. Dao.

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,680
Miss Xue is here.

282
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,960
Xue Wanwan?

283
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,880
Why is she here?

284
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,240
Isn't she in Miami on vacation?

285
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,680
I don't know why she's here.

286
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Tell security to stop her.

287
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,480
- Don't let her come in.
- Stop her.

288
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,320
We couldn't.

289
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,600
She's holding Mr. Xue's invitation.

290
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,560
She's already going up.

291
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,200
No way.

292
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,760
When you see Qian Cheng, take him away.

293
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,760
Oh my!

294
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,400
What kind of people are these?

295
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,640
He neglected the family business.

296
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,440
Every day he hangs out with people like them

297
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,240
and is always appearing
in the tabloids with Dao Ruifeng.

298
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,840
I don't care if my mother indulges him.

299
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,160
When we see him later,
take him away immediately.

300
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,400
With force?

301
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,760
Don't even say a word.

302
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,120
What if he resists?

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,120
He wouldn't dare.

304
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
He wouldn't dare tarnish the name
of the Qing'ai group.

305
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,480
To be precise,

306
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,440
he doesn't want to disgrace
the person behind Qing'ai.

307
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,080
This is his biggest weakness.

308
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,680
Miss.

309
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,960
Are you really ready?

310
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,800
I thought about it on the way back.

311
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,400
If he dares to let Qin Rong be the finale.

312
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,720
I'll ruin his debut.

313
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,240
Mr. William will definitely make a fuss

314
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,000
and beg for mercy.

315
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,040
He might even pull out
a diamond ring right then

316
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
and propose to you.

317
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,520
Even you know

318
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,680
how he'll try to please me.

319
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,600
Crying, making a scene,
before giving me a kiss.

320
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
Kneeling down and proposing.

321
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,240
If he cries today,

322
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll cry, too.

323
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,960
If he makes a scene,

324
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,840
I will also make a fuss.

325
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,840
If he kneels down and kowtows,

326
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,280
I will roll on the ground.

327
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
If he dares to take out
a ring and propose to me,

328
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
I will say yes to him.

329
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,160
I would even drag him up
on stage for the grand finale

330
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,000
to announce our wedding.

331
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,240
That's called giving him

332
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
a taste of his own medicine.

333
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,000
That's brilliant.

334
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,440
I'll show him

335
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,640
I can also pull off

336
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,560
these shameless tricks, too.

337
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,200
Yeah.

338
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,880
My brother knows I won't ruin your show.

339
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,040
You're my weakness.

340
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,960
I'm telling you.

341
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,360
There is no way Xue Wanwan
will let Qin Rong on stage.

342
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,040
Did any of the sponsors provide a diamond ring?

343
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,760
Worst case scenario,

344
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,400
I'll propose to Xue Wanwan tonight!

345
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Why isn't Uncle Dao here yet?

346
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
He could help us stop them if he was here.

347
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,040
How about

348
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
we call the Madam?

349
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Don't count on

350
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,880
my grandmother and my uncle.

351
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,760
If they find out,

352
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,440
the three of us will get into trouble.

353
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,160
Of course Cheng and I won't have a good time,

354
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,920
but you might

355
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,240
lose your life.

356
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,040
I have an idea.

357
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,920
The three of us can die together.

358
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,920
Let's die for our love.

359
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Okay.

360
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,520
Let's jump off together.

361
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,480
Let's see who can live.

362
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,280
What's the big deal?

363
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,040
You're the CEO of Qing'ai Group.

364
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,440
You're the third-generation designer.

365
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,280
How can you two be so scared?

366
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,480
It's not like

367
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
there is no solution.

368
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,760
- You can't go.
- You can't go.

369
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,400
How can I stop two groups
of people all by myself?

370
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,640
You two come with me.

371
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,800
You are also suitable.

372
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,320
Girls.

373
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,680
There is something fun. Come with me.

374
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

375
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,000
You two come with me, too.

376
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,360
William

377
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,280
and Xue Wanwan are childhood friends.

378
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,920
Xue Wanwan knows

379
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,800
all his tricks.

380
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,920
It's useless for him to face her.

381
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,640
However, Cheng

382
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,520
has no mercy.

383
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
- And does not reason.
- Miss.

384
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,440
What are you doing?

385
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,160
But it's a different case for

386
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Cheng's brother, Qian Tu.

387
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,080
He always treats you sternly

388
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,120
like an iron plate.

389
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,120
What is the best way to face an iron plate?

390
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,400
Acid.

391
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,040
Qian Tu.

392
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,520
There you are!

393
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,560
I missed you so much.

394
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,320
Guys.

395
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
I'd like to introduce

396
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
CEO Qian Cheng's elder brother,

397
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,320
Mr. Qian Tu.

398
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,120
The big boss of Zhaoyan Group,

399
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,920
China's largest tourism group.

400
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,520
Young and talented.

401
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,320
He doesn't have a boyfriend

402
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,520
or a girlfriend.

403
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
You guys should seize this opportunity.

404
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,080
Qian Cheng.

405
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,080
My father gave me the invitation.

406
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I was just going to the show.

407
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,080
You stole it, right?

408
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,640
I'll tell my father

409
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,640
you're no good, either.

410
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
You're both liars.

411
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,320
Scumbags.

412
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,360
Say whatever you like.

413
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,000
I won't treat you with mercy.

414
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
You'd better cooperate.

415
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,120
I wouldn't want you getting hurt.

416
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,680
Honey.

417
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,920
Your legs are so long!

418
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,880
You're so handsome. I love you so much.

419
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,440
What?

420
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,760
Who's your honey?

421
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
What handsome?

422
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,120
Qian Tu.

423
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm really touched

424
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,480
that you came all the way back from Fiji

425
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,400
to attend my debut show.

426
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,840
I love you so much!

427
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,400
My dear.

428
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,280
I'm Simon.

429
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,080
No, no, no.

430
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
I love you so much.

431
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,080
Your brother is like what you told us.

432
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,720
He would rather make a fool of himself

433
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
than bring shame to the Qian family.

434
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,520
That's why you should

435
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,320
take your team and act in a shameless manner.

436
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,500
(Dressing Room)

437
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,720
That's why it's useless

438
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,640
even if Xue Wanwan cries and makes a fuss.

439
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,680
- Qian Cheng.
- You two keep an eye on her.

440
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,280
- Yes.
- Yes.

441
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,080
Qian Cheng, let me out!

442
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,480
No more laughter.

443
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,320
Calm down.

Come here.

447
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,400
Keep a low profile.

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
I knew it was you.

511
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
You really came back to life, didn't you?

512
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,000
How did you come back to life?

513
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,360
The mutation has subsided.

514
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,600
I'm able to have emotions.

515
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,720
Why are your hands shaking?

516
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,200
You now know such a big secret.

517
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,440
Aren't you afraid that I will kill you?

518
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,360
I'm not scared.

519
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,480
If you want to kill me,

520
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,440
you would have done it in the elevator.

521
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,880
You and I need to talk.

522
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,720
We can talk.

523
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,960
Let's talk somewhere else.

524
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,080
Why is there no sound?

525
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,040
Let's go in and check.

526
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,560
Do we

527
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,120
have to hold hands while talking?

528
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm taking your pulse

529
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,400
to see if you're lying.

530
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,160
Why did you come to see me all of a sudden?

531
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,640
If it were anyone else,

532
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
they would have thought this was nonsense.

533
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
Because I want it to be true.

534
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,720
If this is true,

535
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,640
would you be afraid?

536
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,920
I'm not afraid of anything.

537
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm just afraid of dying.

538
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,640
Actually,

539
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,520
I'm not afraid of death, either.

540
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,360
People die in the end.

541
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm just worried that

542
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,200
my family won't be taken care of after I die.

543
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,080
And people who like me will be sad.

544
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,240
That's all.

545
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,880
Have you ever heard the saying?

546
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,640
When you try to escape from your fate,

547
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,160
the faster you run,

548
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,360
the harder you fall.

549
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
I've never stood up in my life.

550
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,360
I've crawled all my life.

551
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,560
I don't care if I fall or not.

552
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,680
Don't be afraid.

553
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,040
I'm not going to ask about your past.

554
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,880
And I don't want to know

555
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,240
if you're some strange species.

556
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,920
I just want you to help me.

557
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,080
I hope you can help me

558
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,440
by doing whatever it takes.

559
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,320
In fact, I have a rare disease that is deadly.

560
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I won't live long.

561
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,800
But I can't die.

562
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,960
I need to take care of my family.

563
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,720
Would you like to help me?

564
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,040
Then how do you know I can help you?

565
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

566
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:20,960
You

567
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,840
were dead and then

568
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,320
you suddenly came back to life.

569
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,320
You must be some kind of strange creature.

570
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,440
Sorry.

571
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,600
I said something improper again.

572
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,400
Anyway,

573
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,840
you have this ability.

574
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,640
I'm sure you can help me.

575
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,440
How about this?

576
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,280
Tell me what you want.

577
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,400
Although I'm not as rich as you,

578
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,200
I can try to satisfy you

579
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,400
by any means necessary.

580
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,840
Okay?

581
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,040
In order to stay alive,

582
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,640
you'll agree to any condition, right?

583
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,640
I'm already counting down
the days I have left.

584
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,040
You know what's worse

585
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,800
than that?

586
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,240
It's the fact that you're surrounded
by people who love you.

587
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,800
They know the road ahead is dark,

588
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,080
but they're still trying their best for you.

589
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,760
Sometimes I don't even know

590
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,400
why they would give everything they have

591
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,840
in exchange for my unknown future?

592
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,400
That's why I have to work hard.

593
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,840
So that they don't end up with nothing.

594
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:21,880
I...

595
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,760
I do have what you want.

596
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,520
But you have to promise me one thing.

597
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,900
(Buwenzhong)

598
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,460
(Jin Xiaoyu's personal information)

599
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,580
(Clinical records)

600
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,240
You mean yesterday at midnight,

601
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,760
this girl

602
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,360
stayed in the design room with Young Master

603
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,160
and nothing happened?

604
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,120
I have a hunch she's dangerous.

605
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,840
From what I've heard from you,

606
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,320
I feel like she's the one in danger.

607
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
You know my principles.

608
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,520
I do.

609
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,640
Better to kill than to let go.

610
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,640
Save for a rainy day.
Don't leave anything to chance.

611
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,920
But Young Master must have a reason

612
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,280
to keep her.

613
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,160
And the young master didn't tell me

614
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,480
what exactly this girl does for a living.

615
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,680
You've seen the file.

616
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,600
She's just a girl
with a short life expectancy.

617
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,600
But

618
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,480
why didn't Young Master
deal with her this time?

619
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,920
I'll tell you something even more scary.

620
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,280
The young master told me

621
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,600
he wants to go out alone tonight.

622
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
And he doesn't need anyone to follow him.

623
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,440
He's probably meeting up with the girl.

624
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,640
The young master probably

625
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,640
wants to find out what the girl is hiding.

626
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,160
But you know the young master's habits.

627
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,320
He probably wants to do it himself this time.

628
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,880
He doesn't want us to get involved.

629
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,440
What did Uncle Dao say?

630
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,640
He's really something else.

631
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,120
Since the day he took office,

632
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,040
he's been thinking of stepping down.

633
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,760
As soon as the conference ended yesterday,

634
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,080
he ran away faster than the Flash.

635
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,080
He said

636
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:44,800
from now on,

637
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,560
he would not have to worry
about the young master anymore

638
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,760
and that I would take care of everything.

639
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,640
That's typical of him.

640
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,480
Fine.

641
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,520
Let the young master do his investigation,

642
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,640
but we'll do some digging as well.

643
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,080
We can't let her

644
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,520
go around under our noses.

645
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,840
Are you saying

646
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,760
there's someone behind her?

647
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:00,720
We'll find out

648
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
with a test.

649
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
If she's in danger,

650
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,000
the person behind her

651
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,400
will definitely make a move.

652
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,040
You want to...

653
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,600
So this is what a morgue looks like.

654
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
You've never been to a morgue?

655
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,520
No.

656
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,400
You don't have any family or friends
who have done funerals?

657
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,440
I don't have any family or friends.

658
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,760
What a coincidence!

659
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,600
Neither do I.

660
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,440
But I have my senior brothers,

661
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,640
and friends.

662
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:28,840
And more than a hundred

663
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,240
acquaintances who will come to my funeral
and contribute money.

664
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,720
Congratulations then.

665
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,780
(Make-up room)
(Funeral processions not allowed)

666
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,840
You're lucky.

667
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,440
This corpse will be cremated soon.

668
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:45,880
Thank you.

669
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,360
Are you really a designer?

670
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,520
No, I'm not.

671
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,840
Then what do you do?

672
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,400
I'm a cook,

673
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,680
specializing in hot and spicy dishes,

674
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,680
and pancakes.

675
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,640
Ordinary people who haven't studied medicine

676
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,720
or received professional training

677
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,240
would instinctively stay away from corpses.

678
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,240
How come you're not scared at all?

679
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,000
Death is just a normal thing.

680
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,480
Conventional knowledge

681
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,240
would say that he's dead

682
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,520
and we're alive.

683
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,840
That's all.

684
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,480
His nails.

685
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,960
There are several ways
for a corpse's fingernails to turn black.

686
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,960
Heart problems, electric shock,

687
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,800
or poisoning.

688
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,600
But in the case of a heart problem,

689
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,720
even the fingertips should turn black.

690
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,920
While an electric shock will

691
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,320
leave burn marks all over his body.

692
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
So this person
must have taken some kind of drug

693
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,080
before drowning

694
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,600
and was poisoned.

695
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,240
The coroners didn't see it?

696
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,480
They just sent it here?

697
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,920
I don't know how he did the job.

698
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,080
I'm basing my judgement

699
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,320
on my work experience.

700
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,160
It's not necessarily accurate.

701
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,720
But sometimes

702
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,800
corpses

703
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,880
would seem normal

704
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,560
when they go through an autopsy.

705
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,880
But after a period of time,

706
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,120
problems would appear.

707
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,280
This corpse is very strange.

708
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,080
Usually a corpse would look bloated

709
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,120
after soaking in water.

710
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,040
But look at him,

711
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,440
his body is very elastic

712
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,640
and not bloated at all.

713
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
It's as if he's a living person.

714
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,640
That's right.

715
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,760
Like a living person.

716
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,440
He even looked at you just now.

717
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Don't make fun of the corpse.

718
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,840
Can I take a sample?

719
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,640
Just hurry up.

720
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,160
You seem pretty professional.

721
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,000
He did take that drug before he died.

722
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:38,880
What drug?

723
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,680
A drug you'd be interested in.

724
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,640
Have you heard of the darknet?

725
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,120
Yes.

726
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,800
They pay with cryptocurrency.

727
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,520
And everything on there is illegal.

728
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,040
The drug he took

729
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,360
(Sterile sampling bag)
was sold on the darknet.

730
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,240
It's said to be a cure for all diseases.

731
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,720
It's even said that ordinary people
who take this drug

732
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,040
will gain super strength

733
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
in a short period of time.

734
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,920
That's why you two

735
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,040
were so strong on the bus that day.

736
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,360
It's because of this.

737
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,760
My strength is not because of the drug.

738
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,600
But his was.

739
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,960
That's why I need to find out

740
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,120
(Sterile sampling bag)
what he actually took.

741
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,760
That's why

742
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,800
you have to investigate him?

743
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,480
When I find out about the group
that's making this special drug

744
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,160
and get the formula,

745
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,600
maybe I can develop

746
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,280
a real cure for terminal diseases.

747
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,760
Then you can be saved.

748
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,440
Are you serious?

749
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,600
I don't have much time. I only have a year.

750
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,480
Hurry up a little.

751
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,080
I can't guarantee making it on time.

752
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
If I'm too late,

753
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,680
my condolences.

754
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,360
Wait a minute.

755
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,800
I actually have many friends.

756
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
So many.

757
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,600
Living or dead?

758
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,680
Of course, they are alive.

759
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,720
I can also do simple sewing,

760
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,240
dissection,

761
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,480
and financing.

762
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,280
I have more friends than you do.

763
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
If you know how to interpret dreams

764
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
or have psychic powers,

765
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,120
then maybe you can help me.

766
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,440
Can you show some sympathy?

767
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,720
You're such a cold-hearted person.

768
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,680
Do I look like a caring person?

769
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,040
You're young.

770
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,440
Pity your eyesight is already so bad.

771
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,320
We had a deal.

772
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,520
I'd show you the body.

773
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,800
You give me the drug
that'll bring me back to life.

774
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,640
Where's the drug?

775
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,480
As the term implies,

776
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,000
you first need to be dead.

777
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,360
You're still alive, aren't you?

778
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,760
I...

779
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,000
When you're almost dead,

780
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,680
get someone to inform me.

781
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
I'll bring the drug to save you.

782
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,800
You liar...

783
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,680
Didn't you say we couldn't get caught?

784
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,040
Don't get fired.

785
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,960
I don't want to make you lose your job.

786
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,560
Who is it?

787
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,840
Who the hell are they?

788
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,920
Are you okay?

789
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,440
You're not injured, are you?

790
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,840
Why did you come back?

791
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,520
It's already late.

792
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,360
Why would people come here?

793
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,120
Don't dirty my clothes.

794
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,360
I'm dying.

795
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,680
And you're worried about your clothes?

796
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,800
All men die.

797
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,400
But my clothes must be clean.

798
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,300
(Duty Room)

799
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,440
Lie down.

800
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm fine.

801
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,920
Didn't you say you were dying?

802
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,720
He's so muscular.

803
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,400
I can't believe he looks so good.

804
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,400
Do I look good?

805
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,520
Yes.

806
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,280
Thanks to your nosebleed.

807
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,760
What's your name?

808
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,000
Do designers like you

809
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,440
like to have foreign names?

810
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,960
Do you have a Chinese name or a foreign name?

811
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,800
Chinese name.

812
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:17,840
Chinese name?

813
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,640
Three characters and four characters?

814
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,320
Four characters.

815
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,120
What is it?

816
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,760
Ni Gu La Si.

817
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,760
What a mysterious name.

818
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,360
How do you feel?

819
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,200
Tell me the truth.

820
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,280
Do you know those people?

821
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,600
How can that be?

822
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,080
Why not?

823
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,160
If you don't know them,

824
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,080
you would have called the security guards.

825
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,720
I didn't call the guards

826
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,760
because I didn't want to get exposed

827
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,640
and get you involved.

828
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,560
Are you that kindhearted?

829
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,400
Don't think too much about it.

830
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm leaving.

831
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,800
You will save me, right?

832
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,880
I can't guarantee

833
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,240
finding the formula within a year.

834
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,480
I can wait for you.

835
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
You girls love to say that.

836
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,280
But in the end, you never do.

837
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,040
This is my phone number.

838
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,360
During normal days, don't call me.

839
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,320
Even if you do, I won't answer.

840
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,600
Then why did you give me your number?

841
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,520
You talk too much.

842
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,280
I'm leaving now.

843
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,920
(Mu City Second Hospital)

844
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,080
Director, you keep reminding me

845
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,280
about it all day.

846
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
I'm not an amnesiac.

847
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,960
Okay, don't worry.

848
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,000
I'll hang up now. Bye.

849
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
Why is the chief looking for you?

850
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,240
It's about the kid
who was transferred to our hospital

851
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
and was going to donate his organs.

852
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,720
The chief has been reminding me all day

853
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,400
to hurry up and complete the paperwork.

854
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,880
Is it far?

855
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,000
In the fifth hospital we went before.

856
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,840
Zuo'an Hospital?

857
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:52,880
Oh my God!

858
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,800
What's wrong?

859
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,600
Do you have a checkmate?

860
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,400
Checkmate?

861
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,840
This is checkers.

862
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,160
Dr. Cheng.

863
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,240
Have you heard about the rumors
of Zuo'an Hospital?

864
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,520
All hospitals have rumors.

865
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,960
It's not that simple.

866
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
This hospital

867
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,720
is very strange.

868
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,440
Rumor has it that

869
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,320
it was built

870
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,760
when the Japanese army

871
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,600
was doing human experiments there.

872
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,400
All of my friends

873
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,960
have heard about it.

874
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,000
Is it true?

875
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,480
I'm used to seeing people die in hospitals.

876
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,840
- I only believe in science.
- Yes.

877
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,400
- No superstition...
- 13th bed.

878
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,120
Why do you keep going to the duty room?

879
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,160
Hurry back.

880
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,800
Okay, okay.

881
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,240
Then I'll

882
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,480
go check on the patients.

883
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,320
Enjoy your own company.

884
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,200
You're leaving, too?

885
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,120
What are you doing?

886
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,000
Are you trying to give me a heart attack?

887
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,320
I think you were going to
give me a heart attack.

888
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,960
Why are you here today?

889
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,240
I had a pretty bad nosebleed last night.

890
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,760
I'm here for a medical checkup.

891
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,720
Mr. Ge came with you?

892
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,680
I didn't tell him.

893
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,400
You don't tell him, either.

894
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,560
I just came for a blood test.

895
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,840
If you want me to keep your secret,

896
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,320
you have to accompany me
to a place on the weekend.

897
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,040
Come on.

898
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,960
I only have one day off on the weekend.

899
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
Where are you going?

900
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,360
I'm going to pick up a child
who will be transferred to our hospital.

901
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,440
Thank you very much for supporting our work.

902
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,360
It's very important to us.

903
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,280
Of course.

904
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,360
My little apprentice

905
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,720
is very attentive.

906
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,920
She was the one who first discovered it.

907
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
When she was applying make-up on the corpse,

908
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,720
she felt that something was wrong.

909
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,560
So she urged me to call you.

910
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,640
You mean the skinny girl

911
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,760
with big eyes?

912
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Yes.

913
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,200
During the interview,

914
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,720
I heard that she is a mortuary makeup artist.

915
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,880
I didn't understand

916
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,960
what kind of profession it was at the time.

917
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,200
After what I saw here,

918
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,120
I finally realize

919
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,080
what an amazing girl she is.

920
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,520
Where is she?

921
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,320
It's her day off.

922
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,880
She went to the hospital
to have fun with her best friend.

923
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,680
If you have any questions,

924
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,760
just call us.

925
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,200
Thank you very much.

926
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,120
It's okay.

927
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,480
If you hadn't reported it in time,

928
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,120
the evidence would have been destroyed

929
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,600
once the body was cremated.

930
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,720
That's right.

931
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,080
(Phra Aphai Mani)

932
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,320
You can also send shock bubbles

933
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,480
to the left and right.

934
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,880
These words look like drawings.

935
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,600
Can you read it?

936
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,720
This is a long poem from Thailand.

937
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,880
It's called Phra Aphai Mani.

938
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,000
It's about two princes

939
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,280
who were expelled
from the country by their father.

940
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,560
In the end, after going through
countless hardships,

941
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,640
they found their love.

942
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,240
It's not bad.

943
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,560
Now I remember.

944
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,000
Isn't this my grandmother's book?

945
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:01,960
That's right.

946
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,240
We bought it in Thailand

947
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,160
40 years ago.

948
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:05,920
We wanted to

949
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,560
return home from Thailand.

950
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,120
But we were stranded there,

951
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,800
so we couldn't leave.

952
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Your grandmother bought a lot of books

953
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,840
in Thailand

954
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,760
and taught herself Thai.

955
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,680
I found this book interesting.

956
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,760
So I borrowed it.

957
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:17,480
Young Master.

958
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,280
You mean you've borrowed it
from my grandmother

959
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,280
for 40 years and you haven't returned it?

960
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,520
No wonder there's an old saying.

961
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,000
"You shouldn't lend books or women."

962
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,840
For William,

963
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
becoming a monk is not a happy thing.

964
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,520
But I feel very happy.

965
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,800
What makes a man a man

966
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,400
is when he finds his home.

967
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,760
It's better than going on and on

968
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,480
with no end

969
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,440
in sight.

970
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,360
That Jin Xiaoyu is suspicious.

971
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,400
I have a feeling she's someone bad.

972
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,080
So?

973
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,280
You two worked together to deal with her?

974
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:49,960
Is that so?

975
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,680
It was his idea.

976
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:51,760
- Cheng.
- I...

977
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,200
You should go home and take a break.

978
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,760
Go visit your parents and brother.

979
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,560
Young Master.

980
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,720
Are you punishing me?

981
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,000
No.

982
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,960
Qian.

983
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,360
I told you

984
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
it was not right,

985
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,120
it was not proper,

986
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:02,680
right?

987
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,360
Young Master.

988
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,960
I told him to stop.

989
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,840
He didn't listen to me.

990
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,720
There was nothing I could do.

991
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,280
Young Master.

992
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,040
I know you don't want us getting into trouble.

993
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,400
So you've only asked us
to collect some information.

994
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,960
But this matter is getting
more and more complicated.

995
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,120
You can't hide it from us anymore.

996
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,560
Do you know

997
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,800
why I'm keeping her alive?

998
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:17,800
No, I don't.

999
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,600
Because she can suppress my mutation.
