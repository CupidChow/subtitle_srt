William couldn't deal with it on his own,

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,320
so he kept asking me to go.

about dying together with Madam Dao,

There's nothing that cannot be sorted by a kiss.

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,040
If there is,

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
have some barbecue.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
This is where and how we are at the moment.

39
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,920
Are you happy?

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
I at least need some barbecue.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,680
Don't worry.

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,760
Xiuxiu and I never made any agreement.

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,200
I only hoped that she could destroy me.

44
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
But that's what I had in mind before I met you.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,360
After we met, all of my previous plans

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,280
were disrupted.

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,920
And I'm not seeing Yang Xue'er.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,320
Both William and Qian Cheng can vouch for me.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,320
I just don't want my work

50
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,640
to take up our personal time.

51
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,120
Sorry, I'm a bad person.

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,400
No, it's not you.

53
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,120
And

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,360
I've spent all my time and energy with you,

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
you cannot be bad.

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,320
You are important.

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
You look so pretty today.

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,440
I know that.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
So don't you worry.

60
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,240
As long as you're around,

61
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,080
I won't consider destroying myself.

62
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,880
Regarding what I'll do in the future,

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,600
we still have time to discuss it.

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,320
Whether I'll leave with you

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,640
or stay on,

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,320
we can discuss it later.

67
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,360
Okay?

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
So you heard what I said,

69
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
right?

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,240
You know what?

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,520
When I saw him having dinner with Yang Xue'er,

72
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,840
I suddenly felt that

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,880
if he chose to be vulgar and indulge in enjoyment,

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
he would have fine dates.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,200
I love him.

76
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,200
But he has a long past without me.

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,920
And I won't even be able
to get involved in his future.

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,120
He has a soul mate who can die with him.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,880
He also has beauties awaiting him.

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,760
What about me?

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:19,960
What role do I play?

82
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm just a useless painkiller

83
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,160
that shouldn't have appeared.

84
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,440
How can an abnormal person

85
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,360
expect to have a normal relationship?

86
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
You weren't with me

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,080
in the past.

88
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,440
And our future is most likely short as well.

89
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,480
But it doesn't mean we can't
offer ourselves to each other.

90
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Like you said,

91
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,400
I have a soul mate that I can die with.

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
But Xiuxiu is like my family.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,840
I've been with her
almost throughout her entire life.

94
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,400
And

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,480
those beautiful girls

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,640
just admire my talents.

97
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,840
You need to keep in mind that

98
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,920
you are not the painkiller
that shouldn't have shown up.

99
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
You're the shiniest memory

100
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,520
of my life.

101
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm not bald,

102
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
why do I need to be so shiny?

103
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,300
♪The encounter makes love cruel♪

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,160
So?

105
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,080
Can the matter conclude

106
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,680
with you being jealous?

107
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,640
If,

108
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
in a relationship, the conclusion wasn't jealousy,

109
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
then what would it be?

110
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,120
Jealousy it is, right?

111
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
That's why you got Lin Nuoyan here

112
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,800
to infuriate me?

113
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,760
You need to be thankful for him.

114
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,520
I need to be thankful for him?

115
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Because although he says he likes me,

116
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
the one he actually admires may be you.

117
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800
Me?

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,400
So you think

119
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,280
it wasn't his fault?

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Then whose fault was it?

121
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,280
Was it my fault?

122
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,480
It was William's fault.

123
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,040
It was William's fault, huh?

124
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,120
If it wasn't for him,

125
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
you wouldn't need to entertain the guests.

126
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,200
That's true.

127
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,080
It was William's fault.

128
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,760
It was all his fault, right?

129
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,120
Yes.

130
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,760
And Qian Cheng.

131
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,200
- Right?
- Right.

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,120
Why didn't he stop Lin Nuoyan

133
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,360
from dancing with you?

134
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
If he hadn't danced with you,

135
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,000
I wouldn't have seen it,

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,200
therefore I wouldn't have gotten angry.

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,840
Right?

138
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,240
Correct.

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
It was also Qian Cheng's fault. He's too mouthy.

140
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,360
Those two are undependable.

141
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
Undependable, indeed.

142
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,080
They're good for nothing.

143
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,160
They're good for nothing.

144
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,840
You're the best.

145
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,840
The second best.

146
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,240
You're the very best.

147
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,640
You don't have enough fat.

148
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,960
Human body requires a certain amount of fat.

149
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,440
(30th Anniversary of Qing'ai Group)
The way you lose weight

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,760
will eventually lead to irregular menstruation.

151
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,280
What do we do? We aren't allowed to get fat.

152
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,160
- You don't have to be on a diet to lose weight.
- No.

153
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,280
Your workload is heavy, and you move a lot.

154
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,040
If you go on like this, your body can't take it.

155
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Come. Show me your tongue.

156
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
You obviously suffer from malnutrition.

157
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,800
People like you
who are suffering from malnutrition

158
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,080
should go see a dietician

159
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,400
or a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine.

160
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,920
She came here to do business.

161
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,160
Do business?

162
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,440
She works in the emergency department,
not traditional Chinese medicine.

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,920
If she doesn't know traditional Chinese medicine,
then why did she perform pulse diagnosis?

164
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,640
She's a fake.

165
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,240
I'll go expose her.

166
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,320
Watch your mouth.

167
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,640
Don't believe a single word she says.

168
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,440
She's not a doctor
of traditional Chinese medicine.

169
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,280
She's a fraud.

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
Dummy, what are you talking about?

171
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,340
You...

172
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,000
I really know traditional Chinese medicine.

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,640
You need to master a skill
to flirt with girls, huh?

174
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,280
Maybe.

175
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,760
Actually, I can also tell fortune.

176
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,760
Can you also check on me?

177
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,080
I can tell fortune, too.

178
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,560
Nothing.

179
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,680
Nothing, nothing.

180
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,160
The tiramisu tastes good.

181
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,640
I recommend you to try one.

182
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Since it's your recommendation,

183
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll surely try one.

184
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,680
Your dance partner was taken away,

185
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,880
yet you seem chill.

186
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,960
In a romantic relationship,

187
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,880
you follow the rule of

188
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,600
"Whatever will be, will be."

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,160
That seems too indifferent.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
I think the efforts made in a relationship

191
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,000
should be

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,560
based on mutual interaction.

193
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,000
The two like each other and make efforts together.

194
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,480
This is marching forward hand-in-hand.

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,080
If one's heart already belongs to someone else

196
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,160
while the other makes efforts on his own,

197
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,760
that's stupidity.

198
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,480
Those who see you

199
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
may ask,

200
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
"Who the heck are you?"

201
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,520
The biscuit tastes good.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,440
Your plan fell through.

203
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,480
I bet you're upset, right?

204
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,880
Like you said,

205
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,960
who the heck am I?

206
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,560
I only wish my friend to be happy.

207
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
No matter whom he ends up choosing,

208
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,400
I'll back him up.

209
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,880
Do you need more friends?

210
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,920
The kind that does scientific research.

211
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,580
(Buwenzhong)

212
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,720
I know you like this.

213
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,840
You like pickles, right?

214
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,280
I do. Very much.

215
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,040
Have some.

216
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,240
I'm full.

217
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,280
I'll be waiting outside.

218
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm done eating.

219
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,080
Let's go.

220
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,480
Let's go.

221
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,240
You first.

222
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,040
You first.

223
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,840
You first.

224
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,400
You first.

225
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:58,920
You first.

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,800
You first.

227
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,040
You first. I insist.

228
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:13,600
Be safe.

229
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:14,720
Be careful.

230
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
Please, you two.

231
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,720
Hurry up. We're running late.

232
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll be quick.

233
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,640
I'm off.

234
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,880
See you later.

235
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,640
I didn't finish waving her good-bye!

236
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I didn't finish waving her good-bye!

237
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,960
Every meeting in life is a long-awaited reunion.

238
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,480
(Mu City Central University)
(Anatomy Laboratory)

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,840
All right.

240
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Today we'll be studying

241
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,040
the cancerous liver tissues

242
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
and how it affects the other organs.

243
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,480
This body donor died of late-stage liver cancer.

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,040
Xiaoyu.

245
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
This is the refrigeration room
that stores the body donors.

246
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,360
Here.

247
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,400
Thanks.

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,080
Look at the discoloration on her face.

249
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
I remember when the body first came,

250
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,280
there wasn't any.

251
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:48,880
And

252
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,920
look at her fingernails.

253
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,360
I remember

254
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,440
you were close to this old lady.

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,520
Did she have other diseases

256
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
other than liver cancer when she was alive?

257
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,000
This is not caused by a disease.
This is drug residue.

258
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I need to inform Officer Su immediately.

259
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Thank you for providing the information.

260
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,000
Captain Su is still working on something.

261
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,280
He'll come to you once he's done.

262
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
This is what we're supposed to do.

263
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,640
Thank you, Professor Lin.

264
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,160
You're welcome.

265
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,760
Contact me if there's any problem.

266
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,960
Thank you. I'll be leaving.

267
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,800
Okay. Bye.

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
- Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

269
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,120
Xiaoyu,

270
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,400
have you stopped investigating

271
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
the illegal drug case

272
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
after the accident?

273
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,880
I just changed my way of investigation.

274
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,560
I met two victims of the special drug.

275
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,360
Mrs. Xu was one of the victims.

276
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,360
Her daughter bought the special drug

277
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,240
from a charlatan to treat her cancer.

278
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,400
Mrs. Xu nearly became schizophrenic
after taking the drug.

279
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,760
Really?

280
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,880
Thank you for having asked me to come here.

281
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,160
This means a lot to me.

282
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,240
Don't mention it.

283
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,360
Is there anything else
that you can let me know?

284
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,520
Maybe I can be of help.

285
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,240
The drug has harmed many people.

286
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm also a patient stricken with a fatal illness.

287
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,840
I don't want anyone

288
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,320
to exploit our eagerness to stay alive.

289
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,320
I understand how you feel.

290
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,800
Look,

291
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,360
the color of the cyanosis

292
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,640
is much lighter than before.

293
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,880
But it's larger.

294
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,640
Everyone who took the special drug

295
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,480
has different livor mortis and cyanosis color.

296
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,040
I think, like you said,

297
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,880
they are constantly

298
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,240
improving the formula.

299
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,280
They have clearly not reached perfection,

300
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
so there will be more victims

301
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,280
of their sick experiments.

302
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,960
In the history of medicine, humans have obtained
a lot of medical information

303
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,440
through illegal means.

304
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,400
For example, illegal experiments on the living,

305
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,600
illegal cloning, and so on.

306
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,080
There are always some people

307
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,640
who think they are superior than others

308
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,720
and can treat lives lightly.

309
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,040
The horrific thing is,

310
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,800
they all have strong faith.

311
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,080
And they all think their behaviors

312
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,280
are contributions to human medical history.

313
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,040
But more ironically,

314
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,000
sometimes, we make use of

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,280
the data from their study.

316
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,760
So?

317
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,400
How are you getting along with Professor Lin?

318
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,520
Come to think of it.

319
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,840
I'll go to the volunteer association

320
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,800
with Lin Nuoyan in a few days.

321
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,520
You know, sometimes,

322
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,400
you don't have to do the things
that you don't necessarily need to do.

323
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,040
You're cute when you're jealous, you know?

324
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,720
I'm not jealous.

325
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,520
You are.

326
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,480
Is it that obvious?

327
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,840
It's almost written on your face.

328
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,680
What?

329
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,680
Trying to make a wish?

330
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,400
When a boy closes his eyes,

331
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,800
he's inviting you

332
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,280
to give him a kiss.

333
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,680
Be honest with me.

334
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,800
Did you spend 5 jiao

335
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,920
to buy William's course?

336
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:53,920
300 Yuan.

337
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,800
300 Yuan?

338
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,440
Hi, please check out our campaign.

339
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,320
Hi, would you like to know more?

340
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,200

348
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,840
I read the introduction
of your organ donation campaign

349
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,080
and I'd like to ask

350
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,480
when your lab will have another open day.

Miss Xue,

362
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,560

You two know each other?

I got a call from Officer Su.

402
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
I had Officer Su's WeChat and we talked a lot.

We didn't talk too much about the case.

about organ donation.

I'd like you to ask you.

After I fill in the form,

409
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,000
how do you guys immediately know that

410
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,600
I'm the donor of this particular organ?

411
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,280
This is how it works.

412
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,640
Once you fill in the donation form,

413
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,680
your information

414
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,320
will be inputted

415
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,840
into the system of organ donation association.

417
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,760

419
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,280
the hospital that treats you

420
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,360
will see your information in the system.

421
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,040
Or you can put your donation form

422
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,520
in your car or carry it with you

423
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,520
so that medical workers

424
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,800
can immediately identify you as an organ donor.

426
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,840

You can put it in your car

so that the medic workers
can readily identify you.

444

457
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,120
The organ is paired by the system,

458
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,240
you can't appoint a recipient.

459
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,560

472
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,720
I'll fill in the form.

I have something to talk with you about.

483
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,280
What?

484
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,880
I suspect that the team
that makes the special drugs

485
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,240
is doing experiments on patients.

486

Tan Yueran and Xu Nan,

487
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,520
they are probably

488
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,040
two of the many experimental subjects.

489
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,640
What makes you think so?

490
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,120
Have you guys done an autopsy on Mrs. Xu's body?

491
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,640
Yes, but the result hasn't come back yet.

492
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,760
I'll talk about what I have seen.

493
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,200
From the perpetrator on the bus

494
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,520
to the epilepsy patient,

495
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,880
I examined

496
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,920
both of their bodies.

497
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,920
And the state of their bodies was very alike.

498
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,000
The changes of their nails' colors were obvious,

499
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,040
but those of the livor mortis were not.

500
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,320
It's fine. Go ahead.

501
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,240
The perpetrator had fewer livor mortises,
but the color was the deepest.

502
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,440
The epileptic had more livor mortises

503
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
and cyanosis everywhere.

504
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,320
Mrs. Xu's livor mortises

505
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,680
were large, but with a light color.

506
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,040
I need to read the autopsy report

507
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,520
before drawing

508
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,560
my conclusions.

509
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,960
And I'll have a meeting
with the coroner afterwards.

510
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,240
Okay.

511
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,360
You seem pretty interested in the case.

512
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:01,960
To be honest,

513
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm using my own methods

514
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,240
to investigate the case.

515
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,120
Yeah, I can understand.

516
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,440
After all, you are a victim
of the bus accident, too.

517
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,840
It makes sense that you wish to know

518
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,840
who tried to harm you.

519
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,560
But it's already good enough that you reported

520
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,560
the information to the police immediately.

521
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,480
Sure thing.

522
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,880
Alright, this is as far as I'll send you guys.

523
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:20,880
Okay.

524
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,400
Baby, say goodbye to her.

525
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,680
Goodbye.

526
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,520
Bye-bye.

527
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,640
Alright, we're off.

528
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,960
Be safe, Officer Su.

529
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,760
Come on. Let's go home.

530
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,320
Son,

531
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,000
I need to do something.

532
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,720
I'll drop you at your mom's, okay?

533
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,240
Didn't you say
we would go have hamburgers tonight?

534
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,880
Have hamburgers tonight?

535
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:46,960
Fine.

536
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll go pick you up after I finish my work.

537
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,280
Then we go eat some burgers, okay?

538
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,400
You promise?

539
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,040
I promise.

540
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,760
Mr. Qian, Officer Su's here.

541
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,880
Officer Su's here.

542
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:01,960
Hello, Officer Su.

543
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,600
Hi.

544
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,320
Want to play?

545
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,600
No, thanks.

546
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,560
It isn't easy to get a hold of you.

547
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,360
Let's cut to the chase.

548
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,040
Okay.

549
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,400
Leave us.

550
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,680
Come. Let's sit.

551
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,560
Okay.

552
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,800
Here.

553
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,240
Something to drink.

554
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:25,720
Thank you.

555
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,680
Officer Su.

556
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,880
What do you come to see me for?

557
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,680
I know you have some friends in the station.

558
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,840
I heard from them that

559
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,840
you have been investigating

560
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,240
the bus case in private.

561
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,120
What's the relationship between your brother

562
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
and the victim of the case?

563
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,680
Here's the thing, Officer Su.

564
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,240
I don't know the victim.

565
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,160
But he was my brother's friend,

566
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,520
and they were close.

567
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,440
Think about it,

568
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,000
he took the bus

569
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,480
and just died.

570
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
My brother had questions.

571
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,200
So he asked me to investigate it.

572
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,320
You sent the vendor

573
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,360
who gave the false statement, right?

574
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,680
I know that

575
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,960
influential people like you

576
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,000
don't want to be involved in a murder case.

577
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,440
But still, we thank you

578
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,400
for the evidence and witness.

579
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,840
It's just

580
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,360
you used the wrong means.

581
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:28,760
Right, right.

582
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,520
I don't have any evidence

583
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,600
to hold you accountable,

584
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,120
but I hope

585
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,000
you can stay put.

586
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,960
Oh, right. Tell your brother

587
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,920
that we'll find the truth.

588
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,080
He'll get his answers.

589
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,640
Don't worry.

590
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
I'll tell my brother that.

591
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,360
However, Officer Su,

592
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,520
the young man

593
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,960
single-handedly saved all the people on the bus.

594
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,320
People like him

595
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,920
can't die in vain,

596
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,920
am I right?

597
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,720
No one should die in vain.

598
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:02,760
That's true.

599
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,560
I'll be off if that's all.

600
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,120
Okay.

601
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,440
Officer Su.

602
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,560
If you need anything,

603
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,360
just say it.

604
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,400
Thanks, in advance.

605
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,800
No problem.

606
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:33,760
Hello.

607
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,760
Why did you call me again?

608
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,800
I dare you.

609
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,400
Listen to me.

610
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,000
If you hurt that kid,
I'll come after you no matter what.

611
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,340
(Emergency Department)

612
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,280
It's urgent! Send him to the emergency room!

613
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,180
(Emergency Room)

614
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,780
(General Service Hall)

615
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:05,840
Hi, Xiaoyu.

616
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,640
You came to work.

617
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,240
Morning.

618
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,000
Xiaoyu.

619
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,720
Come with me to take a new kind of medicine.

620
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,120
Master, what medicine?

621
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,320
The new prescription from Dr. Huang.

622
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,080
Be honest with me,

623
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,160
do you get a cut from Dr. Huang's sales?

624
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,320
What's it for?

625
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,840
It's to nourish the Yin.

626
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,320
I think I'll be killed by you two

627
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,760
instead of the rare illness.

628
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,800
What did the doctor say?

629
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,440
The doctor told me to go for another examination.

630
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,020
(Duty Room)

631
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,720
Xiaoyu!

632
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,440
Keep it down!

633
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,680
Master.

634
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,320
Sorry.

635
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,960
What's in your hand, Master?

636
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,640
The medical examination report.

637
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,960
Master, is something wrong with you?

638
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,080
Can you not curse me?

639
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,960
Another consultation?

640
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,400
Master,

641
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,920
will something bad happen to Xiaoyu?

642
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,840
It will happen sooner or later.

643
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,720
Master, don't feel bad.

644
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,520
The doctor hasn't done a second consultation yet.

645
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,760
She's had the illness for a long time.

646
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,720
I've been constantly solacing myself.

647
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,480
Master,

648
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,720
if someday Xiaoyu's gone,

649
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll take care of you.

650
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,280
Boy,

651
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm happy that you said it.

652
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Master,

653
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,680
did you see Xiaoyu's boyfriend?

654
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,600
No.

655
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,920
You saw him?

656
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,040
Cheng Weilan did.

657
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,160
She said he's super handsome.

658
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,360
And rich.

659
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,120
She didn't tell me about him,

660
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,920
and I didn't feel good to ask her directly.

661
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,680
Master, this isn't like you.

662
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,280
When you tried to get her a boyfriend,

663
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
you basically told the whole world about it.

664
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,360
And asked everyone you know for help.

665
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,240
But now, you aren't worried anymore.

666
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,880
I am worried.

667
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm anxious!

668
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,360
When she didn't have a boyfriend,

669
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,520
I did it to help spread the word.

670
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,320
Now that she's got a boyfriend

671
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,240
and if

672
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,200
I am still anxious about it,

673
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,520
I'm worried that it'd lead to a bad outcome.

674
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
I don't want to create trouble for them.

675
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,520
Xiaoyu's like you.

676
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,400
Neither of you likes to put pressure on others.

677
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,880
If you want her to voluntarily

678
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,720
bring the guy to meet you,

679
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,120
I think you can forget about it.

680
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,440
Her illness is worsening.

681
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,800
Why don't you take the initiative

682
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,840
to meet your future son-in-law?

683
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,000
How should I take the initiative?

684
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
It's inappropriate.

685
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,320
Inappropriate how?

686
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Are you going to meet him

687
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,160
at Xiaoyu's funeral?

688
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,480
What the heck are you talking about?

689
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,600
Master,

690
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,640
I'm only joking.

691
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,080
Don't take it seriously.

692
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,080
I'm off to work.

693
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,360
Get out of here.

694
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,780
♪You love me and you make a wish♪

695
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,620
♪We're stuck together♪

696
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,080
Young Master,

697
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,800
my grandmother used to sing this song, too.

698
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,560
I taught your grandmother this song.

699
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,440
Did you?

700
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:21,960
I know the song, too.

701
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,440
Sounds awful?

702
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,600
Did you come to ruin my mood?

703
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:40,880
Young Master,

704
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,640
Yang Xue'er called.

705
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:43,880
She wanted to see you.

706
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,840
No.

707
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,480
She asked me for your number.

708
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,560
Don't give it to her.

709
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,080
No?

710
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:49,840
Young Master.

711
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,080
I admire a man like you

712
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,360
who doesn't sway for beauty.

713
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
If you were a regular guy, who would you pick?

714
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,040
Jin Xiaoyu.

715
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,080
Jin Xiaoyu?

716
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
Are you not going to hesitate one bit?

717
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,800
From an objective point of view,

718
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,200
a regular person would

719
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,680
pair up with another regular person.

720
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,880
Because that would be safer.

721
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,920
From a subjective point of view,

722
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,640
I like Xiaoyu.

723
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,680
What's so good about her?

724
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,520
Everything about her is good.

725
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,200
That's so classic.

726
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,040
I'll put this

727
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,000
into my novel.

728
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,600
"Everything about her is good".

729
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,280
You came to seek inspiration from me?

730
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:27,920
Young Master,

731
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,640
are you going to share your love story with me?

732
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,560
Yes. Come.

733
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,640
Qian Tu.

734
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,080
You're so handsome.

735
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Luckily, you caught me.

736
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
You indifferent old man.

737
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,520
The police came to you?

738
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,480
Don't worry.

739
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,280
I managed to convince him

740
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,320
with the excuse we came up with.

741
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,920
You aren't a suspect.

742
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,480
They won't keep questioning you.

743
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,680
Those people are improving the special drug.

744
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,800
Improving it?

745
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,640
Yes.

746
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,040
They have been doing experiments
on different patients,

747
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,280
and doing follow-ups

748
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,680
to improve the drug.

749
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,400
The corpses

750
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,000
showed different signs.

751
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,920
I told this to Xiaoyu.

752
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,320
I hope the police officer
who's in charge of the case

753
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,280
and the coroner can find something.

754
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
I spoke with the policeman.

755
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,000
I think he's able to keep things in control.

756
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,920
Let's see what he can do.

757
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,320
Are you done?

758
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,440
Her family is rushing us.

759
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
It doesn't seem right.

760
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,320
How come she looks like

761
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,280
a different person from the photo?

762
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,080
Different how?

763
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
Plus, not everybody's like Jin Xiaoyu.

764
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,880
She's careful

765
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,040
because she's a girl.

766
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,200
What's the meaning of that?

767
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,680
If that's the case,

768
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,600
there shouldn't be any male doctors
in the operation room, right?

769
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,640
You do it.

770
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,720
No, no, no.

771
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,320
I don't do second-hand jobs.

772
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,720
Hurry up.

773
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,840
Or she'll be late for the cremation.

774
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,920
I just wish to get off work earlier.

775
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,640
I would hate to work overtime.

776
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,520
If only Xiaoyu were here.

777
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,120
You're starting to like the turtle, huh?

778
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,040
I'll feed it and make it into a soup for you.

779
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm afraid I'll die

780
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,400
before it's ready for the soup.

781
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,440
I've been meaning to ask you.

782
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,200
Why do you grow so many flowers?

783
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,680
Because I'd like to be a flower boy.

784
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,120
Did you learn that from William?

785
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,120
The truth is,

786
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,480
I grow them to find the village
where the meteor landed.

787
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,280
Back then,

788
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,640
when I was in a semicoma,

789
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,440
I saw many beautiful flowers.

790
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,320
But later,

791
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,680
I never came across the flowers again.

792
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,440
I traveled all over the world

793
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
and saw countless flowers,

794
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,600
but I never saw those flowers.

795
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,320
Therefore,

796
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,040
I bought all kinds of flower seeds,

797
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,920
and planted flowers for 80 years.

798
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,760
But no luck whatsoever.

799
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,680
80 years?

800
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,360
Every seed grew, bloomed, and fruited.

801
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,760
But none of them is that particular flower.

802
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,800
You said the meteor was radioactive, right?

803
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,440
Could it be that the flowers mutated

804
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
after being radiated?

805
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,280
That's one possibility.

806
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,840
But I haven't even seen a similar kind of flower.

807
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,560
Why are you smiling?

808
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,320
I just think we're now

809
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,480
like a couple of normal lovers.

810
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,240
We get off work, go home,

811
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,600
feed the pets,

812
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,560
hold hands, take a walk, and have a chat.

813
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,920
This is quite nice.

814
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,240
And two unreliable kids cooking for us.

815
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,280
Oh, no.

816
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,720
Qian Cheng's on duty today.

817
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,320
My tummy.

818
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,800
I don't know

819
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,320
how you bear with them.

820
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,240
I don't get indigestion.

821
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,960
The food only tastes bad.

822
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,200
And to be fair,

823
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,160
their cooking skills have improved a little.

824
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,360
I can somewhat bear with them.

825
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
Poor you.

826
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,280
In a lengthy life,

827
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,720
you have to put up with this.

828
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,080
That's why you have to treat me nicely.

829
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:26,760
Young Master,

830
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,840
Qian Cheng cooked something unspeakable.

831
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,000
I saw nothing.

832
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,960
Why did I save his great-grandfather?

Hello.

839
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,080
Hello.

840
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,360
You're Jin Xiaoyu, right?

841
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,800
Yes.

842
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm Wen Yu, the person
who spoke to you on the phone.

843
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,160
You're an organ donation volunteer?

844
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,240
I am.

845
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,320
On the phone,

846
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,720
you said you were the family of an organ donor.

847
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,280
What question do you wish to ask?

848
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,040
Have a seat.

849
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,000
Thank you.

850
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,160
Your number is on this card.

851
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,920
(Name of Card Owner  Su Jiafan)
Officer Su.

852
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,000
He went to our campaign

853
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,000
and filled out the donation form on the spot.

854
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,600
You are...

855
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
What's your relationship with him?

856
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,280
Why is your number

857
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,320
on the donation form?

858
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,640
Please don't get me wrong.
There's nothing between us.

859
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,960
We only saw each other three times.

860
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,080
Plus, my number

861
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,520
is on every form

862
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,920
to make it convenient
for the donors to contact me.

863
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,400
May I ask

864
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,240
why you have the form?

865
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,640
Did something happen to him?

866
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
He's my husband.

867
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,800
We got married less than a year ago.

868
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,720
He had an accident two days ago.

869
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,760
What?

870
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,360
Officer Su had an accident?

871
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,320
Is he...

872
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,240
Is he at the stage

873
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,520
of donating his organs?

874
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,360
He had a car accident.

875
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,960
And now he's in the hospital.

876
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,480
I found his bankbook.

877
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,600
When I withdrew money to pay his medical fees,

878
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,240
I found that he'd been

879
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,880
sending money out every month

880
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
and that he has another cell-phone.

881
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,080
He's been cheating on me.

882
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,880
I can imagine that

883
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,080
it must be a heavy blow.

884
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,160
Do you know who he has been sending money to?

885
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,240
Gosh.

886
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,280
Is there a twist?

887
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,520
I don't know.

888
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,120
If you want to know,

889
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,840
just go check the name of the account.

890
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,440
I tried.

891
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,600
It belongs to a woman.

892
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,360
I asked the colleague of my husband
to get the information,

893
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,960
but everybody covered for him.

894
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,380
(Qian Tu)

895
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,920
The policeman that you asked me to investigate,

896
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Su Jiafan, had an accident.

897
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,760
"The young master
held the short-life girl by the waist."

898
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,960
"She got closer and closer..."

899
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,960
Hey.

900
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,920
Young Master.

901
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,720
W-Where are you taking me?

902
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,680
Are you going to get back at me?

903
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,120
So

904
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,200
you think I'm the home-wrecker?

905
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
Go check the account. It's not me.

906
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,040
The account name can be forged.

907
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,240
And you can hire an agent
to receive the money for you.

908
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,960
Is

909
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,920
this your son?

910
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,560
You said

911
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,200
you got married less than a year ago?

912
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,400
To be precise,

913
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,640
8 months and 20 days.

914
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,400
8 months.

915
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,360
It wasn't that long ago.

916
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,360
But we were in love for 8 years.

917
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
It is you, right?

918
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
No.

919
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,240
I think you must have misunderstood my girlfriend.

920
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,760
This again?

921
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,440
Well, it works.

922
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,600
Don't leave yet.

923
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,680
You haven't answered me.

924
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:22,880
Let me ask you.

925
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,240
Why do you think it's me?

926
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,600
Before his coma,

927
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,480
his last phone call was

928
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,160
made to you.

929
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,400
What?

930
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:40,960
Let's head to the second hospital.

931
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,120
Officer Su had an accident.

932
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,120
It's pretty serious.

933
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
He already reached the stage for organ donation.

934
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
I just called Weilan.

935
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,880
He's in the second hospital.

936
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,480
What is this person?

937
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,800
Does he have anything to do with the case
that Young Master has been investigating?

938
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,000
This is why I didn't want you to be involved.

939
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,720
I'll go check things out first.

940
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,120
I'll go with you.

941
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,600
No.

942
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,120
The police are there.

943
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,320
You'd better stay out of their sight.

944
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,640
How's Officer Su?

945
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,800
Still in operation.

946
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,880
He's in the process of organ pairing.

947
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,600
There's a pair,

948
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,720
but his family won't sign the papers.

949
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,720
I heard he got into a car accident while working.

950
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,240
I know. His wife came to me.

951
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,400
Before Officer Su went into a coma,

952
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,320
he called me.

953
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,880
His wife came to me using the clues she found,

954
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,840
thinking I'm the mistress.

955
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
How come?

956
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,480
I was having a medical examination
when he called me.

957
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,960
I called him back, but there was no answer.

958
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,960
I didn't know...

959
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,760
But I don't get it.

960
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,760
Why did he call me at the critical moment?

961
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,120
If I was his wife, I'd be mad, too.

962
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,080
I know why he called you.

963
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:41,880
You know the reason?

964
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,200
Why?

965
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,120
He woke up briefly just now

966
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,920
and said he wanted to see
a volunteer named Jin Xiaoyu.

967
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:48,960
He said if he died,

968
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,760
he wanted to donate his corneas to Pei.

969
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,800
Pei?

970
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,880
Daddy,

971
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,880
is this girl pretty?

972
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:58,880
I see.

973
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,440
It must be that blind child.

974
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,440
That's his son.

975
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,920
Then just tell his wife about it

976
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
and everything will be sorted.

977
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,760
No.

978
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,320
His wife isn't the mother of his son.
