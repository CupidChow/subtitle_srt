19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,840
Here's the information.

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,120
The whole thing

21
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,480
(Su Jiafan  Personal Information)
is easier than we thought.

22
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,440
But it may also be more complicated
than we expected.

23
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Indeed, it's simple.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
They just want to disrupt the investigation.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,920
But they dare not directly antagonize the police.

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,040
So, they found Wen Yu.

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
Women's suspicion has been

28
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,560
taken advantage of in this process.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,080
If Jin Xiaoyu heard what you said just now,

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
she would say

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,360
you are discriminating against women again.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,320
What's wrong with that?

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,600
When a woman is in love,

34
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,760
her intelligence is affected.

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,240
But it also shows that

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,880
Wen Yu loves Officer Su very much,

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,640
right?

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,600
Thank you.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,360
Stop staring at the goose.

40
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,200
You like alpacas, don't you?

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,720
When you are in a relationship,

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
I will send you ten thousand alpacas.
How about that?

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,520
No, thanks.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,800
Slow down.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Is it fun, Son?

46
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
How does a rabbit move?

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,220
Are you tired?

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,600
My master said

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
as long as I have a baby,
I can stop going on blind dates.

50
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,040
How about we kidnap one from here?

51
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,760
Let me pick out an easy target.

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,520
We should tell his mother about Su Jiafan.

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
She is still ignorant
of what happened to Su Jiafan.

54
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,720
It wouldn't cause some unnecessary drama, right?

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,440
I will back you up. Let's go.

56
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm here again.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,200
Why have you come?

58
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,200
This is such an interesting place.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,040
I've come to see you.

60
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,840
And also

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
find some material for my web novel.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,760
If you have nothing else to do,

63
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,080
why not spend time with Xue Wanwan?

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,160
I think she is pretty cute.

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Why should I be with her?

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,720
She is my bro,

67
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,480
my buddy.

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,760
Can you stop setting me up with her?

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
Is what you're eating yummy?

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,040
You eat delicacies all day long,

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,400
that's why you think this is yummy.

72
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
If you eat this every day,
you'll get tired of it, too.

73
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
I will never get tired of it if I eat it with you.

74
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,800
I will get annoyed.

75
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,640
I don't allow you to be annoyed!

76
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,920
It's all yours.

77
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,580
(Operating)

78
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
How's it going?

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,400
Mom,

80
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,840
you must take care of yourself!

81
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,160
We can't lose another family member!

82
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,560
What can we do?

83
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,940
(Operating)

84
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,320
I will try my best
to take good care of your parents.

85
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,240
You cheated on me.

86
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,880
But I won't do you wrong.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,080
May you rest in peace.

88
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,140
(Operating)

89
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Do we still have time?

90
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,240
It would be too late even if she signed it.

91
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
Let me help you enrich your science knowledge.

92
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,600
The maximum cold ischemia time of a man's kidney

93
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,480
is 24 hours.

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,520
It's 12 hours for the liver,

95
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,960
about 8 to 12 hours for the lung,

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,200
and about 6 to 8 hours for the heart.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,200
We are now

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,240
in a race against time and death.

99
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
We should try our best even if we might fail.

100
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,640
I'm off.

101
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
(Operating)

102
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,640
- Doctor, how is it?
- Doctor,

103
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
how is my son?

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
We have tried our best.

105
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,000
The patient is brain-dead now.

106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,680
In five to eight minutes,

107
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,200
his heart and lungs will probably stop working.

108
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,440
Mrs. Su,

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,400
- will you reconsider...
- I won't sign the papers.

110
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,360
I won't do it!

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,520
- Mrs. Su!
- Wen Yu,

112
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,520
I discovered the truth.

113
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,360
He didn't cheat on you. The boy isn't his son.

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,080
He is your husband.

115
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,480
If you trust him,

116
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,440
sign the papers now!

117
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,320
What if I don't trust him?

118
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,800
Then you will regret it for the rest of your life.

119
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,920
I have already found out all his secrets.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,760
I'll tell you whether you sign the papers or not.

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,800
But if you don't sign it now, it will be too late.

122
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,240
Will you bet on your husband's moral quality

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
and the love between you two?

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Give me the consent form.

125
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's count down from three.

126
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,400
Three,

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,080
two,

128
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,360
one!

129
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,000
If you dare lie to me,

130
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll sue the hospital!

131
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,500
(Signature: Wen Yu)

132
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Go start the process.

133
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,120
Captain Liu.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,400
Zhou.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,440
Zhang Di.

136
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,040
Why are you all here?

137
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,320
This is the boy.

138
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,520
This is the boy's mother.

139
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,280
You guys should talk about it.

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,640
Wen Yu,

141
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,320
this was a misunderstanding.

142
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,680
We didn't know that

143
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,000
Su Jiafan had an accident.

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,880
Sorry for having caused so much trouble.

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,240
What's wrong with Daddy?

146
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,080
The boy's father was a policeman
in the drug enforcement agency

147
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,120
and also our alumni in the police academy.

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
He was also Su's senior in the training group.

149
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,160
Four years ago,

150
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,160
he was killed in the line of duty.

151
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,480
As his colleagues and friends,

152
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,120
we've been taking turns to take care of his son.

153
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,080
His wife got married again this year.

154
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,840
Because Su was concerned about this kid,

155
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,960
he often took him out to play

156
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,840
and looked after the kid.

157
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,080
My husband is parking the car.

158
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,520
He is coming up later.

159
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Miss Jin told me that

160
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,520
Su didn't tell you about this kid,
which has caused

161
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
a misunderstanding between you and him.

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,080
Last time when he sent my son back, he said

163
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,760
he was going to take you
to my home to have dinner with us.

164
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,960
I never thought something like this could happen.

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,480
I don't know what to say.

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,240
Wen Yu.

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,680
You didn't tell me anything about what happened.

168
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,720
If Pei's mother hadn't told us,

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,200
we would have still been in the dark.

170
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,120
And what's wrong with you, Zhang Di?

171
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,280
Captain Zhou,

172
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,200
I really dare not tell you.

173
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,040
What about the drug?

174
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,320
Why was he carrying the drugs?

175
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,440
Honey,

176
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,480
tell this lady

177
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,000
where the drug came from.

178
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,840
(Ancient Street of Yongshui)
Let's go to Mom.

179
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,600
Pei's mother.

180
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,400
You are back!

181
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,080
Thank you, Su.

182
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,880
My pleasure.

183
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,840
Why are you still holding him?

184
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
- Come on. Put him down.
- This couple of days, I'll bring my wife

185
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
to your home for dinner.

186
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,440
Baby, what's in your pocket?

187
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,160
What's this?

188
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,440
Baby,

189
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
tell me.

190
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,480
Where did you get this?

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,720
I don't know.

192
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,200
Then why is it in your pocket?

193
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,480
I don't know.

194
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,720
Mom got this vest for me.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,800
When I dressed him in the morning,

196
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,320
there was nothing in the pocket.

197
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,720
What's that?

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,760
Is it medicine?

199
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,440
Yes.

200
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,960
Those people placed the drug in the child's pocket

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,760
to threaten Su.

202
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
The aim was to make Su stop investigating.

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,400
Of course,

204
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,240
it also annoyed him.

205
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,520
It wasn't his intention
to keep the drugs a secret.

206
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,000
It was only that we had no time to hand it in.

207
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:01,960
He...

208
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,240
We had asked you,

209
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,880
but you said nothing about it.

210
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,040
I thought...

211
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,600
I thought...

212
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Jiafan!

213
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,000
Su Jiafan!

214
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,000
I was wrong!

215
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,560
I shouldn't have doubted you!

216
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,760
I have signed the consent form for you.

217
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Jiafan!

218
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,060
(Emergency)

219
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
The liver transplant team,

220
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
the heart transplant team,

221
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,920
and the kidney transplant team are all ready.

222
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,280
The organ acquisition team and donation team

223
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
have arrived at the operating room.

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,980
(Operating Room)

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Come on!

226
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,240
Finally!

227
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,080
Come on!

228
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,520
Heart, liver, and kidney teams are all here.

229
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm so sorry

230
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
for having said so many nasty things to you

231
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,160
and Doctor Cheng.

232
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,400
When she finished her work,

233
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
I will apologize to her in person.

234
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,160
Your signature shows your attitude best.

235
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,800
I am sure he is smiling down from heaven

236
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,960
knowing you've carried out his will.

237
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,920
His memorial service is coming in three days.

238
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,240
We haven't had a wedding since we registered.

239
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,520
He was always busy.

240
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,840
He always said that we would do it
when we were free.

241
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,800
I was thinking of holding this memorial service
with the wedding.

242
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,680
Would you

243
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,880
like to come?

244
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,120
Definitely. I wouldn't want to
miss such a novel memorial service.

245
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,120
Thank you.

246
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Without your help,

247
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,800
I might still be questioning everything
that happened.

248
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,400
Having found those so-called clues,

249
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,760
and getting those calls,

250
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,960
I felt terrible.

251
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,720
I hoped to find out the truth,

252
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,240
but was afraid to find the truth at the same time.

253
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,040
That was why I just decided he was guilty.

254
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,960
I don't think so.

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
I think deep down inside you,

256
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,680
you still trusted him.

257
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
Otherwise, you wouldn't

258
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,320
have won the bet at the last minute.

259
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,960
A teacher shouldn't gamble.

260
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,800
But it's pretty weird.

261
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,080
Knowing that his organs
are now in someone else's body,

262
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,520
I don't feel so terrible.

263
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,760
It makes me feel like he's still alive,

264
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
at least a part of him is.

265
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,720
New blood will flow

266
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,880
into your husband's organs.

267
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,040
When oxygenated blood flows
through the coronary artery and myocardium,

268
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,760
his heart will start beating again.

269
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,640
The cold liver will also recover

270
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,720
in the new body.

271
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,080
The color and tension of the kidney
will also be restored.

272
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,320
His corneas will also
be distributed through the system

273
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,280
to their new owner.

274
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
They will take care of the world

275
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
for your husband.

276
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,560
Jin Xiaoyu,

277
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,120
thank you.

278
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:55,720
Be brave!

279
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm leaving. See you.

280
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,040
See you.

281
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,960
How did everything go?

282
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,800
Are you happy to make a new friend?

283
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,440
Yes, I am happy.

284
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Did you ask her for condolence money?

285
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,200
She invited me first.

286
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,440
I did a calculation just now.

287
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,240
Their wedding and funeral combo
would need two times the money.

288
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,400
Old man,

289
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
you have to help me.

290
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Are you that poor?

291
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:22,920
Oh, by the way,

292
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,560
this is Officer Su's hospital records.

293
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,200
As well as some information about his accident.

294
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,920
The information's not complete.

295
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,200
These are enough.

296
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,560
And

297
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,280
this.

298
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,280
(Sterile Sampling Bag)

299
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,840
The special drug.

300
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,160
The reason why the gang put the medicine

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,040
in the boy's pocket 
was that Officer Su could see it

302
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,880
and get irritated.

303
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,320
No wonder officer Su

304
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,520
acted alone

305
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,280
and got into the accident.

306
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,120
And then they called Wen Yu

307
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,440
to muddle the issue

308
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,920
and disrupt the investigation, right?

309
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,240
I think it is more complicated than

310
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,400
muddling the issue
and disrupting the investigation.

311
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,360
Qian Tu got the relevant report of the accident,

312
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,320
which says that

313
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,000
Su Jiafan was on the phone during the incident.

314
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,640
Not only that, but the police couldn't
even trace the number that called Su Jiafan.

315
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,040
The accident happened after the call.

316
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,840
Following this logic,

317
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,160
we can speculate boldly that

318
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,160
the person who called him should be the murderer.

319
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,040
Do you mean that

320
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,200
they located him

321
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,280
through the phone?

322
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:23,720
Yes.

323
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,160
We saw from surveillance video that

324
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,480
Su Jiafan's car started to speed up midway.

325
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
After going through some information,
a few timestamps

326
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,960
and the surveillance video,

327
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,440
I came to the conclusion that

328
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
Su Jiafan suddenly accelerated his car

329
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
after talking on the phone for two minutes.

330
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,880
That was why he collided with the truck.

331
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
I figured it was probably the phone call that

332
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,720
worried him.

333
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
That's why he drove like a madman

334
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,360
and the accident happened.

335
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
So, there was something wrong with the truck.

336
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,400
There must be something wrong with that truck.

337
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,480
It didn't even have a license plate.

338
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,120
I asked Qian Tu

339
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,560
and found out that the resort next to the incident

340
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,360
had already been completed.

341
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,560
There was no reason
for a truck like that to be there.

342
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,800
Neither was the truck needed
by the surrounding construction sites.

343
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,640
So, the call had two purposes.

344
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,640
First, to locate Su.

345
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,520
Second,

346
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,520
to cover the fact that

347
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,720
the driver of the truck was an accomplice.

348
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,920
How could this drug selling gang be so cruel?

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,760
Selling drugs

350
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,120
is the most profitable business in the world.

351
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,040
Second to that, it would be selling medicine.

352
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:19,880
Got it?

353
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,520
Yes.

354
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,840
Repeat what I told you.

355
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,440
Number one, never sell drugs.

356
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,160
Number two,

357
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,480
never get involved in making fake medicine.

358
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,700
(Emergency)

359
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,440
Hello!

360
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,600
Good evening.

361
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,280
Why are you still here?

362
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
If I left, who would take care of you?

363
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,920
I brought you supper.

364
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,520
Thank you.

365
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,440
Aren't you tired of being a doctor?

366
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,560
All jobs are tiring.

367
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,040
May I ask you a question?

368
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
I've always

369
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,520
regarded doctors
as a highly respectable occupation.

370
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,280
But organ donation service

371
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,200
is so taxing and tiring.

372
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,440
Sometimes you might even get yelled at.

373
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,280
You have no commission for successful cases.

374
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,160
Why are you still doing this?

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,480
Organ coordinator

376
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,400
isn't a position in the hospital.

377
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,520
And no money is involved
in the process of organ donation.

378
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,200
You still don't get it, do you?

379
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,520
No, I don't.

380
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,400
But

381
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,960
this is my conviction,

382
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,560
and also, my obsession.

383
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,160
A friend of mine signed a donor agreement

384
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,120
on the operating table
because of a serious illness.

385
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,200
It was my first time

386
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,600
seeing an organ donation form.

387
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,660
(Full name: Jin Xiaoyu)

388
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,000
She told me later that

389
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,280
if she died,

390
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,560
her organs would be donated
to those who need them,

391
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,480
then her life

392
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,280
would continue in someone else's body.

393
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,880
In that way, we can continue being friends.

394
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,960
Continued?

395
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,040
I became a doctor afterwards.

396
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
As a doctor, I face

397
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
life and death all the time.

398
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Not every patient can be cured.

399
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,400
Every doctor has to live with

400
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,880
the feelings of powerlessness

401
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
and self-reproach.

402
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,360
There was a time when I was really

403
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,040
afraid to see dead people.

404
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,440
But whenever I saw people die,

405
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,040
what my friend said would come to my mind.

406
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,960
She said that if her organs could be donated,

407
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,200
her life would continue.

408
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,880
If a life could be continued,

409
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,640
wouldn't hope be continued?

410
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,040
Life and death are serious matters.

411
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,800
I don't know how to answer your question.

412
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,560
After I became an organ coordinator,

413
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,840
I no longer felt afraid.

414
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,680
Because even if I couldn't save a life,

415
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,920
I could still ask the relative of the patient.

416
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,800
Are you willing to donate the patient's organs?

417
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,520
I feel that

418
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,000
death is not the end,

419
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
since hopes can be continued.

420
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,880
The three most beautiful words
that I have ever heard are

421
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,120
"Yes, I do."

422
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,080
Yes, I do?

423
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,040
Not said at a wedding,

424
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,920
but when said at the door of a ward.

425
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,560
It's when the family of the patient

426
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,040
tell me they are willing.

427
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,160
They are willing to sign the papers.

428
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,080
They are willing to donate
the organs of their loved ones

429
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,040
to those who need them.

430
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,280
Yes, I do.

431
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,360
These three words sound so ceremonial.

432
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,280
What happened to the girl?

433
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,180
(Operating)

434
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:06,760
Xiaoyu!

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,840
Xiaoyu, what's the matter? Xiaoyu!

436
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,000
Are you leaving me?

437
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,720
Don't leave me alone!

438
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,600
I can't do without you!

439
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,440
Surprise!

440
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,600
Xiaoyu, you're not dead!

441
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,160
Why did you kid me?

442
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,000
I hate you!

443
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,680
I'm okay.

444
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Don't worry.

445
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,440
See? I'm fine.

446
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,360
Just now Director Cheng asked me
whether I would like to donate my organs,

447
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
and so I signed

448
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,320
an organ donation consent form.

449
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,400
You know that all my organs

450
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,080
are useless now

451
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,040
except for my lovely corneas.

452
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I certainly will cherish them.

453
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,720
I hate you!

454
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,320
Why do you always prank me?

455
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,920
- I hate you.
- Because it's fun to prank you.

456
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
Later on, the girl

457
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,360
was revealed to be

458
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,320
Sha Qianmo's sister, named Sha Qiandao.

459
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,320
Sha Qiandao?

460
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,000
Real name, Jin Xiaoyu.

461
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,120
Jin Xiaoyu!

462
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,840
For real?

463
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,720
Officer Su,

464
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,440
have a happy wedding day.

465
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,840
In sickness and in health,

466
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,800
for richer, for poorer,

467
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,600
be it young and beautiful,

468
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,480
or old and worn,

469
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,120
you will always

470
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
love, honor,

471
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,520
comfort,

472
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,360
and cherish each other.

473
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,600
Never leave each other

474
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
for the rest of your life.

475
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,920
Do you agree?

476
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,880
Yes, I do.

477
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,920
Yes, I do.

478
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,920
Though Officer Su is dead,

479
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,520
his colleagues

480
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
are still investigating

481
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,080
the gang that's producing the special drug,

482
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,760
despite the threat of death.

483
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
People's police,

484
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
we are proud

485
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,560
of you.

486
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,020
(Mourning for Comrade Su Jiafan)

487
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,040
I have to deal with some matters
with President Zhang.

488
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,960
I'll be going.

489
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:17,920
How about you?

490
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Where are you going? I can give you a ride.

491
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,360
I haven't finished my work yet.

492
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,000
All right.

493
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,360
Then I will leave first.

494
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:24,720
Bye!

495
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,480
Bye!

496
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,800
The little girl in a dress!

497
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
Old man!

498
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,120
Someone dressed up to meet with Lin Nuoyan.

499
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,280
You are just like a little girl!

500
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,840
I am a little girl.

501
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Are you a little girl?

502
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,560
You are just like a lad.

503
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,560
I don't think you are a little girl.

504
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,120
Xiaoyu.

505
00:20:59,400 --> 00:20:59,960
Thank you

506
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,640
for making Jiafan look so handsome.

507
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,560
Thank you for

508
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,480
letting me learn something new.

509
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,080
I have to learn,

510
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,480
or else I wouldn't know

511
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,440
how to hold my funeral.

512
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,120
Nonsense! You are so young.

513
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
This bridal bouquet is for you.

514
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,720
I hope you like it.

515
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,040
Is this

516
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
your boyfriend, too?

517
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,800
Too?

518
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,960
Thanks.

519
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,320
I'll wait for you at the gate.

520
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,400
He is your real boyfriend, right?

521
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,240
You've noticed?

522
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
How about the previous two? Were they your friends

523
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,560
or passers-by who wanted to help you out?

524
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,120
And that Lin Nuoyan,
who came with you to my wedding today

525
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,720
isn't your boyfriend, either.

526
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,320
Though they look at you with gentle eyes,

527
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,760
you look at them calmly.

528
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,360
Only when you see this man

529
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,040
did your eyes sparkle.

530
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,440
Whether a man is your boyfriend or not,

531
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
it depends on your behaviors rather than his.

532
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Why are married women

533
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,080
all so intuitive?

534
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,800
Yes,

535
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,960
married women are scary.

536
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,560
A married teaching director is even more scary.

537
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,400
You're so scary!

538
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,040
I wish you happiness.

539
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,800
You too.

540
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,040
See you.

541
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:35,960
What are you doing?

542
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,160
Actually,

543
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,480
I like this place.

544
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
But I have always been seeing others off.

545
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,920
When will I be sent off by others?

546
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,680
Then

547
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,720
let me send you off, Mr. Handsome.

548
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,200
I hope so.

549
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,160
Why don't you accompany me to see Chen?

550
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Let me dress up first.

551
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,680
Let's go.

552
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:01,580
(Path to the Graveyard)

553
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,000
Chen.

554
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,400
Let me make a formal introduction.

555
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,160
You two

556
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,040
have already met before.

557
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:22,920
This is

558
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
my girlfriend,

559
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,280
my future wife.

560
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,680
(Grave of Great Friend Chen Zhongshun)
You can call her Xiaoyu.

561
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,040
Chen,

562
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,960
nice to see you again.

563
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,960
If only Chen were alive,

564
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,360
he could see you face to face.

565
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,880
You know what? When we were young,

566
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,160
book discussion clubs were popular.

567
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,920
That was when two or three couples
went to the park together

568
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
to discuss what they read.

569
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,080
I had no girlfriend.

570
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,240
So, I couldn't join them.

571
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,960
I could only go to the drama club instead,

572
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
and was forced to recite scripts every day.

573
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
Am I hearing the complaints

574
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,160
of a man without a girlfriend?

575
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,400
When I saw Chen come

576
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,720
with his fiancee,

577
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,400
I thought

578
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,080
if someday I had a girlfriend,

579
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
I would join their club as soon as possible.

580
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,920
Then I would keep talking,

581
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,360
not giving them any chance to cut in.

582
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,640
What do you think, Chen?

583
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,720
Xiaoyu is beautiful, right?

584
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,120
Isn't she much better than your Miss Qin?

585
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,160
And she

586
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,720
only loves me.

587
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,520
Can't you be nice to Chen?

588
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,800
Sorry! Sorry!

589
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
This grudge that I've held onto for 80 years.

590
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,640
I finally have taken my revenge today.

591
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,640
If you died at that time,

592
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,160
you would probably have ended up
as an unmarried ghost who couldn't rest in peace.

593
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:27,920
An unmarried ghost?

594
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,080
Yes.

595
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,040
If I were an unmarried ghost,

596
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,400
every night I would visit you
at the funeral home next door

597
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,320
to scare you to death.

598
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,840
Am I scary?

599
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,600
It's not funny.

600
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,000
It's not funny?

601
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,680
Is it really not funny?

602
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,560
How dare you say that...

603
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,820
♪Flying in the sky and watch the time♪

604
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,660
♪See the clouds' love for the sky♪

605
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,800
- You can't catch me!
- Don't run!

606
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,700
(Buwenzhong)
♪The distance, how far away♪

607
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,040
Isn't William on duty today?

608
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,320
Why is Qian Cheng here, too?

609
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,000
Why are you making a cake?

610
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,360
It's a secret.

611
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:20,800
William!

612
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,000
Do you want to know
Cheng Weilan's schedule for next week?

613
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,480
Today is Young Master's birthday.

614
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,440
You're not qualified to participate in planning!

615
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,840
No wonder he was so happy

616
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,640
in front of me at the graveyard.

617
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,120
Young Master is probably tired of birthdays.

618
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,760
He has not celebrated
his birthday for a long time.

619
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,040
He has never mentioned it.

620
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,760
But my grandma always remembers it.

621
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,560
She called us today

622
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,320
to remind us
to prepare some delicious dishes for him.

623
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,160
Should I take this opportunity
to do something for him?

624
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,120
It's too late for you to do it now.

625
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,400
How would you know?

626
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,120
(Pig-shaped Steamed Bun)
This will do.

627
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Frozen buns stuffed with red bean paste?

628
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,160
Aren't you belittling Young Master?

629
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,080
Look,

630
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
I have especially prepared
these lovely pig-shaped buns for you.

631
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,760
They are so cute!

632
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,320
Cheng, this one looks like you, doesn't it?

633
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,400
No, not at all.

634
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,120
- These little eyes...
- Young Master!

635
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,280
- So cute!
- Happy Birthday!

636
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,480
Thank you. Thank you very much.

637
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,520
This is the best birthday that I have ever had.

638
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,160
Thank you all.

639
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:11,720
Thanks.

640
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,400
Where did you buy this?

641
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,240
Qian.

642
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,200
I made it by myself.

643
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,560
This is probably love.

644
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,760
People in love are fools.

645
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
Did you really make this?

646
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,640
Really?

647
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,160
Yes.

648
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,240
They are so cute.

649
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,240
- Young Master.
- Yes, they are cute.

650
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:28,600
Young Master!

651
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,240
It's time to blow out the candle.

652
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,080
Oh, let's blow out the candle.

653
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,720
Make a wish!

654
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,360
You two, that's enough.

655
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
Young Master doesn't like celebrating birthdays.

656
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,040
That's ok.

657
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,080
I'm starting.

658
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,920
I wish Qian Cheng

659
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,080
could have a girlfriend soon.

660
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,560
I wish William

661
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
had fewer girlfriends.

662
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
Lastly, I wish Jin Xiaoyu

663
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
wouldn't be my girlfriend any longer.

664
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,880
I wish...

665
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,160
I wish I could have the right

666
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,520
to pray at your tomb after you die.

667
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
You want me to be your godmother, don't you?

668
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,280
Young Master, you should blow out the candle.

669
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,000
Yeah. Let's blow out the candle.

670
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,040
Blow out the candle.

671
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,000
All right then...

672
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,680
L-Let's do it together.

673
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
Let me count from three.

674
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,360
Three,

675
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,080
Two...

676
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,240
Happy Birthday!

677
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,840
Happy Birthday!

678
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,920
Happy Birthday!

679
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,720
What's wrong?

680
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,480
Are you sad because you're a year older?

681
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:47,720
No.

682
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,400
I feel a little sad because my proposal failed.

683
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,040
Thanks for your gift.

684
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,760
I do.

685
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,780
♪Is still bumpy♪

686
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,360
It took you long enough to react.

687
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,960
I'd love to from the bottom of my heart.

688
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
But we had a deal.

689
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,920
Before we figure out
what you should do in the future,

690
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,640
I won't agree to marry you.

691
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,800
You want me to stay?

692
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,200
I want you to be happy.

693
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,600
Whether you are leaving

694
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,000
or staying,

695
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,840
I hope it's a decision
you genuinely made yourself.

696
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,040
I don't want you to feel obliged.

697
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,200
I don't want you to feel forced.

698
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,320
I want you to follow your heart
when making the decision.

699
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,400
It sounds so lenient.

700
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
I'm encouraging you.

701
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,440
You shouldn't make your decision for others,

702
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,680
or for me.

703
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But for two people in love,

704
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,320
shouldn't they change themselves for each other?

705
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,040
You should make changes willingly

706
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,120
rather than being forced by me.

707
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,540
♪Thank you for understanding me♪

The two of you,

712
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,160
can you have some self-control?

713
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,560
The two of us are still children.

714
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,400
Children that are 1.8 meter tall?

715
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,240
Such tall kids!

716
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,680
Right.

717
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,880
Not only are they dumb but they have low IQ!

718
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,800
I agree with you.

Young Master.

720

You seem less admirable.

I'm glad to hear that.

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,160
Let me take a picture of you two.

723
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,840
A picture that captures your love
and hatred for each other.

724
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,680
No.

725
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,280
Wait for a minute.

726
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,320
Why does it sound like

727
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,400
a plot of a sad movie?

728
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,880
Quite right.

729
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
After you pass away,

730
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,560
I will look at your photo to remember you.

731
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,040
And it will make me happier
at the celebration of your death.

732
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,760
I'm telling you

733
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,280
I won't be your friend before I die.

734
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,080
Before you die?

735
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,040
It will be impossible even until the day I die.

What are you reading?

762
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm reading about a case of a rare disease.

763
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,200
Let me have a look.

764
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,180
(Outpatient Record  Name: Jin Xiaoyu)

765
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,200
I saw this case

766
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,160
at Professor Liu's office the other day.

767
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,520
Really?

768
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,840
Jin Xiaoyu.

769
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,520
Yes, it's her.

770
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,320
It was a rare case sent
by the Oncology Department of the Second Hospital.

771
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,400
The cause is unknown.

772
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,200
I also asked him

773
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,920
about other rare diseases in China.

774
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,080
She is

775
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,920
a good friend of mine.

776
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,920
So, I want to try my best

777
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,480
to help her.

778
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,480
I think

779
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,320
she's more than just a friend, right?

780
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,120
President Zhang,

781
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,400
this is a workplace.

782
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,160
Let's just talk about work.

783
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,720
Liu and I had a short discussion about this girl.

784
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,440
He said you had asked him
for advice with the case before.

785
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,560
The Second Hospital applied for a consultation.

786
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,480
After the relevant materials had been received,

787
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,160
he informed you as soon as he could.

788
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,160
When you went to him,

789
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,760
you said a lot about the girl.

790
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,800
That's why Liu felt
that you had something with that girl.

791
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,680
I think the gossip culture in our school

792
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,400
really needs to be corrected.

793
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,960
Zhang told me that

794
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,520
she is a mortuary makeup artist.

795
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:39,960
Yes.

796
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,960
That's a special profession.

797
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,160
If you have a chance,

798
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,960
you really should take a look
at her suturing technique.

799
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:50,800
Three characters.

800
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,240
Perfect.

801
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,160
Love makes people unable to count.

802
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,160
Because of her,

803
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,480
I'm

804
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,240
not that afraid of death anymore.

805
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,240
Since I began to major in medical science,

806
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,560
all these years,

807
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,920
until now doing scientific research,

808
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,480
I have always been fighting against diseases.

809
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,320
Death

810
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,560
has become a taboo for us.

811
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,760
Even the organ donation program
I've been promoting

812
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,600
is just because I can't accept death.

813
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,240
Medical workers may be defeated by diseases.

814
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,960
But we still want to keep the dead body,

815
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
the organs,

816
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,200
to continue fighting.

817
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,320
Which medical worker isn't like this?

818
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,080
As a terminally ill patient,

819
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
and a mortician,

820
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,640
she faces death every day.

821
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,560
But with her,

822
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
you can't feel

823
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,880
any fear or helplessness at all.

824
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,240
Instead, she calms my heart.

825
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,640
Life and death

826
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,640
are both part of life.

827
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
This is what I have learnt from her.

828
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,920
I really don't know what to say.

829
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,200
Should I congratulate you on having a girlfriend?

830
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,880
Or should I say it is pitiful that

831
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,560
true love is transient?

832
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,840
Then let me share with you some good news!

833
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,600
This transient true love

834
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
is someone else's girlfriend.

835
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,360
I have to go for a meeting.

836
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,680
See you, President Zhang.

837
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,200
Okay.

838
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,760
I will attend the consultation, too.

839
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,520
Don't be too nervous.

840
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,280
I'm pretty relaxed.

841
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,440
It is you that should take it easy.

842
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,280
See you.

843
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,360
You little naughty girl,

844
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,200
where are you going?

845
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,040
Sister Xiaoyu,

846
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,280
I know I've done wrong.

847
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,360
You change your attitude pretty quickly.

848
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,040
Even calling me sister after you've been caught.

849
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,320
Good sister,

850
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,800
please take me back to the ward.

851
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
It's time for me to take my medicine.

852
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,120
You're right.

853
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,880
It's time for you to take your medicine.

854
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,760
Come with me.

855
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,040
Don't pretend to be asleep.

856
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,920
Get up and get changed.

857
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,060
Hey.

858
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,240
Jin Xiaoyu,

859
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,360
you are so annoying.

860
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,880
You little lying brat,

861
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,080
how could you have two faces?

862
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,920
You called me sister just now.

863
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,920
And now you are calling me by my full name?

864
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,880
Women shouldn't make it hard for other women.

865
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,720
Who taught you that?

866
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,920
My dear Bella, don't run around.

867
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,160
She ran away when I went to the bathroom.

868
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,720
Lin Nuoyan, you are here!

869
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,160
What are you doing here?

870
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,360
I asked Professor Lin to come.

871
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,720
Whenever Bella doesn't behave herself,

872
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,480
I would call Professor Lin.

873
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,520
He's more effective than her mother.

874
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,080
Come here!

875
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,160
Take a seat.

876
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,520
I'll ask you some questions.

877
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,240
When you work on a movie

878
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,960
and the lead actor suddenly runs away,

879
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,040
what do you do?

880
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,720
If the lead actor is arrogant,

881
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,960
then we have to wait.

882
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,080
Were you angry at that time?

883
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,560
Yes, I was angry.

884
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
And I felt very bad.

885
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,640
Only he left,

886
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,840
but all the crew couldn't continue
until he came back.

887
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,680
And

888
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,760
wearing makeup was so hot.

889
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,000
It was so uncomfortable.

890
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,720
See?

891
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,560
Just because of one person,

892
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,960
everyone else was affected.

893
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,080
Do you think this is acceptable behavior?

894
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,280
I'm sorry.

895
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,600
I was having a meeting

896
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,720
when I received Miss Wang's call
and came here immediately.

897
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,280
Firstly,

898
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,040
you affected my work.

899
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,920
Secondly,

900
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,880
it's Miss Wang's job to take care of you.

901
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,680
If you ran away while she was at work,

902
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,880
she would have been punished or yelled at.

903
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,280
Let me ask you a question.

904
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Is Miss Wang not nice to you?

905
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,800
She is very nice to me.

906
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,720
But

907
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,000
staying in the hospital all day is so boring.

908
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,280
Mom said she would come to see me today.

909
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,520
But she didn't come.

910
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,400
So, were you going to see your mom

911
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,080
after you snuck out?

912
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,960
She promised me that

913
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,640
she would take me to the amusement park today.

914
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Since your mom has made a promise,

915
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
she surely will take you there.

916
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,200
If you sneak out,

917
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,000
she will be worried about you.

918
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,840
You don't know her.

919
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,720
My mom often lies to me.

920
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,120
I have to go to the amusement park first

921
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,120
and make her come find me.

922
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,160
In that case, she has no choice
but to play with me there.

923
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,080
You are such a smart girl!

924
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:34,800
Who are you?

925
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,600
Stop!

926
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,040
Wang, look after her.

927
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,720
Don't run!

928
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,040
Stop him! Stop him!

929
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,600
Don't run!

930
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,440
She is just a kid!

931
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,320
Why did you take pictures of her?

932
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,080
Give me your camera.

933
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,240
Which media company do you belong to?

934
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,320
I will sue you.

935
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,040
Though Bella is a star,

936
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,120
she's in the hospital now!

937
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,160
You have really crossed the line this time!

938
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,720
I was scared to death.

939
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,200
Zhang.

940
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,400
Is he a paparazzi?

941
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,360
Something is really wrong with his head.

942
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,480
Why did he take pictures of a kid?

943
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,400
A show I played in was a big hit this year.

944
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,280
I'm the most valuable child star this year.

945
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
You look happy to be secretly photographed?

946
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,760
Are you Lin Nuoyan's girlfriend?

947
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,680
Aren't you Lin Nuoyan's girlfriend?

948
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,280
I think he likes you.

949
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,000
You are still a kid.

950
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
Don't learn from adults and have love rivals.

951
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,240
Jin Xiaoyu.

952
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,960
After I die,

953
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
can you take care of Lin Nuoyan for me?

954
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,960
He is an adult.

955
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,880
Does he need to be taken care of?

956
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,000
My mom says

957
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,960
all men need women to take care of them.

958
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,240
If Lin Nuoyan really needs your care,

959
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,320
he'll become a giant baby.

960
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,320
I know I'm young.

961
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,840
Lin Nuoyan only treats me as a kid.

962
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,680
I wish I could grow up soon.

963
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,240
You will.

964
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:46,960
Don't worry.

965
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,120
Lin Nuoyan looks like someone that needs caring.

966
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,560
He always looks sad.

967
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,320
He seems to have something
on his mind every time I see him.

968
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,280
My mom keeps all my money.

969
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,280
And I can't go out by myself.

970
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,640
Besides, I'm running out of time.

971
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,200
Bella,

972
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,040
let me tell you something.

973
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,880
The most important thing between people

974
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,280
is not time,

975
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,320
or money,

976
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,400
but how they feel when they are together.

977
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,280
We should be sincere with others.

978
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,520
Bella.

979
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,160
Lin Nuoyan, you are back!

980
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:19,840
Don't worry.

981
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,440
Your mom is coming to pick you up.

982
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,920
Thank you for your help.

983
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,400
By the way,

984
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,200
aren't you here to see a doctor?

985
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,760
I almost forgot.

986
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,480
I'll be going.

987
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,320
Go ahead.

988
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,360
Except for her looks,

989
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,760
she is fine in other aspects.

990
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
