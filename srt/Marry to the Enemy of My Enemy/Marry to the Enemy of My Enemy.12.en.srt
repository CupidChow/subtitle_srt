11
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:00,039
Are you really married?

12
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,560
Of course, we are indeed a couple.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,840
We are business partners.

14
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,959
I knew it.

15
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:07,079
What do you know?

16
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,280
I know you two are in a fake marriage,

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,760
but you really love each other!

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,359
Serious matter.

19
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:16,959
Well,

20
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,120
this contract alone

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,719
cannot clear the grievances
between our two families.

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,359
We must find a credible witness
from that year.

23
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:25,079
I heard that Meng Media

24
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,519
participated in this acquisition.

25
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:27,359
But...

26
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,040
But what?

27
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,959
Can you say it all at once?

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,599
It depends on Xia Nuan.

29
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,200
Because

30
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,920
once the Zhou Tang wrongful case
is overturned,

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,200
Zhongxia might be implicated.

32
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,359
Yizhe, why is the light off?

33
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,319
Yizhe.

34
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,799
Are you okay?

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm fine. I'm just a bit tired.

36
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,760
Yizhe.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,200
Do you remember Mr. Zhong
from Zhou Tang Pharmaceutical?

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,640
That year, for the business merger,

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,560
he came to our house.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,719
You were there at the time.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,120
Why suddenly asking this?

42
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,599
I just suddenly remembered.

43
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,080
My mom clearly promised not to merge
at that time.

44
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,520
Why did it ultimately face adversity?

45
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,120
Once the Zhou Tang wrongful case
is overturned,

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,360
Zhongxia might be implicated.

47
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Yizhe, if you're tired,

48
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
you should rest first.

49
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,879
For Zhong Xinyang,

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,919
you put Zhongxia into
a perilous situation.

51
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,719
Nuan, how can you be so confused?

52
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,240
We are a couple.

53
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,520
We are business partners.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,159
Come here.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,120
I don't need any more ointment.

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,039
I know you can take a lot of pain,

57
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
but scars don't look good, right?

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
Take off your clothes.

59
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,080
Didn't you say we are business partners?

60
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,439
Which business partner needs to strip?

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,879

Xia Nuan,

don't leave me.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,399
Uncle, what's up?

79
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,519
Have you heard of the company
named Zhou Tang?

80
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,519
Zhou Tang?

81
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,000
It's the pharmaceutical company
acquired by Zhongxia?

82
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,759
Uncle, what have you heard of?

83
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,720
It seems you already know

84
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,600
that their young master
has returned to the country.

85
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,279
I heard about it,

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,720
but it doesn't concern me.

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,959
So I've ignored it lately.

88
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,759
What's the matter?

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,680
About the acquisition case,

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,519
your Meng family was also involved in.

91
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,680
Uncle, didn't you already know

92
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
I'm not a part of Meng family?

93
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,000
Yizhe,

94
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,360
this matter concerns Zhongxia.

95
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,319
You're no longer with the Meng family,

96
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:09,240
Xia Nuan is still your sister.

97
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,680
Just a sister?

98
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
If you need my help, sure.

99
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,720
However...

100
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Just tell me what you want.

101
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,079
What do I want?

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,879
Haven't you always known?

103
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,399
Yizhe, I'm leaving first.

104
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,160
Nuan,

105
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
my leg has been hurting badly.

106
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,639
Can you take me to the hospital?

107
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,000
Yizhe, I'm really busy today.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,800
I'll ask a colleague to take you, okay?

109
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,720
Nuan,

110
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:49,879
I want to talk to you.

111
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,879
Go ahead.

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,920
Actually, I...

113
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,240
I...

114
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,959
Yizhe, how about this?

115
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,199
Tell me until wait I come back.

116
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,759
I'm leaving. I'm really in a hurry.

117
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,879
Wait till I get back.

118
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,264
(You'd better explain.)

119
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:56,120
(Why Xia Nuan had no reaction?)

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,560
(You'd better explain.)

121
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,800
(Why Xia Nuan had no reaction)

122
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,279
(to the charm-the-straight style)

123
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,439
(and the first choice gifts for dates?)

124
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:13,920
(What date outfit did you recommend?)

125
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,079
(Why no reaction from him?)

126
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,879
What's the matter?

127
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,800
It's nothing. I just remembered.

128
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,040
When I left home,

129
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,879
Yizhe said his leg hurt badly.

130
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,160
Never mind.

131
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,199
Zhao Qing introduced me
to an American doctor.

132
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,560
I have sent the medical records.

133
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
Yizhe's leg can definitely be cured.

134
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,360
Let's work hard together.

135
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,279
Hungry?

136
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,679
Let's go eat.

137
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,840
Okay.

138
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,399
Let me see if there's anything
to eat nearby.

139
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,360
Let's have hot pot.

140
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,080
Hot pot?

141
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,879
Go! We're off to eat hot pot.

142
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:57,919
- No.
- No need.

143
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,720
- Just this.
- No.

144
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,080
Y-You hesitated, so you like to eat it.

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,559
Go. Go.

146
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,840
We don't have to eat that.
I'm okay with anything.

147
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's just eat hot pot.

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,919
This place is okay?

149
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,120
Boss.

150
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,840
Ms. Xia.

151
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,279
Great. The date turned into
a team-building activity.

152
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,128
They two...

153
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:37,360
Through this matter,

154
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,639
you should know never open up
to the boss completely.

155
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,440
I don't know.

156
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,480
They actually make a good match.

157
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
Do you really want to eat hot pot?

158
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Ms. Xia, since you returned to Zhongxia,

159
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,600
Mr. Ji has been looking for someone
to make connections,

160
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,159
intending to make Zhongxia go public.

161
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,039
He has been cashing out,
intending to bring the company down.

162
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
I think it's not that simple.

163
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,960
That contract about Zhou Tang

164
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,799
was found in his study.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,320
So it must be related to
the acquisition case.

166
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,679
Maybe he just wants to run away abroad
with the money.

167
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,919
We need to cut off his hopes first

168
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,840
and hold him back,

169
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,799
so that we can find out the truth
of the matter.

170
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,159
I believe we can do it.

171
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:15,840
Hello.

172
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,919
We definitely can.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,919
Please enjoy.
