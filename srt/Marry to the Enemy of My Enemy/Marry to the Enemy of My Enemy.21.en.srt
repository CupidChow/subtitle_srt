Boss, still up so late?

12
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,719
Tell me.

13
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,840
How can I appease an angry woman?

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,840
Boss,

15
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:41,799
are you with Xia Nuan now?

16
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,879
Don't ask.

17
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,079
Just answer the questions.

18
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,000
- Still playing dumb?
- Hello, Ms. Xia.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's that sound?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
Never thought that a girl

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,159
would bring you this far.

22
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,599
My dog.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,319
That's easy.

24
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,319
Listen.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
Women are just like men.

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,840
They're all about what they see.

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,480
What does that mean?

28
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,280
When did you get a dog?

29
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,439
Just recently.

30
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,040
Did you find

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
the private investigator?

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,624
Yep.

33
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:08,439
I'm meeting with him tomorrow.

34
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,199
Look.

35
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,039
Show off

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
your fine physique

37
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,960
to her.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,400
See how she reacts.

39
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,080
Seriously.

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,199
Trust me on this, okay?

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,879
When you meet him tomorrow,

42
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,280
ask him to find Ji Yiran first.

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,360
Ji Yiran just can't
keep anything to herself.

44
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
So I think

45
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,039
we need to get something out of her.

46
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,240
Alright.

47
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,280
Ms. Xia, bye-bye.

48
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:32,919
Good luck, Boss.

49
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:48,080
Tell me.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,280
When will this ever end, Julie?

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,240
Look who's talking.

52
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,400
What did you just say?

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,240
Showing off your "fine physique"
to women?

54
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,520
Seriously?

55
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:05,400
I'll show you today

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,199
what fine physique looks like.

57
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,759
Come on.

58
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,159
Where are you going?

59
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,080
How will you forgive me?

60
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,319
I won't.

61
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:42,120
Let go of me! What are you doing?

62
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,616
Don't believe me?

63
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,080
Here, take this.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,719
Take it.

65
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:46,280
Are you mad?

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,840
- Dig out my heart and check.
- Don't.

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
See what's inside.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,919
- Dig my heart
- Zhong Xinyang.

69
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,919
out and check. Come on!

70
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,719
Let go. Are you crazy?

71
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,080
Yeah, I'm totally crazy.

72
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,000
I miss you like crazy!

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,759
Let go of me!

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,879
Let go!

75
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,400
You had so many chances

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
to tell me the truth.

77
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,000
Yet you kept hiding it from me

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
until you couldn't.

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,759
Because I was scared of losing you.

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,439
Just scared of losing you.

81
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,599
So I didn't want to risk it,
not even by one percent.

82
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,719
But I no longer trust you.

83
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,639
Nuan, we have guests.

84
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,480
Come downstairs.

85
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,720
Nuan, Uncle Xu knows already.

86
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,639
No more hiding.

87
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,480
Did you seriously marry him

88
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,360
just to keep the shares?

89
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,319
Uncle Xu, I...

90
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,040

92
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,959
We did start the marriage

93

for Zhongxia.

94
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,600

Uncle Xu, looking for me?

135
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,399
Your mom's death was suspicious.

136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,560
When I heard she was sick,

137
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
I rushed to the hospital.

138
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,800
But her husband, that Ji guy,

139
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
had two people watch the ward's door.

140
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
They wouldn't let me in.

141
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,439
I had to threaten that

142
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,000
I'd call the cops to finally get in.

143
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,920
I knew it's him.

144
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,399
She secretly

145
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,600
slipped those files into my hand

146
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,984
without letting Ji Yiran find it.

147
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,079
I bet

148
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,519
the Ji family, father and daughter,
are behind her death.

149
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,199
I know what to do now.

150
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,600
Thank you, Uncle Xu.

151
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,680
I wasn't planning
on saying any of this at first.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,399
After your mom passed,

153
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:37,160
you were completely on your own.

154
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,519
But now,

155
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,759
you've got someone you can rely on.

156
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,279
Just do whatever you want.

157
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,199
Actually, about him and me...

158
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,079
About you and him,

159
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,360
Meng told me.

160
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,639
But I don't fully believe
what others say.

161
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,439
I can see it for myself.

162
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,160
He really cares about you.

163
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,199
Way more than you realize.

164
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
Xia Nuan, let me give you a ride back.

165
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:20,639
Nuan.

166
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
I'll drive.

167
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,120
No need.

168
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,160
No need.

169
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,519
Let me.

170
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,639
Nuan.

171
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,680
Stuff in Zhongxia still awaits you.

172
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,480
Like I said,

173
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
Zhongxia's all yours now.

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,320
All yours. You got that?

175
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Let's go.

176
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,000
To draw a clear line,

177
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,720
you even give up on Zhongxia?

178
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,120
I just believe that no matter what,

179
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,720
you'd take good care of Zhongxia

180
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,600
for my mom's sake.

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,639
Told you so many times.

182
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,759
Why can't you get it?

183
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,919
So you're giving up?

184
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,960
Nuan, you're not a quitter.

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm just tired. Want some rest.

186
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,120
Tired. Time to rest.

187
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,152
- You...
- Nuan.

188
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,120
Goodbye.

189
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,879
No need. My car's here.

190
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:13,248
(Pills)

191
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
Ms. Xia, are you okay?

192
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,480
Feeling unwell again?

193
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,240
Not news.

194
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,960
Is Ji Yiran found yet?

195
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,240
It's so strange.

196
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,159
Ji Yiran seems to have gone missing.

197
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,759
Tell them. I add another half a million.

198
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,519
I have to see

199
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,919
Ji Yiran within a week.

200
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,720
Okay.

201
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,320
Xia Nuan.

202
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,279
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,480
I'm here to apologize.

204
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,120
Good.

205
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
Boss, done the acting?

206
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,000
It's already been an hour.

207
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Julie said,

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,519
Xia Nuan needs some private time
for a good rest.

209
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,159
I am letting her rest!

210
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,159
The longer we wait here,

211
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,600
the more touched she'll be.

212
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,320
The more touched,

213
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,879
the better our chances of getting back.

214
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,759
What makes you think

215
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,480
you two will get back together?

216
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,960
Haven't I told you a million times?

217
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
That day she was holding the knife

218
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,679
to me.

219
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,919
She was, like, totally worried.

220
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,600
She just threw the knife away.

221
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
If she hurt you with the knife,

222
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,440
she'd face criminal charges.

223
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,399
You just don't get it.

224
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,679
Xia Nuan, I'm still outside your home.

225
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,039
Can you open the door when you wake up?

226
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,360
Let's just wait.

227
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,320
Is Ji Yiran found?

228
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,480
Ms. Xia.

229
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,679
We've checked everywhere
we could think of.

230
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,120
Still can't find her.

231
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,000
Meng Yizhe.

232
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,080
