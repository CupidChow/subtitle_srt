Zhong Xinyang, Xia Nuan is in my hands.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,400
and the ticket are both here.

20
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,519
Throw them over.

21
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,359
Release her first.

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,640
Throw them over.

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,879
- I was too soft-hearted before!
- Xia Nuan.

31
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,360
I let you two brats go.

32
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,759
I killed both your parents.

33
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,360
I'll send you to reunite with them now.

Xia Nuan?

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,319
- Xia Nuan.

Xia Nuan.

Sorry, family members can't enter.

41
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,479
I asked the doctor.

42
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,960
Nuan's injury
didn't affect her heart or lungs.

43
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,719
Thank you.

44
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,639
No need to thank me.

45
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm not helping you.

46
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,719

If you were willing to be with me,

53
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
you wouldn't be you.

54
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,599
Hello, Dr. Hou.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,719
Yizhe,

56
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,960
I found Xia Nuan's medical records.

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,480
Her condition is very serious.

58
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,360
W-What happened to her?

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,759
I'll send you some photos to see.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,759
Okay.

61
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,680
(Xia Nuan's Medical Records)
Nuan was right.

62
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,560
She and I have always been family.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,759
Inseparable family.

64
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,279
While I wasn't looking, Ji Yiran

65
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,279
escaped from the room

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,040
and contacted Ji Yantao.

67
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,600
She panicked

68
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,199
and revealed all of his plans.

69
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,639
Before coming,

70
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,360
I had given her to the police.

71
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,240
I told her Ji Yantao only asked
for one plane ticket.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,480
Her father abandoned her again.

73
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,160
She's not stupid.

74
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,399
She will tell the police
everything in detail.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Doctor?

76
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,519
The surgery went well.

77
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,959
However,

78
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,240
Miss Xia's physical condition
was already poor.

79
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,920
Now, plus her injury and coma,

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,040
she may not last much longer

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,000
even with the support of machines.

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,959
Hello?

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,040
Got it.

84
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,959
Do me a favor.

85
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,839

I had been deceived by Ji Yantao,)
