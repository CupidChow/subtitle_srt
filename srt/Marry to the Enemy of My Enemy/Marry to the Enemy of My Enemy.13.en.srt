00:00:59,240 --> 00:00:59,960
We definitely can.

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,560

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,959
I'm fine.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,159
What's wrong?

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,032
He is allergic to something strange.

19
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Allergic?

20
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,560
If you don't feel well, let's just go.

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,560
No need.

22
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,319
It's okay. Y-You eat.

23
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,359
You eat first. We're leaving.

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,519

- Okay.

25
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,200
Okay.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Come on.

27
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,640
How is it? Feeling better?

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,359
I'm okay.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,640

38
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,759
Do you have a way?

39
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,400
Wait.

40
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,199
Hot spring?

41
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,199
Wait, I can't do a hot spring bath.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,800
How about this?

44
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,599
Done.

45
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,680
See? It's not that scary, right?

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,280
Actually, hot spring water
can help heal wounds.

car accident before.

Her foot bone fractured.

50
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,400
She could never wear high heels again.

51
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,759
No high heels?

52
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
Why do I remember

53
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,759
the woman that day
was wearing high heels?

54
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,199
So she was an imposter.

55
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,159
So now you do believe
the murderer of your father

56
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,400
was not my mom, right?

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm sorry. I did suspect her before.

58
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,599
It's because I really didn't know.

59
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,080
It's okay. We are both victims.

H-Haven't you already...?

87
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,199
Yes, I have died.

88
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,839
I died the first time.

89
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
We removed Nuan's kidney together.

90
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,439
Then I lived.

91
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,439
Dad, can you guess
how I came back to life

92
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,839
the second time?

93
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
As you know,

94
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,160
my blood type is quite special.

95
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,560
Only Xia Nuan's blood type
is the same as mine.

96
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,399
No, Zhong Xinyang's too.

97
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,600
He was the blood donor

98
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,399
I found in Southeast Asia back then.

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,959
But he betrayed me.

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,319
But if I could find a blood donor,

101
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,079
I could find the second one
and the third one.

104

would never think

106

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,959

Your lifeline is now in my hands.

114
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,079

If you damage it,

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,079
I won't have money to get a second one.

117
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,800
There's gossip. Come on!

118
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,959

- I don't know.

Isn't it explosive?

123
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,439
- Too explosive!
- Really?

124
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,199
Yes.

125
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,319
- Wasn't he her special assistant?
- Yes.

do you not feel guilty?

140

00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,040
to evade?

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,639
- Xia Nuan.
- Please answer us.

143

to hand Zhongxia over to Nuan.

become Xia Li's alone?

166
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,408
