(Your mom took precautions.)

12
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:09,599
She feared someone might deceive you
into marriage for money.

13
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,439
So before her death,
she added another condition.

Where did you go?

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,360
Are you drinking?

34
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,400
Give it to me.

35
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,319
Stop it.

36
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,479
I'm unhappy.

37
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,759
I know you're upset
because of the shares.

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,159
But your body
can't handle so much alcohol.

39
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,520
Zhong Xinyang,

40
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,719
I finally came home.

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,599
But I feel everything has changed.

42
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,759
You are my only family now.

43
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,759
Same here.

44
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,680
I also only have you.

45
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,199
We are a couple, right?

46
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,439
Shall we?

47
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,800
Hold on. I'll get the...

48
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,120
No need for that.

49
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,279
What if...

50
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,600
If I'm pregnant, I'll have the baby.

51
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,639
Then I can get the shares,

52
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,560
and you can get the money.

53
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
What do you mean?

54
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,399
Do you still have a conscience?

55
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,560
What right do you have to judge me?

56
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,480
The child is innocent.

57
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,199
He is not your tool for revenge.

58
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,519
The child is innocent?

59
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
Then what did I do wrong?

60
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,879
Xia Nuan,

61
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,120
what do you take me for?

62
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,199
If you just want a child,

63
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,360
don't come to me.

64
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,600
(Even without a child,)

65
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,960
(I can still reclaim the shares
and take back Zhongxia.)
