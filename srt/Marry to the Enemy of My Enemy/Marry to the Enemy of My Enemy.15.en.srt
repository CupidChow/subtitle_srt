11

Yizhe.

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,480
Nuan,

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,719
my feelings for you
have never been a joke.

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,799
I am not your brother.

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,159
And I've never considered you
as my sister.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,560
But I only see you as a brother.

17
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,599
Could you change for me?

18
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,280
Just treat me as an ordinary man.

19
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,280
Not a brother.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
I can't do it.

21
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,040
Why?

22
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,120
I knew you earlier.

23
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:51,879
Why can he, but I can't?

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,200
You are not the same.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,519
What makes us different?

26
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,760
Just because he is

27
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,000
a conman skilled in deceiving,

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,079
and I'm not?

29
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,879
Or is it because

30
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,480
you despise me because I'm a cripple?

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,520
Yizhe.

32
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,680
Yizhe.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,199
How can kinship turn into love?

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
It never can.

35
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,136
(Zhongxia Group:
Waiver of Management Rights)

36
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,719
Sign it.

37
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,439
What do you mean?

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
You might have a bad memory and forgot.

39
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,599
It's okay. I'll remind you.

40
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,680
This crisis was started by me.

41
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,560
If I'm unable to solve it,

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,039
I will resign and leave.

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,039
Bet on what?

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,000
But if I solve it,

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,039
Uncle Zhou and the other board members,

46
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,439
please don't interfere
in the company's operations anymore.

47
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,080
I...

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,879
Okay.

49
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,719
Uncle Zhou agreed.

50
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,439
You've been
in the business world for years.

51
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,479
You should at least
have this bit of credibility, right?

52
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,080
It's just a joke.
No need to take it seriously.

53
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,599
Yizhe, what are you doing here?

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,240
Everyone here
is a veteran of the company,

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,639
holding key resources for its growth.

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,159
Therefore,

57
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,000
I announce as CEO

58
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,360
that this waiver
of management rights is nullified.

59
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,079
That's the right thing to do.

60
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,000
CEO?

61
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,079
(Share Transfer Agreement)

62
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,120
Let's cooperate.
I want to join Zhongxia.

63
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,920
You want to cooperate with me?

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
There's one more condition.

65
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,079
I want to be the CEO.

66
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,480
You're here.

67
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,800
Tell me, did Ji Yantao approach you?

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,040
What did he promise you?

69
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,519
They said you arrived early
this morning.

70
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,680
Here is your breakfast.

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,879
Answer my questions first.

72
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,120
Nuan, don't you trust me?

73
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,720
Or do you think I will harm you?

74
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,879
Then tell me what exactly is going on.

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,920
Ms. Xia, come to the factory quickly.

76
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,879
Something happened.

77
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,592
Nuan, do you have something to do?

78
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,600
Go ahead.

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll come over now.

80
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,079
The breakfast.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,600
The list of optimized personnel
can be sent out.

82
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:49,759
(Zhongxia Group's
List of Optimized Personnel)

83
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:50,439
He is fired too.

84
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:51,839
Why is Wang on the list?

85
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,319
Where is Ms. Xia?

86
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,879
I don't know.

87
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,879
He was an excellent employee last year.

88
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,279
Zhong Xinyang
is the special assistant to Ms. Xia.

89
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,279
It's not your turn to fire him.

90
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,959
That's petty tyranny!

91
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,279
He was an underground boxer.

92
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,519
His education fails
Zhongxia's minimum standard.

93
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,639
Mr. Meng simply followed the rules.

94
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,720
An underground boxer?

95
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,600
You...

96
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,000
(Zhongxia Group)

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,040
You couldn't fix it.

98
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,199
So you solved the person
causing the problem.

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm impressed.

100
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:33,839
Whether one can stay

101
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,600
is always decided by their strength.

102
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,040
Leaving is only a matter

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,079
of time for the incompetent.

104
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,319
That's true.

105
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,920
Then let's see who can stay in the end.

106
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,240
I'll leave with you.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Romeo.

108
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,639
Don't go.

109
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
Why can't I contact Xia Nuan?

110
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,040
As Ms. Xia's assistant, Zhong Xinyang

111
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,759
had access to many company secrets.

112
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,199
Stay here and help him pack

113
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,000
to prevent him
from taking things he shouldn't.

114
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,800
What do you mean?

115
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't care what you think.

116
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,600
Everything I do

117
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,279
is for the benefit of Zhongxia.

118
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,879
Even if Nuan is here,

119
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,199
she won't object.

120
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:26,839
You've tied yourself

121
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,480
to Zhongxia so quickly?

122
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,680
I had no choice.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
I was born
inseparably linked to Zhongxia.

124
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
This is destiny.

125
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm not like someone
who went to great lengths

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,639
and devised schemes
just to get something.

127
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,800
One can never get
what doesn't belong to them.

128
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,639
What you call destiny

129
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,519
is just a fool's dream.

130
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,399
A fool's dream.

131
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,480
Ms. Xia, where did you go?

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,399
Something big happened.

133
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,720
I know. You go ahead.

134
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,079
Meng Yizhe, why did you fire my people?

135
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,040
Nuan,

136
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
you never spoke to me this way before.

137
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,079
For Zhong Xinyang,

138
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,920
will I be your enemy?

139
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,439
You plotted against me first.

140
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,439
Like I said,

141
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,600
the list is made
based on educational qualifications.

142
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,679
You caused the problem
at the factory, didn't you?

143
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,320
If you had a clear conscience,

144
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,600
why did you lure me away?

145
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,120
Yizhe, I'm so disappointed in you.

146
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,399
Do you remember when he got hurt?

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,559
You said in the hospital that you

148
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,559
have the same blood type.

149
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,240
He also has Rh-negative blood.

150
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,919
What is your point?

151
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,559
Is it possible that he...?

152
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:02,559
Really?

153
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,639
Let him wait. I'll be right there.
