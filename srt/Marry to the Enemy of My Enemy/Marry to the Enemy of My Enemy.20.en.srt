Stop drinking.

Cheers.

13
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,879
Alright. You can just drink.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,120
You think puking will
make her forgive you?

15
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,040
Come over here.

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,719
Tell me.

17
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,280
Xia Nuan is the coldest person
in this world.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,200
Am I right?

19
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:16,280
Yes.

20
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,040
I've never met anyone
who can go cold so quickly.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,680
Yeah, she's the coldest.
She's the most ruthless.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,200
Happy now?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,439
Don't talk about her like that.

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,159
Only I can.

25
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,280
Wasn't I agreeing with you?

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,400
She was mad that day.

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,480
I could just apologize.

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,560
Why did I have to argue?

29
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,760
All I had to do was to apologize.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,519
She was mad.

31
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,719
Didn't I tell you

32
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,799
to just apologize?

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,040
Why did you yell at her?

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,760
Right?

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
Right.

36
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:42,519
What?

37
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,560
Right.

38
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,319
I'll go apologize to her.

39
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,560
I'll kneel to apologize.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,400
I'll kneel.

41
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,959
Xia Nuan, I kneel here to apologize.

42
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Xia Nuan, I'm sorry.

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,120
Xia Nuan, please forgive me.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,400
Right.

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,319
Look, listen to this.

46
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,719
You pull out a knife

47
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,680
and threaten suicide.
She'll forgive you.

48
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,239
Knife.

49
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,840
Look for what?

50
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,200
Knife.

51
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,000
Knife. Where's the knife?

52
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,599
- Knife.
- I'm just joking.

53
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,479
Knife.

54
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:13,080
Alright.

55
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,319
Don't be such a simp!

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,560
(It's not looking good.)

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,360
(Without a kidney donor,)

58
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,000
(given your current health,)

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
(you probably have two months left.)

60
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
Miss, lollipop for you.

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
Slow down.

62
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
Keep good diet.

63
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,464
Okay.

64
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,800
(Mom.)

65
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,800
(The one who killed you)

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,919
(hasn't been brought to justice.)

67
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,520
(Zhongxia's still not
on the right track.)

68
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,759
(What should I do now?)

69
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:51,008
(Obstetrics Department)

70
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,439
Take some rest.

71
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,080
Hello?

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,280
Hello, Baby.

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,879
Julie, what's up?

74
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,759
I saw Ms. Xia went to the obstetrics.

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
Can you drink cold now?

76
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,919
You're drunk.

77
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,879
No, I'm totally clear-headed right now.

78
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,120
Xia Nuan.

79
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,280
(Property Certificate)
Here's all I have.

80
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,560
All yours.

81
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,840
And this.

82
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,800
Zhu Rong's shares.

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,080
They'll be under your name soon.

84
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,719
These are all for you and the baby.

85
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,240
Baby?

86
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,719
What baby?

87
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,199
Don't keep it from me.

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,360
Julie saw that you visited

89
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,199
the obstetrics department
at the hospital.

90
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,719
Don't worry.

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm a responsible guy.

92
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,120
I'll for sure take care of you
and the baby.

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,199
I went to the hospital
because I got burned.

94
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,759
Where?

95
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,919
Are you okay?

96
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,520
Besides,

97
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
I'll never have a baby with you.

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,399
So

99
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,759
I'm out of chances?

100
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,199
Hello?

101
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
Uncle Xu.

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
I'm coming over now.

103
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:48,928
Ji!

104
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:50,839
If you don't pay up,
I'll wreck your place.

105
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,416
I'm working on it.

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Can you give me a few more days? I...

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,759
Knock it off!

108
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,759
That's not what you said

109
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,920
when you borrowed the money.

110
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,199
You liar. I'm telling you.

111
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,279
- Pay up soon!
- Wait...

112
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,480
Xia Nuan. Meng Yizhe.

113
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,319
You will definitely pay for this!

114
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,680
Nuan.

115
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
(Xu Tian, Xia Li's Old Friend)
How'd you get so skinny?

116
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,920
I was a little sick before.

117
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,759
Still recovering.

118
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,600
Your mom

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,120
cared about you most.

120
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,680
You have to take care of yourself, okay?

121
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,519
Uncle Xu.

122
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,519
My mom gave Yizhe a document.

123
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
You were at the hospital then, too.

124
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,600
I want to know what happened.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,879
You're looking into your mom's death?

126
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,079
I don't think she

127
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,759
died of natural causes.
I think she was...

128
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,319
Nuan.

129
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:45,792
Your mom always

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,279
cared most about your happiness.

131
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,759
Don't dwell on what you can't change.

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,240
Focus on today

133
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,600
and live your best life.

134
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,519
That's the real way to honor her.

135
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,639
Uncle Xu, but I think...

136
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,800
Nuan, I heard you got married.

137
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
Why didn't Meng come along?

138
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,839
Uncle Xu.

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Sorry, I'm late.

140
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,199
Just call me Zhong.

141
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,120
I'm Xia Nuan's husband.

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,439
Excuse me. I'll take a call.

143
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:19,240
Okay.

144
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Uncle Xu is watching.
What are you doing?

145
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:37,399
Why are you here?

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,519
To meet the family

147
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:40,639
with my dear wife.

148
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,920
No. I'm here to help you.

149
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,759
This Uncle Xu is not easy.

150
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,199
Right now, he's just worried

151
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,720
that digging into your mom's past

152
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,279
will mess up your life now.

153
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,399
So he won't tell you the truth.

154
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,959
You have to figure a way out.

155
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,040
What way?

156
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,480
The way is

157
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,079
to keep being a good couple.

158
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,519
Hear me out.

159
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,000
Convince him
that you're happy and fulfilled.

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,120
So he lets his guard down.
Once he's not so worried,

161
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,240
he'll tell you the truth.

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,879
Think about it, okay?

163
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:17,959
No way.

164
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:18,959
Why not?

165
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,079
- Trust me.
- Nuan.

166
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,720
Nobody's been to this house in ages.

167
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,680
Stay here for a few more days.

168
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,040
Okay.

169
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,920
Ms. Xia is taking a long leave?

170
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,040
Ms. Xia said

171
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,279
she has no idea
when she'll return to Zhongxia.

172
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
So for the time being,

173
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,759
all Zhongxia's affairs

174
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,160
will be decided by you, Mr. Meng.

175
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,879
Go find out what Ms. Xia is doing.

176
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,639
- Now.
- Yes.

177
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,680
(You hate me so much)

178
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,319
(that you'd even)

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,319
(ditch Zhongxia?)

180
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,759
Here, Uncle.

181
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,439
Have to toast you with water tonight

182
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,759
since we're trying for a baby.

183
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,480
Sorry.

184
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,480
Nuan, are you okay?

185
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,319
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

186
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,279
Choked?

187
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,279
Are you alright?

188
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
I'm alright.

189
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,800
Uncle.

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,519
Cheers to you.

191
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
Nuan always felt the closest to you.

192
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,720
She said we'd come visit you here often.

193
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,079
Make yourself at home here.

194
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,320
Drop by anytime.

195
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,120
Here you are.

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,159
Is it good?

197
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
Good.

198
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,399
One more.

199
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,519
I'm good.

200
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,080
How about giving one to Uncle?

201
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,240
Uncle doesn't like it.

202
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,200
Alright then.

203
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,039
Nuan is just having fun.

204
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,559
Uncle, have some more.

205
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,679
Sure, I'll get it.

206
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,240
Your sleeve.

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,039
Here you are.

208
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,679
She hates peeling shrimp.

209
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,159
If no one peels for her,

210
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,679
she won't even look at it,

211
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,200
right?

212
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
She's been this way
since she was little.

213
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,360
Once there was shrimp at the table,

214
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
she'd cling to her mom

215
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,799
and make her peel it for her.

216
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:38,559
Oh, really?

217
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,559
No worries. I'll peel it for you.
