I am Zhao Qing.

Zhao Qing?

I remember you're...

19
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,120
Aren't you still alive too?

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,840
Back then, before my dad
and your dad were murdered,

21

Stop joking, marry me?

28
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,120
Didn't we agree when we were kids?

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,319

Nuan, you know.

42
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,800
Our Meng family is wealthy and powerful.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,639
How can a successor be in a wheelchair?

44
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:52,599

45
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,080
Nuan, let it go.

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,840
I was not a part of the Meng family.

47
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,879
They brought me back from the orphanage

48
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,159
just to find a successor.

49
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,280
Now they have adopted a new successor.

56
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,039
Yizhe, I'll take you home.

57
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,719
I don't return to Xia family.

Hello, Julie.

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,599
Find me a new apartment now!

64
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,560
I am moving out.

65
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:45,599
Okay, Ms. Xia.

This is my plan.

75
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,599

76
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,400
No.

78
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,879

79
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,519
I haven't.

80

Can we not talk about this?

81
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,680
You said you'd help me.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,759
How do you plan to help?

83
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,360
We haven't met in years.

84
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,120
Won't you even give me
a chance to catch up?

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,920
Fine, let's catch up another day.

86
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,000

so I'll leave first.

Weren't you in a hurry just now?

92
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,920
Why do you have time now?

93
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,720

95

How can I trust you?

96
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,920
You don't trust me?

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,240

won't solve the problem.

00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,960
Yes, so what?

157
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,399
Alright, don't you want a child?

No need.

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,919
Hurry up!

189
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,679
No need!

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,679
The doctor already told me

191
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,480
you only had a simple surgery
after you got injured

192
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,799
and refused further treatment.

193
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,039
Isn't this a bit too hasty?

194
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,919
I am a doctor myself.

195
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I know my own situation.

196
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,279
Not being able to stand up
and not wanting to

197
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,360
are two different things.

198
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,559
No need. I'll do it myself.

199
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:54,759
Let me help you.

200
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,120
Xia Nuan!

201
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,799
She can't hear you.

202
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,679
If you want her to come up,

203
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,960
you can set the house on fire.

204
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,279
Condemning virtue with vice's lens.

205
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,840
Is this what you're thinking?

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,000
You know better than anyone.

207
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,919
Also,

208
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,720
a renowned surgeon

209
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,480
is willing to sit on it forever?

210
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,759
It's none of your business.

211
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,399
Honestly,

212
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,440
you're paralyzed in a wheelchair.

213
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,000
Even if you were in a coma,

214
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,759
it has nothing to do with me.

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,919
But Xia Nuan treats you as his brother.

216
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,519
She bustles about

217
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,799
and feels guilty because of you.

218
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,320
This matter is related to me.

219
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,600
You never intended to stand up, right?

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,720
You just want to exploit her guilt

221
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,720
to make her approach you
and take care of you.

222
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,440
You enjoy this feeling.

223
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,720
But if you have any conscience left,

224
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,399
don't exploit her compassion.

225
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,360
Do you understand?

226
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,720
What she feels for you is pity,
not love.

227
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,519
The relationship between Nuan and me
is not for you to judge.
