Let me go!

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,319
Yizhe,

14
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,760
I was kicked out by the company.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,480
The debt collectors are after me.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,760
I have nowhere to go now.

17
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,359
What's it got to do with me?

18
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,159
If you turn me down,

19
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,959
I'll go to Xia Nuan now.

20
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,519
Are you scared?

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,480
Zhong Xinyang was used
by my dad back then.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,799
We only told him

23
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,319
to stage a kidnapping.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,159
He didn't know at all

25
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,640
that we would take her kidney.

26
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:47,319
Tell me.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,480
If I tell Xia Nuan

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,239
that Zhong Xinyang is innocent,

29
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,959
would there still be a chance
for you two?

30
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,359
Let me go.

31
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,560
Do you really want to die?

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,799
Okay.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Those creditors of yours

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,199
are looking for you and your dad.

35
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,840
If you leave here now,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
they'll skin you alive.

37
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,280
Meng Yizhe, let me go.

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,240
Be quiet.

39
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,800
If you didn't have
Xia Nuan's kidney in you,

40
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,039
I would have ignored you.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,000
Meng Yizhe.

42
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,719
Miss Xia, you can't delay any longer.

43
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,000

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
got those shares

in his hands?

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,080
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Xia.

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,919
What has Meng Yizhe been doing recently?

49
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,520
He...

50
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,120
Keep an eye on him from now on.

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,759
Okay.

Ji,

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,759
I really can't help you anymore.

55
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,520
Zhong Xinyang and Xia Nuan's people

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,879
- are seeking you and Yiran.
- I...

57
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,719
I heard that they've
found out the truth.

58
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,879
If I get involved,

59
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,080
I'll suffer.

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,759
But you promised to help me.

61
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,439
That's it.

62
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,960
- Be careful.
- Wait...

63
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:06,000
Since you're like this,

64
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,479
don't blame me for being ruthless.

65
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,224
(Death Certificate Opinion Notice)

66
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,719
I didn't expect
my dad's death certificate

67
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,839
to have always been
in your mom's study room.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,120
My mom's people

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,199
should have found it before the fire.

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,920
I remember your dad
died of severe injuries.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,959
But this document
says myocardial infarction.

72
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,759
So there's still a discrepancy.

73
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,519
We can hurry before Ji Yantao

74
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,560
acts out of desperation

75
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,600
to find the person
who certified my dad's death

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,879
and bluff him.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,639
Anyway, I've given you this.

78
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,360
Do whatever you want with it.

79
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,279
What's wrong?

80
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,199
I couldn't find you that day.

81
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,240
I drank a lot and might have
upset my stomach.

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,319
So it hurts a lot.

83
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,160
I'll make you a cup of honey water.

84
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,439
Drink it and then leave.

85
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,680
Drink it.

86
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,680
Zhong Xinyang?

87
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,240
What are you doing?

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,439
Let go of me.

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
Just let me hug you.

90
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,439
My phone is ringing.

91
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,319
Get up.

92
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,439
My phone is ringing.

93
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,560
Hello?

94
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,439
Nuan, did you have someone follow me?

95
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,920
I know where Ji Yiran is.

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,439
Since you've already divorced,

97
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,480
marry me and I'll tell you.

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
Okay.

99
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,839
Are you crazy? Marriage isn't a joke.

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,160
It's just a piece of paper. Nothing big.

101
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,639
Also, finding Ji Yiran will lead

102
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,439
to the murderer who killed our parents.

103
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,160
Should I then praise your selflessness

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,279
and sacrifice?

105
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,480
You're welcome.

107
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
Sorry, I didn't...

110
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,079
Will you truly marry me?

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
But you have to promise me
to protect Zhongxia.

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,680
And

113
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,560
after we get married,

114
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
you need to heal your legs quickly.

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,199
This is an additional condition.

116
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,720
Yizhe, this is not a condition,

117
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,920
but my request.

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,064
For the sake of the name of family

119
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,839
and my mom,

120
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,879
promise me.

121
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,079
Nuan,

122
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,279
are you hiding something else from me?

123
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,680
Yizhe, your dream since childhood

124
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,839
has been to be a doctor.

125
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,480
You should be in the operating room
saving more people,

126
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,120
not getting stuck in a quagmire of love.

127
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,879
It's getting late.
The Civil Affairs Bureau is closing.

128
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,279
Let's go.

129
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:18,319
If you are unwilling,

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,839
we don't have to go.

(Resident Household Register)

132
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,279
I won't regret the things
I've promised you.

133
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,639
I'll go get my ID card.

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,560
You changed your attitude so fast.

135
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,079
No, I can't go.

136
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,240
What if Meng Yizhe was bluffing?

137
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,040
If I go, won't it seem like I've lost?

138
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,920
No.

139
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
I need someone to keep an eye on it.

140

No.

141
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:09,959
Hello, Romeo.

142
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,399
Go to the Civil Affairs Bureau
immediately.

143
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,000
It's not me getting married,
nor is it Julie.

144
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,319
If you see Meng Yizhe and Xia Nuan,

145
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,319
stop them.

146
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,079

147
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,560
Okay.

Miss Xia, you finally
answered the phone.

152

You really can't delay any longer.

153
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,960
You must be hospitalized now.

Two months is an optimistic estimate.

Every extra minute

156
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,679
