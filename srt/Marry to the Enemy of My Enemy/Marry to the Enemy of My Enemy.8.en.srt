Just hold on, Zhong Xinyang.

13

Please wait outside.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,760
How is it, Doctor?

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
He needs a transfusion
due to severe blood loss.

16
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,760
Take mine.

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,319
We share same blood type. Take mine.

18
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,040
Nuan.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,400
Yizhe.

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,719
You're unwell.
So you can't donate blood.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,920
You can't save him.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,200
Your leg...

23
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,159
He's not as simple as you think.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,799
Zha Meng!

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,760
Zha Meng, come out!

26
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:56,760
Zha Meng!

27
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,280
Come out! Or I'll cause havoc here!

28
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,000
Miss Ji, I've been looking for you.

29
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,680
Ao Tu? Where's Zha Meng?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He wants to leave now
that it didn't work out?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,120
(Ao Tu, Zha Meng's Younger Brother)
How dare you say that?

32
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,639
It's because of you
that Zha Meng got caught.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,879
How to settle this score?

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,919
Incompetent fool!

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,280
You can't handle Xia Nuan,

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,520
yet you dare ask me for money?

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,919
You're worse than
a dog under my command.

38
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,159
Dog?

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,840
What?

40
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,400
Looking for trouble?

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,759
A matching blood type has been found.

42
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,680
Don't worry.

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,360
Nuan, I just want to tell you.

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,240
He's deceiving you.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,919
I paid to hire him.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,159
I have to know why, don't I?

47
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,719
Nuan,

48
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,520
regardless of excuses,

49
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,240
deception remains deception!

50
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,439
I won't forgive anyone who deceives me.

51
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,680
Yizhe, don't worry about me.

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,319
Hello.

53
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,000
Alright, I'll be over.

54
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,479
Nuan, Yiran was seriously
injured by kidnappers.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,280
Only your blood type matches hers.

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,719
Hurry and save her.

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,639
When you needed my kidney,

58
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,800
you said so.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,039
Nuan,

60
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,560
please.

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,639
I know you hate her.

62
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,439
But she is your sister after all.

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,240
Can you do it for your mother's sake?

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,280
How dare you mention her!

65
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,400
If it were for my mom's sake,

66
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,240
I really wish you were killed
by the kidnappers too.

67
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,919
Nuan, please.

68
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,719
Save her, Nuan.

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,520
Doctor!

70
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,080
Doctor, quickly.

71
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Doctor, save her quickly.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,319
(Like the doctor said,
if you are giving me a kidney,)

73
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,599
(the risk is very high.)

74
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,840
But it doesn't mean you'll die.

75
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,280
Don't worry, Nuan.

76
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,599
I'll hold a beautiful funeral for you.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,920
(I wanted
to give this bouquet to Yizhe.)

78
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,800
This really feels familiar.

79
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:31,800
But today,

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,600
no one will give you
a face mask anymore.

81
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,720
(Miss Xia,)

82
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,959
(we found out)

83
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,639
the one who kidnapped you in South Asia

84
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,399
were Zha Meng and Ao Tu.

85
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,560
What's their deal with Zhong Xinyang?

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,480
Zhong Xinyang used to work for them.

87
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,959
It seems they split two months back.

88
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,920
It is said

89
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,600
that Zhong Xinyang

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,879
ruined a big deal for them.

91
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,959
(Why did you save me?)

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
(Why are you colluding with Ji Yiran?)

93
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:41,800
(Which one is the real you?)

94
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,120
Xia Nuan, I'm sorry.

95
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,160
Are you feeling unwell?

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
Why are you sweating so much?

97
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360
Why discharge from the hospital?

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
It's been a week, time for discharge.

99
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,639
If I don't return soon,
you might forget me.

100
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,759
What's wrong?

101
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
I'm fine. I'll take a shower.

102
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,360
Xia Nuan.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,560
Xia Nuan, are you okay?

104
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,839
I'm fine.

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
Hello?

106
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,879
Boss, you need to
execute your plan quickly

107
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,360
before Xia Nuan and Ji Yantao find out.

108
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,199
Got it.

109
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,399
(If the item is not in Zhongxia,
it should be at the Xia family.)

110
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,319
(Why isn't it found?)

111
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:36,839
Ji Yiran is no longer around.

112
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,600
You're still working hard, huh?

113
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,439
Follow me. We can't chat here.

114
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,079
Stop pretending.

115
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,920
Do you suspect me based on a few photos?

116
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,480
I'm not that stupid.

117
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,240
I told you to kill Xia Nuan.

118
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,560
How did you end up as her husband?

119
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,240
How much did Xia Nuan offer you?

120
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,839
Kill her now!

121
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,639
This isn't true.

122
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,839
Xia Nuan, let me explain.

123
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,040
Photos and videos...

124
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,920
How much did Ji Yiran offer you?

125
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,079
This card has two million.
Is that enough?

126
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,040
Is it enough?

127
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,360
How much did she offer you?

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,879
I'll give you double. Is that enough?

129
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,120
Xia Nuan, let me explain.

130
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,639
The photos and videos aren't real.

131
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,519
These photos and videos aren't real.

132
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,879
What of you is really true?

133
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,480
I don't want to lie to you.

134
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:33,600
But I can't tell you
the truth right now.

135
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,279
Is it because you can't,
or because you don't dare?

136
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,519
Trust me.

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,080
Even if you approached me for money,

138
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,840
I've given you enough, right?

139
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,039
No.

140
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,120
What of you is really true?

141
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,440
I've always been real with you.

142
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
And did you say the same to Ji Yiran?

143
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,159
If I tell you the truth now,

144
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
will you still let me stay by your side?

145
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Boss, what exactly
are you worried about?

146
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,919
Wasn't this all part of our plan?

147
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,759
Besides, Xia Nuan is Xia Li's daughter.

148
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,440
When dealing with her,

149
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,960
we settle two birds with one stone.

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,000
Cold!

151
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,080
Xia Nuan is unrelated to Xia Li.

152
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,279
It will be easier to handle.

153
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,600
After you get the stuff,

154
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,639
you'll just leave.

155
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,480
From then on, you two
go your separate ways.

156
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,879
Anyway, in the end,
Xia Nuan will find out the truth.

157
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,159
Ouch! Ouch!

158
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,559
Yes, Xia Nuan...

159
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,159
To her,

160
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,559
it is really unfair to her, Boss.

161
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,679
Instead of making her wary,

162
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,200
I'd rather just tell her the truth.

163
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,720
This might help a little.

164
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,720
Have you ever considered

165
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,200
it may worsen your relationship?

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,440
It's already bad.

167
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,600
Take a chance.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,480
Obviously, you can't bear to part.

169
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm just doing it for the plan.

170
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,320
Yes, for the plan.

171
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,559
Let's talk at 3 PM.

172
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,120
