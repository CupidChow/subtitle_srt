Don't tell me

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,280
you didn't take a million

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,000
to kill someone.

16
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,719
I just received a photo of you
with the gang leader in South Asia.

17
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,799
Put the phone down!

18
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,879
You were quite interesting.

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,799
I told you to kill Xia Nuan.

20
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,920
How did you end up as her husband?

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,000
You didn't say she
absolutely had to die, did you?

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,719
How much did Xia Nuan offer you?

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,280
I'll double it.

24
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,719
Go kill her now!

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,959
Double the price?

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,200
How about it?

27
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,359
Moreover,

28
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,519
I can give you whatever you want.

29
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,760
Besides, Nuan only has one kidney.

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,439
She can't satisfy you either.

31
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,319
Neither you nor double the price
interests me.

32
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,239
Do you believe it or not?

33
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,599
I'll go tell Xia Nuan right now.

34
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,640
So that you will get nothing.

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
Sure, go ahead.

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,319
Tell her you and your dad
paid me to off her.

37
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,280

Who told you to do this?

53
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
Ms. Xia, when you were not here,

54

they bullied me really hard!

Julie has something to do.

115
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,319
So I assist with the interview.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,160
They're all handsome guys.

117
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,920
Dressed so revealingly!

118
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
Wandering around
in the company every day,

119
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,800
can everyone work properly?

120
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,079
Eliminate!

121
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,079
I am a PhD from BJTU.

122
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,120
Are you single?

123
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,800
Yes.

124
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,240
You are already over 30.

125
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,120
Your family must be pushing you hard.

126
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,199
Do you have to start dating next?

127
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,160
If you date, do you have to get married?

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,079
If you get married,
do you have to have kids?

129
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,399
Do I have to take paternity leave
for you?

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,720
I don't need.

131
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
No need? Do you don't
care about your wife?

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,600
You work

133
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,199
and leave your wife alone with the baby.

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,920
Do you think

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,319
raising kids is easier than work?

136
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,079
Marrying you is the worst luck ever.

137
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,120
Eliminate!

138
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,839
Your previous job
was in the PR department at GM.

139
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:30,600
Yes.

140
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
I heard your boss likes

141
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,240
to find handsome but superficial guys

142
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,320
to discuss business.

143
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Using your looks to get ahead
is hard, right?

144
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,759
So what if it is?

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
What are you freaking out for?

146
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Can't you tell who's here with

147
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,120
their hidden schemes?

148
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
It's just you.

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,399
Don't be anxious.

150
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,960
I prepared some options for you.

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,360
They have both qualifications

152
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,240
and experience.

153
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,320
You can choose freely.

154
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,279
Try it.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,480
These are the people you chose?

156
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,399
They are not from this industry.

157
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,320
What about you?

158
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,320
How come you're down

159
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,200
to vibe with random one-time strangers?

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,120
You don't have any emotional foundation.

161
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,360
I never thought you were so casual.

162
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,279
What emotional foundation do I need?

163
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,360
As long as they help me
win back the company.

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,879
What about us?

165
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,639
Do we have any emotional foundation?

166
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,639
Troublemakers Ji Yantao
and his daughter brought in

167
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,879
have all been fired.

168
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,600
Now Zhongxia is seriously understaffed.

169
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,600
After all this hiring,

170
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,879
not a single useful one.

171
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,480
Stop smiling!

172
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,679
I was out of line bringing up

173
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,559
having kids yesterday.

174
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,080
But draw the line at work from now on.

175
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,360
Don't handle selection for me, go out.

176
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Zhong Xinyang!

177
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,960
Go out!

178
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,879
I got it!

179
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,039
I'll go help you continue
to find people.

180
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:30,480
Hey.

181
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,039

This one is okay.

182
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,559
Romeo.

183
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,600
(Zhong Xinyang's Assistant, Romeo)
Long time no see.

184
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,759
I thought you died in South Asia.

185
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,240
I really missed you.

186
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,120
Stop using the hometown dialect
around them.

187
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,840
Understood.

188
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,000
More handsome.

189
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,360
Boss, you really have skills.

190
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,480
Not only did you marry
the enemy's daughter,

191
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,000
but placed me into the company.

192
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,960
Truly impressive.

193
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
Let's talk business.

194
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,279
Alright.

195
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,759
You've already been to their house.

196
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,840
Any hints on the contract?

197
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,159
No.

198
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,159
It shouldn't be.

199
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,000
Logically, it should be
at the Xia family.

200
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,720
If you have time, take another look.

201
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:29,879
No.

202
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,879
Xia Nuan is very cautious.

203
00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:32,919
If we act rashly,

204
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,159
she will definitely alert.

205
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,399
I'll gain her trust
before taking action.

206
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,879
Okay, quite cunning.

207
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,320
By the way,

208
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,039
my friend from South Asia told me.

209
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,440
The gang leader there, Zha Meng,

210
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
has been inquiring about you.

211
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,879
You rescued Xia Nuan
and called the police.

212
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,039
Final payment is unsettled.

213
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,679
They'll cause trouble for you.

214
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,559
Got it.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
Hold on, the princess is calling.

216
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,320
I have to go now.

217
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,039
Take care.

218
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,279
I'm on the elevator now.
Meet me at the entrance.

219
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,960
I have arrived, Miss Xia Nuan.

220
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
You'll see me when you get out.

221
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,480
