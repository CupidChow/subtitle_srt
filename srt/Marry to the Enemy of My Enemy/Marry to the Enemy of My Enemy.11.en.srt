11
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,760
Xia Nuan, don't be in such a hurry
to pack your luggage.

12
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,000
Have a good meal.

13
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,599
Yizhe,

14
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,159
I have been busy with Yiran's
funeral arrangements.

15
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:14,159
I called you over today

16
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,719
because of the matter with your dad.

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,920
I need to stand up for you.

18
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:21,959
Ultimately,
it's because Yiran was irresponsible

19
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,920
that you ended up in a wheelchair.

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,359
However,

21
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,040
she also paid the price she deserved.

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,480
After that, you can move in,
and I'll take care of you.

23
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,719
Thank you, Uncle.

24
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,599
But I'm quite accustomed
to living with Nuan.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,239
Uncle,

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,879
there's no need to abduct him
to uphold justice.

27
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,359
How can this be called an abduction?

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,079
He has good intentions.

29
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,719
I think it's good
for Yizhe to live here.

30
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,159
Isn't it?

31
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's eat.

32
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,519
Your favorite fish.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,599
What's wrong?

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,080
Water. The sound of water.

35
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,240
Water.

36
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,840
W-What's happening here?

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,560
Are you okay?

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,360
What's wrong?

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Let's go.

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,639
Let's take a rest.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,599
Okay.

42
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,800
What's happening here?

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,919
If I'm not mistaken,

44
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
it's probably related to
a stress response.

45
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

46
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,080
During his childhood or teen years,

47
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,759
he encountered something
related to boiling water.

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,199
And this incident left him
with an indelible

49
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,560
shadow.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,800
So after hearing that sound,

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,560
he feels suffocated
and unable to breathe.

52
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,400
Boiling water?

53
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,560
Uncle, I'd go to the hospital
for a follow-up checkup later.

54
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,520
Can you take me there?

55
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,280
Sure.

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Are you okay?

57
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
Why fear boiling water sounds?

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,879
Xia Nuan,

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,319
I left a box of medicine with Dr. Zhao.

60
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,336
Can you get it for me?

61
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:30,919
But...

62
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,400
It's okay, let me be alone for a while.

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,639
Go ahead.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay, wait for me.

65
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,319
Okay.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,639
Hey, help me stall Xia Nuan later.

67
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,719
Right.

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Meng Yizhe is already suspicious
of my identity.

69
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,360
I need to quickly find the contract.

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,400
I have new clues here too.

71
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,199
Ji Yantao renovated
the Xia family study ten years ago.

72
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,159
The contract should be in the safe.

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,000
You'll believe me once you find it.

74
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,439
(I've already looked everywhere.)

76
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,079
(What have I overlooked?)

Watch every door closely!

Don't let anyone get away!

(Merger and Acquisition Agreement)

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,759
So this is what you wanted.

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,360
I...

85
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,519
I lied to you.

86
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,319
But I had no choice.

87
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,839
You owe me the truth.

88
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,759
What if it is not
what you anticipate seeing?

89
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
Even so, I still demand
to know the truth.

90
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:40,224
(Merger and Acquisition Agreement)

91
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,120
So you are Zhong Xuan,

92
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Zhou Tang's son
from Zhou Tang Pharmaceutical.

93
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
There were so many employees

94
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,279
at Zhou Tang Pharmaceutical.

95
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,199
How can you be sure
that I am Zhong Xuan?

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,920
Actually, I've suspected you for long.

97
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,879
When Mr. Zhong had the accident,

98
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,199
Zhong Xuan was 13.

99
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,240
Fifteen years later, he is 28.

100
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,920
Exactly the same as you.

101
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,480
It's common to obscure
names and identities.

102
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,439
Why did you only hide your name?

103
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,439
Actually,
my mom investigated you back then.

104
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,920
Your mom investigated me?

105
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,920
After that incident,

106
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,040
my mom thought
there was something suspicious.

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,639
So she sent people to investigate.

108
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,160
The reason you won't say

109
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,839
is because of this contract, right?

(Merger and Acquisition Agreement)

111
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,360
This transfer contract

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,839
was forced on my dad

113
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,560
by people your mom sent.

(Merger and Acquisition Agreement)

115
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,959
No.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,839
I won't sign it.

119
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,160
Ms. Xia, he seems to be dead.

120
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,279
Even if he's dead,
make sure the contract is signed.

121

(Merger and Acquisition Agreement)

122
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,639
Impossible.

123
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,279
If that's the case,

124
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,120
my mom couldn't spend money
to investigate...

125
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,200
But I personally heard "Ms. Xia".

126
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,080
It can't be wrong.

127
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:56,200
So you approached me for revenge.

128
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,240
It's not like that, Xia Nuan.

129
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,279
Right now, I only want the truth.

130
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,639
I want those

131
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,679
who spat and cursed at my dad

132
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
to finally apologize.

133
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,679
After my dad died,

134
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,120
those who were laid off

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,919
said my dad sold out the company
for money.

136
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,200
They smashed his memorial hall.

137
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
And they also wrote letters

138
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
cursing our entire family.

139
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,960
So you went abroad.

140
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,919
Yes.

141
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,600
They wanted to get back at my dad.

142
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,600
They wanted to wipe us out.

143
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,120
Since then,

144
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
I've been boxing while making money.

145
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,159
I hope one day I can return

146
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,919
to clear my dad's name.

147
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,320
Zhong Xinyang, let's work together.

148
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:08,519
I believe what you said.

149
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,519
I also believe

150
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,279
my mom is definitely not someone
who would go to any lengths.

151
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,320
So this truth
is equally important to me.

152
00:10:28,243 --> 00:10:28,800
(Merger and Acquisition Agreement)

153
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,720
So, do you believe now?

154
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,840
I want to know if this

155
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,679
can exonerate my dad's past injustice.

156
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,039
I'd like to ask you two first.

157
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,320
Are you two really married?

158
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,799
Of course, we are indeed a couple.

159
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,039
We are business partners.

160
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,039
Well.

161
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,200
I knew it.
