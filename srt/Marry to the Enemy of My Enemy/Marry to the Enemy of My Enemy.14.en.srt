My mom founded Zhongxia.

13
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,280
You guys almost bankrupted it before.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,159
And my mom brought it back to life.

15
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,280
My mom believed

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,599
I'd carry Zhongxia forward.

17
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,799
But you disagree.

18
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,280
Why don't we make a bet then?

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,959
Sure, bet on what?

20
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,840
This crisis was started by me.

21
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,640
If I'm unable to solve it,

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,120
I will resign and leave.

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,040
Okay.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,920
But if I solve it,

25
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,920
Uncle Zhou and the other board members,

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,680
please don't interfere
in the company's operations anymore.

27
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:37,280
Nuan, they just...

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,840
Uncle Zhou agreed.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,608
Let's bet.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
We'll bet with you.

31
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,120
I won't be intimidated

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,239
by a girl like you.

33
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,760
Deal.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Nuan.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,799
It's okay.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,239
There must be a way.

37
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm fine.

38
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,039
Nuan.

39
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,919
Yizhe, why are you here?

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,319
You're in trouble.
How can I sit and do nothing?

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,919
You have a way?

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,639
Aren't they arguing now

43
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,520
that I got hurt because of Nuan,

44
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,080
and Nuan turned to you
because I was disabled?

45
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,520
We can clarify to them

46
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,639
that your arranged marriage
was just a smokescreen

47
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,840
meant to protect me.

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,960
To protect you?

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,080
In fear I'd get hurt again.

50
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,759
Before the danger is eliminated,

51
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,719
She only...

52
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:35,319
Wait.

53
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,120
You mean, when all this is settled,

54
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
Xia Nuan will leave me

55
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,319
and then be with you again?

56
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,199
That's right.

57
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,800
Right now, this is the best plan.

58
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,439
Is this the best plan?

59
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,199
Or is it your best chance?

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,400
Nuan, leave him.

61
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
You still have a chance.

62
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,240
The reporters are here. Let's go.

63
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,520
Ms. Xia,

64
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,719
is the marriage contract online true?

65
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,039
Yes, we do have a contract marriage.

66
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,080
I'm very sorry to have lied to you.

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,199
Did you do that
because your fiancé was disabled

68
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,400
and you didn't want

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,639
to marry him anymore?

70
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,439
First, I'd like you all
to respect Yizhe.

71
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,479
(He can't stand up for now
due to the injury.)

72
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,360
(Please don't use)

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,879
(Zhongxia Group's Press Conference)
(harsh words to describe him.)

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,240
My

75
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,639
and Meng Yizhe's

76
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,560
marriage contract

77
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
was just a joke
from my mother back then.

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,479
All these years,

79
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,039
(she had treated him as her own son.)

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,039
(So she hoped we would become a family.)

81
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,479
So you had a contract marriage...

82
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,199
Because of me.

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,719
It was due to my selfishness.

84
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,840
They say that time and patience
melt the hardest heart.

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,360
But his heart

86
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,080
didn't melt
after I held it for a long time.

87
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,319
So I used the excuse
of being the heiress

88
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,039
needing a stable partner to have

89
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,719
a fake marriage with him.

90
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,159
A fake marriage?

91
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,560
But now I want to ask,

92
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,000
after being together for so long,

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,080
will you...?

94
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,840
There's no reason for a girl to propose.

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,360
Xia Nuan,

96
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,159
will you marry me?

97
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,840
I will.

98
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,479
Oh, my God.

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,600
Big news.

100
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,144
(Zhongxia Group's Press Conference)

101
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,439
Zhong Xuan,

102
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,959
you've hidden your identity well.

103
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,399
Good for you.

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,399
You still remember me.

105
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,560
You've fooled all of us around.

106
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,759
You've got something.

107
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,560
Much smarter than your dead dad.

108
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,639
But you're still too green
and can't keep calm.

109
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,160
Be sensible.

110
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,560
Keep your mouth and hands in check.

111
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,839
You probably don't want
to end up like your dad did

112
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,120
with your reputation ruined
and all lost, right?

113
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:33,480
What happened?

114
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,959
Ji Yantao discovered my identity.

115
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,680
It seems that what happened back then
is indeed related to him.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,639
Hello?

117
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,319
Ms. Xia, we found something.

118
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,728
Those accounts that leaked

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,920
are all marketing accounts
from Meng Media.

120
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,920
From the Meng family?

121
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,480
Yes.

Yizhe?

123
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,279
I didn't expect you
to be the most underestimated one.

124
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,199
In just a few hours, you were able
to mobilize so many resources

125
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,600
and stir up such big news.

126
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm flattered.

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,600
I just wonder if Nuan will hate me

128
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
in the end.

129
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,120
No need to worry about that.

130
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,720
Your years of bond with Nuan

131
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,439
won't be easily affected.

132
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,000
She was just

133
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,279
bewitched by that Zhong guy.

134
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,079
Have you heard of vixens?

135
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,639
Yes, I've heard of vixens.

136
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,560
But a male vixen?
It's the first time I've seen one.

137
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,759
You need to know.

138
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,600
Women always turn their desire
for a man's power and money

139
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
into what they call love.

140
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,240
Every woman will actively step

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,120
into the trap of power and money.

142
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,240
What you need to do is become stronger.

143
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,240
Mr. Ji, I'm not a hunter.

144
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
Nuan is even less of a prey.

145
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,240
Let me introduce someone to you.

146
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,319
Come in.

147
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,240
Yizhe, did you miss me?

148
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,000
Zhao Qing? You...

149
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,000
Yes.

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,160
This was also sent to you by me.

151
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,079
Yizhe?

152
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
Yizhe?

153
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,279
Everything is gone.

154
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,360
Hello, Yizhe. Have you moved out?

155
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,439
Nuan, let's meet up.

156
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,079
Yizhe, when did you buy this place?

157
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:56,879
After college graduation.

158
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Nuan,

159
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,079
before your mother passed away,
she left me a letter.

160
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,519
My mom?

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,759
When did she give it to you?

162
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,439
Uncle Xu from Tianhong
sent it to the hospital I was in.

163
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:15,800
I just received it.

164
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,759
It's my mom's handwriting.

165
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't believe my mom.

166
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,440
She took a joke so seriously...

167
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,279
It's not a joke,

168
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,480

169
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
