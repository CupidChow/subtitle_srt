(Message)

Nuan.

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
A cup of coffee, please.

00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,272
(Reference Room)

15
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,319
Nuan.

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Your phone.

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:43,640
Hello?

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,519
Hello, is this Miss Xia?

19
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,719
Hope you can talk Mr. Meng

20
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,959
into taking the surgery abroad.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,439
What surgery?

22
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,560
Mr. Zhong asked us to look into

23
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,760
Mr. Meng's condition.

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,192
We checked his medical records

25
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,599
and didn't find extensive

26
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,640
nerve damage in his leg.

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,719
Another surgery can get him

28
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,599
an 80% chance of full recovery.

29
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,719
Can you talk with him again?

30
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,319
Okay.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,968
Mr. Zhong suspects that Dr. Meng
is pretending to be lame,

32
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,960
so he asks me here.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,360
Zhao Qing, what do you mean?

34
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,120
Nuan, you got burned?

35
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,240
Come here. Let me see.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,800
Nuan.

37
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,719
(See you in the cafe at 3 PM.)

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Surprised?

39
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,159
Stop looking. She's not coming.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,199
Losers should know their place.

41
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,800
By being so persistent,

42
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,840
won't you lose face
as a Zhu Rong executive?

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,719
Save that to yourself.

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,800
You took Zhongxia

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,919
with your shady moves.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Don't think you can win her back

47
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,439
by using the same tricks.

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,520
We've still got plenty of chances.

49
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,159
But you're done.

50
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,039
Look.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,199
I'm the one here, not her.

52
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:37,919
Don't you get it?

53
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,728
(Reference Room)

54
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:45,599
(Delete)

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,199
Nuan.

56
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,919
Your phone.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,439
(The dizziness you mentioned)

58
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,720
(might be a complication
of having only one kidney.)

59
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,959
(You should probably
get a full-body checkup.)

60
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,160
Hungry?

61
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,839
Let's go eat.

62
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,680
Here you are.

63
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,040
Xia Nuan.

64
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,199
Are you sure you will

65
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,519
choose Meng Yizhe for Zhongxia?

66
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,920
What's that look?

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,224
Aren't you the same?

68
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,800
Treating me like a tool
to be used and exploited.

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,920
What do you mean by that?

70
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,000
When you asked me to marry you

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,120
and have kids

72
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,199
for your company,

73
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,839
weren't you using me as a tool too?

74
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,240
Yeah.

75
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,560
Because we had no more use
for each other,

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,040
we divorced.

77
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,240
Nuan.

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,920
It's dinner time.

79
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,600
I'm not hungry.

80
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,120
Pass on this.

81
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,759
A major restructuring in R&D.

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,519
Anyone here for over ten years,

83
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,519
no need to come tomorrow.

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,399
What to eat?

85
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,680
Hold on, scratch that notice.

86
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,240
See? I'm easy.

87
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,120
Come, eat.

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Nuan, remember

89
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,279
the first steak?

90
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,560
You cut it for me.

91
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,519
You could stand up.

92
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
Why don't you see the doctor?

93
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,519
Why?

94
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,519
The doctor called you?

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,600
What a busybody.

96
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,560
Why?

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,839
Dinner first.

98
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,519
Cold is bad for the stomach.

99
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,120
Because I don't want to.

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,800
It's an unbreakable bond

101
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,800
between you and me.

102
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,560
As long as I can't stand up,

103
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,959
you'll never truly get mad at me.

104
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,959
Never leave me.

105
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,279
You're insane.

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,920
Yeah, totally.

107
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,639
I want you so bad.

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
As long as I'm with you,

109
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,639
what does it even matter

110
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,040
that I can't stand.

111
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,839
Yizhe.

112
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,399
I'm begging you.

113
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,560
Go to the hospital.

114
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Unless

115
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,240
you'd move in and live with me.

116
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
Not now.

117
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,320
Wait for some time.

118
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:45,879
I will wait.

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,600
