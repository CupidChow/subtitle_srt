13
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,079
has long been by your side.

A glass of water, please.

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,640
Okay.

16
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,000
Everyone's here. Let's get started.

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,199
Wait a moment.

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,319
Mr. Ji.

19
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,000
That is your new spot.

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,919
What do you mean?

21
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,039
Everyone.

22
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,319
Zhu Rong acquired Zhongxia.

23
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,520
Zhongxia is now renamed
Zhu Rong Zhongxia.

24
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,039
The 51% stake originally held

25
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,759
by former Chairman Ji Yantao

26
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,560
was diluted to 18%
after the acquisition.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
Our new shareholder Zhu Rong

28
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,759
holds a 51% stake.

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,719
Lawyer Zhao, check it.

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,719
It's right.

31
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,919
Please.

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,656
The ownership has changed.

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,479
Zhu Rong Zhongxia
needs to pick a new chairman.

34
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,960
You just heard

35
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,080
that Zhu Rong owns 51% of the shares.

36
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,840
So from now on,

37
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,952
I'll be the new chairman.

38
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Any objections?

39
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Nope.

40
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
Objection here.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,919
We're ending our marriage.

42
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,960
Your 51% stake

43
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
is marital property.

44
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:58,520
It'll change once the marriage is over.

45
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,080
I propose to adjourn this meeting.

46
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,639
Xia Nuan.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
What's up? Why did you say that?

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,480
You know the reason better than I do.

49
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,079
Xia Nuan.

50
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,519
You know it?

51
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,519
If my brother

52
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,439
hadn't shown me your blood test results,

53
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,439
I would never know

54
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,160
we don't even have the same blood type.

55
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,360
My trip to South Asia,

56
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
to find you a kidney, was all a setup.

57
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,839
It's not like that.

58
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,720
Let me explain.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,879
If I hadn't gone South Asia,

60
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,360
my mom would still be here.

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Because of your scam,

62
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,199
I lost my only family.

63
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,240
And a kidney.

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,439
The messed-up part is

65
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,800
that I married the person
behind this scam.

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
I even fell in love with him.

67
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,959

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
You've decided to part.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240

00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,879

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720

Why do you owe so much?

145
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,240
Dad, did you forget

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,159
to build connections, I...

147
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,320
Still fooling me?

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,039
You think I don't know anything?

149
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,559
This mess is all a consequence
of your own profligacy,

150
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,559
and the gambling with your cronies.

151
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,720

154
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:12,240

155
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,679
we're just parasites.

156
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,639
I wanted to prove them wrong.

157
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,792
Prove that our Ji family
doesn't rely on anyone.

158
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,360
Please believe me, Dad.

159
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,720
I'll ask Assistant Su

160
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,600
to sell the antiques in the study.

161
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,224

162
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,200

00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,440
That's just a temporary fix.

166
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,776
You're way too deep in debt.

167
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,120
If we still had Zhongxia in our hands,

168
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,639
this amount of money was no big deal.

169
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,840
But now,

170
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,559
we're about to lose everything.

171
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:45,200
How could it be, Dad?

172
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,279
Why?

173
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Xia Nuan schemed us in that merger deal.

174
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,039
Before long,

175
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,879
she'll probably own the whole Zhongxia.

176
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,879

177
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,600

182
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,399
