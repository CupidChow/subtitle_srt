11

Don't move. Our boss wants to see you.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,439
If you don't want to die painfully,

13
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:03,240
come with me.

14
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,159
(Turn Off)
He came from so far away.

15
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,879
I should be the one visiting him.

16
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,319
Then let's go.

17
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,264
(Online, Offline)

18
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,120
Sorry, the phone you dialed
is turned off.

19
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Ms. Xia,

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,760
could he have left for something urgent?

21
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,359
He wouldn't leave without a word.

22
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,879
I've installed a GPS on your phone.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,319
As long as both our phones are on,

24
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,479
we can keep in touch.

25
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,879
(You can find me anytime.)

26
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,759
Besides, he can't just leave
without notice.

27
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:17,312
(Online, Offline)

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,759
Is the surveillance ready?

29
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,639
In minutes...

30
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,439
I'll go look myself.

31
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,960
Zhong Xinyang,

32
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,439
back then, you were just
a stray dog on the street.

33
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,360
(Zha Meng, Gang Leader in South Asia)
I took you in.

34
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,560
How dare you betray me!

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,919
Five million.

36
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,240
You made me lose five million.

37
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,319
Boss, this is not South Asia.

38
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:49,080
If you kill me, you won't escape.

39
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,159
How about you let me go back with you?

40
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,639
My life will still belong to you.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,960
Who wants your worthless life?

42
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:06,080
(Enter password)

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
Boss.

44
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:20,280
They have knives.

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,719
They are from South Asia.

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,599
You were in the elevator back then.

47
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,599
Luckily, you avoided them.

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,719
He didn't want me to be in danger,

49
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,159
so he willingly went with them.

50
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,759
They're too terrifying.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,879
Let's call the police.

52
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,680
No, we can't.

53
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,360
Zhong Xinyang is in their hands.

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,560
And they are desperadoes.

55
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,599
If we call the police,

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm afraid they will kill him.

57
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,280
Location information?

58
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,800
Xia Nuan, the heiress of Zhongxia Group.

59
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,000
Isn't she Miss Ji's older sister?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,840
No wonder you betrayed me.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,919
If we hand her life over to Miss Ji...

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,400
Buddies, our chance
to make a fortune is back.

63
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,080
Let's go.

64
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,279
Beat him.

65
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,040
None of you can leave.

66
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,120
Go get him!

67
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,399
He's right around here. Search!

68
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,519
You set me up?

69
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,680
Zhong Xinyang?

70
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,839
Zhong Xinyang? Zhong Xinyang?

71
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,360
Zhong Xinyang! Zhong Xinyang!

72
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,959

74
