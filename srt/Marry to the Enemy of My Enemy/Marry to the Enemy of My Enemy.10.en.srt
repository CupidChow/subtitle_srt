11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,719
That time,
we went to the amusement park.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
I remember you didn't dare
to play anything.

13
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,000
Right?

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,040
But in the end, I still played.

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,920
It's because I pulled you to play.

16
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,319
I pulled you to play.

17
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,239
I was also scared.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,840
But I just wanted to try it out.

19
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,239
As a result, I got lost.

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,159
Not only did you get lost,
but you also fell.

21
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:24,359
When did that happen?

22
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,079
I was really stupid as a kid.

23
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,640
Indeed!

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Was I that stupid?

25
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,239
Yes, you wouldn't allow me to say it.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,120
What is this? Is it an old photo?

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Come here.

28
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,680
Do you remember this?

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
I remember

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,239
it was half a year into Meng family,

31
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,760
I refused to call them Mom and Dad.

32
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,159
They were going to send me back.

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,599
You dragged me to get married.

34
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:48,599
You said marriage

35
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,120
would keep me from being sent back.

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,959
I even stole my mom's diamond ring.

37
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,200
But I lost it.

38
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,959
And I got beaten by her.

39
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,560
She even beat you?
Why didn't you tell me?

40
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,319
I have another album.

41
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,200
Wait for me.

42
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
Take it, I'll be back soon.

43
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,920
Okay.

44
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,479
How about it? Our wedding photo.

45
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,840
Is it nice?

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
Do you need my help?

47
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,240
No, I'll do it myself.

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,080
Yizhe!

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,719
Yizhe, what's going on?

50
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,840
Slow down.

51
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,000
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,039
You didn't even help.

53
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:44,400
I...

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,319
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

55
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,240
I can get it for you. Just let me know.

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Nuan,

57
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,319
I can't trouble you with everything.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,416
You don't need to be formal with me.

59
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,520
"Nice Guy".

61
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,360
Ignore him.

62
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,599
Hello, Dr. Zhao.

63
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,039
Can we consult tomorrow?

64
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,120
Yes.

65
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,639
Okay, I'll send you the address.

66
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,120
Dr. Zhao is currently

67
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,639
one of the top neurology experts
in the country,

68
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,039
specializing in leg nerves.

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,759
I asked her to take a look at Yizhe.

70
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,759
There's no problem.

71
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,439
Miss Xia, Mr. Zhong,

72
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
can we speak privately?

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,039
Dr. Zhao, please.

74
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
Zhong Xinyang,

75
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:30,759
please entertain Dr. Zhao.

76
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,080
I'll go find Yizhe first.

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,919
I've long heard that Ms. Xia,
daughter of Xia Li,

78
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,000
is as beautiful as a fairy.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,919
Seeing you today,
it turns out to be true.

80
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,680
Heard it? Who said it?

81
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,400
He.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,719
Have you known each other
for a long time?

83
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,639
No, we just met today.

84
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,919
Mr. Zhong suspects that Dr. Meng
is pretending to be lame,

85
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,080
so he asks for an assessment.

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Zhao Qing, what do you mean?

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,919
But I want to say,

88
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,840
Mr. Zhong, you're overthinking it.

89
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,759
From today's check,

90
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,280
Dr. Meng's leg recovery

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,360
doesn't look very promising.

92
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,319
If there's nothing else, I'll leave now.

93
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll see you out.

94
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,279
Zhong Xuan,

95
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,160
actually, Yizhe's leg can be treated.

96
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,879
Why didn't you say that earlier?

97
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,920
I saw he was so enjoying

98
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,639
how Xia Nuan was worried about him.

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,680
Besides, that's your family's business.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,839
So, I shouldn't say.

101
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,839
Okay, got it.

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,519
By the way, I have a doctor here.

103
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:52,639
If he wants to change his mind,

104
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,759
tell me. I'll send you the contact.

105
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Thanks.

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
I'll go. Bye-bye!

107
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,519
Bye-bye.

108
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,279
Zhong Xinyang, what do you mean by that?

109
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,519
What does Yizhe's leg
have to do with you?

110
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,480
How can you disregard his dignity

111
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,920
and just find any doctor?

112
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't you realize

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,279
this is hurting him all over again?

114
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,040
No, Xia Nuan.

115
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,399
Isn't that going too far?

116
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,680
Do you know that M-Meng Yizhe simply...?

117
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,519
Yizhe!

118
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,120
Are you okay, Yizhe?

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,959
I'm fine.

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,399
It's fine.

121
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,800
I am coming in.

122
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,639
Yizhe.

123
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,519
Yizhe.

124
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,920
Yizhe.

125
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,560
Are you okay? Yizhe?

126
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:04,680
Yizhe.

127
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,000
Yizhe.

128
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,639
Yizhe, don't be like this, Yizhe.

129
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't do that. You'll get hurt, Yizhe.

130
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,399
No matter what, you are my brother.

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,959
It's different.

132
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,839
I promised your mom
I would take care of you.

133
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,160
Nuan, trust me.

134
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:26,959
I can stand up.

135
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:27,680
Yizhe.

136
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,920
I can stand up!

137
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,040
No.

138
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,399
Yizhe, please.

139
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
Please, Yizhe.

140
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,279
No, Yizhe.

141
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,920
No, Yizhe.

142
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,720
Let's take it slow, alright?

143
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,879
Let's take it slow.

144
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,399
Nuan, don't leave me.

145
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,399
Don't leave me, alright?

146
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,920
Okay, I won't leave you.

147
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,959
Don't worry, Yizhe.

148
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,079
You are our family for life.

149
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,360
Xia Nuan and I will
take good care of you.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,079
Boss, small impatience
ruins great plans.

151
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:21,920
Calm down.

152
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,759
He can play the victim. You can too.

153
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,639
Let Xia Nuan see those injuries on you.

154
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,720
She must feel heartache.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,120
Only a fool would mimic him.

156
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,560
Zhong Xinyang,
what are you doing hiding inside?

157
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,839
Open the door, Zhong Xinyang.

158
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:39,160
I am coming in.

159
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,040
I-I will do it.

160
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,759
Turn around!

161
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,680
Turn around!

162
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,680

Sorry.

167
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,759
You've lied to me before.

168
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,759
You shouldn't have Meng Yizhe moved in

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,919
to punish me by making me jealous.

I am a family member
