4
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,170
The kids must be
almost there, right?

5
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,210
Give them a call.

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,609
Sure.

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,149
- Hey.
- Hey.

8
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,390
You were away from the office,
so you're not coming with Da Rim.

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,490
- Are you on your way there?
- I'm on my way.

10
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:50,719
How far out are you?

11
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,890
I won't be late.

12
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,590
Do I have to be there too
when I'm busy as is?

13
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,200
Aren't you curious about
how your brother's doing?

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,259
If you act like snobbish in-laws,

15
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,729
I'll be out of there.

16
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,200
Hang up and just get there.

17
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,870
What is it? Can't Cha Rim make it?

18
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,310
- She's almost there.
- Right.

19
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:09,969
What about Da Rim?

20
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,140
She said she had left the office
and was on her way.

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,510
- I see.
- Right.

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,010
I thought everyone was out.

23
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,379
Who could be home?

24
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,519
Right. Here you go.

25
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:54,290
Thank you. Got it.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
My gosh. Mother, Father!

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
What is it?

28
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,090
I forgot the clothes
I purchased for Soo Ji's family.

29
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,230
- What?
- Goodness me.

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,930
- What do we do?
- Oh, no.

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,939
Take this cab back home
and bring the clothes.

33
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,569
- Should I?
- You should.

34
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,039
Sir,

35
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,840
can you drive me back
to the dry cleaner's?

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,610
No, wait. I'll come with you.

37
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,949
Man Deuk won't be able to find them.

38
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,719
He couldn't remember
where he placed the ledger...

39
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,020
and lost his key.

40
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,689
- How can I trust him?
- What...

41
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,150
You should head inside.

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,520
I'll make it back
as quickly as possible.

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,090
But she's your son's mother-in-law.

44
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,960
It's only right for you
to head inside first.

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,699
We got here early anyway,

46
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,000
so have Mu Rim come meet you.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,469
Let's all head back together then.

48
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,569
What reason do we have
for going in there without you?

49
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,569
Exactly.

50

to go back and forth.

Fine.

Can you go back...

53
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,379
- to the dry cleaner's?
- Sure.

54
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,050
Mom, are you at Mu Rim's?

55
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,250
Cha Rim, where are you?

56

I'm in Cheonglyeom-dong.

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,919
Da Rim's nearly there as well.

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,560
Where in Cheonglyeom-dong are you?

59
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,719

60
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,659
Yes. Why do you ask?

64
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:13,699
Yes. Why?

65
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:16,669
I arrived at Mu Rim's place...

66
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:18,569
but realized
I had left the gifts at home,

67
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,770
so I'm heading back.

68
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:21,740
How can I go there empty-handed...

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,580
when it's my first time
visiting the place?

70
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,840
How would that make Mu Rim look?

71
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,050
Hey, I'm almost at the intersection.

72
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,310

can you turn up the volume?

74
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,919
Sure.

75
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,159
Did they not leave yet?

76
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,930
But it's dinnertime.

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,370
Bom, call me if someone comes.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,180
I see that Shin called.

79
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,509
Shin, did you call me?

80
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,050

Sir, we're sorry for making you
go back and forth.

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,399
- Here's an additional ten dollars.
- Thanks.

Hey. We got here at the same time.

- Right.
- I'm kind of out of sorts.

- Let's go.

What were you doing
in our empty house?

There's nothing to steal here,
so tell me!

94
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:17,040

Calm down, Da Rim. That...

98
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,579
This is breaking and entering.

99
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:24,850
I'll call the cops.

100

- Hey!

101
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,389
Hold on.

102

You know how my house was robbed.

103
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,120
It was 10 million dollars
and not 1,000 that was stolen.

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
The two thieves ran off,

105
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,860
but when one was arrested that day,

106
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,930
the accomplice buried the money
in Mount Euak.

107
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,500
Your grandparents and mom
stumbled upon it and dug it all up.

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,870
They couldn't tell
other members of the family...

109
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,199
and hid the money in the AC
at the dry cleaner's,

110
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,439
but I torched the place,

111
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,970
so three million dollars
burned to ashes.

112
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,170
They spent 800,000 dollars
on your eye surgery,

113

and the rest of the money
is underneath this mattress.

This money is my mom's,

115

your grandparents and mom...

116
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,550

is underneath this mattress.

121

that it's your mom's?

with a yellow rubber band.

127

Right. Also, the serial number...

128
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,139
on every single bill starts with AA.

How will you do that?

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,309
While my grandma, grandpa,

181
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,649
and mom were running
the dry cleaner's,

182
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,580
they always returned
even a dollar bill...

183
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,320
found in the customers' clothes.

184
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,149
Please. It was all because of me.

185
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,690
Please help me this once. Please!

186
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,090
Hey!

187
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,330
Your family are thieves.
How can I leave the money here?

188
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,730
What if they move the money?

189
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,029
I don't even know
if I can get in here again.

190
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,629
It was really hard for me to get in.

191
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,769
- Let go of me!
- No.

192
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,769
- No!
- Come on. What?

193
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,370
Who's that? Hey!

194
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,110
- The mattress! Hurry!
- Oh, my gosh.

195
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,320
Cover it.

196
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:58,919
What...

197
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,960
What are you doing here?

198
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,600
What are you guys doing
in your elders' room?

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,100
Can't you see what we're doing?

200
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Da Rim.

201
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,009
You're not interested in me.
Close the door.

202
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,909
Read the room.

203
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,809
She told you to close the door.

204
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,620
Hurry and close it.

205
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,519
Go ahead and close it!

206
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,019
You can't be doing this
in your grandma and grandpa's room.

207
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,620
Come on out!

208
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,909
Hey, Lee Da Rim. Mother called me.

209
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,409
She wants you to bring the gifts
for the in-laws now.

210
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,309
She's waiting.

211
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,750
Okay. You should leave.
I'll take care of it.

212
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,860
Tae Woong is waiting outside.
He wouldn't leave.

213
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,299
Please just leave today. Please.

214
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,769
I'll be sure to give it all back.
But not today.

215
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,269
I promise we won't move the money.

216
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,710
Hurry and come on out, will you?

217
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,049
I'll count to ten.

218
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,250
Tae Woong will never leave
like that.

219
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,149
There's no way
you can take the money today.

220
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:36,649
We have to leave the money here.

221
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,429
I'll let you take the money
whenever you want.

222
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,360
But not today. Please?

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,629
Darn it.

224
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,379
Why were you cuddling
in your grandparents' room?

225
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:00,710
How did you get in here?

226
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,350
He came in with me.

227
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,750
You let him go in
and out of your place?

228
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,450
Yes.

229
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,490
Hurry and bring this to your mother.
She's waiting.

230
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,789
Okay. I will.

231
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,129
I'll take care of it.
You should leave now.

232
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,460
What about the store?

233
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,399
Is it unattended now?

234
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:20,529
Hurry and get out.

235
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:23,029
- Tae Woong, will you please leave?
- Hey.

236
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,399
Seo Gang Ju, come on out.

237
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,139
Darn it.

238
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:32,279
Tae Woong, seriously...
I'll bring these to Mom!

239
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,490
Please come on in.

240
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,460
My gosh.

241
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,129
Awesome.

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,700
It's good that your room is
on the second floor, Mu Rim.

243
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,070
Am I not supposed to say this?

244
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,009
It's okay.

245
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,240
It would've been better
if it was on the third floor.

246
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,710
And it would be even better
if we moved out.

247
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:11,279
Mu Rim gave all the money gifts
he got at the wedding...

248
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,879
to Chairman Ji to pay back
the money for Da Rim's surgery.

249
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,919
Are you okay with that?

250
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,289
It was Soo Ji's idea.

251
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
Whatever he does is the right thing.

252
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,230
That's impressive.
You guys are the best.

253
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,830
You'll have a baby
as soon as possible, right?

254
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,240
It'll make Grandma and Grandpa
so happy. And Mom as well.

255
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,870
Am I giving you
too much pressure now?

256
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:39,840
I've never been a sister-in-law,
so it's difficult.

257
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,940
It's okay.

258
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,009
We're trying very hard now.

259
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,250
Oh, dear.

260
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,649
- It's hot in here.
- We're doing fine.

261
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:54,289
What are you doing?

262
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,370
Honestly,
I feel like I got a new son.

263
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,340
Thank you for saying that.

264
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:07,340
He's nice to Soo Ji.
That's all that matters.

265
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,970
What more can I ask for?

266
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,240
Of course. Everything is good
as long as they're happy.

267
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,279
By the way, Ms. Ko,

268
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,120
Ms. An, Mr. Lee.

269
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,090
You know Sergeant Lee
is really stubborn, right?

270
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:28,259
Mu Rim is not interested
in getting promoted.

271
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,200
His wife is a lieutenant,
so she's above him.

272
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,669
But he doesn't seem to care at all.

273
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,370
He has no ambition.

274
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,340
- What?
- Pardon?

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,240
Listen.

276
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,610
I'm trying to assign him a case
that can help him get promoted,

277
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,279
but he's hung up on a case
that's about 1,000 dollars.

278
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:49,779
Instead of a case
that's worth 1,000 dollars,

279
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,549
he should catch a big-time thief
who stole...

280
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,750
1 million dollars
or 10 million dollars.

281
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,220
Then he'll be promoted
to lieutenant like Soo Ji.

282
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:03,659
So I'd like you to talk to him
about it.

283
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,259
If he wants to catch a thief,
he should go for a big one.

284
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,470
Sure. He should catch
a big-time thief.

285
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,910
Of course, I'll talk to him.

286
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:19,680
I knew you would be understanding.

287
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Okay.

288
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,180
It's not that Mu Rim is incompetent.

289
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,549
If Mu Rim set his mind to it,

290
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,279
there would be no criminal
he couldn't catch.

291
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,349
You might not know that.

292
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,720
He even arrested his friend
from school.

293
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:34,630
He was sentenced
to 20 years in prison.

294
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,329
He's merciless...

295
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,730
when it comes to
punishing criminals.

296
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,670
If I, who is his mother-in-law,
stole a dollar bill,

297
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,569
he'd even send me to prison.

298
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,410
You have a great son.

299
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,880
He'll become a great person.

300
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,309
- Oh, dear.
- Gosh.

301
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,920
- Mother.
- Please have some tea.

302
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,420
- Are you all right?
- Have some tea.

303
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,349
Here. Drink some tea.

304
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,170
I can't believe these two.

305
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,789
However hard I think of it,
I can't keep my mom's money there.

306
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:42,259
I'm just taking my mom's money back.
Why are you being like this?

307
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,660
It's not your money.

308
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,230
Just because it's in your house
doesn't mean you can keep it.

309
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:49,329
They stole the money.

310
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,769
If they find out
that the money is gone,

311
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,039
they'll be shocked to death.

312
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,309
Okay? Hey!

313
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,809
If you take the money like this,
they'll pass away right away!

314
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:03,809
- Hey.
- They did it for my eyes.

315
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,019
I can't hold three funerals
in a row.

316
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:09,349
Hey, you. Listen.

317
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,160
Stop threatening me
by mentioning funerals.

318
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,160
I want to take what was stolen.

319
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,859
It's our money I want back.

320
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:20,059
Why should I take the fall
for making people die too?

321
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,700
Why do you scare me
with threats of death?

322
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,200
It's freaking me out.

323
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,339
I swear I won't keep it.

324
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,339
I won't take the cash
and disappear, okay?

325
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,339
How can I leave my family's money
in a houseful of thieves?

326
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,880
You're spending it even now.

327
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,109
The longer you have it,
the more you'll spend.

328
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,180
It's not an amount you can pay back.

329
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:42,390
I can get in whenever I want.

330
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,519
If you keep Cha Tae Woong occupied,

331
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:47,160
I'll let myself in,
take the money, and leave.

332
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,359
"Whenever you want?"
How can you go in at any time?

333
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,900
Director Seo. How did you get in?

334
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,900
How did you sneak in
when I didn't let you in?

335
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,869
Hand over the key.

336
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,599
Did you steal our house key?

337
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,109
Darn you.

338
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,910
Hey, wait.

339
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,049
Go home and keep Tae Woong busy.

340
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,420
Give it to me. Where is it?

341
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:14,019
Where is the key?

342
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,220
Darn it.

343
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,089
Stop fondling my butt.

344
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,460
It's not here. Where is it?

345
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,700
Stop groping. It's not your chest.

346
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,130
Hey. You.

347
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,200
Where did you hide it?

348
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,779
Hand it over. Give me my house key.

349
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,480
Darn you. Give it back.

350
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:52,819
Give it to me.

351
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,960
If I can't get it today,

352
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,230
then tomorrow,
or the day after, any day will do.

353
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,430
Why would I give you this key?

354
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,730
When 6.2 million of our money is
under a bed in there.

355
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,069
You took ten million
of my mom's money.

356
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,769
Can't I steal your stupid house key?

357
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,839
Why would I give this to you?

358
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,980
Darn it.

359
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,509
What...

360
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,779
were you going to tell your mom
if you returned the cash to her?

361
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,519
That's my business.

362
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,250
Do I have to tell a thief
my plans...

363
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,220
when the money was ours?

364
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,190
Okay.

365
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,859
- Now you say that?
- Fine.

366
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:34,400
I'll go and beg in person
to your mother.

367
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,900
So please just leave tonight.

368
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,769
I'll kneel before your mother
and ask for forgiveness.

369
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,609
- You will?
- I'm the guilty one.

370
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,839
My mom and grandparents
are innocent.

371
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,180
No. Don't do that.

372
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,710
You said it was your mother's money.

373
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:52,019
Before you return it to her,

374
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,279
since all this was my fault,

375
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,690
I'll explain what happened
and ask for forgiveness.

376
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,420
I won't go empty-handed.

377
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,690
Give me some time.

378
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,730
It will be really hard,

379
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,430
but I'll force myself
to beg Tae Woong...

380
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,029
to lend me the money.

381
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,730
I can pay him back
for the rest of my life.

382
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,240
Wait.

383
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,180
No one knows
what my mom might do to you.

384
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:24,309
I deserve to put up with
whatever she does to me.

385
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Bye.

386
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,490
I'm really sorry about this.

387
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,390
The key... Fine.

388
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,589
You deserve to have it
since we're a houseful of thieves.

389
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:39,930
You left without the cash.

390
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,730
I get it.

391
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
What...

392
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:49,140
She'll borrow 800,000 dollars
from Tae Woong...

393
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,539
and beg my mom for forgiveness?

394
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,079
She can't do that.

395
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,880
If Mom hears about the cash now,
she'll have a fit.

396
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,089
Hey... This isn't...

397
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,519
This isn't right.

398
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,730
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

399
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,410
Tae Woong. I need a loan.

400
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,680
I can do it. I can say it.

401
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,180
Tae Woong.
What's wrong with her eyes?

402
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:37,420
She feels guilty about something.

403
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,220
What did she do wrong?

404
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,759
Since she recovered her sight,

405
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,630
she lost all sense
of how to pick a good guy.

406
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,069
Why would that happen
when she can see after the surgery?

407
00:23:49,069 --> 00:23:50,130
Exactly.

408
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,789
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

409
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:11,890
- Hello.
- Hi, Bom.

410
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,319
- Hi.
- You're back.

411
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,690
- Oh, dear.
- We'll go upstairs, Tae Woong.

412
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,890
- Okay.
- Was everything okay?

413
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,430
- Let's go inside.
- Okay.

414
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,160
What happened to you, Da Rim?

415
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,859
We ended up visiting our in-laws...

416
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:26,160
for the first time empty-handed.

417
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,529
- Hey.
- Goodness.

418
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,730
Why...

419
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,440
The new clothes are
beside the couch.

420
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,809
You'll be the death of me.

421
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,140
You sat down
on the couch for a while...

422
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,710
and forgot all about them,
didn't you? As always!

423
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,609
Darn you.

424
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,549
Are you asleep?

425
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,650
I'm sorry, Mom.

426
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,650
What?

427
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,190
Do you feel ill?

428
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,660
Yes.

429
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,490
Let's see. Look at me.

430
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,160
Oh, dear. She has a fever, Mother.

431
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,930
- What?
- She's hot.

432
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,869
- Da Rim.
- Get out.

433
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:08,470
Are you not well, sweetie?

434
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,269
I had a feeling you'd fall ill.

435
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,180
It must be hard working all day long
after spending years at home.

436
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,519
- Do you feel dizzy?
- Why did you do it?

437
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,750
- Do what?
- Do what?

438
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,579
- What did we do?
- What do you mean?

439
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,990
Why did you do it?

440
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,660
- My gosh.
- What?

441
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:29,589
She's losing her voice.

442
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,190
She can barely talk.

443
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll run to the pharmacy
before it closes, Mother.

444
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,470
Okay. What if it's closed already?

445
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,829
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.

446
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:39,269
You're boiling hot. My gosh.

447
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,039
Lie back down.

448
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,009
- Lie down. Get some rest.
- Yes.

449
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,150
You poor thing.

450
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,960
Here. Hang this up too.

451
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,690
My back aches.

452
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:08,099
I feel so weary.

453
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,029
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,400
My legs don't feel like my own.

455
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:16,940
- Goodness.
- You shower first.

456
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,339
You go first.

457
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,380
- You shower first.
- What?

458
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,079
Get up right away!

459
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,220
You always fall asleep
while I'm in the shower.

460
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,450
You want to go straight to bed
because you're too tired.

461
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:33,289
Go to the bathroom
and brush your teeth.

462
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,259
Can't I brush them later?

463
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,359
You'll never get back up
once you lie down.

464
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,829
You can't be bothered
to get ready for bed then.

465
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:43,630
Get up now
and get yourself cleaned up.

466
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,269
- Oh, dear.
- Go.

467
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,200
- Gil Rye.
- What?

468
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,039
Don't go to sleep first.

469
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,279
I won't. I'm not like you.

470
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,880
Whenever you fall asleep first,
I get this weird idea.

471
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,549
What's that?

472
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:02,819
The idea that maybe you died.

473
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,920
Gil Rye. Don't die first.

474
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,630
I'm 90 years old,
and it wouldn't be surprising...

475
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,259
if I were to die suddenly.

476
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:12,700
I could die right now.

477
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,329
What would be weird about that?

478
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,470
Only you find it weird.

479
00:28:20,069 --> 00:28:21,140
What?

480
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,109
Please don't say things like that.

481
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,579
What? Not again.

482
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,450
It's disloyal of you to die first.

483
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:34,519
We stole the money for our kids
and should go to prison together.

484
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,349
Should I rot in prison alone?

485
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,660
Don't you worry. I won't die first.

486
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,029
We'll go to prison hand in hand.

487
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,430
Da Rim can see now.

488
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,970
That alone...

489
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,200
makes dying in prison worthwhile.

490
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,170
Likewise.

491
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:01,039
So go brush your teeth already.

492
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,250
We must stay healthy
to pay for stealing all that money.

493
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,420
We can't wish to skip that step
and go straight to the afterlife.

494
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:13,119
You're right.

495
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,859
Wait. I should take out
my hearing aid.

496
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:18,259
You should too.

497
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,900
I got it, Half-a-person.

498
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:48,589
What should I do, Mom...

499
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,809
Excuse me. Ma'am!

500
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,180
Ma'am.

501
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,880
(Cheonglyeom Pharmacy)

502
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,650
Gosh, thank you.
My daughter has a fever.

503
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,289
I'll go and beg in person
to your mother.

504
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,059
Darn, I can't allow that.

505
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,529
You've got to be kidding me.

506
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,730
What... I shouldn't do this.

507
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,880
Hey. Don't you have anything
to say to me?

508
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,380
Tae Woong.

509
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,049
Go on.

511
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,119
What do you have to say?

512
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,089
Eight...

513
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,630
Eight...

514
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,660
It's nothing.

515
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,500
I'm pretty sure
you have something to say.

516
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,170
You go first.

517
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,210
Don't you have something
to say to me too?

518
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,369
You first.

519
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,410
Has your fever subsided?

520
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,180
Gosh, the medicine worked wonders.
Don't you agree?

521
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,319
The fever's gone.

522
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,849
Mother, she isn't sick.

523
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,950
She invited Seo Gang Ju over...

524
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:00,089
and hugged him
in her grandparents' room.

525
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,329
That's why
she couldn't bring the gifts to you.

526
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,829
What? With that fool?

527
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,970
Is this true?

528
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,369
Yes.

529
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:14,700
But... I thought
you had a crush on Tae Woong.

530
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:18,539
That's right.
I have feelings for Tae Woong.

531
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,710
You like both men?

532
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,849
That's right.

533
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,279
One can love two people.

534
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,319
- Since when?
- Today!

535
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,819
What the...

536
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:33,490
How can you like the fool
who burned down our dry cleaner's?

537
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,329
Does he like you back?
I bet it's just another crush.

538
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:39,930
It's not.
That fool likes me a great deal.

539
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,670
You can never be with him.

540
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,869
Why not?

541
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,400
Why? Because he burned...

542
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,740
the three million dollars
that was in the AC?

543
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,309
Because he burned the money
Grandma, Grandpa, and you dug up?

544
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,039
Why are you looking at me like that?

545
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,680
It's nothing.

546
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:02,319
Hey. He's the one
who burned our dry cleaner's down.

547
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,819
We lost customers because of him...

548
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:05,519
and have been trying to recover
from it.

549
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,259
You were head over heels
for Tae Woong,

550
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:08,589
but then invited that fool over
so that you two could hug...

551
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:10,960
in your grandparents' room
while no one was home?

552
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,829
Where did you pick up
that kind of behavior?

553
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:16,329
Why not take him to your room?
Why did you do it in theirs?

554
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:18,670
What were you even thinking?

555
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,539
Tell me.

556
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,940
- You...
- Da Rim.

557
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,009
What is up with her?

558
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,579
Unbelievable.

559
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:33,819
My goodness.

560
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Hi.

561
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,029
Could we talk?

562
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:47,400
Talk?

563
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,029
We can talk here.

564
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:52,099
No,

565
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,099
we should talk outside.

566
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,889
How is this different
from talking inside the restaurant?

567
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,900
Hold on.
Would you like a steamed bun?

568
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,610
Is it just for me?
You should have some too.

569
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,480
The restaurant has been packed,

570
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,579
and you've been a tremendous help.

571
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,619
You'll earn a lot of money
with so many customers.

572
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,349
Ms. Lee.

573
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:47,460
I'm sorry to say this,

574
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,929
but I don't think
we should be doing this.

575
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,070
That night,

576
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,440
I meant it.

577
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:03,239
But you know
that I'm a single father...

578
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,269
who runs the barbecue place
with my mother-in-law.

579
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,880
We may have had that one moment,

580
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,480
but I can't betray them.

581
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,849
"Betray them?"

582
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,059
Sure.

583
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,329
I thought the same way.

584
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,440
Sorry? What was that?

585
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,170
That's also what I thought.

586
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
As in?

587
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,219
I hear you, okay?

588
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,179
As parents,

589
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,920
love is the kind of luxury
we can't enjoy.

590
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,619
Sure thing, Mr. Nam.

591
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,730
Be good to your mother-in-law
and raise Bom well.

592
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,280
Did you insist on talking
outside the restaurant...

593
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
because others can see us out here?

594
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,679
Were you worried
I might throw myself at you?

595
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:20,280
Did you think I'd come at you?

596
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,820
Did you think
I'd be clingy and senseless...

597
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,690
because that place is doing well
and you're earning a lot?

598
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:30,889
Is that not the case?

599
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:08,030
(Incoming call)

600
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,179
(Incoming call)

601
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,699
As if that's the only place
I can find work.

602
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,349
Hey.

603
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,449
You should get your own room.

604
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,789
I'm good.

605
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,150
Isn't it uncomfortable?

606
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,760
This isn't like you at all.

607
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:11,030
It's already too late,
so I'll stay here for the night.

608
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,230
I'll feel more at ease that way.

609
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,599
Unbelievable.

610
00:38:22,909 --> 00:38:24,369
(Cheonglyeom Villa)

611
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,409
- Goodness gracious!
- What?

612
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
For goodness' sake!

613
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,420
My gosh. What are you doing here?

614
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,090
Shouldn't you get ready for work?

615
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:38,550
- It's the weekend.
- What?

616
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,320
Why are you standing there
like that?

617
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,059
How's the bed? Do you like it?

618
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,559
Is it nice to sleep on a bed...

619
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,860
after spending your whole life
sleeping on the floor?

620
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,199
- What?
- Gosh, the bed? Yes, it's great.

621
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,570
Our backs don't hurt as much,
which is amazing.

622
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,769
Can't the elderly sleep in beds?

623
00:38:54,769 --> 00:38:55,869
- Exactly.
- Right.

624
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,750
It must've been exhausting
to hike down Mount Euak.

625
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,480
- What?
- What?

626
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,650
Oh, right.

627
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,719
She's talking about the day...

628
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,650
- we went to collect bracken.
- Exactly.

629
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:13,389
Don't go hiking up there again.

630
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,619
You're too old to go there
by yourselves.

631
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,159
We can buy bracken
for the memorial service.

632
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,329
It's not important enough
for you to hike up there.

633
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,800
I'm good. You can stop that.

634
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,369
Your calves are still knotted up.

635
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:29,739
You have no idea how upset I am.

636
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,480
What? Don't be ridiculous.

637
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,010
I barely have any muscles anyway.

638
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,809
I bet it was scary
in the woods that night.

639
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,719
You must've been startled.

640
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,650
I'll do right by you even more.

641
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,190
I'll care for you
until the day you die.

642
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:51,960
We'll soon die.
It won't be long now.

643
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,559
Are you calling that a joke?

644
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,099
Anyway, breakfast is ready.

645
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,010
- Hold on. That's fine.
- We'll make our own bed.

646
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,710
- That's right.
- We'll get that.

647
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,079
- You can leave now.
- Don't worry and go on.

648
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,780
- It's fine.
- You can leave the room.

649
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:28,260
Aren't your grandparents joining us?

650
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,199
Mom.

651
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,500
Yes?

652
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,269
How can I live with this guilt?

653
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:38,570
Wake Tae Woong up as well.

654
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,809
Someone like me
doesn't deserve to eat.

655
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,980
Do I even have the right to eat?

656
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,690
Da Rim, what about your breakfast?

657
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,489
What?

658
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,289
Leave her be.

659
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,360
She's determined to act out.

660
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,699
Don't give in to her.

661
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:02,000
Isn't she having breakfast?

662
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,199
Why isn't she eating?

663
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,369
Da Rim!

664
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,570
(New message)

665
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:24,349
I got my money.

666
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,630
- What money?
- I sold the house.

667
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:31,989
Your father bought it from me.

668
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,659
Our house? You sold it?

669
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:36,969
Why did Father buy it from you?

670
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,900
Detectives came by again...

671
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,170
in search of a safe.

672
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:42,809
I couldn't sell it to just anyone,

673
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:44,809
so he bought it from me
and promised to cover for me.

674
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:49,139
By the way,
have you been looking for my money?

675
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,219
Of course.

676
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,079
Mom.

677
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,250
Are you really divorced?

678
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,559
Yes.

679
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,719
I even sold the house to him.

680
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,590
I need to look for a place.

681
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:05,260
Staying in a hotel for long
is uncomfortable.

682
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,429
I'm going house-hunting today.

683
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,969
Do you want to come with me?

684
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,639
You'll live with me, right?

685
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:15,940
Would you rather live alone?

686
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,610
Mom, please.

687
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,710
We should look for a house together.

688
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,309
Hurry up and get dressed.

689
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,460
Of course, I found your money, Mom.

690
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:45,369
(Incoming call)

691
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,969
Tae Woong, you're getting a call.

692
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,239
My gosh.

693
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,079
Here.

694
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:57,610
Thanks.

695
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:02,789
I don't know that number.

696
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,260
(Ms. No Ae Ri has passed away.)

697
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:13,460
(Ms. No Ae Ri has passed away.)

698
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,539
Tae Woong.

699
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:36,119
Ms. No Ae Ri has passed away.

700
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,150
Since she has no family,

701
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,989
I will act as her proxy...

702
00:43:40,059 --> 00:43:43,260
and bury her remains
in her place of choice in Korea.

703
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,159
The burial will take place
at 3 p.m. today.

704
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,929
Ms. No didn't tell me
to inform you two of her death.

705
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,599
The location
is Yangdal Woodland Burial.

706
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:56,210
You visited her in the US,
so you should go.

707
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,710
Don't regret it later on in life.

708
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,449
I don't want to go.

709
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,750
Do you want me to go with you?

710
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,449
It'll be your final moment with her.

711
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,699
I told you not to come for a while.

712
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:31,639
My goodness.
Did you have drinks last night?

713
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,110
I didn't think you'd go out to eat
on a weekend,

714
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:37,409
which had me worried.

715
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,150
I set the table for you,
so please enjoy.

716
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,250
I'll get going.

717
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,159
Thank you.

718
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,340
Ms. No Ae Ri has passed away.

719
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,889
Where's Tae Woong?

720
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:24,329
Why do you ask?

721
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:25,889
When will he be back?

722
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,329
He'll be home late today.

723
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:28,800
He's visiting someone's grave.

724
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,300
Leave him alone today.

725
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,400
I'll do that, Mom.

726
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,369
Get some rest at home.

727
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:41,110
You had it rough because of me,

728
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,239
so let me do it.

729
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:45,610
Seriously?
Look at you being a good daughter.

730
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,079
I'm no such thing.

731
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,820
Thanks, Mom.

732
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,190
What has gotten into you today?

733
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,230
The tip of my nose feels icy cold.

734
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:02,460
It's a good thing
I went by with food.

735
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,829
He didn't say anything,
but he looked dreadful and pale.

736
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,900
I haven't seen Chairman Ji
in that state before.

737
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,110
They say that divorce is
the second most stressful event...

738
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,980
a human can experience
following the death of a loved one.

739
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,480
Not even Chairman Ji
can rise above it.

740
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,650
I doubt he will eat the food...

741
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,110
I laid out for him
if he's left alone like that.

742
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,119
He's no baby.

743
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:23,989
He shouldn't be alone.

744
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,219
He's a grown man.
He dug his own grave.

745
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,659
He only has himself to blame
for his lonely life.

746
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,530
He made the people around him leave.

747
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:33,400
He chased them away.

748
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:36,929
I see that you hate him a lot.

749
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:40,070
Da Rim, go take your medicine.

750
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:50,110
Hey.

751
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,210
Hae Ja.

752
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,119
Can you get me some kimchi?

753
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:56,949
I'm so tired
of the bland hotel food.

754
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:59,590
But Gang Ju took some recently.

755
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,119
What? He didn't bring me any.

756
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,829
Did he take it to his father?

757
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,400
I didn't see any at the house.

758
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,570
Where did it go?

759
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:13,239
Just give me some kimchi.

760
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:15,869
I have to stay at a hotel
for the time being.

761
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:17,909
I'm staying in Room 1001
of Do Hotel.

762
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,469
What's the room number?

763
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:20,840
Room 1001.

764
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,110
Da Rim, write this down.

765
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:26,420
Room 1001 of Do Hotel?

766
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,690
Hae Ja, bring me white kimchi
and young radish kimchi, okay?

767
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,519
Okay. I will.

768
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,690
White kimchi
and young radish kimchi. All right.

769
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:40,800
Bye, Bong Hee.

770
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,530
What's all the fuss about?

771
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:46,070
She's even asking for kimchi
to be delivered to her hotel room?

772
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,570
Unbelievable.

773
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:26,210
You're here early. Let's go up.

774

(The late No Ae Ri)

775
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,929
I knew you would come.

776
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:39,380
What was she like?

777
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,920
She was just unpredictable.

778
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:47,989
She was a poor soul.

779
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,260
She left a message before she died.

780
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,840
You take it.

781
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,039
You should take it.

782
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:04,510
You take it.

783
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:10,670
Goodbye. This is my last farewell.

784
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,480
I know you won't believe me,
but I'm dying soon.

785
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,179
This is my last request,
so please do me a favor.

786
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:19,949
Did you see the post I made
on your company bulletin board?

787
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:23,690
I got it in Tae Woong's hand,
but he refused to do it.

788
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,760
He doesn't take after me,
so he can't do such a thing.

789
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:29,659
That's why I posted it.

790
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,829
Tae Woong is honest
because he takes after you.

791
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,099
Please take care of him.

792
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,150
You two are lonely.

793
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,719
I wish you guys
would become a family.

794
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:05,559
I understand
that I can't be your family,

795
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:09,159
but Tae Woong and you are related
by blood,

796
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,300
so you can accept him
as your family.

797
00:52:30,090 --> 00:52:31,090
Get in.

798
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,929
The happiest and most shining moment
in my life...

799
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,800
was the three years
I spent with you.

800
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:48,769
Even though I was
a fake college student,

801
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:50,840
I had the college life I dreamed of,

802
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:53,639
and I was really happy
to be with a man...

803
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,179
who truly loved me.

804
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,449
I endured my whole life...

805
00:52:57,449 --> 00:52:58,849
with the memories
of the three years.

806
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,150
Goodbye.

807
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:05,190
I felt sorry for you, I loved you,

808
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,760
and I was happy with you.

809
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:16,570
The neighborhood has
a good infrastructure.

810
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,000
There's a big mall here...

811
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,940
- as you can see.
- Where is a department store then?

812
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:24,170
A department store? It's...

813
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,679
You can drive to a department store.

814
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:29,679
I don't want to drive there.
It should be close to my house.

kimchi tomorrow morning.

Let's just have
a simple dinner tonight, Gang Ju.

Da Rim couldn't go yesterday
because she was sick.

825
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,280
You should get it
and bring it to Ms. Yun.

826
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,849
I was really embarrassed yesterday.
I don't want to make you lose face.

827

"just die quietly," I said.

I told her not to do anything silly
pretending it was for my sake.

834
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:44,579

00:59:47,389 --> 00:59:50,429
It's no big deal, Da Rim.
Don't worry.

889
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:52,659
We're off to see some test results.

890
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:54,630
- Have breakfast and head to work.
- Okay.

891
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:58,130
What if I end up living to be 100?

892
00:59:58,329 --> 01:00:00,099
I hope you do, Mother.

893
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:02,300
- I'll drive you.
- What?

894
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,739
Mi Yeon, watch the store for us.

895
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:04,809
Don't worry.

896
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:06,309
Take care, Mom.

897
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:07,780
- Okay.
- Let's go.

898
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,010
- Let's go.
- See you.

899
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,010
Bye.

900
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,050
Hi.

901
01:00:45,949 --> 01:00:49,179
Room 1001. Breakfast, please.

902
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:50,719
Yes.

903
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,869
(Crosswalk)

904
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:17,150
Did you manage to get to work?

905
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:19,849
You looked like you'd faint.

906
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:25,050
Hey.

907
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:27,090
I'm on my way to see your mother.

908
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,829
What? To see my mom?

909
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:32,829
I realized
that the most dangerous thing...

910
01:01:32,829 --> 01:01:36,030
is the fact that the cash is
under my grandparents' bed.

911
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:37,800
I didn't see that.

912
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,739
Where are you right now?

913
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,869
There's no denying the crime...

914
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:45,510
once the money's found there.

915
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,440
It's undeniable proof...

916
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,440
that my grandparents
and mom are thieves.

917
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,679
I'll return the money...

918
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:53,349
and beg your mother for forgiveness.

919
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,750
I'll die if she kills me,

920
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,619
and I'll do anything she says.

921
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,349
As long as she stops...

922
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,590
my grandparents and mom
from going to prison,

923
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:05,659
I'll beg as hard as I can.

924
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,860
I'll say I started it all.

925
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,570
I'll explain it was my fault.

926
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,730
I'll kneel and beg her
to punish only me.

927
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,769
Where are you right now?
I'll come to you.

928
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:25,250
Gang Ju!

929
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,550
(Do Hotel)

930
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:30,690
Get the door, Gang Ju.

931
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,920
It's our breakfast.

932
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,960
Hey.

933
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,230
Where are you?

934
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:44,829
Bye.

935
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,260
(Iron Family)

936
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,760
What are you two up to?
Why are you here...

937
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,760
with a massive bag
as if you're packed to elope?

938
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,230
I'm sorry. It's all my fault, ma'am.

939
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,039
You should teach
your daughter better.

940
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,840
That money is proof that my mom
and grandparents are thieves.

941
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,269
What do you want to do?

942
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,369
- Mom!
- My goodness.

943
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,739
Talk. Everyone's here, so be honest.

944
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,610
Tell me why you went on your knees!
