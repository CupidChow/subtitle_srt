00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,310
(Episode 33)

2
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,359
Mom, are you asleep?

3
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,199
Why are you still up?

4
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:28,800
I couldn't sleep.

5
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,699
Why not?

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,670
Jiseung Group
took over Seogang Apparel,

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,539
so I'll be working there
starting tomorrow.

8
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,109
I'm now a regular employee.

9
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,810
- Really?
- Yes.

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,149
That's great news.

11
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,020
Gang Ju's the president,
Cha Rim's the design manager,

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,850
Tae Woong will help
promote our work...

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,119
as the managing director
of the head office,

14
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,159
and I'm the junior staffer.

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,829
- A junior staffer?
- Yes, that's me.

16
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,759
I see the excitement
is keeping you up.

17
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,799
I'm going to work hard...

18
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,270
so that I can be someone
as talented as Cha Rim...

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,439
who is valuable to the company.

20
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,409
I'll be the kind of employee
Gang Ju needs.

21
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,840
It'll be a huge burden for him
if I can't do my job right...

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,340
when I'm dating him.

23
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,780
I hear he'll be hiring
more employees.

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,750
Do you like him that much?

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,750
Mom.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,049
There isn't a man on this earth
who is as decent as him.

27
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,750
You know that yourself.

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,659
He's truly one of a kind.

29
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,959
You're right.

30
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,159
Absolutely.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,000
There isn't a man like him
in this world.

32
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,599
Right.

33
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:37,870
Get some sleep.
You have to be at work tomorrow.

34
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:39,640
Can I sleep here with you?

35
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,640
What? But the bed's too small.

36
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,280
- Hey.
- I'm sleeping with you tonight.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,540
- Okay?
- Sleep someplace with more space.

38
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,980
Let's sleep together.

39
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,450
- Mom.
- Aren't you too old for this?

40
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:57,590
Get up!

41
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,390
You all knew, didn't you?

42
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,459
Was it fun to make me
the only fool around here?

43
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,659
Was it entertaining?

44
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,730
Ko Bong Hee dug up...

45
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,530
my ten million dollars
from Mount Euak,

46
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,969
which you all knew!

47
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,409
How come I have no one on my side?

48
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,810
How could you all do this to me?

49
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,580
Please calm down and take a seat.

50
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:22,979
Have a seat.

51
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,990
How did you find out?

52
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,969

(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

56
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,439
I came to my mom's after getting
the rest in 50-dollar bills...

57
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,909
to make up
the entire ten million dollars.

58
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:28,909
It's over now.

59
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,120
Both our moms can sleep with ease.

60
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,789
I'll be in touch.

61
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,490
Why did you lie?

62
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,419
You told me not to lie,

63
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,729
but you lied for Ko Bong Hee's sake?

64
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,360
Bong Hee...

65
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:46,159
only spent 800,000 dollars...

66
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,370
on Ms. Lee's eye surgery.

67
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,000
It was Gang Ju...

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
who burned three million dollars.

69
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,370
You'll get your money back,

70
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,379
- so maybe you can generously...
- Shut it.

71
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,349
Why are you only taking her side?

72
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,580
She's a thief!

73
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,750
After losing that money,
my life fell apart.

74
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,050
We divorced,

75
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,189
I sold this house,

76
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:12,219
and Gang Ju
can't get enough of that girl.

77
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,689
Rather than being a son,

78
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,490
he's being the son
to that girl's family!

79
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,759
It's time you got over...

80
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,360
the money you hid
to evade paying taxes.

81
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,300
What?

82
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,600
Will you report it?

83
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,779
Does that scare you?

84
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,040
I get it.

85
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,180
Are you afraid I'll report
your girlfriend Ko Bong Hee?

86
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,279
That...

87
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,089
That's not it.

88
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,350
Just a moment ago,

89
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,589
Gang Ju promised to end things
with Ms. Lee...

90
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:47,529
and to cut ties with her family,

91
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:49,759
which is why I said nothing
at the police station.

92
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,959
But I get it now.

93
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,629
Why are so many people
only considerate of that thief?

94
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,839
I'll report her.

95
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:01,610
I'd have to be insane not to!

96
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:05,439
That family will lose everything
once I report the theft,

97
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,279
which will automatically end
Gang Ju's relationship with Ms. Lee.

98
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,420
I let it slide knowing that.

99
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:14,620
Even someone like me
has an ounce of compassion.

100
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Why do you always make me out
to be the bad one?

101
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,589
How dare you think you're
warmhearted and compassionate...

102
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,660
while making me out to be a monster
who only cares about money?

103
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,160
How could you even ask me
to generously let this go?

104
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,029
Reporting it...

105
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,939
will only be more of a loss to you,
that's why.

106
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,839
I'm not the same fool I used to be.

107
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,540
Was that a threat?

108
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:46,220
The second I wake up,

109
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,389
I'll go to the police
to report Ko Bong Hee.

110
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,860
You'll get back the money
in a few days...

111
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,730
once it is tied as evidence
to Oh Min Gi's crimes.

112
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,899
If the dry cleaner's is put
under investigation again,

113
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,699
there's no guarantee
when you'll get the money.

114
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,870
Because that will be a new case...

115
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,540
where Ko Bong Hee stole money
from Mount Euak.

116
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,509
That calls for a new trial
and a new investigation.

117
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,639
It'll be a while
before you get the money.

118
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,740
Are you okay with that?

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,750
How long will it take?

120
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:15,949
That's not all.

121
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,680
Four million dollars
from that money...

122
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,420
isn't included
in your inheritance money.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,920
It's what Gang Ju earned
to add later on.

124
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,490
If the police find out
that he earned it himself,

125
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,029
things will get complicated.

126
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,930
It's the same as him
giving you that money...

127
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,259
without reporting it.

128
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,629
You might be charged gift tax
on that four million dollars.

129
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,199
What? You mean I have
to pay more tax?

130
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,639
Why is everything so complicated?

131
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,910
Of course, it's complicated.

132
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,980
People who know all about this
are the ones holding the money.

133
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,509
Do you think the police
will let you easily take the money?

134
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,850
They hardly want you to have it...

135
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,920
since you gained it
by not paying any taxes.

136
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,389
Letting this slide
and not reporting Bong Hee...

137
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,129
is your best option.

138
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,689
As if.

139
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,230
Don't talk like you care about me.

140
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,839
You were in on this too,
weren't you?

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,509
Of course, you were.

142
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Gang Ju...

143
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,649
Just think of why
he had to go that far.

144
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,509
Since when were you two this close?

145
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,980
I'm so sorry.

146
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,550
My mother at the dry cleaner's...

147
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,689
desperately needed the money
to pay for Da Rim's eye surgery.

148
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:34,660
Forgive me.

149
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,430
I'll make it up to you
for the rest of my life.

150
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll move out if you tell me to...

151
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,069
and resign from the company
if that's what you want.

152
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,939
If you tell me to stay away
from my father,

153
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,240
I'll do that.

154
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,439
I'll do everything you say.

155
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,009
I'm no longer hung up
on your father.

156
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:57,449
He's all yours.

157
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:30,980
What if she calls the police?

158
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,190
She'll call her lawyer
at the crack of dawn...

159
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,490
to ask if I'm right or not.

160
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,789
She won't do anything
that'll lose her money.

161
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,200
Did you have to say...

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,070
you'd leave the company
and me to stop her?

163
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,470
I had to if it would help.

164
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,240
Shouldn't I give up
what I cherish...

165
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,649
to make her change her mind?

166
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,929
You left so many missed calls
so early in the morning.

167
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,639
Lawyer Kang.

168
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,970
The chairman's right
about everything.

169
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:36,710
Are you telling me
not to call the police, then?

170
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:38,039
No.

171
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,179
- No?
- Yes.

172
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,279
Get your money back from the police,

173
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,580
then make the report.

174
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,519
Depositing the money
into a bank account fast,

175
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,990
then making the report would work.

176
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,220
To investigate,

177
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,629
they'll try to seize your money
as evidence,

178
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,860
but if you've already deposited it
into an account,

179
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,929
they can't get the exact bills back.

180
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,169
Bills that you take to the bank...

181
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:03,129
are bound to be distributed
nationwide.

182
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,570
They'll become damaged,
which makes them useless as proof.

183
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,139
Okay.

184
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,809
Even so,

185
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,110
if Gang Ju doesn't keep his word,

186
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:13,980
I'll report them,
regardless of the money.

187
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:17,679
My son with the girl
whose family stole my money?

188
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,889
That can never happen.

189
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,929
Starting today,

190
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,840
we are an independent subsidiary
of Jiseung Group.

191
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,110
We'll work there now.
Both of us and Cha Rim too.

192
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,909
And Da Rim's now a regular employee.

193
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,509
I see.

194
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,379
I'm a junior staffer.
Junior Staffer Lee.

195
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,710
Are you?

196
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,620
Then how about for dinner today...

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,120
we grill some pork belly
and celebrate?

198
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,289
- Yes, Father.
- Let's do that.

199
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:02,129
No. I'm moving home today.

200
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,029
You're going back home?

201
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,360
Thank you for everything so far.

202
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,100
Why are you acting like
you'll never see us again?

203
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,110
Visit us often.

204
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:17,539
Okay.

205
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,779
We just warmed up to you,
and you're leaving?

206
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,820
I think I should spend time
with my mom.

207
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,690
Yes, that's a good idea.
You should be there for her.

208
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm okay with that
since we'll see each other at work.

209
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,720
Have some more food.

210
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,259
Thank you for the meal.

211
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,059
I'll get ready and head to work.

212
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,539
Gang Ju. Let's go to work together.

213
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,240
I'll take my stuff home first.

214
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,179
Okay.

215
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,090
Bong Hee. We'll head downstairs...

216
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,159
and open the dry cleaner's.

217
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,490
Okay, Mother, Father.

218
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,559
- I'll join you right away.
- Okay.

221
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,840
Are you packed?

222
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,710
I'll pack up myself if you haven't.

223
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,779
That's why I'm here.

224
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,250
Hello.

225
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,289
I don't see the thief woman.

226
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:26,740
Your son told us
he's moving back home.

227
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,440
Did you come for him?

228
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,980
This is no place for him.

229
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,139
What?

230
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,679
It's a den of thieves.

231
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,710
Gang Ju told us over breakfast...

232
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,379
that he'd return home for your sake.

233
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,820
It wasn't his decision.
I told him to come home.

234
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,049
He shouldn't be here.

235
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,360
Give me all my clothes.

236
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,759
I'm switching dry cleaners.
I want all my clothes back.

237
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,190
- What?
- What?

238
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:49,990
Didn't you get it?

239
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,159
Give me all the clothes you have
that are mine.

240
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,070
I'm switching dry cleaners.

241
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,399
Are you displeased with something?

242
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:00,269
You were a regular for a long time.

243
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,240
We washed and ironed your clothes
as best we could.

244
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,350
Tell us what the problem is,
and we'll do even better, ma'am.

245
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,850
I chose a local business
out of generosity,

246
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,019
but I'll go with an upscale place
that deals with luxury labels.

247
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,220
Do you think you people are
on my level?

248
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,090
You know you aren't, right?

249
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,929
- Ma'am.
- Come on, ma'am.

250
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't want us
to be involved anymore.

251
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,870
It was stupidly nonsensical
that Gang Ju even stayed here.

252
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,440
I want my stuff back.

253
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,269
Ma'am. We haven't washed some
of your clothes yet,

254
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:36,210
and some are in the machine.

255
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,379
Stop the machine and get them out.
Forget the dress shirts.

256
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,080
Take out whatever's in the machine.

257
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,649
I'll take them to an expert.

258
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,919
We washed your clothes separately...

259
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,179
from our other customers' clothes.

260
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,190
We did the best we could.

261
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,090
Were you not happy with that?

262
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,720
What didn't you like?

263
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,629
We'll do whatever you ask.

264
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,100
I don't want that.
I just want my clothes.

265
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,899
Get them
so I can leave with Gang Ju.

266
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,639
I'm sorry
if we didn't do a good job.

267
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,269
Will you stop it?

268
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,970
We'll do better from now on.

269
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,340
Throw out all my clothes then.

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,179
- What?
- Why?

271
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,210
Let's go.

272
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,480
- What can we do to appease you?
- Yes.

273
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,120
See what it's like to get cursed at
by complete strangers.

274
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,659
You'll end up like me too.

276
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,190

and get them to you safely.

- Yes.
- We will.

Don't you see I'm packed?

I know.

00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,529
She doesn't want Gang Ju
to date Da Rim...

305

in different leagues.

358
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,890
Yes. I'll tell you
as soon as it's done.

359
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,329
Did you check the supplier schedule?

360
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,990
Yes. I checked it.

361
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,200
I'll get things ready
so we can start production...

362
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,430
as soon as the sample is done.

363
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:37,670
Okay. Please make it quick.

364
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,940
I'll be out for a while.

365
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,680
I'll be outside for a moment too.

366
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,349
What's with those two?

367
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,619
Why does he look so stiff?

368
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:59,089
Is he nervous
because it's the first day?

369
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:07,529
Father got humiliated
by your mother...

370
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,029
while he was sleeping last night.

371
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,700
She found out everything.

372
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,240
You said you'd break up.

373
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,970
Are you all right?

374
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,809
I can see it on your face.

375
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,109
If I break up with Da Rim...

376
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:26,819
and cut ties with her family,

377
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,490
Mom won't report it.

378
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:30,190
Will you seriously break up
with her?

379
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,250
I have to.

380
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,529
You'll see her at work every day.
Are you going to be okay?

381
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,789
I have to.

382
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:41,329
She's so happy
that she's a full-time employee.

383
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,539
I'll go to the fabric room.

384
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,680
Are you sure you can break up?

385
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,250
If Da Rim's family finds out...

386
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,349
that my mom knows,

387
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,190
they won't be able to sleep
at night.

388
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,819
Don't let Da Rim and Cha Rim know.

389
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:09,089
It's between us.

390
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Okay.

391
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,869
I don't think
you can break up though.

392
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,829
Don't worry.

393
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,170
We can break up well.

394
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:21,910
"Well?"

395
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,640
How can things go well
when you break up?

396
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,609
I can do it.

397
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,490
We've finished analyzing
Baek Ji Yeon's ten million dollars.

398
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,359
If there are
no additional circumstances,

399
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,430
I think she'll get
her money back soon.

400
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,630
Darn it.

401
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,900
I don't want to give it back
just like that.

402
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,670
Can't you think of anything else?

403
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,569
No matter how hard I think,

404
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,069
I'm suspicious
of the four million dollars.

405
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,309
All right. You may leave.

406
00:23:58,309 --> 00:23:59,309
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:04,009
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

408
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,980
Hello, Chief.

409
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,089
Can I get my money back?

410
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,789
Please visit the station.

411
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,730
Let's go and have lunch,
Director Cha.

412
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:23,599
Just the two of us?

413
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,200
There's a place we need to go.

414
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,400
Hurry and get up.

415
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:29,839
Go ahead.

416
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,380
I'll see you later.

417
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:46,190
Shall we eat?

418
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not feeling well.

419
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,700
You haven't looked well all day.

420
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:53,460
Do you have an upset stomach?

421
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,670
Are you feeling nervous
because it's the first day?

422
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,099
Yes.

423
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,170
That's not good.
I'll get some porridge and medicine.

424
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,240
Wait.

425
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,240
It's okay. You should go have lunch.

426
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,339
I don't need medicine.

427
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:06,539
Just get some rest.

428
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,259
Should we let people at work know
that we're dating or not?

429
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,930
We can't hide it forever.

430
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,240
We're at work.

431
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,309
Let's not show that we're dating.

432
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:36,470
We're pros.

433
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,480
Maybe you are.

434
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,809
I've never been
in a serious relationship before.

435
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,150
Let's just focus on work
while we're at work, Director Cha.

436
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,349
Do you want to keep it a secret?

437
00:25:47,349 --> 00:25:48,750
Of course.

438
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,819
That's what you do at work.

439
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,690
But how can I hide it
when I like you?

440
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:56,589
How can I keep it a secret?

441
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:59,029
When you carry something heavy,
I want to help you.

442
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,730
When you work overtime,
I'll be there for you all night.

443
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,069
I can't treat you
like other female employees.

444
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:05,500
I want to buy you
more delicious things.

445
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,339
When I see you laugh
with other male employees,

446
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,440
I still feel nervous.

447
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,609
What do I do with my boss?

448
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,549
I have a lot to teach you.

449
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,720
You have to keep it a secret
no matter what, okay?

450
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,190
Where are you going?

451
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:26,690
Hey.

452
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,730
(Shinhyub Bank)

453
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,230
Is this where you wanted to come?

454
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,269
Yes.

455
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,400
I want to start saving money now.

456
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,670
Customer number three,
please come to Booth Two.

457
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

458
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,509
How may I help you?

459
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:50,250
I want to open a new account.

460
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,880
I think it'd be good to start
with a small amount to save money.

461
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,950
Would you like to take a look?

462
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,220
Thank you.

463
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:04,359
I'll set up this account.

464
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,329
Take a look, Tae Woong.

465
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,369
I'm going to invest
in the stock market...

466
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,069
and save money to build my savings
in a safe way.

467
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:14,839
Is this your way of caring for me?

468
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,339
No, this is me being the breadwinner
of the family.

469
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,849
As long as other issues
don't surface,

470
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,250
you'll receive your money next week.

471
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,349
Are you sure about that?

472
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,220
Yes.

473
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,029
I must ask about the other night.

474
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,329
You were here with your son.

475
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,529
What?

476
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,269
Oh, that?

477
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,400
What were you trying to show me...

478
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,339
that was on your phone?

479
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:51,809
It was nothing.

480
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:53,339
It was nothing,

481
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,910
but you came by the police station
that late at night?

482
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,180
Well...

483
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,720
That's...

484
00:28:02,019 --> 00:28:03,819
All sorts of people...

485
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,990
have been sending
hate messages via text...

486
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,859
and posting them online.

487
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:12,059
I was going to report them all...

488
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,700
and have them charged with slander.

489
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,200
Right. Is that so?

490
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,640
Show me those texts.
You can file a report.

491
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,009
I deleted them all
since they gave me a bad feeling.

492
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,539
I've been staying strong
since then...

493
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,750
and living with a generous heart
letting it go.

494
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,519
Right, I see.

495
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:34,980
Who knows?

496
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,990
I might come back
to officially file a report.

497
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,990
Against whom?

498
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:43,789
I'm still deliberating.

499
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,900
I've been wronged by several people.

500
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,069
That reminds me.

501
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,329
On the day my money was found,

502
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,269
I heard Ms. Ko at the dry cleaner's
was arrested.

503
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,509
I didn't know.

504
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,579
She was released
after the charges were dropped.

505
00:28:58,579 --> 00:28:59,809
Are you done...

506
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,609
investigating Ms. Ko Bong Hee?

507
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,420
Is it over?

508
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,019
As of now, yes.

509
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:11,650
I'll see you next week
when I get my money.

510
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,880
All right.
Here are the final samples.

511
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,319
What's your take?

512
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,750
Are they good to go?

513
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,259
It's an upgrade for sure.

514
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,960
It's lighter...

515
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,660
and easier to move in.

516
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,630
The stitches are denser too.

517
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,900
They're definitely better.

518
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,500
What do you think, Mr. Seo?
Is it pretty?

519
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,539
Yes, it is.

520
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,339
I love it.

521
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,569
We'll release this right away.

522
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,140
We have our samples,
and it's our first day here,

523
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,140
so let's grab some drinks.

524
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,440
- Sure.
- Good.

525
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:12,349
- It should just be us two.
- What?

526
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,650
Why? What is it?

527
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:20,660
Come on.

528
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,529
We should grab a drink too.

529
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:34,170
What? Sounds good.

530
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,579
Let's break up.

531
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:48,079
What was that?

532
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,519
Now that you like me back,

533
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,559
it's gotten boring.

534
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,130
It's no longer fun.

535
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,130
You bore me,

536
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,470
so let's break up.

537
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,670
Say that again
while looking into my eyes.

538
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,250
Let's end this.

539
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,619
That's out of the blue.

540
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:20,519
Is this a game of push and pull?

541
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,349
Do you want to play games
like others?

542
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,319
Fine, count me in.
This is hilarious.

543
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:27,960
Take this seriously.

544
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,460
You're saying we should break up
with love in your eyes.

545
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,269
A dog would bark at that.

546
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,339
What's this about all of a sudden?

547
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,740
Here.

548
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:49,450
Open up. Don't you want it?

549
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,119
Whatever. I'll have it instead.

550
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:54,019
Gosh, that's hot.

551
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,890
I should finish this off first.

552
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:06,960
I love you.

553
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:11,029
There's not even enough time
to shower each other with love,

554
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,769
so why bother
with a game of push and pull?

555
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:18,940
How can you be this cute?

556
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,579
I love you, Da Rim.

557
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,009
I love you too.

558
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:25,549
Here. Have some.

559
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,579
Open up.

560
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,390
Careful.

561
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,589
Isn't it good?

562
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,630
Why are you all out here?

563
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,470
Did you break up with her?

564
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,240
Yes.

565
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,309
Look at you lying blatantly.

566
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:53,039
You broke up this easily? As if.

567
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,609
Tae Woong, give him your room...

568
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,210
and move into another one or leave.

569
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,420
Why are you glaring at me?

570
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:17,569
What? What the...

571
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,200
You're going to sleep here
when there are other rooms?

572
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,339
This was my room,

573
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:25,240
and I can't sleep
peacefully elsewhere.

574
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,339
Right, of course. Sleep here.

575
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:30,380
No, I can sleep on the floor.

576
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,779
I don't want to be alone,
so don't leave.

577
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,250
Are you a baby?

578
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,920
All right.

579
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,819
There we go.

580
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,259
You take the bed.

581
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,460
Leave this to me.

582
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,990
What... Father?

583
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:46,259
Father?

584
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,450
Why are you getting home so late?

585
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,380
Did you stay up for me?

586
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,050
Goodness, Da Rim.

587
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,590
- I see you came home late.
- Right.

588
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,659
Grandma, Grandpa,
weren't you in bed?

589
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,320
It's late.

590
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,929
Were you with Gang Ju?

591
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,159
Yes.

592
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,699
Didn't he say anything?

593
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,429
Like what?

594
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,070
Well...

595
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:27,800
Oh, that.

596
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,610
Yes?

597
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,139
He said he loved me.

598
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,179
What?

599
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,840
That cheeky boy.

600
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:49,630
Father, what kind of man
breaks up with a girl...

601
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,659
just because he was told to?

602
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,800
Your mom is the type of person
to report to the police.

603
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,429
By dragging this out,

604
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,170
you'll only hurt Da Rim more.

605
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:03,739
What do I do then?

606
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,840
Don't go soft
and put your foot down firmly.

607
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,809
She'll be less hurt
if you end it cleanly.

608
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:13,449
Don't string her along
or give her any false hope.

609
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,050
That's something he could never do.

610
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,519
Gang Ju,
date her behind your mom's back.

611
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,059
All my life?

612
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,989
If she catches them,

613
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,960
she'll immediately file a report.

614
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,000
That's a risk you should be
willing to take...

615
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,369
if you choose this path.

616
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,829
That's not an option.

617
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,039
I'm sorry to say this,
but I'm against that too.

618
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,670
Are you going to let Ms. Ko
go to prison?

619
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,039
That's not what I'm suggesting.
Gosh, no.

620
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,880
This is driving me crazy.

621
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,179
What do we do?

622
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:52,760
A report was filed
regarding an illegal loan...

623
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,190
approved by Myungmoon Savings Bank.

624
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,960
According to the file,

625
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,889
you approved an illegal loan...

626
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,159
of three million dollars
to Love Capital.

627
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,500
You'll be taken to trial...

628
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,130
on charges of fraud
and document forgery,

629
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:05,639
so be ready.

630
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:10,840
Sung Hoon.

631
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,739
- You had it rough today.
- You had it rough today.

632
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:14,210
Shall we get going?

633
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,619
Why that...

634
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,090
Darn it!

635
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:27,559
Is there more to investigate?

636
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,989
No. See that tall guy?

637
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,730
- Kim Sung Hoon?
- Yes.

638
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,260
Kim Sung Hoon was fired
from the bank he worked at...

639
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,670
and was accused of fraud.

640
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:38,630
Baek Ji Yeon, you scum...

641
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,269
Sung Hoon,
we're still at the police station.

642
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:44,869
- Sung Hoon...
- You.

643
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,110
How can I not get worked up?

644
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,380
Because of that crazy Baek Ji Yeon,

645
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,550
I'll be going to prison for fraud...

646
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:56,489
if I can't settle with the bank.

647
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,619
- Why you...
- We're still at the police station.

648
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,119
We should get going for now.

649
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,840
I'll close the door.

650
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,840
(Vice President Kim Sung Hoon)

651
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,880
I don't even want to see that,
so get rid of it.

652
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,360
Is there no way...

653
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,119
you'll go back to work
at the savings bank?

654
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,389
You were the beacon of hope
who showed us...

655
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:38,130
that even loan sharks
could make a name for themselves.

656
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,599
Are you really losing your job
like this?

657
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,400
Why you...

658
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,730
If I'm to settle with the bank,

659
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,969
I need to get rid of Love Capital.

660
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,400
Collect the money we loaned out...

661
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,309
and put the office space
on the market.

662
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,610
Darn it.

663
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,409
Let's go to Baek Ji Yeon's house...

664
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,280
and teach her a lesson.

665
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,619
Exactly.
She can't treat us this way.

666
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,949
Forget it.
We'll go after something bigger.

667
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:04,289
It seems she'll soon get
her ten million dollars.

668
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,820
Are you suggesting we steal it?

669
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,619
Hey. We wouldn't be stealing it.

670
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:10,590
That's our money.

671
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:13,230
Before Gil Soon died,

672
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,730
he left that for us.

673
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:17,070
That ten million dollars...

674
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,300
will be deposited into
Myungmoon Savings Bank next week.

675
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:21,969
That small window of time
before it arrives at the bank...

676
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,239
will be our last chance.

677
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:24,869
We'll steal the money...

678
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,909
and leave on that day.

679
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,650
Contact the stowaway broker.

680
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,280
- Yes, Sung Hoon.
- Got it.

681
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,320
Why are we eating at the same place?

682
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,889
I meant what I said yesterday.

683
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:38,789
We're breaking up.

684
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:45,389
Sir, can we have a bottle of soju?

685
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:46,460
Sure.

686
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,429
Yes, we'll have it.

687
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,780
Da Rim, have you forgotten?

688
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,619
This is who I am.

689
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,849
I'm the jerk who never called you.

690
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,619
I said I'd call you after we slept
ten years ago,

691
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,619
but I didn't.

692
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:16,630
I've always been one
to lose interest quickly.

693
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,789
I'm that shallow.

694
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:18,929
The feelings I have
are like thin ice.

695
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,329
They shatter all too easily.

696
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,800
You should never allow yourself
to step foot on it.

697
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,099
What are you babbling on about?

698
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,369
You returned home...

699
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,369
only to find out
that your mom hates the idea of us.

700
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,780
Of course,
she's against our relationship.

701
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,710
You're nice and caring.
You're a good son.

702
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:39,820
You care deeply for your mom.

703
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,449
- Is that why?
- No.

704
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,019
How can a man
have a change of heart...

705
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,320
just because
his mom doesn't approve?

706
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,329
Even if she does,
I can do better to make up for it.

707
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:54,159
I get unhappy
whenever I look at you.

708
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
This isn't a healthy relationship.

709
00:40:02,909 --> 00:40:03,969
I will...

710
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,639
make you happy, okay?

711
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:18,449
Can we get another bottle?

712
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,070
Don't date someone like me
who can't protect his love...

713
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,739
and be with a better man.

714
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:37,570
Don't think twice
about a jerk like me.

715
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,079
There isn't a man in this world
who is as good as you.

716
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,849
Why are you this pretty?

717
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:55,690
Not everyone
can have a change of heart.

718
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:58,789
I won't let that happen.

719
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:00,500
That's up to me.

720
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,159
I'm the keeper of my own heart.

721
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,030
Exactly.

722
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,300
So why aren't you being true
to your feelings...

723
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,139
and talking nonsense instead?

724
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,909
Will you stop being so cute?

725
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,480
That's it.
Only say nice things like that...

726
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,309
instead of things you don't mean.

727
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,179
Drink up.

728
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,860
You cheeky boy. So adorable.

729
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,719
Cheers.

730
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,130
Did you end it with her?

731
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,539
Yes.

732
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,550
Don't drink next time.

733
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:57,389
It'll only soften you up.

734
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,590
Girls look prettier
when you're drunk.

735
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
Sure.

736
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,159
I know Da Rim,

737
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,789
and she won't give up...

738
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:07,929
if you approach the matter
like this.

739
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,929
You need to brace yourself...

740
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,099
and say harsh things.

741
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,170
Of course,
I said harsh things to her.

742
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,840
She wouldn't budge.

743
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,840
She must like you a great deal.

744
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,650
Cha Rim wouldn't have taken that.

745
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,920
Gang Ju, are you all right?

746
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:31,590
The more I try to break up with her,

747
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,260
the more I learn
how much she likes me.

748
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,389
That drives me crazy.

750
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,800
Welcome.

751
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:49,340

Hello.

754
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,619
Hey, Shin.

755
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,550
I'm here as a customer today,

756
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,150
so don't be mean.

757
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:15,969
I was going to pay for
your academy classes...

758
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:18,730
so that you could keep studying
to be a doctor,

759
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:21,539
but I don't think I'll be able to.

760
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:24,940
I'm sorry for being incompetent.

761
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,210
What now?

762
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,179
No parent should say
it's impossible...

763
00:43:29,909 --> 00:43:31,409
especially when your child
wants to study.

764
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,320
My mom must've tried her best
to make it happen for me,

765
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,420
but it probably didn't work out.

766
00:43:37,219 --> 00:43:38,989
It's not up to the child
to worry about that.

767
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:41,320
Think about what you want
in your life.

768
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,059
If you want to be a doctor,
only think about that.

769
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,829
It's not your job
to worry about how much it'll cost.

770
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,630
Enjoy.

771
00:43:53,269 --> 00:43:54,400
It's delicious, Mom.

772
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,610
Right? Eat up.

773
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,179
Mom, I'm off to the restroom.

774
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:02,539
Sure.

775
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,050
How can you call yourself his mom...

776
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,659
when you're easily giving up
like this?

777
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:17,789
Was stealing from your parents
the only way to pay for his classes?

778
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,360
You're right, Mr. Nam.

779
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,869
I'm a terrible mom.

780
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:32,139
He should've been born
to a parent like you.

781
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,250
I'm thinking about opening
another branch.

782
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,820
Can I expect your assistance?

783
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,059
Of course, sir.

784
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,760

Offer me a ten-dollar discount.

789
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:19,250
A discount at a restaurant?

790
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,820
You should pay the full price.

791
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,829
How can you be this clueless
about money?

792
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:26,159
Did you steal that money as well?

793
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,769
I find you most difficult.

It's definitely not here.

803

Are you sure of the date and time?

Yes.

and give us another call.

let's not break up ourselves.

00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,510
I set out some food. Eat a bit.

He works hard and makes good money.
What's the matter?

866
00:50:14,349 --> 00:50:17,019
So what if he's home
when his mind is elsewhere?

867
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,489
He won't listen to me.

868
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,590
What grown son listens to his mom?

869
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:24,590
One thing's for sure.
He has low standards for women.

870
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,960
He hasn't come around yet.

871
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,260
He's still clinging to
that darn girl.

872
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,300
Do you mean Da Rim?
Don't say that about her.

873
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:37,139
Da Rim's a decent girl.
Why are you so against her?

874
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:40,610
And kids these days don't break up
because their parents tell them to.

875
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,639
You don't know
what you're talking about.

876

That whole family's a mess.
They're horrible.

877
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,280
What's wrong with owning
a dry cleaner's?

878
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:50,690
They work hard and diligently
to earn their keep.

879
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,789
They don't cause anyone any harm.

00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,059
That's good enough.

881
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,989
Do they have to be as rich as you?

882
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:57,059
Let's be honest.

883
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,000
You were a loan shark's daughter.

884
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,929
Why do you care so much
about her family background?

885
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,300
Get your facts straight
before you talk like that.

886
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,969
The dry cleaning lady dug up...

887
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:09,869
my ten million dollars
from Mount Euak.

888
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:12,369
That's how she paid for
her daughter's eye surgery.

889
00:51:13,579 --> 00:51:15,139
- What?
- But then...

890
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,849
she got arrested
while spending the money.

891
00:51:16,849 --> 00:51:19,250
My sweet,
tenderhearted son Gang Ju...

892
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,480
spent every single cent...

893
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,389
of his hard-earned money
to make up for what they'd spent.

894
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:26,349
Then he buried it on Mount Euak.

895
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:28,320
That's how that woman got out.

896
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,329
That's impossible.

897
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,929
The money you said she gave you.

898
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:35,559
One grand in 50-dollar bills.

899
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,369
They were my stolen bills.

900
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:39,369
Their serial numbers
all began with AA.

901
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,239
She gave me the money she'd stolen?

902
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:53,480
Take a look. Read that for yourself.

903
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,150
(I came to my mom's after getting
the rest in 50-dollar bills.)

904
00:51:57,389 --> 00:51:59,989
I went to the police station
with that text to report them,

905
00:51:59,989 --> 00:52:02,760
but didn't because Gang Ju
promised to break up with her.

906
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,730
I want to burn their house down.

907
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,699
You have no idea how hard...

908
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,429
I'm clenching my teeth
just to hold back.

909
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,530
My goodness.

910
00:52:13,369 --> 00:52:14,599
What on earth...

911
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,309
The whole world badmouths me
not knowing the whole truth.

912
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:23,510
It's not fair. I feel so wronged.

913
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:26,179
It's driving me insane.

914
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,489
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

915
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:36,760
You're back?

916
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,929
Take your time.

917
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,500
My hands are shaking.

918
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,539
I can't seem to calm down.

919
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,969
Gi Dung. Sit over here.

920
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:55,739
Come here. Sit down.

921
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:57,809
Is something wrong?

922
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,119
I heard something unbelievable
just now.

923
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,550
Listen.

924
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,530
The ten million dollars.

925
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,260
Baek Ji Yeon's missing money.

926
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:16,000
Bong Hee stole it.

927
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,769
That's how
she paid for Da Rim's surgery.

928
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,199
But Gang Ju got the money back
and buried it.

929
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,710
That's how the police
released Bong Hee.

930
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,739
My goodness.

931
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,880
Do you get what I'm saying?

932
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:31,449
Wait. Why aren't you surprised?

933
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:32,909
Mother.

934
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,949
What you just said.

935
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,449
You can't tell anyone else.

936
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:41,420
Don't spread the word.

937
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,090
Gi Dung. Did you know about it?

938
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:47,230
I was there...

939
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,099
with Gang Ju
when he buried the cash.

940
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,900
I'm an accomplice.

941
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,070
What do you mean?

942
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,179
What are you saying?

943
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,739
It's all in the past.

944
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,579
The full ten million dollars
was put back,

945
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,150
and Ms. Baek will get it soon,
so what's the problem?

946
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:12,250
Da Rim's mother spent
just 800,000 dollars on the surgery.

947
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:13,960
Three million evaporated...

948
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,820
when Gang Ju
set the dry cleaner's on fire.

949
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,260
That's why he put it back himself.

950
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:19,690
To be honest,
if there had been no fire,

951
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,960
Ms. Ko would've sold
her apartment and store...

952
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,300
to replace the money.

953
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,469
Gi Dung.
Didn't you think at all about Bom?

954
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,469
If it gets out
that you helped a thief,

955
00:54:29,469 --> 00:54:31,909
you could go to prison too.
What then?

956
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:36,780
No. I should give them
a piece of my mind.

957
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,150
Mother.

958
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:40,250
- Unit 702. 3 items.
- Okay, 3 items.

959
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:42,349
I'll drop this off
and come right back.

960
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:44,489
Okay. The roads are slippery,
so drive carefully.

961
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:45,519
- Hey!
- What's wrong?

962
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,289
Did you get my son-in-law...

963
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:48,920
to help you bury the cash
in the mountain?

964
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,090
You dragged my son-in-law
into your theft?

965
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,900
Why did you drag
my son-in-law into it?

966
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,960
Let's go home, Mother.

967
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,199
What...

968
00:54:57,269 --> 00:54:59,769
What if things go wrong?
What about Bom then?

969
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,869
What about my restaurant?

970
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,239
Are you out of your mind?

971
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:05,309
If Gi Dung were to go to prison,

972
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,940
would you make up for everything?

973
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,579
Whether you stole the cash
or returned it,

974
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:10,780
you should've done it yourself.

975
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,079
Why did you involve Gi Dung?

976
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,480
Listen, Hae Ja.

977
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,519
- It's all our fault.
- Yes.

978
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:21,219
I'm sorry, Gi Dung. We're sorry.

979
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,329
You two knew about it as well?

980
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,260
That she stole the money?

981
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:28,599
Let's go. Come with me!

982
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,929
Ms. Baek told me everything.

983
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:35,099
She went to the police station
to report you all,

984
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,840
but Gang Ju talked her out of it.

985
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,340
What's wrong with your whole family?

986
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:43,980
Why are you people like this?

987
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,880
You shouldn't do this to us!

988
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,480
How could you?

989
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,190
Ms. Baek knows everything.

990
00:55:58,329 --> 00:55:59,489
What should we do?

991
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,500
What happens now, Bong Hee?

992
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:04,500
Stop asking Bong Hee.

993
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:07,170
We're the thieves.

994
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:11,840
We should go
and ask her for forgiveness.

995
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:15,340
Yes. Let's go. It is all our fault.

996
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,710
Yes.

997
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,780
Let's stop giving
Bong Hee a hard time.

998
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,820
Okay.

999
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,420
- My gosh. Gil Rye!
- Mother!

1000
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,920
- Are you all right?
- Mother.

1001
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,289
Gosh, Gil Rye. Are you okay?

1002
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,440
Mother. Take your medicine.

1003
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:42,369
Don't bother.

1004
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:45,269
I don't deserve medicine.

1005
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:47,840
Please take it.

1006
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:51,449
Mother, Father.

1007
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,179
Let's go tomorrow
and beg her together.

1008
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,789
Even if she doesn't forgive us,

1009
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,920
we should apologize for what we did.

1010
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,219
Okay.

1011
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,420
Father, please make sure
Mother takes the medicine.

1012
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,460
Okay.

1013
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:07,000
My goodness.

1014
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,530
It's all my fault.

1016
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:39,030
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

1017
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,670
Ms. Baek.

1018
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,170
I have something to tell you.

1019
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,010
I have nothing to hear.

1020
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:41,360
Wait, Da Rim.

1021
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,440
Ms. Baek,
please let me in this once.

1022
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,139
I did something horrible.

1023
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,579
(35 Buja-ro, 2 na-gil)

1024
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,670
How dare a thief ask to come in?

1025
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:35,179
I'm so sorry, Ms. Baek.

1026
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,079
And you're saying that now?

1027
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,679
Why couldn't you tell me sooner?

1028
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,949
I have no excuse for what I did.

1029
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:45,219
I'm so sorry, Ms. Baek.

1030
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,960
You heard it, right?
I know everything.

1031
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:50,460
But I didn't report you
because of Gang Ju.

1032
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:54,230
What do you want me to do?

1033
00:59:56,099 --> 00:59:58,869
I know there's no way
I can make it up to you.

1034
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:03,269
But I'll do as you say
whatever it is.

1035
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:06,570
You will?

1036
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:10,139
We're here.

1037
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,650
Then leave this neighborhood.

1038
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,250
Pardon?

1039
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,579
What? Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning?

1040
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,920
Cheonglyeom, my foot.

1041
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,659
How dare you use the name,
you thief?

1042
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,630
You got out of the police station
thanks to my son.

1043
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:27,099
Is that why you covered for me
when people threw persimmons?

1044
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,900
The mere sight of you makes me sick.

1045
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,869
I even thanked you
without knowing anything.

1046
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,039
How abominable it is.

1047
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:35,199
I'm sorry, Ms. Baek.

1048
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:38,369
- I'm really sorry.
- Just knock it off.

1049
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,610
I don't want to see
your face ever again.

1050
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,309
Shut down your store...

1051
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,079
and leave with your whole family
this instant.

1052
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,079
Go to a place where I can't see you.

1053
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,480
Make sure to stay out...

1054
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,579
of my sight.

1055
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:51,389
Yes, ma'am.

1056
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,449
I will do that.

1057
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:56,420
And...

1058
01:00:56,889 --> 01:00:58,530
your daughter regained her sight
with my money.

1059
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:00,329
Let her quit her job.

1060
01:01:03,699 --> 01:01:04,869
It's enough that she got
her sight back with my money.

1061
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:07,440
How dare she go after my son now?

1062
01:01:07,869 --> 01:01:10,869
Make sure to keep your daughter
out of my son's sight.

1063
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,610
Why aren't you saying anything?

1064
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:18,550
You said you'd do anything.

1065
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,880
Get rid of your daughter!

1066
01:01:21,849 --> 01:01:22,849
You don't want to?

1067
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,690
Can't you do that as her mom?

1068
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:31,530
Then why did you steal my money
in the first place?

1069
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,630
I'm so sorry, Ms. Baek.

1070
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:38,230
I'm to blame for everything.

1071
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,269
It's all my fault.

1072
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:47,809
Don't make me say more.

1073
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,550
I don't want to see you
in the same neighborhood.

1074
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:56,519
Take your whole family...

1075
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,889
and leave as soon as possible.

1076
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,090
Otherwise,

1077
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,090
I'll report you.

1078
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:07,960
Yes, ma'am.

1079
01:02:08,659 --> 01:02:09,800
We will.

1080
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,739
(Iron Family)

1081
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,880
Ms. Baek might report us.

1082
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,650
She wants us to leave. We have to.

1083
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,519
- Da Rim.
- We should move on.

1084
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:02,849
Let's not see each other again.

1085
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,289
The dashcam footage
has been retrieved.

1086
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:06,619
They got away with it like that?

1087
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:07,889
We will take the blame...

1088
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:10,989
for everything and leave.

1089
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:13,789
- Bong Hee.
- Please forgive us.
