00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,009
In the end,

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,580
the time came.

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,050
The end we dreaded...

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,559
greeted us.

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:22,059
What are you thinking?

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,699
I'm an accomplice.

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,260
I was in on it too.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,300
I'm with your family.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,899
I went to Mount Euak
with your grandparents.

11
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:31,969
There was a lot of digging
and burying.

12
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:34,340
I carried your grandma down
away from the police.

13
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,570
If you're guilty, I am too.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,439
If you're arrested, I should be too.

15
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:39,880
I should be punished too!

16
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,609
I'm a thief as well!

(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

18
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,280
Will you keep your mouth shut?

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,560
Why are they taking
Mr. Lee and Ms. An?

20
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:54,289
Why are they being taken away?

21
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,729
It's all right.

22
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,630
My goodness.

(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

24
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,269
In Sergeant Lee Mu Rim's car,

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,439
the daughter-in-law Ko Bong Hee...

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,280
fully confessed
to the grand larceny...

27
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,409
of the ten million dollars
which was dug up...

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,980
by Lee Man Deuk and An Gil Rye,

29
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,420
who are her parents-in-law.

30
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:24,890
Do you remember that?

31
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,189
Since Grandma and Grandpa...

32
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,189
committed theft twice
in the same place...

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,099
without remorse,

34
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
they will be sentenced to...

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,430
up to 15 years in jail
for habitual theft.

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,299
Even if they take their age
into consideration,

37
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,939
they will receive
a more severe sentence than yours.

38
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,670
Even more severe than me?

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,950
I will confiscate your phones.

40
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,219
Hand them over.

41
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,920
I am confiscating your phones.

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,290
Hand them over.

43
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,290
We have videos of you...

44
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,290
by the lockers
at the subway station.

45
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,859
One of Lee Mi Yeon
placing money inside a locker,

46
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:05,799
one of Lee Man Deuk
and An Gil Rye taking it out,

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,769
and one of the daughters...

48
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:09,830
going with the aunt
to check on the money.

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,939
I guess everyone
knew about the money.

50
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,270
That proves...

51
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,469
the entire family
colluded in a crime.

52
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,379
Gang Ju.

53
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,919
Hand over yours too.

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,979
- Me?
- You said you were an accomplice.

55
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,150
Oh, right.

56
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,719
Here you go. Take it.

57
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:32,990
We're off.

58
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,090
- Step aside.
- Let us through.

59
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,229
Move.

60
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,599
What now?

61
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,699
But the grandparents
are too old to go through this.

62
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,039
Mr. Lee, Ms. An!

63
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,069
Da Rim!

64
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:51,039
Mr. Lee, Ms. An!

65
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,509
Come on. This is just wrong.

66
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:56,979
This is wrong. They can't do that.

67
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,650
I'll also go.

68
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,150
If Gang Ju's an accomplice,
I'm one too.

69
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,520
Are you out of your mind?
What about Bom?

70
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,560
I buried the money
in the mountain as well.

71
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,360
Even Gang Ju turned himself in,
so...

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,129
What will happen to Bom
if you're found guilty?

73
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,229
What will you tell her...

74
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,830
if you end up as an ex-con?

75
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,900
Stay out of it, Gi Dung.

76
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,340
Bom, head inside with your dad.

77
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,939
Now!

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,389
Ji Yeon, it's bad.

79
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,789
A bunch of police came by...

80
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:39,719
to arrest Bong Hee
and her entire family.

81
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:41,129
Did you report them?

82
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,800
What do you mean? Who reported whom?

83
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,530
How could you be this cruel?

84
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,629
Wasn't them moving away
more than enough?

85
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,439
The police even arrested Gang Ju!

86
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,240
Who was arrested?

87
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,469
Why Gang Ju?

88
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,979
Why did they arrest Gang Ju?

89
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,310
What if Shin finds out?

90
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,550
He should be kept in the dark.

91
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,520
Could I be fired
from the company for this?

92
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,919
Da Rim, are you all right?

93
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,590
Detective.

94
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,230
This man isn't family...

95
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,360
and is innocent.

96
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
It's his family's money,

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
so let him go.

98
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,470
He's not an accomplice.

99
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,769
He's a harmless man...

100
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,209
who didn't cause any trouble.

101
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,649
Aren't you concerned
about your life?

102
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:36,709
Is this you giving up?

103
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,079
The recent breakup
did a number on him.

104
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,589
He's not in his right mind.

105
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,269
Gang Ju confessed
to being an accomplice...

106
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:56,399
and willingly got into
the police van, Lawyer Kang.

107
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,339
Will he be found guilty too?

108
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,670
(Lawyer Kang Han Mo)

109
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,439
What did he say
as he got into the van?

110
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,470
How should I know?

111
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,379
Ma'am, he won't be found guilty...

112
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,949
as long as he says
he buried the money...

113
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,550
at Mount Euak to make up...

114
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,550
for the lost ten million dollars.

115
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,550
However,

116
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,790
if he says it was
to free Ko Bong Hee,

117
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,350
he'll be held accountable...

118
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,290
for concealing evidence
and impeding a police investigation.

119
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,689
Even though it's his mother's money?

120
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,560
What do I do? That crazy brat!

121
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,870
Ma'am,
about the ten million dollars.

122
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,769
You might not get it tomorrow.

123
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,439
It was going to be returned
to you...

124
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,439
only because
Oh Min Gi's trial was over.

125
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,439
But now,

126
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,709
due to the theft
by the people at the dry cleaner's,

127
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,680
it might stay in police custody
as evidence.

128
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,079
I won't be getting
my money tomorrow?

129
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,079
(Love Capital)

130
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,180
No way.

131
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,819
It really was the dry cleaner's.

132
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,560
Every member of the family...

133
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,620
was hauled out in cuffs
along with Seo Gang Ju.

134
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:55,029
Unbelievable!

135
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,860
There's a good chance
we won't get the money tomorrow.

136
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,370
The money was obtained
without paying any tax,

137
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:05,670
so the police never wanted
to give it back to Baek Ji Yeon.

138
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,670
Now that a new case
will be opened...

139
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,509
The money is the evidence,

140
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,610
so it won't be given back to her
as scheduled.

141
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,180
Should we hold off
on what we planned?

142
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,290
Gang Ju is no help whatsoever.

143
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,240
Take your shoes off.

144
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,180
(Detention cells)

145
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,480
Goodness.

146
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:56,850
(Detention cells)

147
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,360
The three of you...

148
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,290
made criminals
out of your entire family.

149
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,230
You should've made a report...

150
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,259
as soon as you'd found the money.

151
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,529
I only meant to take enough
for the eye surgery,

152
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,430
but I lost all sense of reason
when I saw the load.

153
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,110
I should've taken
just 800,000 dollars.

154
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,209
Yes.

155
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,279
No. I shouldn't have taken
even that,

156
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,709
but I took everything.

157
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,279
That was so wrong of me.

158
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,279
We're in-laws, so I'll tell you
the truth about everything.

159
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:28,149
We're in-laws?

160
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,990
You're confessing
so willingly today.

161
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,220
I'm a thief,

162
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,529
so I deserve to go to prison.

163
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,600
Me too. I'm a thief,
so I deserve to die.

164
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,670
Punish just us three.

165
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,639
Let our kids go.

166
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,370
Ms. Yun.

167
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,610
The kids did nothing wrong.

168
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,310
Ms. Yun.

169
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,180
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear...

170
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,720
What now?

171
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,290
What a mess...

172
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,459
As soon as I knew...

173
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,490
my family was involved in
a case I was investigating,

174
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,199
I knew I should've reported it
and excused myself.

175
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,939
But I couldn't do so.

176
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:20,339
To help my family,

177
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,639
I hampered the investigation...

178
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,610
and destroyed evidence.

179
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,509
You punk.
Isn't Soo Ji your family too?

180
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,209
If you ever thought about her,

181
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,919
you shouldn't have done this.

182
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,120
Lieutenant Song's clueless.

183
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,759
I didn't tell her anything,

184
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,029
and I believe you kept her
out of all activities...

185
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,529
regarding this case.

186
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,360
I don't want her
to suffer over this.

187
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,539
You act like you care so much.

188
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,509
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,879
I accept any punishment.

190
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,490
(Washing, mending, dry cleaning)

191
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,059
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

192
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:21,830
I was told today was moving day,

193
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,529
but I can't reach my mom.

194
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Yes.

195
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,279
I took a million dollars
from under my parents' mattress...

196
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,320
and kept it
in a subway storage locker.

197
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,490
I stole money
that had already been stolen.

198
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,289
I'm a useless daughter.

199
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,120
Whatever the punishment...

200
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:48,360
I accept it willingly.

201
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:49,929
Yes.

202
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,529
I knew about the money
under the mattress and said nothing.

203
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,230
I never took...

204
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,700
or spent a single cent on myself.

205
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,940
All I did was work crazy hard...

206
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,539
to fill in what was missing
from the ten million.

207
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:05,940
This all happened...

208
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,250
because we needed money
for my eye surgery.

209
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,820
Grandma, Grandpa,
Mom, even my brother.

210
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,820
They did what they did
because of me.

211
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:17,519
They didn't spend anything
for themselves.

212
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,090
Only I spent the stolen money.

213
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,389
I can see now because of the surgery
we paid for with the cash.

214
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,830
Can't I take the penalty instead?

215
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,009
A few days ago,

216
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,210
your mother was going to show me
something on her phone.

217
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,480
What was that?

218
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,049
I'll show it to you.

219
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:44,419
Can I have my phone?

220
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:45,480
Give it to him.

221

(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

222
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,090
This is it.

223
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,789
Here you go.

224
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,389
I sent that to her,

225
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,600
then buried the cash on Mount Euak
instead of giving it to my mom.

226
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,230
I thought Ms. Ko would be released,

227
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,429
Mom would get her money back,

228
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,799
and that would be the end of it.

229
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,500
I thought
Da Rim and I would be happy...

230
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,110
once we'd handled
our families' issues.

231
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,779
Lee Da Rim?

232
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,509
Ms. Ko's youngest daughter?

233
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:14,980
Yes.

234
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,750
I've loved her
since before she regained her sight.

235
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,419
Then Da Rim
got the opportunity to see again.

236
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,019
If she hadn't gotten
the surgery then,

237
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,090
she'd have never regained her sight.

238
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,860
I'm the guilty one.

239
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,529
I'm the one
who got them in this mess.

240
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,269
Please show them leniency.

241
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,740
It's my mother's money,
and I'm pleading for them.

242
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,909
Your mother...

243
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,679
should plead for them
since it is her money.

244
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,679
You don't have the right.

245
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,690
What can I do
to lessen their punishment?

246
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,289
Tell me what to do and I'll do it.

247
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:02,389
Don't you get that...

248
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,659
you're being questioned
for assisting criminals...

249
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,929
and hiding evidence?

250
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,100
Where's the chief?
I'm here to see her.

251
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,940
Mom.

252
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,840
Who's your mom?

253
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,809
What brings you here?

254
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,580
The people who had anything to do
with my money.

255
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,379
I want them all
to be punished severely.

256
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,720
Mom.

257
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,990
Who's your mom?

258
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,190
Didn't you come here to settle?

259
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,259
What?

260
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,529
Why should I settle?

261
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,830
Punish the people
at the dry cleaner's severely.

262
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:39,230
And that fool. Don't let him off.

263
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,500
Grill him properly
and punish him too.

264
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,899
He's with them. He's not my son.

265
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,970
I won't settle.

266
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,799
Speed up the investigation
and return my money.

267
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:49,240
Must you be like this?

268
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,240
We're reopening the theft case,

269
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,080
so you won't get the money tomorrow.

270
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,379
I know that, so don't waste time
trying to settle...

271
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,879
and give me my money
as soon as possible, okay?

272
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,620
Mom.

273
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,620
I might go to prison.

274
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,220
Will you visit me?

275
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,360
You darn fool.

276
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,929
You're an accomplice?

277
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:14,730
- You're an accomplice?
- Ma'am.

278
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,330
- You're an accomplice?
- Keep this up...

279
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,500
and I'll detain you for assault.

280
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,539
We apologize.

281
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,610
Mom.

282
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,639
I won't break up with Da Rim.

283
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,309
I take that back.

284
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
What?

285
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,580
Why should we break up...

286
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,419
when her whole family got arrested?

287
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,990
They all said
they'd cooperate with the police...

288
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,519
and pay the price.

289
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,590
I went along with your demand...

290
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,419
because you threatened
to report them.

291
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:43,360
Your threats are powerless now.

292
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:45,629
Yes. Chief.

293
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,830
Lock him up for hiding evidence.

294
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,970
You're out of your mind!

295
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,409
Is it a crime to love Da Rim?

296
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,840
I found someone I love
as much as I love you.

297
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,750
I love her as much as I love you.

298
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,149
As much as you, Mom.

299
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,360
What am I to do
if you hate her so much?

300
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,590
Don't do that!

301
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,929
Don't make those sad eyes!

302
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,730
I feel way worse than you!

303
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,799

Let's go, Ms. Baek.

305
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,539
Please hurry
so she can collect her money.

306
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,740
We won't settle with anyone.

307
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,710

The police came
and took the whole family.

311
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,629

as they were packing to move.

When he buried the money
on Mount Euak,

319
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,590
I helped him.

320
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,559
What are you doing here?

321
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,500

Ms. Lee's in an interrogation room.

325
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:43,750
I'm not looking for her.

326
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,850
If you're an accomplice, so am I.

327
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,490
If I committed a crime,
I must pay for it.

328

We hampered an investigation
and buried cash in secret.

329

any of us mentioned you.

Where's the interrogation room?

333
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,370
You must be hungry.

334
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,409
Thanks for the food.

335
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,419
I'm not hungry.

336

You can starve, then.

337
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:23,419
Don't eat.

that if Grandpa, Grandma,

342
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,220
and Mom moved,
I'd like to live with them.

343
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,259
People in the neighborhood say...

344
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:03,730
your grandma and grandpa
should go to jail.

345
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,329
I know.

can they?

And Mu Rim.

351

They need an attorney
even when they confess.

352

I've found one for them.

353
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,339
I'm sure he will help them
with a good guideline.

What are you waiting for? Let's go.

365
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,049
Okay.

366
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,769
I'll drive, Father.

367
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,539
No, I'll do that.
You're not in your right mind now.

368
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,069
I'm in my right mind.

369
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,269
When I saw the people
at the dry cleaner's get arrested,

370
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,779
I came to my senses.

371
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,450
What did the police say?

372
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,720
We were released
as it was a voluntary accompaniment.

373
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,990
We were told to cooperate
with the investigation.

374
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,960
What about Bong Hee
and her parents-in-law?

375
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,430
They will stand trial under arrest.

376
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,829
I'm worried about the elders.

377
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,200
I wish your mom would settle.

378
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,500
She won't because she hates me.

379
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:28,970
Mom hates it that I care about
Da Rim and her family.

380
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,009
I don't know what to do.

381
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:41,079
Let's go.

382
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,150
Okay.

383
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,289
Do you really have to go this far?

384
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,230
Are you happy now?

385
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,369
I can't let the thieves
get away with it.

386
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:57,400
Mom. Why are you being like this?

387
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,539
Are you sure you're doing this
out of a sense of duty as a cop?

388
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,670
Do you think I don't know...

389
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,640
that you're being like this
to split me and Mu Rim up?

390
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,910
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

391
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,950
Hey.

392
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,819
You know how much
I cared for Sergeant Lee.

393
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,990
He's the one I gave credit to...

394
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,390
for being a righteous cop.

395
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,130
And look what has happened.

396
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,960
Righteousness?

397
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,369
What's righteous about him?

398
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,230
You...

399
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,440
Don't you even care about
the feeling of betrayal I'm having?

400
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,480
Mu Rim didn't tell you anything,
did he?

401
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,049
He didn't even offer
any excuses, right?

402
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,650
That's because he doesn't trust you.

403
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,450
You're the only one
that's hung up on that jerk!

404
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,519
It's not that he doesn't trust me.

405
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,190
He's just too embarrassed
to tell me.

406
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,029
A cold-blooded person like you
wouldn't understand him.

407
00:20:58,529 --> 00:20:59,799
Don't blame Mu Rim.

408
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,799
If you committed a crime,

409
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,700
I would cover it up like Mu Rim did.

410
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,140
I would try to protect you.

411
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,609
How can you blame him
for doing that as her son?

412
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,069
Don't be ridiculous.

413
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:12,410
We are police officers.

414
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:16,710
It's over between you and Mu Rim.

415
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,480
No.

416
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,119
It will be over between us
before that happens.

417
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,819
I will never break up with Mu Rim.

418
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,599
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

419
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:41,410
It feels strange to be home
without Mom, Grandma, and Grandpa.

420
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:43,769
I don't think I can sleep.

421
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,640
I'll move in.

422
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:48,809
Here?

423
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,410
Yes.

424
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,119
I'll move in too.

425
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,650
Mu Rim will have to stand trial,

426
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,049
so he won't come home.

427
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,119
I don't know
what their sentences will be,

428
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,029
but I'll stay here with you guys
until they're out.

429
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:05,930
Then we're not moving?

430
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,029
It's like the three of them
are moving to prison.

431
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,470
It's no different from moving.

432
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:16,869
The landlord heard about us
and refused to accept us.

433
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,079
They called off the contract.

434
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,039
They don't want
to rent out a place to thieves.

435
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,509
Though they're arrested,

436
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,750
Ms. Baek wouldn't still
want to see us.

437
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,990
We should move.

438
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,819
You broke up with him.

439
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,289
It's over with Seo Gang Ju.

440
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:37,859
I can't let you and your auntie
stay so far away.

441
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,700
Stay in Cheonglyeom-dong
with me, okay?

442
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,400
- Let me take care of it.
- Can I...

443
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,470
live here too?

444
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,079
Aren't you going to the academy?

445
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,940
I can study to be a doctor later.

446
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,750
Shin, you don't have to be
like that.

447
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,380
You want to study.

448
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,519
I will help you.

449
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,849
No. I don't want to study.

450
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,460
Why are you lying?

451
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:07,960
You're saying
you don't want to study...

452
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,960
because of my circumstances.

453
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,299
Shin.

454
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:15,900
If we work together,
we can pay for your academy.

455
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,069
You can live here
and go to the academy.

456
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:20,470
It's not that
he doesn't want to study.

457
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,539
This is the least
we should do for him. Okay?

458
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:26,339
She's right.

459
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:29,250
Then I'll move in here...

460
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,880
and live with Mom.

461
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,720
What about the store?
What do we do about it?

462
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:43,329
The rumors will go around.

463
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,500
I bet the word already went out.

464
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,299
People will find out...

465
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,970
that we stole ten million dollars.

466
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,569
We should shut it down for now.

467
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,740
There won't be
many customers anyway.

468
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,140
They would be afraid
to leave their clothes with us.

469
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:10,690
Mom, are you sleeping?

470
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,890
Don't talk to me.

471
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,490
I'm your son.

472
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,029
If you weren't my mom,
who else would be?

473
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,569
I'll be your son forever.

474
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,410
Get lost.

475
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,380
(Equality, Justice)

476
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,750
I'll announce the sentence
for the theft case...

477
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,950
involving ten million
from Mount Euak.

478
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,049
Defendant Lee Mu Rim,

479
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,920
as a police officer,

480
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,490
knowing the culprit of the case
he was investigating,

481
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,420
intentionally obstructed
the investigation...

482
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,019
and destroyed evidence.

483
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,630
This is a crime
of dereliction of duty,

484
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,400
which is subject to imprisonment
for up to one year, detention,

485
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,000
or a suspension of qualifications
for up to three years.

486
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,430
It is understandable
that he was unable to report...

487
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,670
the crime of his family
as a human being,

488
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,500
but since he was a police officer,

489
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,069
he cannot avoid being punished.

490
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,509
Defendant Lee Mu Rim is sentenced...

491
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,710
to a one-year suspension
of his qualifications...

492
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,539
for dereliction of duty.

493
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,750
What does a suspension
of qualifications mean?

494
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,559
It means he's being fired
from the police force.

495
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:56,960
Oh, dear.

496
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:01,630
Our poor Mu Rim.

497
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,710
Defendants Lee Da Rim
and Lee Cha Rim...

498
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,880
concealed the money
after finding out...

499
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,539
that it had been stolen
by family members.

500
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,650
The crime committed is the retention
of stolen property.

501
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,319
Those who obtain,

502
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,519
receive, move,
or retain stolen property...

503
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,650
can be imprisoned
for up to seven years...

504
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:25,390
or be fined up to 15,000 dollars.

505
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,829
However, we considered
how a daughter couldn't turn in...

506
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,430
her parents...

507
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,859
who stole the money
to fund her eye surgery.

508
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,470
Moreover,
she actively participated...

509
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,069
to earn the money to replace...

510
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:40,369
what had been spent
following the theft.

511
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:42,740
For that, she will be sentenced
as follows.

512
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:44,839
Defendant Lee Da Rim.

513
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:46,609
Not guilty.

514
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,589
Defendant Lee Cha Rim
was the last...

515
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:58,720
to find out about the theft
committed by her family.

516
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,589
It would not have been easy
to report them to the police.

517
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,000
We considered her key role
in recovering the money.

518
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,460
Defendant Lee Mi Yeon...

519
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,299
spent the money
not knowing that it was stolen.

520
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:10,569
Her actions are reprehensible,

521
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,640
but she cannot be found guilty
for unknowingly spending stolen money.

522
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,910
Defendant Nam Gi Dung
only provided aid to the family.

523
00:27:17,009 --> 00:27:19,480
We considered his role
in returning the money.

524
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:21,480
The sentences for the defendants
are as follows.

525
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,279
Defendant Lee Cha Rim.

526
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:24,710
Defendant Lee Mi Yeon.

527
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,180
Defendant Nam Gi Dung.

528
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:27,619
Not guilty.

529
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,759
What a relief.

530
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:34,890
Mom...

531
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,289
Defendants Lee Man Deuk
and An Gil Rye failed...

532
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,799
to report the ten million dollars
they found at Mount Euak.

533
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,329
After learning
of Yang Gil Soon's death,

534
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,839
the two of them conspired
late at night...

535
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,740
to steal three million dollars.

536
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,109
They involved their daughter-in-law
as an accomplice...

537
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:55,109
and stole
the remaining seven million dollars.

538
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,150
They trespassed on
state-owned land at night...

539
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,549
and stole property
owned by someone else.

540
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,619
This constitutes trespassing
and theft during late hours.

541
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,619
Since two or more individuals
conspired to commit theft,

542
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,059
they will be charged
with grand larceny...

543
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,230
under Article 331
of the Penal Code...

544
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,799
with special circumstances applied.

545
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,869
Since the theft was committed twice
and deemed habitual,

546
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:18,000
the nature of the crime
is considered more severe.

547
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,769
Special circumstances
will be applied again.

548
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:24,009
A sentence of 1 to 15 years
of imprisonment is warranted, but...

549
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,410
Mr. Lee.

550
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,009
Yes?

551
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,150
Ms. An.

552
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,549
Yes?

553
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,279
After digging up the money,

554
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,819
did you ever spend it on yourselves?

555
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:38,519
- No.
- Gosh, no.

556
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,190
We're so sorry.

557
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,089
Our grandchildren did nothing wrong.

558
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,430
Our grandchildren
didn't know anything.

559
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,069
As you have heard,
they are thieves...

560
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:51,029
who did not use the money
for themselves.

561
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,170
The choice was inevitable
as grandparents...

562
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,539
caring for a grandchild
in need of eye surgery.

563
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,779
They have confessed
and expressed deep remorse.

564
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,849
Their old age,
lack of prior convictions,

565
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,450
and the return
of the money were considered...

566
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,619
in the following ruling.

567
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,789
Defendant Lee Man Deuk.

568
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:17,230
For trespassing and theft
at night...

569
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,029
and theft
with special circumstances,

570
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,700
he is sentenced to a year in prison.

571
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,539
And here I thought
we'd get a newbie...

572
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,609
who is quick on his feet
that we can order around.

573
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,440
What rotten luck.

574
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,710
Gramps, your spot is over there
in the corner.

575
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,910
What? Yes, of course.

576
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,279
We got ourselves a snail.

577
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,779
Unbelievable.

578
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,789
- Seriously?
- What a joke.

579
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,269
Defendant Ko Bong Hee...

580
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,799
turned a blind eye...

581
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,700
after finding out
that her parents-in-law...

582
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,509
stole three million dollars
from Mount Euak.

583
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:05,539
She actively participated
in their crimes and helped steal...

584
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:08,180
a large sum of money
that was seven million dollars.

585
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,650
Not only that,

586
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,980
but even after she was arrested
at the scene...

587
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,779
for using
the stolen 50-dollar bills,

588
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,190
she did not confess.

589
00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:18,319
That is also a serious offense.

590
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,759
Defendant Ko Bong Hee...

591
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,759
is also found guilty
of trespassing and theft at night...

592
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,660
and theft
with special circumstances...

593
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:26,029
and will face
an aggravated sentence.

594
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:30,470
A sentence of 1 to 15 years
of imprisonment is warranted, but...

595
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,740
Ms. Ko.

596
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,609
If you were in the same situation...

597
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,539
and needed money
for your daughter's eye surgery,

598
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,150
can you surely say
you won't dig up the money?

599
00:30:56,859 --> 00:30:58,960
You look like
you will dig it up once again.

600
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,369
Bong Hee, say you won't do it.

601
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,480
I'll accept whatever punishment
you give me.

602
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,779
What parent
wouldn't dig up the money...

603
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,750
to pay
for their child's eye surgery?

604
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,049
We took into consideration...

605
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,420
that she has no priors
and that the money was returned...

606
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,930
and will rule as follows.

607
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,930
Defendant Ko Bong Hee.

608
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,299
For trespassing and theft
at night...

609
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,730
and theft
with special circumstances,

610
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:36,200
she is sentenced
to a year in prison.

611
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,900
Defendant An Gil Rye
is sentenced to a year in prison.

612
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,710
In you go.

613
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,170
- Mother...
- Bong Hee.

614
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,880
Just a second.

615
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,539
- You can't.
- Just a second.

616
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:49,809
- Mother.
- Yes?

617
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,579
Eat your fill
and sleep well at night.

618
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,480
Take your medicine too.

619
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,750
Don't skip them.

620
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,619
All right. Bong Hee, you too.

621
00:31:58,619 --> 00:32:00,089
- Sure.
- In you go.

622
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,329
- Go on.
- Right.

623
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,470
All right. See to it...

624
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,269
that you have a good relationship
with your new cellmate.

625
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:14,799
Got it?

626
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,369
- Sure.
- Sure.

627
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,809
In you go.

628
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,240
(Silence)

629
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,519
That's her.

630
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,400
Defendant Seo Gang Ju...

631
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:44,799
buried money in the mountain...

632
00:32:44,869 --> 00:32:46,240
for Ko Bong Hee,
who was then arrested,

633
00:32:46,369 --> 00:32:48,039
so that she could be released.

634
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,339
Hampering a police investigation
by concealing evidence...

635
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,480
is punishable
by up to five years in prison...

636
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,009
or a fine of up to 7,000 dollars.

637
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,509
However, as the son of the owner
of the ten million dollars,

638
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,619
he made a decision...

639
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:02,849
considering the best interests
of both families.

640
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,960
Moreover,
we considered his active role...

641
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,059
in recovering the stolen money,
which is reflected...

642
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,859
in the following ruling.

643
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:11,990
Defendant Seo Gang Ju.

644
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:13,730
Not guilty.

645
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,309
I knew it.

646
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,309
Can I get my money
now that the trial is over?

647
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,279
I'll look into it right away.

648
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,930
(Cheonglyeom Villa)

649
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,430
(You humiliated our neighborhood.)

650
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,809
(I can't believe thieves live here.)

651
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:02,079
(Launder your own conscience.)

652
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:12,389
(Business Closed)

653
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,659
(We're closing
due to unforeseen circumstances.)

654
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,530
(Launder your own conscience.)

655
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,539
Is Da Rim doing all right?

656
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,469
She won't take my calls.

657
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,570
(Director Cha Tae Woong)

658
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,690
The windows are lightweight
and easily accessible.

659
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,360
Also, you can select a color
to match your interior design.

660
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,829
We offer many different options.

661
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,400
This one's pretty.

662
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,369
Would this color go well
with our unit?

663
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,940
- I think so.
- Right.

664
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,400
Take your time looking around.

665
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,409
Sure.

666
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,750
I'm here as a customer
who needs a consultation.

667
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,579
I'm sorry, sir,

668
00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:15,449
but I'm assisting
another customer now.

669
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,619
They will refer you
to someone else at the front desk.

670
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,489
Would you like to look at
some other options?

671
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,530
- Sure.
- Sure.

672
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,599
- There are more here.
- Let me escort you this way.

673
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,670
Sure.

674
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,480
- Will you eat with her?
- Of course.

675
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Mom.

676
00:35:43,179 --> 00:35:45,949
I went to Da Rim's workplace today.

677
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,250
Right. I'll take those.

678
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,690
She won't even acknowledge me.

679
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,360
It's like I'm invisible to her.

680
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,730
She made up her mind
never to see me again.

681
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,699
Do you have scorched rice water?

682
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,199
Sure.

683
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,969
I don't intend to break up with her,

684
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:07,840
but she won't even talk to me.
What should I do?

685
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,880
Da Rim does
what she sets her mind to.

686
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,650
She's strong-willed.

687
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:20,380
I'm going to change her mind
no matter what...

688
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,880
and be on good terms with her again.

689
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,119
Her mom and grandparents
are paying for their crimes in jail.

690
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,889
Wouldn't that take a toll on her?

691
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,730
Why are you telling me that?

692
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,980
Mother, Father,

693
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,079
you must stay healthy
to see the kids again.

694
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,079
Please maintain good health.

695
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,239
Man Deuk, don't cry.

696
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,469
Keep the tears in
even if you want to cry.

697
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,769
Hang in there.

698
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,280
Let's meet again alive and well.

699
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,139
Gil Rye.

700
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,650
Gil Rye...

701
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,019
Darn it.

702
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,519
Shut it, Gramps.

703
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,690
Aren't you too old
to be asking for your big sister?

704
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,750
Da Rim, can you take that customer?

705
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,679
He's been waiting
for a consultation with you.

706
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,519
Allow me to help you.
This way, please.

707
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,699
What would you like to see, sir?

708
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,300
Everything.

709
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:18,630
We'll start on the ninth floor.

710
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,670
Sounds good.

711
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,610
This is the final showroom we have.

712
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,989
My goodness.
Companies do wonders these days.

713
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,750
Please let me know
what I can get you, sir.

714
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,059
Da Rim, which do you prefer?

715
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:43,329
Since you're tall,

716
00:38:43,329 --> 00:38:44,630
the kitchen counter
should be raised.

717
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:47,860
Hang on. You don't like cooking.

718
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,670
- Or do you?
- Sir.

719
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,500
The tour is over.

720
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,570
Take your time looking around.
If you make a decision,

721
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,409
please inform the manager.

722
00:38:57,739 --> 00:38:58,769
Wait.

723
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,449
Can I see the model home
you showed me earlier?

724
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,019
My mom, grandma, and grandpa...

725
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,449
are all locked up in prison.

726
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,260
So how could I possibly be with you?

727
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:36,809
Hey.

728
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,280
Mom, wear this one.

729
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,449
You look pretty in this.

730
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,750
Get out.

731
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,960
Da Rim's just as stubborn.

732
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,630
She won't budge
although I go to see her every day.

733
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,969
What makes a woman cave, Mom?

734
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,230
You brat.

735
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:03,670
What can I do to win her over again?

736
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,980
What can I do...

737
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,579
to get on your good side again?

738
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:09,849
Don't pretend to be my son.

739
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:11,309
Mom.

740
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,619
The police will soon give
your money back.

741
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,820
Will you take it to a bank?

742
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,119
That's always the safest option.

743
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:19,219
Mind your own business!

744
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:21,889
It can be dangerous
to move your money...

745
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:23,059
to the bank from the police station.

746
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,889
Let me go with you.
I'll be your bodyguard.

747
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,760
This time around,
I'll give up my life...

748
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,599
before letting anything happen
to your money.

749
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,699
You're the most dangerous one
of all.

750
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:32,969
- Move.
- Gosh, no.

751
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:35,239
- Move! Out of my way.
- Goodness.

752
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,670
Let me go with you, Mom.

753
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,909
That looks good.

754
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,250
Let's eat.

755
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,679
What?

756
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,849
Hurry.

757
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,150
Hold on.

758
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:52,389
Why does she get more soup?

759
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,820
Ask her for more.

760
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,130
I want to switch.

761
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,090
- But that's mine.
- I want to switch!

762
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,969
- Darn it.
- Seriously?

763
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:05,869
- My gosh.
- Hey! You're spoiled.

764
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:08,039
- Because of you, we can't eat!
- Darn.

765
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,869
I'm so sorry.

766
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,639
Goodness. Oh, dear.

767
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:14,309
What else?

768
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,019
What's going on?

769
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,719
What are you doing?

770
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,190
That's what you get
for being cheeky.

771
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,690
You only had one job to do.
Take that!

772
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,659
Unbelievable.

773
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,860
They must be teaching
the newbie a lesson again.

774
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,929
What?

775
00:41:33,929 --> 00:41:35,159
What do you mean by that?

776
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:36,900
Teaching the newbie a lesson?

777
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,070
A beating is necessary
to make someone listen.

778
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,699
The ladies in the next room
are scary, you see.

779
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,909
Consider yourself lucky, Granny.

780
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:44,969
Oh, no.

781
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,579
Goodness me. Excuse me.

782
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:50,980
Guards!

783
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,280
Please help my Bong Hee.

784
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,650
Guards, help my Bong Hee.

785
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,789
She'll die at this rate.

786
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,559
Bong Hee!

787
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,960
My goodness.

788
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,130
Oh, no!

789
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,599
Granny?

790
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,929
Guards!

791
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:12,940
The old lady fainted.

792
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,019
What?

793
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:39,059
Bong Hee, are you all right?

794
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,199
Mother, are you all right?

795
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:48,269
I heard you fainted.

796
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,139
I only faked it...

797
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,110
so that I could come and see you.

798
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,079
Mother.

799
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,750
This is how we're being punished.

800
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:04,119
It's finally sinking in.

801
00:43:04,889 --> 00:43:07,019
How are things for you?

802
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,190
My cellmates
are rough around the edges,

803
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:13,059
but they still respect their elders.

804
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:15,829
Mother, my gosh.

805
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,070
Why are you laughing?

806
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,539
I could ask you the same thing.

807
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:23,570
I feel...

808
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:25,570
at ease here...

809
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,679
more than I did at home.

810
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,380
When will the kids find out?

811
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:32,210
When will I be arrested?

812
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,219
It has been torture for me.

813
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,320
Same here.

814
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,219
It may be physically exhausting,

815
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,420
but I like being punished.

816
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,389
Likewise.

817
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,730
I guess committing a crime isn't
for everyone.

818
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,000
I agree.

819
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,869
Oh, dear.

820
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,670
This is also a place
where people live.

821
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,380
I wonder how Father is doing.

822
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,550
I bet...

823
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:08,550
he fell ill
from missing you so much.

824
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,019
Serves him right.

825
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:15,219
Mother.

826
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,860
I'm not lonely.
I'm actually happy...

827
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,929
to be in this with you.

828
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:26,400
My daughter-in-law.

829
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,010
You married into the wrong family...

830
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:32,710
only to have an exhausting life.

831
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,980
My gosh.

832
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,260
(3H1 8032)

833
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,010
Let's have a look.

834
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,579
Our newbie's quite a romantic.

835
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:07,980
- Hey.
- What's this?

836
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,349
"Gil Rye. Man Deuk's doing well."

837
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,280
"I eat well and sleep well."

838
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,550
"How are you doing?"

839
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:21,260
Please. Will you give that back?

840
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,030
- It's fine, Gramps.
- Wait.

841
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,860
- Let me see.
- Old man. You're a good liar.

842
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,500
You don't eat well,
and you barely sleep.

843
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,329
- Give it back.
- This is no fun.

844
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:34,940
Let him be.

849
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,090
(You humiliated our neighborhood.)

(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

852
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,539
- Da Rim.
- Stop trying so hard.

853
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:52,170
Our families should stay away.

854
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,010
You still have feelings for me.

855
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,050
Do you think you can hide it?

856
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,710
It shows so badly.

857
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:01,150
It's written on your forehead...

858
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,880
just how much you love me.

859
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:04,719
Your angry pout...

860
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,789
shouts loud and clear
that you want to be with me.

861
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,860
I don't like you anymore.

862
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:13,059
See? You lie
whenever you open your mouth.

863
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,400
That's why it squirms
as if it's being torched.

864
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:18,130
Why won't you be true
to your feelings?

865
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,369
Why do you try so hard...

866
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:23,769
to deceive yourself?

867
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,739
Let's stick to our resolve
to break up.

868
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,440
- We failed already.
- That's what I'll do.

869
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,610
You can't.

870
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,110
Don't come here again.

871
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:32,610
I'll come here every day.

872
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,179
I only barely got this job.

873
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:37,920
Will you get me fired?
Do you call that love?

874
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:40,590
Let me make a living at least.

875
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,429
I don't have the energy
to talk about our love that's over.

876
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,530
How is it over?

877
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,269
It's not over.

My gosh.

879
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:17,090
You come home early these days.

880
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,289
Does Da Rim refuse to see you?

881
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,170
How can I get a woman to come back?

882
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,639
Whatever I say,
Da Rim won't get back with me.

883
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,539
It's like talking to a wall.

884
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,480
She said
she can't allow us to drift apart...

885
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,050
because of her.

886
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:42,349
She's normal then.
You're the crazy one.

887
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,920
Stop clinging to her.

888
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,019
The three elders each got a year.

889
00:49:47,389 --> 00:49:49,690
That's how long
I'll cling to Da Rim for.

890
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,260
You lunatic.

891
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:54,130
I'll lock her up in my heart.

892
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,130
Her grandparents and her mother
are in prison.

893
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,000
I bet she can barely sleep or eat.

894
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,510
She won't want to dress nicely
or go to the movies.

895
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,610
I'll keep hitting on her
to distract her.

896
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,849
I'll see her every day
and annoy her...

897
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:11,710
so she has no time to think...

898
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,980
or worry about
her mom and grandparents.

899
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,079
You're insane.

900
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,789
Then a year will speed by.

901
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:17,949
Shut your mouth!

902
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,519
I don't want my son...

903
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,360
to cling to a woman mindlessly
every day for a year.

904
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:26,360
Why should you act like
you're beneath her?

905
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,699
Do you know how nasty Da Rim is?

906
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,199
You should've seen
the look she gave me.

907
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:36,269
You should've seen
the disdain in her eyes.

908
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:38,639
What?
Does that brat think she's special?

909
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:41,639
How dare she look at my son
with disdain?

910
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:45,610
She just had to be direct
and say it's over.

911
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,349
Mom.

912
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,849
When will the police
return your money?

913
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,090
Why are you so interested
in the money?

914
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,130
- Goodness.
- You think I'll leave it to you...

915
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,659
if you brownnose me?

916
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:00,360
You can wake up from that dream.

917
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,230
I feel bad for you
and for what the money went through.

918
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:06,440
You're traumatized.

919
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,809
I'd brought the ten million
into the house,

920
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,909
but I left with it again
and buried it on the mountain...

921
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,010
to help Da Rim's family.

922
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,050
I betrayed you that day.

923
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:20,480
Yes. That was the day
my son stabbed me in the back.

924
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,550
It was.

925
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,519
Nothing will happen,

926
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,559
but I'll go with you
like the trusted son I am,

927
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:28,860
and I'll escort you and the money
to the bank.

928
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,989
The bank is a stone's throw
from the police station,

929
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,400
and no one knows about it.

930
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,500
The police won't broadcast
they'll return me the money.

931
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,369
I tried moving the money on my own.

932
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:41,900
It's really heavy and bulky.

933
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:47,179
I'll ask the police
to take it to the bank for me.

934
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,909
They won't do it.

935
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,750
They're not obligated to,

936
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,409
and they don't like you at all.

937
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,449
Why not?

938
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:59,090
You didn't pay the taxes on it,
so they're reluctant to return it.

939
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,559
The prosecutor
couldn't stand you either,

940
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,719
so he kept delaying the process.

941
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:04,590
It's your money,

942
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:06,559
but no one
in the country is pleased...

943
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,130
that you'll get it back.

944
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,900
- Whatever.
- "Whatever?"

945
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,070
When you go to pick up the cash,

946
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,000
the police will shoot daggers at you
from their eyes.

947
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,670
I'll take the hit...

948
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:20,110
so you don't cut even once.

949
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:22,780
I'll be your bodyguard.

950
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,449
I'll prove that I'm your son.

951
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,679
See for yourself that I'm your son.

952
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:34,760
Isn't it nice?

953
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:37,630
It's bitter.

954
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,460
Coffee is supposed to taste bitter.

955
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:48,269
Hello, Chief.

956
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,940
The investigation...

957
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,269
on Oh Min Gi,
Lee Man Deuk, An Gil Rye,

958
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,010
and Ko Bong Hee's aggravated larceny
was concluded.

959
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:57,710
Come to the station tomorrow.

960
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,250
You can collect the evidence.

961
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:01,420
Tomorrow?

962
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,449
Okay.

00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,530
She'll come to the bank tomorrow.

as he was dying.

967

972

the ten million dollars...

in evidence
to the rightful owner Baek Ji Yeon.

974
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,280
Count it for me so I can see.

975
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:04,949
- What?
- What?

976
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:19,960
This is the 1,998th.

977
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,199
This is the 1,999th.

978
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,570
And this is the 2,000th.

979
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:28,099
That's 2,000 bundles
of 100 50-dollar bills.

980
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:31,440
Is that good enough?
All ten million's there.

981
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:35,039
Don't hate me too much.

982
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,050
Wouldn't you do the same
if it were your money?

983
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,050
What if I got to the bank
and it wasn't the full ten million?

984
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,949
Wouldn't that be dreadful?

985
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,019
Thanks for your help.

986
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:45,090
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

have to be like that?

I lost back then?

No.

Are you looking for this?

1075
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,030
Are you?

00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,960
She abandoned you for money.

1078
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,630
Come on out, you jerk.

1079
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,769
No. I will never get out!

1080
00:59:27,769 --> 00:59:29,769
You darn leech.

1081
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:32,269
You will never get the money.

1082
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:35,039
I'll be sure to protect her!

1083
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,280
What do I do?

1084
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,519
Gang Ju.

1085
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,590
Gang Ju...

1086

Gosh, Sung Hoon.

1087
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:16,079
Darn it!

1088
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:26,429
You crazy jerk.

1089
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:29,000
It'll be over once she gets
to the bank. Give me that!

1090
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,599
I'm almost there, Gang Ju.

1091
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:05,900

Give me the key, you idiot!

1094
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,480
Let go.

1095
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,250
What a crazy jerk.

1096
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:05,829
Hey.

1097
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,429
- We can't stay here. Let's run.
- Okay.

1098
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:08,960
Darn it!

1099

mess with my son?

1104
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,769
We will have to wait and see
how it goes.

1105

I don't need any of this!

Ms. Lee.
Please go and talk to Gang Ju.

1108
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:30,239
Tell him to stop sleeping
and wake up.

1109
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,150
I'm sorry.
