1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,910
No, let me go.

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,050
- Let me go.
- You can't leave like that.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,810
I just did.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,019
Hey.

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,550
There's no man in Korea...

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,689
who'd let a girl run off
after hearing that.

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,960
You can be naughty.

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:18,920
Is it always on your terms?

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,429
Is this a one-way stream?

10
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:22,829
I don't think...

11
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,460
you kissed me in that motel room.

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,600
It was me kissing you.

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,009
Dragging it out
will only make it awkward.

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,270
(Sewing factory CEO Bong Chi Su)

15
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:08,409
Yes, Mr. Bong.

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,079
Hey, wait. Junior Staffer Lee!

17
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,120
Junior Staffer Lee?

18
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,879
Sorry about that, Mr. Bong.

19
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,750
Director Seo, is it true
you started your own company?

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,159
Yes, and I'd appreciate
the assistance.

21
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,159
That being said...

22
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,200
Sure. I'll come see you
first thing in the morning.

23
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,030
Right.

24
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,650
- You brat. I'm glad you're home.
- What?

25
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,750
You!

26
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,489
- What...
- I have something to say.

27
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,829
But...

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,459
Sit.

29
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,979
What are you and that nuisance up to
in that rooftop unit?

30
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,490
Why call him a nuisance
when he has a perfectly fine name?

31
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,659
That nuisance is also
someone's precious son.

32
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,129
- What?
- Don't upset...

33
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,830
Seo Gang Ju ever again.

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,759
Don't corner him as a group
and give him a hard time.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,199
Have you lost your mind?

36
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:43,229
Selling the unclaimed clothes
at our dry cleaner's?

37
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,969
That was my idea.

38
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:47,840
He was adamantly against it
until the very end,

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,909
but I took photos on my own
and posted them without him knowing.

40
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,780
It wasn't his doing,
so don't be hard on him.

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,810
Got it?

42
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,349
He was fired from work,
his parents got divorced,

43
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,650
and he was even kicked out
of his house.

44
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,960
He's trying to make a living...

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,419
while staying rent-free
in the rooftop unit.

46
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,860
He's only trying to build his career
from the ground up again.

47
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,060
So? Are you saying
you're proud of this?

48
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,669
No, I know I did wrong.

49
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,240
It may seem foolish to you...

50
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,110
that we're still holding
onto the clothes...

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,280
that haven't been claimed
for over ten years.

52
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,590
That's not how I
or your grandparents think.

53
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,620
I doubt anyone cares about...

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,020
what owners
of a dry cleaner's think,

55
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,060
but you should've cared
since we're your family.

56
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm sorry, Mom.

57
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,080
- Thank you.
- Does it suit your palate?

58
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
- Absolutely.
- Everything's delicious.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,909
- So I had to come again.
- She said you served great food.

60
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,150
She's still working hard
at the barbecue restaurant.

61
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,990
Is it because...

62
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,689
she needs more money for Shin?

63
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:13,090
Or is this a show?

64
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,530
She takes us for two fools.

65
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,560
I bet that one day, when we wake up,

66
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,930
she'll have packed up and left.

67
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,470
Goodness.

68
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,370
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

69
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,069
- Here.
- I'll help with that.

70
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,079
- The fire's not hot enough.
- It's not, is it?

71
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,009
I'll get another canister of gas.

72
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,920
Hello, sir.

73
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,490
You were told never to appear...

74
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:44,459
before me,
our dry cleaning store, or Da Rim!

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,490
You shameless punk.

76
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,639
Recent reports of...

77
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,209
Select the service...

78
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,180
Put in your PIN.

79
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,009
(Deposit, Withdrawal,
Update Bankbook)

80
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,050
(60 50-dollar bills)

81
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,250
(Withdraw 3,000 dollars)

82
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,649
The bills are being counted.

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,620
Please wait.

84
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,730
Where are you?

85
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,199
I asked where you are.

86
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,839
Get out.

87
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,269
Okay.

88
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,300
Here.

89
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,170
It's for all the clothes you bought
from my company. Take it.

90
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,899
Get out.

91
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,550
(Shinhyub Bank)

92
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,019
You punk. I can't stand your guts.

93
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,490
Why did you buy the clothes?

94
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,949
I was going to take them all down.

95
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,089
You bought them all
in the wink of an eye...

96
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,860
just to disrespect and humiliate me.

97
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,089
Get out of my house.

98
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,300
Okay.

99
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,750
Hey. Can't you let me stay?

100
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,449
You took over my office
and now my home.

101
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,720
I have no money and nowhere to go.

102
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,490
Can't you be nice and let me stay?

103
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,300
It's none of my business.

104
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,629
I have nowhere to go.

105
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,769
What are you up to?

106
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,970
Why are you staying here?

107
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,240
This isn't the only room
available to rent.

108
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,970
Why are you even here?

109
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,639
Downstairs,
under the old man's mattress...

110
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,449
is as much as 6.2 million dollars.

111
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,279
Thanks.

112
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,660
Thanks to you, my online store
made 2,000 dollars in sales.

113
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,319
Now we can sell things live.

114
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,259
You can do all the cool stuff
for now.

115
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,029
I'm fine with that.
Even I think you're cool.

116
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,899
This room now feels like my home
and my workplace.

117
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:45,500
I've grown to like it.

118
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,269
Can you let me stay
until I get back on my feet?

119
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,310
I'll have the real estate agent
put up the room for rent.

120
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,079
Let me stay.

121
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,649
Darn you.

122
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,089
Let me stay.

123
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,389
Let me stay!

124
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,059
These punks are so darn sexy.

125
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,490
The sound of their hard labor.

126
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,960
Let's let them work up a sweat.

127
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,269
We can arrest them as soon
as they find the bag of cash...

128
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,100
and reap the rewards.

129
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,370
How much did they bury...

130
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,139
that they're doing this
two days in a row?

131
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,169
I mean, the bag must have a zipper.

132
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
They could use a metal detector.

133
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,980
Do you enjoy being ignorant
and resorting to physical labor?

134
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,399
Sung Hoon. It really isn't here.

135
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,039
Forget about
the ten million dollars.

136
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,509
I can't do this anymore.

137
00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:35,350
Ten million dollars?

138
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,519
Did he just say ten million, Mother?

139
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,789
- Yes.
- I heard it too.

140
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,690
It is ten million,
as the rumor said.

141
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:45,389
Darn it.

142
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,389
Yang Gil Soon.

143
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,389
Gil Soon!

144
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,659
Hey.

145
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,600
Do you think he pranked us?

146
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,029
I doubt that.

147
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,139
Why would he have scheduled
a message like that...

148
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,139
to be sent right before he died
if it wasn't serious?

149
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,279
Sung Hoon.

150
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,309
If we haven't found it
after all this digging,

151
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,950
it's not here!

152
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,720
Undo that cloth just in case.

153
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,019
We have the coordinates
and don't need that sign anymore.

154
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:20,289
Let's regroup to think
and then come back.

155
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,860
- Okay.
- Okay, Sung Hoon.

156
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,759
- Climb on up.
- Get on your hands and knees.

157
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,570
- Here you go.
- Did you get out?

158
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,440
Will you keep still?

159
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,440
What happened?

160
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,009
I think the bug fell off.

161
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,950
Did they find out?

162
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,820
Let's just look further into
that suspicious dry cleaner's.

163
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,500
- Hey. Fill in the hole first.
- The dry cleaner's?

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,259
Why would they go there?

165
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,730
What are they talking about?

166
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,000
Could they mean
where they launder their money?

167
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,570
Money laundering...

168
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,820
What did Seo Gang Ju say?

169
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,649
Mom, Grandpa, and Grandma
are furious, aren't they?

170
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:26,419
I don't get why Da Rim's hanging out
with him.

171
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,500
Did you have dinner?

172
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,399
I didn't have time to eat dinner.

173
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,139
I rushed over after work.

174
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:41,570
You should have some ramyeon, then.

175
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:44,809
No, leave it. It's fine.

176
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,580
Did you call her over?

177
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,549
Yes.

178
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,490
It's cold. Let's talk at home.

179
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,419
The elders are home.

180
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,490
Can I sit down?

181
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,500
Am I allowed to join you?

182
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,899
Hey, you.

183
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,899
Don't work with Seo Gang Ju.

184
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,970
You just got a job.
Focus on your career.

185
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,669
Don't you have other stuff to sell?

186
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,870
How could you sell
our customers' old clothes?

187
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,409
You're selling clothes
without a designer's help?

188
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,210
Do you think that little
of what I do?

189
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:23,549
Does he think business is easy?

190
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,649
Even if they say
anyone can make and sell clothes...

191
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,590
and blindly jump into the industry,
that's acceptable only for you.

192
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,590
Shouldn't Director Gang Ju
feel humiliated?

193
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:36,759
This job requires detecting
and adapting quickly to change.

194
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,659
He must think
his old connections still work.

195
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,330
People worked with him
as he was a director.

196
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,570
Do you think they'll do business
with a one-man operation?

197
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,370
They won't.
You could end up being exploited.

198
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,610
Your illness set you back ten years.

199
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,009
Da Rim. You can't waste your life.

200
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,879
It's not just 10 years.
She's behind by 20.

201
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,580
She can't do anything alone.
She can't even judge people right.

202
00:12:57,549 --> 00:12:59,419
You must be
around successful people.

203
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:01,019
Stay around people who will succeed.

204
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,519
Seo Gang Ju was
in the industry for years.

205
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,659
Is he naive or stupid?

206
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,059
Where are you going? Da Rim.

207
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,470
We're giving you the hard truth,
and you're...

208
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,029
At least pretend to listen!

209
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:18,769
Sit back down.

210
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:26,779
- What are you... Hey.
- Da Rim.

211
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:28,980
Hey.

212
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,649
(Anchovy Chips)

213
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,779
What...

214
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,350
But you disliked Seo Gang Ju too.

215
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,029
(Crosswalk)

216
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:56,370
CEO Seo Gang Ju.

217
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,610
- Look at you.
- Da Rim.

218
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,879
- What?
- Get over here.

219
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,480
- Are you alone?
- I'm outside the general store.

220
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,289
Are you drunk?

221
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,289
Things we were talking about...

222
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,289
Let's pick up where we left off.

223
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,519
Things we were talking about?

224
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,429
I'll give you
a proper one next time.

225
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,470
I'll give you
a proper one next time!

226
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,330
Now you're making it too obvious.

227
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,830
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,840
No words can justify what you did
even if you have ten mouths.

229
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,399
I have 11 mouths.

230
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,399
My gosh.

231
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,169
- So what?
- Did you plot it together?

232
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:04,879
Did you get your story straight?
Are you two dating?

233
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,639
Why are you two
saying the same thing?

234
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,679
Your younger sibling is
trying to start something new.

235
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,879
And she's working hard.

236
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,720
Why are you trying to nip it
in the bud?

237
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,820
Hey.

238
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,289
Don't let her drink more.

239
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,659
You should take her home now.

240
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,730
So when did something happen
between you two?

241
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,559
You didn't even tell me.
The whole family didn't know.

242
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,169
How sneaky you two are.

243
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,269
What?

244
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,039
CEO Seo!

245
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,879
It's my boss.

246
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,840
- Come here.
- My gosh.

247
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,149
CEO Seo, have a seat.

248
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:45,620
Aren't you cold?

249
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:49,490
I couldn't deal with
those smarty-pants by myself,

250
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,059
so I called you.

251
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,759
Are you busy?

252
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,629
You should stop drinking.

253
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
What?

254
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,470
So what is it
that you wanted to talk about?

255
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,240
I got criticized all evening,
so I don't feel like eating,

256
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,340
but this is delicious.

257
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,610
You should try this. Open up.

258
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,679
- Why are you being like this?
- Open up.

259
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,250
Darn it.

260
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,019
There's nothing to talk about
for the four of us.

261
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:26,289
Hey.

262
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,289
Move out...

263
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:30,460
and stay away from Da Rim.

264
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:33,759
Don't you dare tell him to move out,
Cha Tae Woong!

265
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,399
Hey, you're crossing the line.

266
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,899
After getting a scolding from Mom,
Grandma, and Grandpa,

267
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,600
are you taking it out on Tae Woong?

268
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,769
Pull yourself together.

269
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,710
Just make sure to focus on your work
at the company.

270
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,080
You were tricked
by Director Gang Ju, you fool!

271
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,379
How dare you call her a fool?

272
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:53,019
Why is Da Rim a fool?
Are you saying she's beautiful?

273
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,090
Did Da Rim's beauty harm you
in any way?

274
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,919
Why do you look down on her
when you're her older sister?

275
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:03,460
Hey. What right do you have...

276
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,930
You're no different.

277
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,430
You've worked at this dry cleaner's
for 6 or 7 years.

278
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,000
You own this building
and stocks worth millions.

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,170
You must've been busy
lying to her family as a part-timer.

280
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:16,410
You must've told them countless lies
as if you were penniless.

281
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,309
Don't you think you're a hypocrite?

282
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:22,480
How could you possibly trust him,
Assistant Manager Lee?

283
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,480
All he did to the woman he liked
was tell lies...

284
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,750
and play the hypocrite.
Do you not mind it at all?

285
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,119
Oh, right.

286
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,660
You don't care as long as he's rich?

287
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,059
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,559
I forgot that you were materialistic
for a moment.

289
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,460
The jerk who can't be read...

290
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,130
and Assistant Manager Lee
who's shallow...

291
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,640
make a great match. Make it work.

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,069
You two make a great match.

293
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,240
Hey!

294
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,680
- I'm not Assistant Manager Lee.
- No?

295
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,779
I'm now Design Director Lee,
you rotten brat!

296
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,849
Oh, right. We should have a drink.

297
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,049
Where Director Gang Ju left off,
Director Cha stepped in.

298
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,460
Oh, dear. Congratulations. There.

299
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,160
And Design Director Lee took
Design Director Kim's position.

300
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,529
Congratulations on your promotion.

301
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:16,329
Did Design Director Kim
get kicked out?

302
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,069
How impressive.

303
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,200
Now that you two got promoted
to Director and Design Director,

304
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,369
you should pay for the drinks.

305
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:22,640
Can I drink more?

306
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,839
You two are buying, right?

307
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,109
Okay?

308
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,109
- No. Stop drinking.
- Just wait.

309
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,380
So where did Design Director Kim go?

310
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
What?

311
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
You should stop drinking.

312
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,849
Let's drink tonight.

313
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,190
But...

314
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,589
Darn it! Seriously.

315
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,759
Gosh, it's cold.

316
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,559
Hey, I'm hungry.

317
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,029
Why don't we have some cup noodles
in my office?

318
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,440
What on earth are the thieves up to?

319
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,170
We should think about that.

320
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,069
You stay out of this case, Chief.

321
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,250
Why? I don't want to. Count me in.

322
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,049
It's worth ten million dollars.

323
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,950
We should catch the thieves together
and make it big.

324
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,779
It'll make headlines.

325
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,720
And it'll make us get promoted.

326
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,059
I have a hunch.

327
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,230
Right, Mu Rim?

328
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,099
Chief, they keep digging in vain.

329
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,839
Could it be that someone else
took the money first?

330
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,640
That's impossible.

331
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,039
Even the loan sharks
found out just now.

332
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:33,180
Someone else?

333
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,250
- Who could it be?
- Who could it be?

334
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,960
- What?
- You darn brat.

335
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,619
I'm going.

336
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,259
- Move over.
- She tells you to move over.

337
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,660
Hey. My gosh.

338
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,359
What?

339
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,970
No. Not that way.

340
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,130
Move.

341
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,900
I'm so tired.

342
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,220
You should spend the night here.
Mom will be happy to see you.

343
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:18,190
- Of course.
- Hey.

344
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,589
Hey, stay quiet. Okay?

345
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,390
Don't wake them up.

346
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,759
Bye, guys.

347
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,500
- Bye.
- Hey.

348
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,200
Where are you going? Come on down.

349
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,569
Let go of me.

350
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:31,670
Why isn't it opening?

351
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:32,769
- What?
- Come on down.

352
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,170
I can't open it.

353
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,339
Cha Rim.

354
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,740
This is the key to your studio.

355
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,339
- You're right.
- What?

356
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,650
Hey. Come down.

357
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,809
Where's your key?

358
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,980
Where am I...

359
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,250
supposed to go
at this time of night?

360
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,319
It's no concern of mine.

361
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,960
Sleep somewhere else.

362
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,160
You're being so mean in this cold.

363
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,329
Do you want me
to freeze to death out there?

364
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,170
Gosh, get out of my way.

365
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,230
Why is it so hard?

366
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,569
Is this hard?

367
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:07,400
- Why?
- You can just open it like this.

368
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,240
- It's open. See?
- It's open.

369
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,339
It's open, Tae Woong.

370
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:12,380
Hurry and go in. Go.

371
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,440
- This is fun.
- Shush.

372
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,779
I should go in too.

373
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,680
Hey. Come on in.

374
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:20,750
- That's not it.
- Shush.

375
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,119
Shush.

376
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,450
Shush.

377
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,460
Mom, aren't you going home?

378
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,599
I'll sleep here tonight.

379
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,769
Your dad and stepmother went golfing
and will come back tomorrow.

380
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,339
I can't believe they left you alone.

381
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,839
But still...

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,109
It's okay.

383
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,839
I won't leave any trace
of me behind.

384
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,579
Shin.

385
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,250
Do you want to be a doctor?

386
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
Yes.

387
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,650
If Grandma and Grandpa live
a long time,

388
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,450
I'll be able to cure them.

389
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,019
I'm not sure
if they can live that long.

390
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,589
Don't worry about the tuition fee.

391
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,230
Until you go to medical school
and become a doctor,

392
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,660
I'll pay for everything.

393
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,529
Do you want to live with me?

394
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,039
How?

395
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,589
A proper kiss?

396
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,720
Hey.

397
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,390
When exactly next time?

398
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,730
Hey!

399
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:10,750
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

400
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,400
What are you doing in there?

401
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,039
Why? You look comfortable.

402
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,250
Sleep some more.
I know you're tired.

403
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,390
Grandma, Grandpa,

404
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,160
please stop hating him.

405
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,400
He's not out to hurt our family.

406
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,329
In fact, he cares dearly...

407
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,970
about me, Mom, and you two.

408
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,940
Please be fond of him.

409
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,750
Hey.

410
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,599
Keep it down, will you?

411
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,670
They remove their hearing aids
before going to bed...

412
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,039
and can't hear my voice.

413
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,480
Even mine?

414
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:23,309
They'll probably hear you
since you're closer.

415
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,230
Mr. Crosswalk.

416
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,230
How did you land in this state
in my house?

417
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,670
What was it like to sleep
on a bed of money?

418
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:45,039
Did you sleep well?

419
00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:52,180
How much do you like me,
Mr. Crosswalk?

420
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,309
Do you like me as a friend,
or is it love?

421
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,980
You're confused, aren't you?

422
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,849
Is it actually love?
I just can't believe you.

423
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,619
You said we'd date last time,

424
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,589
but you gave me false hope
for eight years.

425
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,329
Am I confused?

426
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,630
As if you need to keep on asking.

427
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,039
Gil Rye.

428
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:28,650
Am I dreaming?

429
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,180
Oh, no.

430
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,710
It seems that way.

431
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:35,420
Did the nuisance appear
in our dream?

432
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:39,960
This must be one
of the worst dreams.

433
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:42,890
Well, you see...

434
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,200
What...

435
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,000
Where's my hearing aid, Gil Rye?

436
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,740
How should I know that?

437
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,279
Where are my glasses?

438
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,839
- Goodness.
- Where...

439
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,609
I don't think we were dreaming.

440
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,019
How could it not have been a dream?

441
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,990
That nuisance was sleeping
between us in our bed.

442
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,859
That is one crappy dream.

443
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,690
Get some more sleep upstairs.

444
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,390
I need to get to work.

445
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,000
At this early hour?

446
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:22,369
I'm meeting with the CEO
of a sewing factory.

447
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,529
He has clothes in stock
that I can sell.

448
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,039
I'll go with you.

449
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,369
You have to be at the office.

450
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:30,640
I'm going with you.

451
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,640
Go back to bed.

452
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:43,019
Can we sell the clothes
he has in stock?

453
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,089
Don't they belong to someone else?

454
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,960
The company that placed an order
went under...

455
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,230
and left the clothes
as payment instead.

456
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,329
They haven't even been tagged,

457
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,829
so we can sell them online.
There won't be an issue.

458
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,869
We'll be able to buy them cheaper
than clothes from wholesalers.

459
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Hey.

460
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,380
This better not be what you meant
by the proper kiss you promised.

461
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,480
That wasn't a kiss.

462
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:17,819
You can't keep insisting
those were proper kisses.

463
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,990
I mean it.

464
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,900
You'll cause an accident
if you keep it up.

465
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,529
(Bong Company)

466
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,539
Mr. Bong. I'll check these.

467
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:35,670
Go ahead.

468
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:39,779
(Bong Company)

469
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,519
Check the sewing
including loose ends...

470
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,119
and see if any threads
are hanging out.

471
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,349
Stretch the cuffs and hem
to see if they're sturdy.

472
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,259
The quality of our final products...

473
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:53,960
obviously passes
your strict standards.

474
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,690
I'm well aware
of the quality of your sewing.

475
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,430
You'll take them, right?
There are 1,000 pieces.

476
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,660
Right.

477
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,599
How much per piece is it?

478
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:05,839
It should cover the production cost.

479
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,240
So 30 dollars.

480
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,670
At this rate,
I won't be able to pay my employees.

481
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,609
Sure. 30 dollars it is.
Your employees should get paid.

482
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,250
Buying 1,000 pieces
at 30 dollars per piece?

483
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:20,349
That'll be 30,000 dollars.

484
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,089
Thanks. One piece cost 30 dollars
to make,

485
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,720
but you can easily sell them
for 60...

486
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,890
since you're getting them
from the factory.

487
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:28,990
If we sell them all
for 60 dollars a piece,

488
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,660
we'll have made 30,000 dollars.

489
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,730
Since I paid the full price
this time,

490
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,299
you'll make my clothes
at a good price next time.

491
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,529
I'll soon be making my own.

492
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,940
Of course, Director Seo.
You saved me this time around,

493
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,240
so consider me as an ally
who will always be loyal to you.

494
00:31:44,109 --> 00:31:46,279
- It's CEO Seo now.
- Sure, CEO Seo.

495
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:47,980
- I'll take them right away.
- Got it.

496
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,619
You saw my photos from before.

497
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,650
Only shoot me from the neck down.

498
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:55,789
Got it.

499
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,109
Are you done? Let me see.

500
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,049
You should be at work, so get going.

501
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,779
I should check
if they came out all right.

502
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,480
Leave the photos to me.

503
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,519
The chairman will be
at the office soon.

504
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:32,690
Should he be there
before his secretary?

505
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:37,829
We'll profit 30,000 dollars
if we sell one at 60 dollars each.

506
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,599
I'll be selling them
at 35 dollars a piece.

507
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,599
- What?
- We're just starting out.

508
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,630
Who will buy our clothes...

509
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,970
if the price is the same
as other companies'?

510
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,640
No one has even heard of us.

511
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,839
I'm going to promote
our company as one...

512
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,910
that sells good clothes
close to their production cost.

513
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,740
When will we earn money
at that rate?

514
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,950
Good quality clothes sell
at a higher price.

515
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,009
That's just how it is.

516
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,480
If you sell good clothes
at too low a price,

517
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,190
people will doubt their quality.

518
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,720
Seogang Apparel
will become a brand...

519
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,720
that sells good quality clothes
at a reasonable price.

520
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:09,259
People will eventually notice
our good clothes.

521
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,160
Okay. Then sell them
at 50 dollars a piece.

522
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,730
Get to the office.

523
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,569
Fifty dollars. That's the minimum.

524
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,599
Whatever. Just get going.

525
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,970
We already have
30,000 dollars in debt.

526
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,609
The company is in a pile of debt!

(Bong Company)

528
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,500
Did Da Rim leave
at the crack of dawn?

529
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Did you see her?

530
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,230
I didn't.

531
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,569
Hey. Why are you...

532
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:52,640
sitting next to him
when there are other seats?

533
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,069
Because that's where I belong.

534
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:57,410
Unbelievable.

535
00:33:57,809 --> 00:33:58,809
Tae Woong,

536
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,339
isn't it uncomfortable
having her throw herself at you?

537
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,849
It's fine.

538
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:06,849
Seriously.

539
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,219
Don't be nice to her
for your elders' sake.

540
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,519
You can be honest with us.

541
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,389
If you feel uncomfortable,
just say it.

542
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,019
It's fine.

543
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,429
I'm going to tantalize her
for a bit...

544
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,460
and then give in.

545
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,130
Tae Woong, are you still drunk?

546
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,099
Tae Woong, are you okay?

547
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,239
Has it been exhausting for you?

548
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,710
You're not one
to say things like that.

549
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,440
It's nice to eat at home
after a while.

550
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,619
Oh, right.

551
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,389
Mom, here's your soup.

552
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:43,590
Tae Woong, have your fill.

553
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,119
Give him some more.

554
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,619
Tae Woong, I'll give you more soup.

555
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:47,619
Sure.

556
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,389
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

557
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,099
She must be back
from dropping Shin off at school.

558
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,730
Right.

559
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,969
Mother, Father, go home and rest.

560
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:03,969
Mi Yeon's back.

561
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:07,079
No, it's fine.
We'll stay a while longer.

562
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,780
Did the kids all leave the house?

563
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,349
Of course. They went to work.

564
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:14,449
- A little later.
- Yes, sometime later.

565
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,340
It's okay. You may speak.

566
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,710
Oh, right.

567
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,239
Tae Woong slept at my place
and stayed for breakfast.

568
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,909
In case you were worrying.

569
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,750
Right.

570
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:46,050
Have you two gotten closer?

571
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,289
Bong Hee.

572
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,389
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

573
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:54,389
Just us two.

574
00:35:56,489 --> 00:35:57,489
Just us two?

575
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,099
I'll pick you up.

576
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,230
What?

577
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,559
See you later.

578
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,599
Sure.

579
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,070
What was that?

580
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:15,409
Thank you for breakfast.

581
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,510
Sure, Chairman Ji.

582
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,059
Mother, Father.

583
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:32,559
Can you watch the store
during lunchtime?

584
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,300
Are you going somewhere?

585
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,030
I won't be long.

586
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
So...

587
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
Sorry?

588
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:42,269
Are you meeting a friend?

589
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,070
Well, yes.

590
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,679
Take all the time in the world
with your friend, Bong Hee.

591
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,449
You don't have to leave early
because of the store.

592
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,579
He's right.

593
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:57,050
You should meet your friends
from time to time as well...

594
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,519
rather than spend
all your time here.

595
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,460
What are you going to wear?

596
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,190
Wear something pretty, Bong Hee.

597
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,159
- Yes, Mother.
- Good.

598
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,329
We're rich now,

599
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:10,469
so buy new clothes...

600
00:37:10,469 --> 00:37:13,269
and treat the redness on your skin.

601
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,969
Why let the money just sit there?

602
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,639
Isn't it about time
you had it good as well?

603
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,480
He's right.
Take half of that money...

604
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,619
and spend it on yourself, Bong Hee.

605
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,579
- Right.
- What? That doesn't make sense.

606
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,190
The money under the mattress?

607
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,150
Half of it is yours.

608
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,059
Hey, wait.
Shouldn't we keep it elsewhere?

609
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:37,289
Where else could we keep it?

610
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,690
You know what they say.

611
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:39,929
Just like eggs,

612
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:42,369
money should never be kept
in one basket.

613
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,800
Haven't you heard
that money should be spread out?

614
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,070
It's all in cash,
so we can't deposit it in a bank...

615
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,440
or buy a house for that matter.
You know that.

616
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,510
There isn't a place safer
than underneath your mattress.

617
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,579
Who would imagine
that there's money under there?

618
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,909
It's the safest place,

619
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,179
so don't worry.

620
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,719
Well...

621
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:05,019
Okay.

622
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,829
All right.

623
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,090
- Gil Rye.
- Yes?

624
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:10,449
Would you like a steamed bun?

625
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,590
I'll have one
with vegetable filling.

626
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:15,420
I'll go with red beans.

627
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,489
- Sure.
- Right.

628
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,599
Here.

629
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:35,539
How much do you think
our daughter will steal?

630
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,750
That depends on how brazen she is.

631
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,820
Right.

632
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,389
Should we have half of each?

633
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,030
Unbelievable.
You're always like that.

634
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,900
It's better to share.

635
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,030
Here.

636
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,800
Right. Here's yours.

637
00:39:57,469 --> 00:40:00,340
Gil Rye, don't you die before I do.

638
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:03,210
I don't want to have
a steamed bun alone.

639
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:07,179
We can each buy two buns.

640
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,150
We have more than enough money.

641
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,750
It's not the same, is it?

642
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,280
Sharing halves of two buns
between us isn't the same...

643
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,849
as buying two buns for yourself.

644
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:17,119
Two is too much for one person.

645
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:19,219
Half a portion is just right.

646
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,119
Those are different cases.

647
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,769
(A few days ago)

648
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:34,400
Goodness.
Where did I leave my phone?

649
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:41,579
What?

650
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,630
Enter your PIN.

651
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
(Enter your PIN.)

652
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,380
Hold on.

653
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,530
- What...
- Wait.

654
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:09,059
How can she not be worried
about keeping her money here?

655
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,269
You've got to be kidding me.

656
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:13,170
Was this the best place
she could think of?

657
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,440
How stupid is she?

658
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,809
She had nowhere else to go,
so this was the best place for her.

659
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:19,639
Do they really launch
an investigation...

660
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:21,510
if you take over
10,000 dollars in cash...

661
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,179
to the bank?

662
00:42:23,179 --> 00:42:25,750
So I said.
How many times must I repeat it?

663
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,449
She should've just taken
a decent amount...

664
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:32,690
and fled with Shin.

665
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:35,590
That darn brat. Just how much...

666
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,360
is she planning to take? My gosh.

667
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:47,539
We'll go broke at this rate
thanks to our thief daughter.

668
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:51,039
We'd have shared it with her,
but she couldn't wait.

669
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,579
Still, she didn't ask
about the money...

670
00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:57,880
or why we kept it hidden
without giving her any.

671
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,349
At least I'm pleased...

672
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,079
she didn't ask any questions
or make a fuss.

673
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,820
If she had asked,

674
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,590
we would've had to answer
her questions.

675
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:10,789
Then Mi Yeon will become a thief
like us.

676
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:15,530
Just like us,
she'll have to go to prison too.

677
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:19,199
Mu Rim said
the person isn't guilty...

678
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,239
if they spent the cash
not knowing it was stolen.

679
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,369
He must be right.

680
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:27,610
Isn't that a huge relief...

681
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:32,210
that our daughter's taking the cash
without asking us where it was from?

682
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,820
Yes, sure it is.

683
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,650
You raised her so well.

684
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,150
She was taught well...

685
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,159
to steal.

686
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,260
Do you have the right to say that?

687
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:48,059
- What?
- You and I are thieves too.

688
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,800
The apple fell under the tree.
Like mother, like daughter.

689
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,769
Like father, like daughter. Right?

690
00:44:04,579 --> 00:44:05,579
Hey.

691
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Get in.

692
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,789
I said I'd pick you up
from the dry cleaner's.

693
00:44:14,989 --> 00:44:17,190
Too many people would notice.

694
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,900
Who cares?

695
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,199
What?

696
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,469
What do you want to eat?

697
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,130
Don't ask.

698
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,539
- Why not?
- I haven't eaten out...

699
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:31,469
with a guy in over 30 years.

700
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,980
I'm dead nervous.

701
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,150
Why would eating out with me
make you feel nervous?

702
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,449
I don't know. It's so weird.

703
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,849
Goodness.

704
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,559
Shall we go to a hotel?

705
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,260
What?

706
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:08,239
Yes.

707
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:13,750
- Fasten your seat belt.
- Okay.

708
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,889
I didn't think it through.

709
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,530
He must've been overjoyed
that I asked for a divorce.

710
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,159
How could he do this to me?

711
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,000
Is my room as it was?

712
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,769
I was wrong.

713
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,639
I'll turn everything back.

714
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,809
Does the chairman know
you're coming back?

715
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,309
Of course not.

716
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,909
I'll move back in
and take over the master bedroom.

717
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:31,760
I'm starving.

718
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,699
I thought I'd never get to eat.

719
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:42,599
Hey.

720
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:44,809
(Order complete, 33 new orders)

721
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
No way.

(Seogang Apparel)

723
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:03,289

(Seogang Apparel, New order alert)

725
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,909
(New order alert)

726
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,820
- What foods do you like?
- What?

727
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:03,750
Well...

728
00:48:05,619 --> 00:48:06,690
Anything.

729
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,030
Are you angry?

730
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,329
- No.
- You look ticked off.

731
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,800
I've never been to such a place,
so I don't know how to order.

732
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,170
You do that for me.

733
00:48:22,469 --> 00:48:23,639
Should we not have come here?

734
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:26,679
All the other good places
have a long waiting list,

735
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:29,409
so I came here to eat right away.
Do you feel uncomfortable?

736
00:48:30,179 --> 00:48:31,650
I don't.

737
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:39,820
Yes, sir.

738
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:42,019
I'd like the noodles
slightly undercooked...

739
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,960
so they're on the firm side
and with less sauce.

740
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,699
I don't like too much sauce.

741
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,099
I want the vegetables
to have a slight crunch,

742
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:51,869
and slightly more spicy than usual.

743
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,670
You like your meat well done, right?

744
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,769
What?

745
00:48:58,670 --> 00:48:59,679
Yes.

746
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,780
- You heard her.
- Yes, sir.

747
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,250
Skip the bread
and serve fish as an appetizer.

748
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,650
She likes shrimp and crab.

749
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,889
Cook that with garlic
and tomato sauce.

750
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,489
Skip the red fish and fish roe.

751
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:16,389
For drinks and desserts,
if she hasn't changed her taste,

752
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,360
she'll have coffee
with condensed milk...

753
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:20,199
and a cheesy tart.

754
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,829
You'll like it.

755
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,940
You like milk as much as a baby.

756
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,769
What about the wine, sir?

757
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,039
No wine today.

758
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:37,909
She likes beer.

759
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,550
Pour her a draft beer
with lots of foam.

760
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,619
Yes, sir.

761
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:47,219
How do you remember
all the foods I liked?

762
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:49,489
You didn't just pay my tuition.

763
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,530
You were the only friend
who treated me to nice food.

764
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,030
I don't forget that.

765
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Hey.

766
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,940
Do they cook whatever you want
even if it's not on the menu?

767
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,139
They do
what other customers ask too.

768
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,239
Chefs are happiest
when the customer...

769
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,909
eats everything on their plate
even if they were picky.

770
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:24,860
- Bong Hee.
- Yes?

771
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,800
I asked to see you today because...

00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,369
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

773
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,420
I asked to see you today because...

774
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,579
You.

775
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,150
Yes?

776
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,960
You know Tae Woong best.

777
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,500
We don't talk at all at home.

778
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:05,530
He speaks even less than I do.

779
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,440
- I see.
- What he likes...

780
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,539
and dislikes.

781
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,780
Could you tell me everything
you know?

782
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:19,510
Yes. Of course I can.

783
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,739
Oh, silly me. I was out of my mind.

784
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,869
Stupid me.

785
00:51:52,949 --> 00:51:53,980
Hello.

786
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,579
Hi, Mu Rim.

787
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,250
Where are Grandpa and Grandma?

788
00:51:57,719 --> 00:51:59,019
They're at home, of course.

789
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,460
You should've
brought this over sooner.

790
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,230
You should be
wearing this right now.

791
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,059
Did you have dinner?

792
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,400
Eat with us if you haven't.

793
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,599
- Mom.
- Yes?

794
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,039
One of your buttons is off.

795
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,199
What?

796
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,809
My gosh. When did it come off?

797
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,909
Do you not know where you lost it?

798
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,110
I don't know.

799
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:24,849
Was it today?

800
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:26,750
I went out wearing this today.

801
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:30,019
I'll go say hello
to Grandma and Grandpa.

802
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,320
Okay.

803
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:32,320
All right then.

804
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,789
How silly of me.
I was just preoccupied with a man.

805
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:40,730
I didn't even know it came off.

806
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,329
How stupid. How pathetic of me.

807
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:44,829
Bong Hee, pull yourself together.

808
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,070
Where is it?

809
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:51,369
Grandma, Grandpa.

810
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,739
- What?
- What?

811
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,110
Oh, dear.

812
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:58,050
What are you doing here?

813
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,320
- Did you have dinner?
- Did you?

814
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,920
Yes, I did.

815
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,690
- I should go back to my office.
- I see.

816
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:05,889
Do you want something to drink?

817
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:07,219
No, it's okay.

818
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,730
Grandma,
I hear you have stomach cancer.

819
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:11,760
What?

820
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,900
Oh, dear. You...

821
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:16,360
When is your surgery?

822
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:19,530
It's no big deal.

823
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,969
You're busy with work.
You don't have to worry about it.

824
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,010
It'll be hard to get surgery
because of your age.

825
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,010
That's not important, Mu Rim.

826
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,179
Since you're a detective,

827
00:53:34,179 --> 00:53:36,590
you must know this.

828
00:53:37,949 --> 00:53:40,690
If you use the stolen money
without knowing it,

829
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,789
you are innocent, right?

830
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,559
Is it?

831
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:47,159
So the one who stole the money...

832
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:49,860
will go to jail
and pay for their crime,

833
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,130
but if the person's family
use the money without knowing it,

834
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:54,300
they'll still be innocent...

835
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,909
and won't go to jail, right?

836
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:00,539
Yes. Only the one who stole it
will be punished.

837
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:01,539
I see.

838
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,380
All right.

839
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,019
How is your newlywed life?

840
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,849
My gosh.

841
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:14,119
Do you want me
to give you some pocket money?

842
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:16,889
Why do you even ask?

843
00:54:16,889 --> 00:54:19,329
If you ask, he won't say yes.

844
00:54:19,329 --> 00:54:21,000
- Just go and bring some.
- Okay.

845
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,340
Grandma, I'm leaving.

846
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,840
I should give you money.
You don't need to do this.

847
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:35,210
Mu Rim is leaving. Hurry!

848
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,949
Oh, dear. All right.

849
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:40,750
Hey, this isn't much.

850
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,219
Tell me if you need more. Okay?

851
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:45,889
You should keep it.

852
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:47,960
- No.
- All right.

853
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,059
Eat something good with Soo Ji.

854
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,190
- Okay.
- All right.

855
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,130
- Thank you. I'll get going then.
- Sure. Okay.

856
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:57,730
- Bye.
- Bye.

857
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,519
(50 dollars)

858
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,159
So even if I stole someone's money,

859
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:24,289
but the family who spent it
didn't know where it came from,

860
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:27,360
the family can't be punished by law.

861
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:30,030
You, Bong Hee,

862
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:31,769
Cha Rim, and Da Rim...

863
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:34,570
won't have committed a crime...

864
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,369
for spending it while in the dark.

865
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:03,829
An Gil Rye,
missing from Cheonglyeom-gu.

866
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,400
Female, 90, be on the lookout.

867
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:08,469
Height 160cm,

868
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:11,469
purple top, beige pants,

869
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,840
and white sneakers.

870
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:29,820
- Mom.
- Yes?

871
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,190
One of your buttons is off.

872
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,559
What?

873
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:55,650
(Bong Company)

874
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,030
Hey, Seo Gang Ju!

875
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:08,599
Why did you sell it for 35 dollars?

876
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,929
If we'd sold it for 60 dollars,
we would've made a fortune.

877
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:16,170
We sold a lot
because it was 35 dollars.

878
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,309
Sit. Now that you're at work,
you should do the packing.

879
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:20,139
You know
quick delivery is important.

880
00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:25,210
CEO Seo,
the price is just too cheap.

881
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,219
We buy it for 30 dollars
and sell it for 35 dollars?

882
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:32,849
In this field,
the cost-benefit ratio is over 1.7.

883
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:34,920
They'd sell it for 60 dollars.

884
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:40,460
You seem really happy,
Junior Staffer Lee.

885
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,130
Yes. I'm elated.

886
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,829
I'm so happy...

887
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:46,170
that I'm about to burst.

888
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,940
(New order alert)

889
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:52,610
I'm going insane with happiness.

890
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,179
I am!

891
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,010
We should make a lot of money...

892
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:00,880
so your mother and grandparents
can sleep without a worry.

893
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,280
Okay.

894
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:07,960
No, don't fold it like that.

895
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,090
Is this wrong?

896
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,389
- Give me that.
- This looks fine.

897
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:13,389
- Just put it in the plastic bag.
- Okay.

899
00:58:44,090 --> 00:58:46,190
Hey, did you forget anything?

900
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,800
I found this in Mount Euak.

901
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,710
I think it's from your cardigan.

902
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:06,750
Mount Euak?

903
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:09,980
When Grandma went missing,

904
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,019
you were wearing that cardigan.

905
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:14,489
I guess it came off...

906
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:15,719
when you were wandering around
in the mountain.

907
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,889
Well...

908
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,460
Is that it?

909
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,360
I'll get going then.

910
00:59:24,369 --> 00:59:26,099
Okay. Thanks, Mu Rim.

911
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:45,989
Mom.

912
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,960
Don't think of anything
and put the button on your cardigan.

913
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:52,159
Don't be nervous because of me.

914
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,159
Mom.

915
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,000
Just put the pretty button back on
and wear it.

916
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:59,670
Please don't do anything.

917
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:40,800
(Delete?)

(Iron Family)

919
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,070
I can do the rest.
You have work tomorrow.

920
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:56,199
I don't want to leave.

921
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,269
Do you want to stay with me?

922
01:03:57,369 --> 01:03:59,010
You know, don't you?
The 100,000 dollars...

923
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:01,780
you received at your wedding
had serial numbers starting with AA.

924
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,050
What nonsense are you spewing,
you thug?

925
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,409
You didn't even get my permission.

926
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:07,349
Who are you to tell me
I shouldn't look for my money?

927
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:08,449
There's no one in this world
I can trust.

928
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:10,619
I will officially report it
on January 1.
