00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:03,303
(Episode 27)

2
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:09,643
Mother, let's go.

3
00:01:13,902 --> 00:01:15,573
(Cheonglyeom Police Station)

4
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:43,232
I saw the money under Grandpa and Grandma's mattress.

5
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,503
I also...

6
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,113
saw the 150,000 dollars you gave me as a wedding gift.

7
00:01:55,713 --> 00:01:57,213
Did you dig up money at Mount Euak?

8
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,122
Why are there wads of cash under their mattress?

9
00:02:02,253 --> 00:02:03,823
Did Grandma and Grandpa...

10
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:05,522
also dig up that money?

11
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:07,223
You too?

12
00:02:15,403 --> 00:02:16,903
Your grandparents...

13
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:20,042
first dug up three million dollars.

14
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,542
The three of us went back...

15
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:25,843
to get the remaining seven million.

16
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:27,783
But your son's a cop!

17
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,153
How could you think to steal that money?

18
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,823
Did you even think about how this would affect me?

19
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,223
From the money you stole,

20
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:39,163
you gave me 150,000 dollars which you obtained in a crime.

21
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:40,892
Where's your conscience?

22
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,962
I'm a cop for crying out loud!

23
00:02:47,762 --> 00:02:50,302
I couldn't live with myself...

24
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,302
without giving Da Rim her eye surgery.

25
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:55,212
That's why I stole the money.

26
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:58,112
I got greedy after I heard it didn't belong to anyone.

27
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:02,153
- I'm not saying I'm not at fault... - Of course it belongs to someone!

28
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:04,153
Every penny in this world is tied to at least someone.

29
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:07,623
It belongs to someone.

30
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,653
I heard the owner of the money died.

31
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:12,623
No, the owner of the money is alive and well.

32
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,193
My gosh. What do I do?

33
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,832
What have I done?

34
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:21,232
Stealing isn't for just anyone.

35
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:25,103
Not everyone can sleep at night after committing crimes.

36
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:28,542
What came over you when you lived your whole life...

37
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,813
worrying about cheating people out of even ten dollars?

38
00:03:32,183 --> 00:03:33,843
How could you steal from someone?

39
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,952
How could you stash...

40
00:03:35,952 --> 00:03:37,552
ten million dollars you stole under the mattress...

41
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:39,552
and think about spending it on your children?

42
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,193
Am I supposed to lock Grandma, Grandpa, and you behind bars?

43
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,462
This isn't why I became a cop.

44
00:03:45,462 --> 00:03:47,292
How could you do this to me?

45
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:52,732
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

46
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,732
If this had been your plan all along,

47
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,573
you should've stopped me from marrying.

48
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,712
You shouldn't have let me walk down the aisle.

49
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,443
How could you give me stolen money? Are you insane?

50
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:14,652
What am I supposed to do about this, Mom?

51
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:19,863
I'm sorry, my son.

52
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,633
I can only imagine how troubled you've been.

53
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:24,803
This must've weighed on you.

54
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:26,402
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:28,233
My son, what did I do to you?

56
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,373
I'm terribly sorry, my son.

57
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,602
Mu Rim, my gosh.

58
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,813
Mu Rim, please.

59
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,113
Mu Rim, my gosh.

60
00:04:41,683 --> 00:04:42,813
Mu Rim...

61
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:59,303
I'll go far away.

62
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:04,073
You can come with me if you want.

63
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:09,113
If you're not that serious, it's fine.

64
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:15,012
I'll get going.

65
00:05:19,053 --> 00:05:20,123
Hold on.

66
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,652
Where would you go...

67
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:25,923
and what would you do...

68
00:05:27,693 --> 00:05:29,433
to make a living?

69
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:31,032
I'm allowed...

70
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:33,032
to ask, right?

71
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:35,933
Where would you go?

72
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,272
What's your plan?

73
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,443
Do you have enough money?

74
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:48,652
Did you seriously think about it?

75
00:05:49,313 --> 00:05:50,952
Abandoning your daughter and mother-in-law?

76
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:53,823
You can't do that.

77
00:05:57,652 --> 00:05:58,722
What?

78
00:05:59,363 --> 00:06:00,962
Were you playing with my heart?

79
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:04,063
My gosh.

80
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,202
Fine.

81
00:06:08,373 --> 00:06:10,003
I was so stupid...

82
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,342
that I seriously thought about it.

83
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:15,772
But...

84
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,462
So...

85
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,592
how much did you use from the ten million dollars?

86
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,233
About four million dollars.

87
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,873
Four million dollars?

88
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:45,842
When the store was on fire,

89
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,573
your grandparents...

90
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:51,983
were keeping three million dollars...

91
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:54,113
in the air conditioner.

92
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:58,652
Seo Gang Ju didn't know about the money when he started the fire.

93
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,123
He doesn't know that he burned three million dollars,

94
00:07:02,123 --> 00:07:03,623
so we can't blame him for that.

95
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:06,722
So we have to pay back the four million dollars.

96
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,793
Since two or more people conspired to commit theft, not just one,

97
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:12,363
it will be considered aggravated theft.

98
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,303
For trespass upon residence at night for stealing...

99
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:16,332
and keeping stolen goods, you'll be sentenced to ten years in prison.

100
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:18,243
Since Grandma and Grandpa...

101
00:07:18,673 --> 00:07:22,113
committed theft twice in the same place without remorse,

102
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:25,613
they will be sentenced to up to 15 years in jail for habitual theft.

103
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:28,712
Even if they take their age into consideration,

104
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:29,983
they will receive a more severe sentence than yours.

105
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:32,923
Even more severe than me?

106
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:34,452
How could you do that twice?

107
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:38,493
Did they want to die in prison?

108
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:39,993
Were they out of their minds?

109
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:42,332
How could they go there twice?

110
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:45,102
Why did you make them go there twice?

111
00:07:45,162 --> 00:07:48,602
What was I supposed to do? I didn't know where the money was.

112
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:49,933
My goodness.

113
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,243
Ms. Ko.

114
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:08,623
Ms. Ko, what are you doing here at this hour?

115
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:15,332
Now that you're here, you should come to my office.

116
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,863
I'll get you some tea.

117
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:29,842
I thought you were going home.

118
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:33,413
I got off work, but I had something to check.

119
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:38,452
You must be busy. Please don't worry about me.

120
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:42,153
I was about to leave anyway.

121
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,823
We've set the surgery date for Grandma's stomach cancer,

122
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:48,433
so she's here to talk about it.

123
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,092
My goodness. That's too bad.

124
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,702
I'll visit her at the hospital.

125
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,773
Please tell me if there's anything I can do.

126
00:08:59,002 --> 00:09:00,773
I'll help as much as I can.

127
00:09:01,612 --> 00:09:03,013
- Chief. - Yes.

128
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:05,643
I should get back to work.

129
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,913
I'll see you later then.

130
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:08,352
Okay.

131
00:09:15,423 --> 00:09:16,452
Let's go.

132
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,393
This way.

133
00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:37,413
I didn't know you'd come.

134
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,013
Thank you so much.

135
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:46,683
Ms. Lee.

136
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:48,622
Try the meat with this.

137
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,092
It will taste a lot better.

138
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,193
Open up.

139
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:58,033
My gosh. I like the flavor.

140
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:59,533
- It has a nice flavor, right? - Yes.

141
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:02,702
Though we are working at this tiny little place,

142
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:05,173
we should eat well.

143
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:06,502
Good food gives strength.

144
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:09,143
Thank you for making this tough decision.

145
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,313
You can design anything you want here.

146
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:16,452
They sent me to the pattern team to promote Cha Rim.

147
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,823
I'm so furious whenever I think about it.

148
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:24,923
We are out of alcohol.

149
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:26,622
Oh, well...

150
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:30,632
- We can drink more later. - What?

151
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,232
That thing.

152
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,533
I'll go buy some.

153
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,673
All right. Fine.

154
00:10:37,273 --> 00:10:38,342
Here.

155
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:42,313
I brought my design book, which is my treasure.

156
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:45,813
Here, I've kept dozens of my treasured designs.

157
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,612
- Really? - Okay.

158
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,053
By the way,

159
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,923
why is four million dollars in sales your goal?

160
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,622
I mean, CEO Seo?

161
00:11:04,393 --> 00:11:05,433
Mu Rim.

162
00:11:06,563 --> 00:11:08,232
Please help me this once.

163
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:11,773
Before the thief died,

164
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,742
he had sent the location of where the money was buried.

165
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:19,313
The cops know that his minions are looking for the money now.

166
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,553
They will close in on our family.

167
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,683
It's only a matter of time before they find out everything.

168
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:28,393
I'll turn myself in...

169
00:11:28,952 --> 00:11:31,092
once your grandmother's cancer surgery is over.

170
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:33,793
I will deliver myself to the police.

171
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:38,063
Mu Rim, let me serve in prison alone.

172
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:42,102
Please let your grandparents get away with it.

173
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,643
I'll say that you had no idea.

174
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:48,242
Please, Mu Rim.

175
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,742
Mom.

176
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,882
Your grandmother is 90 now.

177
00:11:57,112 --> 00:11:59,683
She won't get the surgery without me.

178
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,423
Once she gets the surgery and leaves the hospital,

179
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:07,222
I will turn myself in. Will you please let me do that?

180
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,163
When they hear that 2 elders in their 90s...

181
00:12:12,602 --> 00:12:14,962
took the heavy bag full of money from the mountain,

182
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:17,273
they will find it strange.

183
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:20,303
And if we say that the 2 elders in their 90s went back there,

184
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:21,702
it will sound more strange.

185
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:25,783
If I say that I did it alone, the police will believe that.

186
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,813
I can't let them spend the rest of their lives in prison.

187
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:31,712
Please, Mu Rim.

188
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:34,523
Please do this for me.

189
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:36,592
Can you do that?

190
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:40,163
Please, Mu Rim.

191
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,393
Please.

192
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:46,303
Please do that.

194
00:12:57,472 --> 00:13:00,212
Hey. Have a seat here.

195
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:01,712
Oh, dear.

196
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:04,283
Sit here.

197
00:13:05,683 --> 00:13:07,553
Everything is all set.

198
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,752
We have a sewing factory to work with us,

199
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,693
and I even called the fabric supplier...

200
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:12,063
to secure the materials.

201
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:15,433
I've also talked...

202
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,132
to the material suppliers.

203
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,433
All we need now is your design.

204
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:20,202
I should get rid of this.

205
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,933
As we talked about,

206
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,073
we will make premium down jackets.

207
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:28,102
We will promote the products via live commerce.

208
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:30,472
We'll sell for four million dollars until the end of the year.

209
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,242
By the way,

210
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,582
what are you two to each other?

211
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:41,283
(Short jacket, detachable hood)

212
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:42,952
This is not it.

213
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,193
Do you live with Ms. Lee here?

214
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:48,122
This is too old-fashioned. This isn't it either.

215
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,732
It's no big deal in this day and age.

216
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:54,263
(Pocket style, exposed pocket)

217
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:58,573
This is my favorite.

218
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:03,842
Well... I know you're talented.

219
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,242
Let's throw these away.

220
00:14:06,242 --> 00:14:07,712
What you've done, what you've wanted to do,

221
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,712
and what's easy. We can do things like that.

222
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:12,323
We will start over. You can't go home.

223
00:14:12,323 --> 00:14:13,653
Are you serious?

224
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,923
We have no time to waste.

225
00:14:17,193 --> 00:14:19,462
We're in a hurry. Here.

226
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,592
I can't believe this.

227
00:14:23,393 --> 00:14:25,403
I just offered my resignation, you know.

228
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:26,632
Ms. Lee and I...

229
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:30,832
will start dating if you give me a good design.

230
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,803
If you don't, we will be arch-enemies.

231
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,643
The relationship between us...

232
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,543
and the fate of our families lies in your hands.

What?

237
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:48,773
You should take your medicine before bed.

238
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:51,972
What? My goodness. Give me mine.

239
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:04,352
Why are you back so late?

240
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,823
We took our medicine.

241
00:17:06,823 --> 00:17:08,122
You didn't.

242
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:10,793
I think I did.

243
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:14,832
Sleep tight.

244

246
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,612
What?

247
00:17:28,483 --> 00:17:29,953
Did you see her face?

248
00:17:29,953 --> 00:17:33,352
I can't see a thing without my glasses.

249
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:34,483
Why?

250
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,422
She looked lonely.

251
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,122
Was I mistaken?

252
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,063
She had the same face as when her husband died.

253
00:17:42,932 --> 00:17:44,463
I'm wide awake now.

254
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:46,003
I hope I die...

255
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:48,533
before I become too much of a burden to her.

256
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:51,503
That's my biggest wish too.

257
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,942
Not to be a nuisance to her.

258
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,622
Be careful.

259
00:18:15,632 --> 00:18:16,892
- You're good at this. - Yes.

260
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:20,432
Be careful.

261
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,733
Okay. There.

262
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:23,432
How does it look?

263
00:18:23,832 --> 00:18:26,203
Flap your arms and see if it's comfortable.

264
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,172
Careful.

265
00:18:28,203 --> 00:18:29,543
Try not to prick yourself on the pins.

266
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,112
I'm okay.

267
00:18:32,582 --> 00:18:33,912
My arms are comfy.

268
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:36,553
Okay, that's enough.

269
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,253
You'll wear something thicker underneath.

270
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:40,582
Should it be bigger?

271
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:42,493
Then I'll look fat, like a snowman.

272
00:18:43,692 --> 00:18:44,723
How's the waist?

273
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:45,723
The waist?

274
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:48,092
If I fasten the zipper and buttons...

275
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:50,963
Take it off.

276
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,003
No. I'll keep it on a bit longer.

277
00:18:53,463 --> 00:18:55,672
So I can tell for sure what needs to be changed.

278
00:18:56,332 --> 00:18:57,632
I'm hungry.

279
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,402
Shall I buy and cook some ramyeon?

280
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:00,842
That would be nice.

281
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,313
I'll keep this on when I eat too...

282
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:04,543
and see how it feels.

283
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,513
You can't. The pins will kill you.

284
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:07,713
- Take it off. - No.

285
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,112
Don't touch me.

286
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,783
I want to keep it on.

287
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,152
My goodness...

288
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:14,682
We must forge ahead until we make four million dollars.

If Ms. Baek reports us on the first of January,

290
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,553
we'll all be done for.

00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:42,513
Sorry. My bad.

295
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:46,483
- It will be fine. - Yes.

296
00:19:47,422 --> 00:19:49,352
That hurts. Be gentle.

297
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,223
Sorry about that.

298
00:19:53,763 --> 00:19:54,793
That hurt.

299
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,793
- See you later. - Okay.

300
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,263
Be quick.

301
00:20:01,362 --> 00:20:02,973

Leave.

310
00:21:15,663 --> 00:21:16,893
Get out.

357
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:42,633
Don't you know I don't like spinach?

358
00:24:43,472 --> 00:24:46,873
Tae Woong likes spinach, but you don't.

359
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:49,472
Who am I supposed to consider when cooking?

360
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,542
I'm fine, Ms. Bae.

361
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:53,712
You should cook according to Tae Woong's preference.

The spinach dish is delicious today.

364
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:01,923
Really?

365
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:05,992
This isn't how you were when Gang Ju was around.

366
00:25:06,692 --> 00:25:09,863
You told Gang Ju that men are never picky eaters...

367
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:11,933
and forced him to eat what he hated.

368
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:13,903
Unbelievable.

Is it because Tae Woong's your biological son?

370
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:19,202
Hold on. You're a guest in this house...

371
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,212
who's even staying for breakfast.

372
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,613
Shouldn't you quietly eat...

373
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:28,752
what the homeowners like and be grateful?

374
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:33,482
How can you be this rude...

375
00:25:34,323 --> 00:25:35,353
when you're a guest?

376
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,522
"A guest?"

377
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:42,492
Gosh, please don't argue.

378
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:44,192
I'll cook it all starting tomorrow.

379
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,532
What Tae Woong likes, what you like, and what Ms. Baek likes.

380
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:50,732
Every meal will be a feast,

381
00:25:51,272 --> 00:25:53,942
so please refrain from loud arguments.

382
00:25:55,573 --> 00:25:56,742
Can I have more spinach?

383
00:25:56,942 --> 00:25:58,042
- Sure. - It's good.

384
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:00,113
My gosh.

385
00:26:03,883 --> 00:26:06,522
How did you know what I liked?

386
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:09,222
I asked Bong Hee.

387
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:12,492
There isn't a single thing she doesn't know about you.

388
00:26:14,522 --> 00:26:15,563
Father.

389
00:26:15,962 --> 00:26:18,333
Are you sure you two are just friends?

390
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:20,702
- It doesn't seem that way. - What?

391
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:23,633
Didn't one like the other back in college?

392
00:26:24,272 --> 00:26:25,603
Who? Me?

393
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:28,103
Gosh, no.

394
00:26:29,313 --> 00:26:31,012
- I mean Mother. - What?

395
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:34,343
I doubt it.

396
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:38,722
Father, you should date her.

397
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:41,653
My driver will hear you.

398
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:43,323
That reminds me.

399
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:45,863
Mr. Park, drive yourself to the office.

400
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:47,022
Sure.

401
00:26:50,232 --> 00:26:52,032
- You can ride with me. - What?

402
00:26:52,802 --> 00:26:53,802
Come on.

403
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:57,972
Sure, I'll...

404
00:27:03,113 --> 00:27:04,542
Did Bong Hee say that?

405
00:27:04,772 --> 00:27:06,643
As if she needs to say it for me to know.

406
00:27:07,012 --> 00:27:08,343
I'm not fond of her rosy cheeks.

407
00:27:08,952 --> 00:27:11,212
Her rosy cheeks make her look adorable.

408
00:27:14,623 --> 00:27:16,222
I don't like how stubborn she is.

409
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,593
Is there anyone who isn't a bit stubborn?

410
00:27:20,363 --> 00:27:22,133
She's too straightforward.

411
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:24,762
A woman who always beats around the bushes?

412
00:27:25,192 --> 00:27:26,532
It's exhausting.

413
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,732
She always adheres to the rules.

414
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:31,433
She's unyielding which frustrates me.

415
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,373
I bet she'll stay straight even without the law.

416
00:27:35,772 --> 00:27:37,042
Isn't that a good quality?

417
00:27:38,113 --> 00:27:39,413
She doesn't think highly of me.

418
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,212
- I doubt it. - Seriously.

419
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,752
If only you saw how she treated me.

420
00:27:51,653 --> 00:27:52,663
Hey!

421
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:57,633
Gosh, just thinking about it...

422
00:28:00,802 --> 00:28:03,373
I've seen her in close proximity for years now.

423
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:05,603
If there was anyone like her in my life,

424
00:28:05,603 --> 00:28:07,442
I'd date her and pop the question.

425
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,843
Wear this.

426
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:12,042
It's okay.

427
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:14,982
Keep it simple and let go of the past.

428
00:28:15,413 --> 00:28:16,683
Apologize and call it even.

429
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:18,613
Say it's all right and call it even.

430
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,552
Seriously. I can't think of a good quality she has.

431
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,722
What if another man gets to her first?

432
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:28,863
Another man?

433
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,002
Come on. As if that would ever happen.

434
00:28:33,302 --> 00:28:35,833
It's highly unlikely.

435
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:38,732
Weighing your options too much will only result in your loss.

436
00:28:39,742 --> 00:28:42,472
Father, you hate to lose out on things.

437
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:47,183
At this age?

438
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:51,113
I'll help you.

439
00:29:00,492 --> 00:29:01,492
Be careful.

440
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:12,942
Please be careful.

441
00:29:12,942 --> 00:29:15,302
Mom, did you buy a bed?

442
00:29:15,442 --> 00:29:17,012
Shouldn't you be off to the office?

443
00:29:18,212 --> 00:29:20,782
I took a day off today. Is it yours?

444
00:29:21,942 --> 00:29:23,883
Hold on. What's with the bed?

445
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:26,022
Bong Hee, do you also want...

446
00:29:26,022 --> 00:29:27,522
- to sleep in a bed? - Right.

447
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:28,823
Goodness.

448
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,492
My gosh.

449
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:40,403
- Can you move it inward? - Sure.

450
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:41,532
Yes, a bit more.

451
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:43,002
Gosh, thank you.

452
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:44,702
- Thank you for your hard work. - Take care.

453
00:29:47,843 --> 00:29:50,873
You hate sleeping in beds due to back pain.

454
00:29:51,143 --> 00:29:52,883
Am I not allowed to also sleep in a bed?

455
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,083
I wanted to sleep in a bed too.

(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

457
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:18,302
I got the signatures from the two witnesses.

458
00:30:18,403 --> 00:30:19,442
Let's go.

459
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:22,242
Where?

460
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:26,482
We agreed to register our marriage today.

461
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:29,313
Oh, right.

462
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,583
Are you busy?

463
00:30:37,722 --> 00:30:38,722
We'll go some other time.

464
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:42,593
But it won't take long.

465
00:30:44,393 --> 00:30:45,433
Later.

466
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:47,363
It's hardly urgent.

467
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,073
What...

468
00:30:53,472 --> 00:30:54,673
Why are you leaving alone?

469
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:57,413
I'm leaving the office to work on something.

470
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,113
Hold on.

471
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:04,413
Weren't you going to the borough office together?

472
00:31:06,153 --> 00:31:08,083
He must not want to register our marriage.

473
00:31:08,282 --> 00:31:09,323
Why not?

474
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:11,452
Oh, right.

475
00:31:12,123 --> 00:31:13,563
His grandmother...

476
00:31:13,692 --> 00:31:15,022
will be having surgery for stomach cancer.

477
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:18,363
Even his mother came by the station last night.

478
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:21,363
Is that why he's like a dead man walking?

479
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:24,433
Could it be serious?

(Medicine)

481
00:31:29,073 --> 00:31:31,173
Do they take all of these every day?

482
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:32,942
They take a fistful.

483
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,512
Always remember they must eat well in order to take their medicine.

484
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:40,853
Bong Hee, maybe it should continue to stay your task.

485
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,923
- Da Rim, remember this too. - What?

486
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:45,863
Their medicine in the morning...

487
00:31:46,262 --> 00:31:47,492
is different from what they take in the evening.

488
00:31:47,722 --> 00:31:49,433
They take different ones after lunch and also before bed.

489
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,532
This is your grandmother's.

490
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:55,302
This is your grandfather's.

491
00:31:56,232 --> 00:31:57,802
What's so complicated?

492
00:31:57,903 --> 00:31:59,403
Stay alert and listen to the instructions.

493
00:31:59,742 --> 00:32:01,603
You and your aunt will hand them out starting today.

494
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:02,813
Come to me if you have any questions.

- Well... - Mi Yeon.

496
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:07,883
Bong Hee, please.

497
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:10,653
I'm not smart enough to memorize all this.

498
00:32:10,653 --> 00:32:12,522
If something goes wrong because I gave them the wrong pill,

499
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,522
you'll hold me accountable.

500
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:17,052
Don't wiggle yourself out of this and listen up.

501
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,492
Are they not the parents that gave birth to you?

502
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,022
A daughter-in-law could never outdo a daughter.

503
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,563
Bong Hee, what has gotten into you?

504
00:32:25,032 --> 00:32:26,103
Are you going somewhere?

505
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:27,962
Are you remarrying?

506
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:30,403
Da Rim, listen up.

507
00:32:31,002 --> 00:32:32,843
There is a medicine...

508
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:35,502
that is taken twice a day and one that is taken once a day.

509
00:32:35,942 --> 00:32:38,143
This should be taken before bed.

510
00:32:38,143 --> 00:32:40,683
They take this first thing in the morning.

511
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:43,613
Mom, you're confusing us, so slow down.

512
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,282
Your grandfather can stick to his intake plan,

513
00:32:46,282 --> 00:32:49,692
but your grandmother can't take this orange pill...

514
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:51,653
because she'll soon have her surgery.

515
00:32:51,992 --> 00:32:54,663
This is a blood thinner.

516
00:32:54,863 --> 00:32:56,663
Her doctor said that taking this...

517
00:32:56,663 --> 00:32:59,363
before her surgery could lead to terrible ramifications.

518
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:00,833
Got it?

Do you hear me, Mi Yeon?

520
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:08,003
Why are you suddenly putting all of the burden on us?

521
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:13,913
Mom, I'm sorry. Can you explain it once more?

522
00:33:14,183 --> 00:33:15,282
Why didn't I think of this?

523
00:33:15,282 --> 00:33:16,882
I didn't know it'd be this complicated.

524
00:33:16,983 --> 00:33:18,512

Really?

532
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:14,242
Didn't she tell you?

533
00:34:15,202 --> 00:34:17,672
She's been humming lately while serving customers.

00:34:17,943 --> 00:34:18,943

535
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:20,612
she saw her buying expensive clothes at the department store.

536
00:34:21,382 --> 00:34:23,313
Why would she need such clothes...

537
00:34:23,512 --> 00:34:24,512

00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:29,213
It's Mu Rim's mother-in-law.

552
00:35:31,552 --> 00:35:32,583
Hello.

553
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:36,222
Did you get home well last night?

554
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,822
Yes, of course.

555
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:40,623
What brings you to this part of the town?

556
00:35:41,163 --> 00:35:42,862
I was flustered last night...

557
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:44,793
and wasn't able to properly ask.

558
00:35:45,262 --> 00:35:47,503
Your mother-in-law will be getting surgery.

559
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,302
I'm sure it has been troubling you.

560
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:53,672
Mu Rim has been glum these days as well.

561
00:35:54,003 --> 00:35:55,742
He even wants to register his marriage some other time.

562
00:35:57,742 --> 00:36:00,242
Mu Rim said they should postpone?

563
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,543
Tell me about it.

564
00:36:02,382 --> 00:36:03,413
Anyway,

565
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:06,952
things seemed serious between you and Sergeant Lee...

566
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,422
in the car.

567
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:10,893
May I ask why?

568
00:36:11,592 --> 00:36:14,023
I was wondering if his grandmother's surgery...

569
00:36:14,023 --> 00:36:16,032
was a risky one...

570
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:18,293
which is why I came to see you today.

571
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:22,063
- Is it serious, Bong Hee? - That...

572
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:23,532
It's not that.

573
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:25,773
Due to her old age,

574
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:28,242
going under general anesthesia could cause delirium,

575
00:36:28,702 --> 00:36:29,713
but the surgery will go well...

576
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:30,773
since the cancer is in its early stages.

577
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,043
I see.

578
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:34,882
Dark clouds were hovering over Sergeant Lee,

579
00:36:35,282 --> 00:36:37,452
so I was worried about her condition.

580
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:39,552
Soo Ji was also worried...

581
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,483
since he pushed back registering their marriage.

582
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,092
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Ms. Yun.

583
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:46,422
Goodness. Don't be like that.

584
00:36:46,422 --> 00:36:48,523
This isn't something you should apologize about.

585
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,492
I'm so sorry, Ms. Yun.

586
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:53,362
Gosh, what has gotten into you today?

587
00:36:54,032 --> 00:36:57,132
By the way, I saw something in the alley on my way here.

588
00:36:57,132 --> 00:37:00,603
Do you perhaps know the two men in front of the grocery store?

589
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:03,972
They've been around often these days.

590
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,773
I don't know if it's us or the dry cleaner's,

591
00:37:05,773 --> 00:37:08,413
but they stay all day watching us.

592
00:37:08,413 --> 00:37:09,483
Even today...

593
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,552
What?

594
00:37:14,882 --> 00:37:17,052
They were here a minute ago, but now they're gone.

595
00:37:17,052 --> 00:37:18,152
Right, Bong Hee?

596
00:37:18,222 --> 00:37:20,862
Things have been too hectic for me these days.

597
00:37:21,492 --> 00:37:23,163
Are they around often?

598
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:24,193
Yes.

599
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:41,112
Hello, ma'am.

600
00:37:41,713 --> 00:37:42,913
Shall we?

601
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,762
I pressed the main office for its quick release.

602
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:53,922
Thank you so much.

603
00:37:53,922 --> 00:37:55,092
This way, please.

604
00:38:00,132 --> 00:38:02,233
Congratulations, ma'am. Stay safe on the road.

605
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:04,072
- Thank you. - The pleasure was mine.

606
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:10,543
- Have a good night. - Sure.

607
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,742
- Make sure you get the plates. - Right.

608
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:15,742
Keep taking photos.

609
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:17,753
She's off. Hurry.

610
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,623
Take photos quickly.

611
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:26,523
- Did you get everything? - I did.

612
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:27,623
Let's see.

613
00:38:34,163 --> 00:38:35,302
(227R 2805)

614
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,933
There we go, and now...

615
00:38:53,683 --> 00:38:54,722
Da Rim.

616
00:38:58,422 --> 00:38:59,893
Why isn't Ms. Kim picking up?

617
00:39:00,492 --> 00:39:02,833
She must've fallen asleep after all those all-nighters.

618
00:39:03,492 --> 00:39:05,293
Did you get the design to the sewing factory?

619
00:39:05,293 --> 00:39:06,902
Did the CEO like it? Did he say it'd be a hit?

620
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:11,472
I dropped the final design at the sewing factory.

621
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:14,273
He thinks the design is fresh and said it'd be a hit.

622
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:15,943
Are you happy now, Ms. Lee?

623
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:21,543
What about the cost? How much were you able to save?

624
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:23,282
We're still discussing it.

625
00:39:23,282 --> 00:39:24,983
Still?

626
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:25,983
Be patient.

627
00:39:25,983 --> 00:39:27,683
This always takes a while.

628
00:39:27,683 --> 00:39:30,092
But that means the production cost might go up.

629
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:32,293
That will result in a higher price.

630
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:34,992
You should whine to the sewing factory CEO...

631
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:36,893
about how this could make or break us.

632
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,833
He's taking this stance because you're not assertive enough.

633
00:39:40,902 --> 00:39:42,663
Is this how you are with the others too?

634
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,802
If we can't save money on supplies and insulation,

635
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:46,802
we won't be able to earn four million dollars...

636
00:39:46,802 --> 00:39:47,802
by the end of the year.

637
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,873
Unbelievable. I've been trying to cut the cost.

638
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:52,773
Remember how you foolishly sold sweaters...

639
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:55,043
- for 35 dollars instead of 60? - Hey.

640
00:39:55,043 --> 00:39:57,882
So what if we sold a lot of them for a discounted price?

641
00:39:58,183 --> 00:40:00,183
What we earned barely covered the shipping cost.

642
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:01,322
Ms. Lee.

643
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,623
Say that 10 more times, and you would've said it 100 times.

644
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:05,992
- That's enough. - Unbelievable.

645
00:40:08,063 --> 00:40:09,492
You said we were selling them at a discounted price...

646
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:10,793
to put Seogang Apparel on the map.

647
00:40:10,793 --> 00:40:12,063
But look at us now.

648
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:14,463
The puffer jacket will be pricey with it being of premium design,

649
00:40:14,463 --> 00:40:17,532
but those who bought our sweaters won't even be interested in it.

650
00:40:17,532 --> 00:40:19,672
Would they help us out by buying the jacket...

651
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:20,802
because they're grateful...

652
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:22,072
for how we sold sweaters at a discounted price?

653
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:24,443
We're standing on the edge of a cliff.

654
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:27,242
Is making it big even on your mind?

655
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:29,782
Will you start small and end small as well?

656
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:30,853
Shut it.

657
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,552
Is it fascinating to have the humble experience...

658
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,353
since you grew up in a castle?

659
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:35,623
Everyone else saves money on cost just fine,

660
00:40:35,623 --> 00:40:36,992
so why can't you do the same?

661
00:40:36,992 --> 00:40:38,023
Hey!

662
00:40:38,023 --> 00:40:39,623
Stop running your mouth...

663
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:41,222
when you have no idea of how this industry works!

664
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:42,523
If you only focus on lowering the cost,

665
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,092
that'll be evident in the quality of the clothes.

666
00:40:44,092 --> 00:40:45,793
The final product will be a wreck.

667
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,802
Do you think lowering the cost will instantly make you rich?

668
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,702
Everyone in this world value money the most like you,

669
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:52,472
so how come they end up penniless?

670
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,802
Thinking only about money will scare it away.

671
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,213
There's only a thin line between us making it or breaking it.

672
00:40:58,043 --> 00:40:59,112
My mom...

673
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:01,742
bought a bed for her room.

674
00:41:02,643 --> 00:41:03,913
What do you think that implies?

675
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:06,922
Trust me, will you?

676
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,782
She's going to move the money to her room.

677
00:41:09,353 --> 00:41:12,253
If they get caught, she's going to take the fall.

678
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:13,922
I know how my mom thinks.

679
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:16,092
She may not have said anything,

680
00:41:16,092 --> 00:41:19,163
but she isn't at ease because of the money she stole.

681
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:21,433
I'm asking you to trust me.

682
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,572
Hey, Da Rim.

683
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,112
Hey!

684
00:41:48,862 --> 00:41:49,963
No way.

685
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:51,793
Your car is nice.

686
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:54,603
- Fasten your seat belt. - Sure.

687
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,333
To Cha Rim's house.

688
00:42:00,072 --> 00:42:02,603
Did you have my address saved?

689
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:16,282
You pulled an all-nighter last night.

690
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:19,293
Are you keeping tabs on me?

691
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:23,632
A new design was posted late in the night.

692
00:42:25,063 --> 00:42:26,063
Good work.

693
00:42:30,302 --> 00:42:31,373
Are you cold?

694
00:42:32,003 --> 00:42:33,072
A little.

695
00:42:35,672 --> 00:42:37,112
Make it warmer.

696
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:38,512
(Make it warmer.)

697
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:40,342
No way.

698
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:45,152
Tae Woong, how much does a car like this cost?

699
00:42:46,782 --> 00:42:47,983
The company paid for it.

700
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:49,722
It's really nice.

701
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:51,753
I'm seeing you in a different light.

702
00:42:53,922 --> 00:42:55,663
The men you've been seeing...

703
00:42:56,262 --> 00:42:58,233
probably drove cars as nice as this.

704
00:42:59,862 --> 00:43:01,563
Okay, fine.

705
00:43:02,862 --> 00:43:04,433
You sure can hold a grudge, Tae Woong.

706
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:06,543
You're one to hold a grudge for a long time.

707
00:43:08,302 --> 00:43:10,472
Tae Woong, how's the chairman's residence?

708
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:12,612
How do the wealthy live?

709
00:43:14,112 --> 00:43:15,183
It's pretty much the same.

710
00:43:15,183 --> 00:43:16,552
You went from working out on the rooftop...

711
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,813
to going to the gym with the chairman.

712
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:19,952
You even hit the sauna together.

713
00:43:19,952 --> 00:43:21,253
Word has been spreading.

714
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:23,253
How much is a membership at a gym like that?

715
00:43:23,253 --> 00:43:24,693
You must have a VIP membership.

716
00:43:24,693 --> 00:43:26,862
Can't I work out there even though I'm not a member?

717
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,492
The swimming pool there must have clean water.

718
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:30,733
You know I love to swim.

719
00:43:31,433 --> 00:43:33,302
I bet the clothes are from where the chairman buys his.

720
00:43:33,463 --> 00:43:34,603
Which brand of shoes are you wearing?

721
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:37,273
He'll probably leave the company to you, right?

722
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:40,143
Of course he will. You're his real son, after all.

723
00:43:40,302 --> 00:43:41,972
Seo Gang Ju is nothing compared to you.

724
00:43:42,543 --> 00:43:45,012
Tae Woong, what's different about people...

725
00:43:45,012 --> 00:43:46,112
who are rich?

726
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,023
We're not at my house yet.

727
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:00,822
I'll make dinner.

728
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:03,632
Get out.

729
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,802
It's been a while since you let me be with you,

730
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:09,833
and I got excited.

731
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:14,003
I'm truly happy that things worked out for you.

732
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:16,943
The chairman and I...

733
00:44:17,472 --> 00:44:19,242
have been strangers for over 30 years...

734
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,483
but now we're living together.

735
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:24,652
Can't you imagine how awkward that would be for us?

736
00:44:26,052 --> 00:44:28,322
Am I sleeping or eating well?

737
00:44:29,052 --> 00:44:31,353
Doesn't it worry you that I might be uncomfortable at that house?

738
00:44:31,893 --> 00:44:33,222
Is the swimming pool all you care about?

739
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:37,733
Get out.

740
00:44:38,933 --> 00:44:40,103
We'll eat some other time.

741
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:19,741
Where's Sergeant Lee?

742
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:23,610
He's in the night-duty room.

743
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,550
I see. You may get back to work.

744
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:27,521
- Okay. - See you.

745
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:29,681
She was in the car at around...

746
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,920
They use general anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery?

747
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,250
Please don't worry.

748
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,431
How long will I stay in the hospital after the surgery?

749
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:45,161
They will tell you after you're hospitalized.

750
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:47,061
Mother, Father.

751
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,331
Is this what you wore to Mount Euak?

752
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,271
- Yes. - Yes, that's it.

753
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,971
What did you wear when you went to Mount Euak by yourselves?

754
00:46:56,871 --> 00:46:57,940
Why do you ask?

755
00:46:58,041 --> 00:46:59,541
I'll wash them together.

756
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:00,880
What?

757
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,050
The time when Ms. Ko was in the car...

758
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,161
There's no footage left.

759
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,101
Ms. Ko isn't here.

760
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,201
What happened, Mr. Seo?

761
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,741
Design Director Kim told me not to work with you...

762
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:05,610
and took the samples, job orders, and patterns.

763
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,741
What are you talking about?

764
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,250
Why would the designer show up and take everything all of a sudden?

765
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:12,880
She says we should never make a jacket with this design.

766
00:48:13,121 --> 00:48:14,851
What's going on?

767
00:48:19,761 --> 00:48:20,791
(Jiseung Group)

768
00:48:34,201 --> 00:48:36,871
(Design Director Kim)

769
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,110
Design Director Kim, I'm in front of your office now.

770
00:48:39,511 --> 00:48:40,840
Let's talk talk in person.

771
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,150
(Design Director Kim)

772
00:49:07,471 --> 00:49:09,641
You're a secretary. Is it okay to take a day off so often?

773
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:10,971
Didn't your boss say anything?

774
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:12,741
It's fine.

775
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:17,710
My goodness. Hey, get off of me.

776
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:20,250
Hey, go away.

777
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,750
Why are you being like this?

778
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,221
Mom.

779
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,360
You know I'm inseparable from you.

780
00:49:28,561 --> 00:49:30,161
I always stick to you like a leech.

781
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:54,581
Okay.

782
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,480
What's going on?

783
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:25,650
It is just as you can see.

784
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,351
I thought they accepted your resignation.

785
00:50:31,891 --> 00:50:33,920
I thought they would accept it.

786
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:36,530
But they canceled my transfer to the pattern team...

787
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,661
and promised to send me to the design team I wanted.

788
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,070
Since I withdrew my resignation, the design belongs to Jiseung.

789
00:50:44,471 --> 00:50:45,471
You know that, right?

790
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,670
To be honest, we drank and planned things together,

791
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:53,581
so I wanted to do things well with you as a designer.

792
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:57,681
But you don't even obey the minimum working hours of 52 hours.

793
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,150
Why would I have to work after an office dinner?

794
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,621
You let me work all night without going home.

795
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,050
I was so afraid to start all over in the tiny rooftop house.

796
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:08,521
And that's when I got a call from the company.

797
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,761
I didn't know they would want me back.

798
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:15,261
I don't need an employee who's not desperate.

799
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:17,971
You can't use my design.

800
00:51:17,971 --> 00:51:19,230
You should find another designer.

801
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:25,011
I'll discard all your work.

802
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:27,880
That's my work, and I didn't even get money for it.

803
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,911
All you did was give a few opinions.

804
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,650
I'm sorry.

805
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,221
I deserve the criticism.

806
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:49,630
Mr. Seo, it's okay for you to let me go,

807
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,530
but you should never lose Ms. Lee.

808
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:54,340
It's not like everyone in this world is like me.

809
00:51:57,241 --> 00:51:58,371
What do you mean?

810
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,300
(Bong Company)

811
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,221
My gosh.

812
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,621
What...

813
00:53:55,261 --> 00:53:56,261
Why...

814
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:59,491
What are you doing here when Gang Ju isn't even here?

815
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,331
What?

816
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,331
Oh, dear.

817
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:24,050
Did you move in?

818
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:25,420
Are you living together?

819
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,491
No, I live...

820
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:29,190
Are you living with him?

821
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,561
Have you shacked up together?

822
00:54:31,561 --> 00:54:33,291
You said you weren't dating!

823
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:35,130
You said you weren't!

824
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,630
You said you knew your place!

825
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,000
You said you wouldn't hit on my son!

826
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,241
You hit on him after saying you knew...

827
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:41,800
you weren't good enough for him?

828
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,411
Don't you know what kind of girl you are?

829
00:54:44,771 --> 00:54:47,380
Why would you drag my son down to your level?

830
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:50,650
He's staying here because of you.

831
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,451
You asked him to live with you, didn't you?

832
00:54:53,451 --> 00:54:55,820
I can't believe he's here with...

833
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,420
I had no idea I was being betrayed!

834
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,121
I was a moron for believing you.

835
00:55:02,121 --> 00:55:04,491
My goodness...

836
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,831
Ms. Baek.

837
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,500
Can't you please stay at home...

838
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:11,701
on January 1 and not go anywhere?

839
00:55:13,371 --> 00:55:15,241
What? Why?

840
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,440
Will you come to wish me a happy new year?

841
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:20,880
Have you lost your mind?

842
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,480
I'm sorry.

843
00:55:23,411 --> 00:55:24,411
What?

844
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,221
What are you sorry about now?

845
00:55:27,621 --> 00:55:31,021
How do you expect me to trust you now?

846
00:55:31,351 --> 00:55:34,460
You never do what you say and never say what you do.

847
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,261
You're stabbing me in the front, back, and sides!

848
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,230
My gosh.

849
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:40,701
I've had enough. Leave.

850
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:42,460
- Get out. - What?

851
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,331
- You're leaving. - Ms. Baek, wait.

852
00:55:44,331 --> 00:55:45,670
You're a schemer!

853
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,440
Stop clinging to my son and get lost.

854
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,840
My goodness.

855
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:55,940
Oh, dear.

856
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:07,391
Come home immediately.

857
00:56:07,991 --> 00:56:09,161
Right now!

858
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:35,550
Father's out, isn't he?

859
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:41,561
Is Tae Woong out too?

860
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:43,891
Why are you walking on eggshells? This is your house!

861
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,061
Why do you worry if Cha Tae Woong's here or not?

862
00:56:47,061 --> 00:56:48,230
You fool.

863
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:50,230
You're the problem. It's all on you.

864
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,471
I shouldn't blame that brat. It's your fault.

865
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:55,041
She's clinging to you because you let her!

866
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:57,940
Were you at my rooftop home?

867
00:56:58,241 --> 00:56:59,541
My goodness.

868
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,880
What got into you?

869
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:04,880
Why are you befriending and dating just anyone?

870
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,851
What if someone were to see?

871
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:08,851
To get on your good side and win you over,

872
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:09,951
she washes clothes,

873
00:57:09,951 --> 00:57:11,820
does the cleaning, and stocks the fridge.

874
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,761
She's determined to seduce you.

875
00:57:13,761 --> 00:57:16,360
Why would you act like you moved in with someone like that,

876
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,960
you utter moron?

877
00:57:18,661 --> 00:57:21,101
Why would you let her wash your underwear?

878
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:23,201
What did you say to Da Rim?

879
00:57:23,201 --> 00:57:24,201
Were you mean to her?

880
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:26,630
What if she tells you to do the responsible thing?

881
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:29,500
Men should always be wary of women.

882
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,971
You could ruin your whole life in one go!

883
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,371
Did you hurt her?

884
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,741
"I wouldn't dare go after your son."

885
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:37,210
"I won't fall for him."

886
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,250
"Trust me, Ms. Baek."

887
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,550
"I won't let him know."

888
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,650
That's what she promised me.

889
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,891
And she stabbed me in the back!

890
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:47,021
Did you tell her not to dare go after your son?

891
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:48,291
Without me knowing?

892
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:49,621
So what if I did?

893
00:57:49,621 --> 00:57:52,391
I wanted to pull out all her hair, but I barely controlled myself.

894
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,601
If you go back there again,

895
00:57:55,601 --> 00:57:57,101
- I will... - So what?

896
00:57:58,730 --> 00:57:59,900
Did you make her cry?

897
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,641
Did you make Da Rim cry?

898
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:14,681
Mr. Seo. You can let me go,

899
00:58:14,721 --> 00:58:16,221
but don't let Ms. Lee go.

900
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:19,050
Not all women out there are like me.

901
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,561
What do you mean?

902
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:24,360
What's your relationship with the CEO?

903
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:25,761
What?

904
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,561
Are you dating?

905
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,030
Are you really dating?

906
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:35,271
I won't tell anyone. I swear.

907
00:58:36,241 --> 00:58:37,570
Well...

908
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:41,880
Mr. Seo.

909
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:45,811
Isn't he deathly adorable and charming?

910
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:50,951
I want to date him so badly.

911
00:58:51,951 --> 00:58:54,121
He's penniless. Work with him but that's it.

912
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:56,991
I don't care if he's penniless or even if he goes bankrupt.

913
00:58:57,661 --> 00:58:59,730
I'd like him even if he just breathes by my side.

914
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:23,650
You're eating ice cream in the cold?

915
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,121
It's to shock my senses.

916
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:29,690
What senses?

917
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:32,061
You don't need to know.

918
00:59:33,161 --> 00:59:34,161
Are you okay?

919
00:59:35,261 --> 00:59:36,360
Why would you ask?

920
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,101
Never mind.

921
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,880
Your lips are blue.

922
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,750
It's cold. Let's go inside.

923
00:59:58,891 --> 01:00:00,090
What did you do today?

924
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:01,860
Today?

925
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,460
I did what I do every day.

926
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,570
Da Rim.

927
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:17,741
Are you going somewhere?

928
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:19,840
Why are you sitting here?

929
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,710
Where would I go?

930
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,241
I have nowhere else to go.

931
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:24,980
I'll just stay until I finish this.

932
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,480
It's nice here because it feels like...

933
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,650
I can go anywhere I want.

934
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:34,061
Ms. Kim told me not to let you go.

935
01:00:34,561 --> 01:00:35,561
Why?

936
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,860
She told me everything.

937
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:40,661
Can't she...

938
01:00:41,431 --> 01:00:43,130
keep a secret?

939
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:00,780
It's embarrassing.

940
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,061
People might see.

941
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:13,130
Even if I'm penniless...

942
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,371
Even if I'm bankrupt...

943
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:20,771
Even if I just breathe...

944
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:26,570
You have terribly low standards when it comes to men.

945
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,121
I'm sorry, Ms. Baek.

946
01:01:36,980 --> 01:01:39,050
I can't help it anymore.

947
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,360
That's it.

948
01:01:53,371 --> 01:01:55,070
I fought it as long as I could.

949
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,541
I held back as long as I could.

950
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:00,610
That's it.

951
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:04,780
Seo Gang Ju is a stone.

952
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,911
Seo Gang Ju is not a man.

953
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,480
I keep saying that,

954
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,991
but I can't help falling for him.

955
01:02:14,161 --> 01:02:15,190
I'm sorry.

956
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:17,190
Exactly.

957
01:02:19,761 --> 01:02:21,630
I'll do what my heart says.

958
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,900
I have nothing to lose.

959
01:02:26,530 --> 01:02:27,541
I'm sorry.

960
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,090
(Iron Family)

961
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,761
Patient, An Gil Rye. Administering general anesthesia.

962
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,730
How can you prove that you actually had...

963
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:05,800
ten million dollars?

964
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,601
With your grandfather's will.

965
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:10,741
He wrote that he was leaving ten million dollars to his daughter.

966
01:04:10,771 --> 01:04:13,811
We gave Mi Yeon ten million dollars,

967
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:15,940
so let's hand the others the same amount.

968
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:16,940
Grandma!
