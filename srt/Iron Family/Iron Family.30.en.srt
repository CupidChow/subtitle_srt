(Episode 30)

2
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,250
I'm sorry I liked you.

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,850
Was it fun to toy with my feelings?

4
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:48,289
I'm the fool for being fond of you.

5
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,890
I'm the lunatic.

6
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,659
Don't live this way.

7
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,900
Where are we on the assistance
we requested from the bank?

8
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,609
Even if a billion dollars
in 50-dollar bills...

9
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,769
with serial numbers
starting with AA...

10
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,640
were issued 15 years ago,

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,510
it is now way past
the lifespan of those bills.

12
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,849
If those bills are now
being circulated...

13
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:17,180
in single notes or even wads,

14
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,219
that's because Baek Ji Yeon...

15
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:20,319
kept the money in her safe
without spending any of it.

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,120
There's a high chance
that it's the money...

17
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,519
given to her by White Bear.

18
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,920
(50 dollars)

19
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,390
Okay.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,959
What you're saying...

21
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,629
is that the one
who's spending those exact bills...

22
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,870
dug up the money from Mount Euak.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,099
That's right.

24
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,170
Good work.

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,879
What on earth? My gosh!

26
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,219
You scared the life out of me!

27
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,180
Why were you jumpy like someone
who was caught committing a crime?

28
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,250
You...

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,920
You should've knocked
before sliding in here.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,359
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,

31
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,129
That was Intellectual Crimes.
What did they say?

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,260
What else other than
that they'll keep investigating?

33
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,560
There's nothing new.

34
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,740
By the way,
I just met with a tax accountant.

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,800
Right.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,469
If Baek Ji Yeon...

37
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:17,340
had inherited 10 million dollars
in 50-dollar bills,

38
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
December 31 this year...

39
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,310
would be the last day before the tax
on that money expired.

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,250
Including additional taxes,
she must pay 13 million dollars.

41
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,750
- Thirteen million dollars?
- Yes.

42
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,620
Once we catch the thief,

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,889
we'll be able to prove...

44
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,759
that the rumored
ten million dollars exists.

45
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:36,060
If the thief is caught
before December 31 ends,

46
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,159
we can charge her
13 million dollars in tax.

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,469
Arrest the thief
and arrest the tax evader.

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,169
It's a 2-for-1 special.

49
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,139
We must catch the thief
before January 1...

50
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:47,039
to charge her with tax evasion.

51
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,069
That's right.

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,169
On January 1,

53
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,180
she will no longer
have any tax to pay.

54
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,080
We're running out of time
to arrest them both.

55
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080

67

Are you here to try to
make me return to Jiseung?

68

No.

69

Why on earth...

71
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,319
did you ask me for a loan?

72
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,490
Why do you suddenly care?

73
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,560
Oh, now that I'm making a bit,

74
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,090
do you think I can pay you back?

75

If your grandparents, mother,

I'd have loaned them without asking.

78
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,240

you'd asked for it so blatantly.

Am I a fraud?

97
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,779
Would I take your money and run?

98
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,810
That means you can
lend everyone but me any money.

99
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,680

100

that way anymore.

107
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,579

to cover the increased order...

No. We spent a little extra
and secured what we needed.

- Already?
- Don't worry.

- I'll report you!

183
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,309
- I'll report...
- Oh, no, you won't.

184
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,809
Come here with me.

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,419
Why can't I pick it up?

186
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,990
(50 dollars)

187
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,309
Did Mr. Nam find out?

188
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:17,009
How much? Everything?

189
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:20,049
Your grandparents dug up
three million in Mount Euak.

190
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,690
It burned in the fire
Gang Ju started,

191
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,419
so your mother took them back
and dug up another seven million.

192
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,659
You're earning money
to make up the deficit,

193
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,860
and you'll return the full amount
before the owner calls the police.

194
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,960
The rightful owner is Baek Ji Yeon.

195
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
She'd kept it to avoid paying taxes.

196
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,070
I heard...

197
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,440
everything.

198
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,409
Where are you going?

199
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,080
Pretend you don't know.

200
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,940
She took one million...

201
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,779
without permission
with plans to leave the country.

202
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,379
But I came back.

203
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,690
You're the worst.

204
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,960
But you're the prettiest.

205
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:02,659
Anyway, you're really something.

206
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,929
Will you report this, Mr. Nam?

207
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,259
Hey.

208
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,700
Don't you live like this.

209
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,470
You have a nice place here.

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,610
<i>The rooftop room</i>

211
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,279
- Oh, no.
- Bom sings this "APT." song.

212
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:23,179
Wait.

213
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:25,779
We have all we need.

214
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,789
We'll return it to the owner.
Believe me.

215
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,250
This is our best option.

216
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,360
Gi Dung.
You know what my mom is like.

217
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,129
She won't leave
the dry cleaning folk alive.

218
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,230
She'll ruin them for good.

219
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,429
You don't want that, do you?

220
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:45,899
It's cold out here.

221
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,840
Hey.

222
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:52,240
If I knew there were thieves here
and I didn't report it,

223
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,679
what would that make me?

224
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,210
Don't trust me.

225
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:01,220
- See you.
- Gi Dung.

226
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,759
Well...

227
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,860
Mr. Nam.

228
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,399
Yes?

229
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,440
I love you.

230
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,429
You're unbelievable.

231
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,929
You're trying to use me again.

232
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,799
You're trying to stop me
from reporting it to the police.

233
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:50,970
Hey.

234
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,570
Get lost.

235
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,139
Gosh, I guess this is life.

236
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:01,580
There's nothing much about it.

237
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,980
What a life.

238
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,220
You were supposed to apologize
and say sorry.

239
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,120
Why did you say you loved him?

240
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,460
Mom?

241
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:32,909
What are you doing there?

242
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,379
You left home
without your winter clothes.

243
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,309
I hate you, but you'll need this.

244
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,019
You're the only one
who cares about me.

245
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,289
Now that you're here,
you should take it with you.

246
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,720
Wait, Mom.

247
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:44,990
Did you ride this while I was out?

248
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,419
Try this. Look.

249
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,629
You can't go out
because it's cold now.

250
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:51,629
You should ride this instead.

251
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:52,960
It's like cycling outside.

252
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,399
It's safe and nice.

253
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,909
Mom, what will you do
on New Year's Day?

254
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,210
You'll stay home, right?

255
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,879
You will find
Grandfather's will soon.

256
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,950
Hey, forget it.
I don't need the will.

257
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,720
Do you even know how much
I will have to spend because of you?

258
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,250
Now that I don't have the will,

259
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,950
things will work
to Oh Min Gi's advantage.

260
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,820
What does that mean, Mom?

261
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,029
Thanks to you,
Oh Min Gi will be lucky.

262
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:24,700
Do you know how much it will cost me
to get a confession out of him?

263
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,299
What are you talking about?

264
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,230
I talked to Lawyer Kang
and asked Oh Min Gi.

265
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,970
I don't have the will,

266
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,470
but if Oh Min Gi tells the police
that he stole ten million dollars,

267
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,570
it will have legal validity.

268
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,679
The police will
look into it right away.

269
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,740
I'll report it to the police.

270
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,710
Mom.

271
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,250
On January 1,
once they ring the Watch-Night bell,

272
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,519
I'll go to the police.

273
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,789
Oh Min Gi will give testimony.

274
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,919
That he saw...

275
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,559
ten million dollars in my safe
with his own eyes.

276
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,100
(222 G 3914)

277
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,039
We have to give the money
back to Mom as soon as possible.

278
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,779
She said she'd report it
to the police on January 1.

279
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,049
Without the will?

280
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,519
It is no exaggeration to say that
it's the epitome of premium jackets.

281
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,120
This is the third release
of Seogang Apparel's jacket.

282
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,320
It begins now.

283
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,950
(3rd Release,
Seogang Apparel's premium jacket)

284
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,289
Those who had difficulty
purchasing the jacket last time...

285
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,990
can buy one today.

286
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,889
This is the third release.

287
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:30,990
We have various colors...

288
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,000
- Da Rim.
- Yes?

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,799
Call Heung Mall
and ask them to wire the money...

290
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,570
right after the third
live sales promotion.

291
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,570
Okay.

292
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
(Chairman Ji Seung Don)

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,940
Seogang Apparel hit the jackpot...

294
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,980
with the year-end
live sales promotion.

295
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,639
The total revenue is
close to four million dollars.

296
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,419
Why are these two doing better
after they left the company?

297
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,690
I'm so jealous.

298
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,490
Hey. Why do you think...

299
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,289
Gang Ju hit the jackpot...

300
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:04,400
outside the company
after he learned everything from me?

301
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,700
(December 30, 2024)

302
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,569
I'd like to withdraw
all the money...

303
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,009
in this account
with 10,000-dollar checks.

304
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,549
All of it?

305
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,150
Yes, all of it.

306
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,150
(ID Card)

307
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,289
Tell Cha Rim and your aunt...

308
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:32,690
that we have the money ready.

309
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:34,630
Okay.

310
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,759
I'll go and beg her with you.

311
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,400
Having you there won't help.

312
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:40,859
I won't tell her about your family.

313
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,299
If she finds out that it was
your family, she won't let it slide.

314
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,900
Your grandmother is leaving
the hospital tomorrow.

315
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,140
You should take care of her.

316
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,710
Then...

317
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,880
what are you going to tell her?

318
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,880
My mom is gentle when she has money.

319
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:57,779
She would find it strange
and wonder what happened.

320
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,380
She would keep asking me.

321
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:02,390
But I will never tell her
about your family.

322
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,890
She won't call the police
once she gets the money back.

323
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,390
It will only bring disgrace to her.

324
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,890
Why would she report it?

325
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,500
Thanks.

326
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm glad we were able
to give all her money back.

327
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,579
You should talk to your grandmother,
grandfather, and mom.

328
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,349
They will be shocked.

329
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,779
I will.

330
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:36,990
(10,000 dollar check)

331
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,500
This is great.

332
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,680
Your grandmother is leaving
the hospital tomorrow.

333
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,549
I know.

334
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:04,450
I'll drop your grandma off
at home...

335
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,519
and...

336
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,990
turn myself in
at the police station.

337
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,759
Okay. I'll wait.

338
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,160
Mu Rim.

339
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,730
Let's call the guys over...

340
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:19,259
and have a meal together.

341
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,599
I'll cook...

342
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,000
for Da Rim and Cha Rim.

343
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,740
You should come.

344
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,779
I don't think...

345
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,180
I'll be able to swallow food
sitting in front of them.

346
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,349
Okay. I understand.

347
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,390
I'll see you
at the police station tomorrow.

348
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Where's Soo Ji?

349
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,519
She got off work.

350
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,980
Let's go home together.

351
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,750
I'm waiting for Officer Park.

352
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,890
When is your grandmother
leaving the hospital?

353
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,059
Tomorrow.

354
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,769
She must've gone through a lot.
Is she all right now?

355
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:32,940
Yes.

356
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:35,869
I'll get going then.

357
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,009
Okay.

358
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:49,519
What about Mu Rim?

359
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,220
He's busy with work.

360
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:55,259
- Mom.
- Hey. Come and have a seat.

361
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:56,960
- Cha Rim.
- Hey.

362
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,660
Mom, Tae Woong is here.

363
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,430
What?

364
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,900
I didn't prepare a lot.

365
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,740
It's okay. What matters is
that we're eating together.

366
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,210
Why isn't he coming?

367
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,539
He's parking the car.

368
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,670
This looks delicious.

369
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,009
What's with you two?

370
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,220
Mother, it's me.

371
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,619
Hey. Welcome, Tae Woong.

372
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,619
Have a seat.

373
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,420
I'll go wash my hands first.

374
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,230
Are you two...

375
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,529
seeing each other?

376
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,730
Ask him.

377
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,369
Hey. What did Tae Woong say to you?

378
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,069
Did he ask you out?
Did he ask you to be his girlfriend?

379
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,140
You don't trust me.

380
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,940
You should ask Tae Woong yourself.

381
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,720
I'll bring my date then.

382
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,950
What date?

383
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,650
I'll bring someone over too
just like Cha Rim.

384
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,019
I'm allowed, right?

385
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:00,759
Gang Ju hasn't had
a home-cooked meal in a while.

386
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:03,289
I feel bad that he has
to order in every day.

387
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,930
These are dishes
that he likes as well.

388
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,759
No. Sit back down.

389
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,369
There's more than enough food.

390
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,039
Why would he join us
when we're having a family dinner?

391
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,769
You're okay with Cha Rim
bringing her boyfriend, but...

392
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:16,740
Who are you to discriminate?

393
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,380
He's more a sworn enemy
than a stranger.

394
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,410
Do as I say and don't invite him.

395
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,279
Scoop up another bowl of rice
and lay out a spoon and chopsticks.

396
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,019
What? You brat.

397
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,289
- Goodness.
- I'm staying out of this.

398
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,359
- Gang Ju.
- What?

399
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,160
My mom invited you over for dinner.

400
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,799
Did she already forgive me?

401
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,200
She cooked a lot of the dishes
that you liked.

402
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,029
- Really?
- Yes. Let's go.

403
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:55,609
How brazen can one be?

404
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,049
Can you even stomach all this?

405
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,150
I'll enjoy the meal.

406
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,049
Don't let her discourage you
and enjoy.

407
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,250
Here. Open up.

408
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,619
I also have hands, Da Rim.

409
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,559
Eat for now. Here.

410
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,789
It's delicious, Da Rim.

411
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,700
It's been a while
since I had a home-cooked meal.

412
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,799
I know.

413
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,569
Tae Woong, have some.

414
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,240
- Right.
- Would you like more stew?

415
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,509
Sure.

416
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:22,910
You said
you'd be calling Mu Rim over too.

417
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,470
Tae Woong,

418
00:23:24,609 --> 00:23:28,109
did you and Cha Rim
decide to give it a shot?

419
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,410
Yes.

420
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,420
I'm also dating this guy, Mom.

421
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:38,990
Are you sure
when she can be bratty and rude?

422
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:40,920
You must be serious
about relationships.

423
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,859
Mom, please.

424
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,799
I have a temper as well.

425
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,859
She cuts me slack
a lot of the time too.

426
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,599
Gosh, this is great news.

427
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:54,500
My goodness.
Don't feel burdened by this at all.

428
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:57,970
I won't say anything
even if you two end things.

429
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:02,250
Don't mind me and try to be...

430
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:04,450
in a normal relationship with her.

431
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:06,819
Don't worry, Mother.

432
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,119
Be fond of Gang Ju too, Mom.

433
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,829
You. Don't date that nuisance.

434
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,160
You can call me Gang Ju.

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,529
- Don't date Seo Gang Ju.
- Why not?

436
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,529
I don't want to eat with him
at the same table...

437
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,269
nor do I want to see him eat
the food that I made.

438
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,769
Why not?

439
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,710
He made up
for burning down the dry cleaner's.

440
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,339
You don't know men, that's all.

441
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,140
Men should be like Tae Woong.

442
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,950
Responsible, competent, trustworthy,

443
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,710
and handsome.

444
00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:41,250
Gang Ju is way better looking...

445
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,319
and is more trustworthy,
competent, and responsible.

446
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,660
Let's not exaggerate.
That I can't agree with.

447
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,119
That clearly isn't true.

448
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,660
Thank you for the meal.

449
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,460
Where are you going?

450
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,329
I'll head back up.

451
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,039
This might give you indigestion,
but stay seated and eat your fill.

452
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,569
There are lots
of delicious food here.

453
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:04,339
You'll be carrying him around
on your back in due time.

454
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,609
You don't have to, Mother.

455
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,680
Mother, my foot. I'm Ms. Ko to you.

456
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,380
Of course, Mother.

457
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,349
My gosh.

458
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,890
- Go ahead.
- Are you done?

459
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,319
Eat up.

460
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:33,000
As of December 31,
we are closing for good. Apologies.

461
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,710
(Shinhyub Bank)

462
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,759
Who is it?

463
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,190
Hello, Black Bear.

464
00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:31,799
It's Seo Gang Ju.

465
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,359
- As in White Bear's grandson?
- Yes.

466
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,930
I heard you still manage...

467
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,940
the largest amount of money
in the business.

468
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,140
And? Is something up?

469
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,740
I called to ask for a favor.

470
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:45,980
I'd appreciate your help.

471
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:48,650
Sure. Come see me.

472
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,269
(10,000 dollars)

473
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,680
Since you came to us,

474
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,190
we'll remove this
for security reasons.

475
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,589
Come this way.

476
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,299
Can you tie 100 notes
of 50-dollar bills per wad...

477
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,940
with yellow rubber bands if possible?

478
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:52,069
I came to my mom's after getting
the rest in 50-dollar bills...

479
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:53,539
to make up the entire ten million dollars.

480
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,900
It's over now.

481
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,039
Both our moms can sleep with ease.

482
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:00,579
I'll be in touch.

483
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,980
Would you like a bottle each?

484
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,779
No, we're good.

485
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,240
Are you coming back home?

486
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,740
What? Oh, yes.

487
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,240
Hi, sir.

488
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,509
It's been a while.

489
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:33,640
It'll be over soon.

490
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,210
What are you up to, Mom?

491
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,950
I told you
I'd be reporting the stolen money.

492
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,720
I was discussing the details
with my lawyer.

493
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,089
Oh Min Gi agreed to testify...

494
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,990
that he stole ten million dollars
from your safe.

495
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,289
In return, he requested...

496
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,099
that you pay a million dollars
and cover his gambling debt.

497
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:56,529
Unbelievable.

498
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,299
He thinks he can walk all over me.

499
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,039
I have no other choice
but to accept the deal.

500
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
Ms. An,
your blood pressure is stable.

501
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,049
You may go home.

502
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:17,349
I'll take out the needle.

503
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,160
Thank you, nurse.

504
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,059
(Sein General Hospital)

505
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,930
Yes?

506
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,000
Who?

507
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Yes.

508
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,069
Ms. An Gil Rye
will soon be discharged.

509
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,509
Sure.

510
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,450
You didn't all have to come today.

511
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,319
You're finally smiling, Mom.

512
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,019
When will you leave?

513
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,059
I thought you had left that day.

514
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,190
Grandma, should I throw out
the remaining diapers?

515
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,000
What for? We could still use those.

516
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,700
Bong Hee, I'll go and pay
the hospital bill.

517
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,839
Gosh, Father. Let me do that.

518
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,769
But... Bong Hee, hold on.

519
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,609
(Sein General Hospital)

520
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:13,640
Bong Hee.

521
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,309
Yes, Father?

522
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,549
Pay it with this.

523
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,319
No, Father.

524
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,119
I'll charge it on my credit card.

525
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,990
Why would you when we have the cash?

526
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,759
The card might bounce
due to it being a lot.

527
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,089
With the laparoscopic surgery...

528
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,990
and all the days staying here?

529
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,900
- This is a time to spend the money.
- But...

530
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,930
Sure. I'll be right back.

531
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,799
- Don't take too long.
- Sure.

532
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:50,650
I'm afraid the card
has been maxed out.

533
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:52,349
Goodness.

534
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,279
By how much?

535
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,490
Can you try again
with a lower amount?

536
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:57,720
I didn't bring any cash.

537
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,119
Let me try, then.

538
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,529
I put 4,200 dollars
on the credit card.

539
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:07,029
You still owe 300 dollars.

540
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,170
That's how much extra you must pay.

541
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:11,269
Okay.

542
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,509
Here.

543
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:25,519
Ms. Ko.

544
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,250
Oh, my gosh. You're here.

545
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,849
I said I'd help you get home.

546
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,390
I should've gotten here
a bit sooner.

547
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,890
Will you cancel her payment...

548
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,730
and put it on this?

549
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,529
Don't.
I paid for everything already.

550
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:40,630
It's fine.

551
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,200
Put it on this card, please.

552
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,329
Okay.

553
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,099
And give me those bills.

554
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:48,000
Why would you do this?
I feel so uncomfortable.

555
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,710
(50 dollars, serial number AA)

556
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:03,089
Ms. Ko.

557
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:06,220
- Yes?
- Let's see inside your bag.

558
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:09,829
What?

559
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,039
Hey.

560
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,140
- What's taking Bong Hee so long?
- What?

561
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,650
Go and check, Da Rim.

562
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,380
- Yes, Grandma.
- Go on.

563
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,329
I had my doubts.

564
00:33:53,869 --> 00:33:54,869
So...

565
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:56,769
Ms. Yun.

566
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,369
Ko Bong Hee.

567
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,950
The bills you just tried to spend.

568
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:09,820
It's part of
a ten-million-dollar slush fund...

569
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,789
a thief buried here in Mount Euak.

570
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,760
We've been tracing the bills.

571
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,860
Since you could destroy evidence,

572
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:21,659
as of this moment, Ko Bong Hee,

573
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:24,630
I'm arresting you...

574
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,800
for obtaining stolen goods.

575
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,139
You have the right to hire a lawyer,

576
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,139
and you can challenge this arrest.

577
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,380
I need you to come with me
to the police station.

578
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,820
If you don't cooperate,
I must handcuff you.

579
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:49,090
Please come quietly.

580
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:52,730
Let me make just one call.

581
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,030
We will...

582
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:57,829
contact your family.

583
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:27,460
Mom!

584
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,969
Why are you taking her away?

585
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,340
Da Rim!

586
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,139
Mom!

587
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,260
Mu Rim.

588
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,460
Your chief arrested Mom.

589
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,090
Do you know something?

590
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,429
She was arrested?

591
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,130
Hang up.

592
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,530
Did the chief say anything?

593
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,800
Is something wrong?

594
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,599
(Chief Yun Mi Ok)

595
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,550
I told Mr. Oh what to say.

596
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:25,190
You must call the police tomorrow.

597
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,590
Make a report,

598
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:29,030
cause a fuss,
and demand they find your money.

599
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,889
That will get them
to move faster, okay?

600
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,400
Okay.

601
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,800
I can't believe that
in just a few hours,

602
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,670
I won't have to pay any taxes.

603
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,400
I'll be in touch.

604
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:42,670
Bye.

605
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,980
Why are you standing there
with the luggage?

606
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,650
Kick Tae Woong out
and take over his room.

607
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,050
I have something to tell you.

608
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,179
Let's sit down.

609
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,849
Did you hear that?

610
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:01,090
No one can call me a tax evader now.

611
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,130
I really didn't want you...

612
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,530
to be ridiculed and criticized
by the public.

613
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,699
So I came back to stop you
from reporting the theft.

614
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,940
I have something for you.

615
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,139
What is it?

616
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:17,909
(Crosswalk)

617
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,610
Just a moment, Mom.

618
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:33,090
Mu Rim's mother-in-law,
the police chief,

619
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:35,289
caught Mom spending the cash
from Mount Euak.

620
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,929
She took the bills.

621
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,460
I think she knows
Mom dug it up and kept it...

622
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:42,159
at home and spent it.

623
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:44,869
She knew where the thief
had buried the money,

624
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:46,500
and she took my mom away saying...

625
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,699
she'd taken stolen goods.

626
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,809
The chief knew the location too?

627
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,239
Did you call
your police officer brother?

628
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,480
He didn't even know
about the arrest.

629
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,719
Da Rim. Where are your grandparents?

630
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,400
Mom.

631
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,199
I'm sorry.

632
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:18,429
I was going to give it to you today,
but you must wait until tomorrow.

633
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,469
Give me one more day.

634
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,739
What are you talking about?

635
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:23,940
I was going to give it to you today.

636
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,409
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

637
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,340
Call the police.

638
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,110
You just told me not to.

639
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,050
No.

640
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,380
Be sure to call the police.
You must.

641
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,530
Hey.

642
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:46,329
Gang Ju!

643
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,570
Didn't you say you'd move back in?

644
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,139
I'm a horrible son.

645
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,110
Don't leave. Do you know...

646
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,710
how poorly I'm treated here?

647
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,980
Stay with me.

648
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,409
I won't nag.

649
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,820
Gang Ju.
I'm sorry I wasn't a good mom.

650
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,179
I apologize.

651
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,920
You're weakening my resolve.

652
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:13,190
Gang Ju. You can't go.

653
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,659
I'm a really horrible son.

654
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,400
I love you, Mom.

655
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,739
Gang Ju.

656
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,380
Gang Ju.

657
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,349
Gang Ju.

658
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,050
Open up.

659
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:40,219
Stay here with me.

660
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,920
Gang Ju.

661
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:54,860
Yes.

662
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,429
Okay, Da Rim.

663
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,440
We sent Da Rim to get her mom.
Why did she disappear too?

664
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,210
Yes, why? I'm hungry.

665
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,610
So...

666
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,449
Da Rim and Bong Hee
went to get some groceries.

667
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:16,650
We're to wait at home.

668
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,489
- What? Why?
- What?

669
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:21,420
Let's go home, Mom. Dad?

670
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,460
- What?
- Goodness.

671
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,289
- Let's go.
- Okay, then.

672
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,730
Here they are.

673
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,579
- What's going on, Chief?
- What are you doing, Mom?

674
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,809
Leave my mother alone!

675
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:45,820
Stop it!

676
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,480
Sergeant Lee! How dare you?

677
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,420
As a member of her family,
as of this moment,

678
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,489
you are not allowed
to enter the investigation room.

679
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,719
It's an order.

680
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,329
Don't tell him anything
about the investigation process.

681
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,559
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

682
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,599
- Mom...
- Wait.

683
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,829
I'm Ms. Ko's attorney, Seo Gi Seok.

684
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,039
(Lawyer Seo Gi Seok)

685
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,469
I'm coming with her.

686
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,079
- Mom!
- Sergeant Lee.

687
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,710
Will you just wait here?

688
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,449
Sit here.

689
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:32,130
Oh, dear. My gosh.

690
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,159
Well...

691
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,469
I'll be out for a moment.

692
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,300
What? Where are you going?

693
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:39,800
Okay.

694
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,340
- I'll be right back.
- All right.

695
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,940
Oh, dear.

696
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,280
Don't you think
they are being strange?

697
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:48,110
What do you mean?

698
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,809
They are acting out of character.

699
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,449
- Ms. An! Mr. Lee!
- What?

700
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,090
What? I didn't even let you in.

701
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,989
How did you get in here?

702
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:00,989
You know the grave in Mount Euak...

703
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,630
where you found the 2 bags full
of 3 million and 7 million dollars.

704
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,030
You know where the grave is,
don't you?

705
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,159
What?

706
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,659
- What?
- Only you two...

707
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,070
and your daughter-in-law went there.

708
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,570
But your daughter-in-law
was taken to the police station.

709
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,699
You dug up the money
at night that day,

710
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,699
and you went there twice.

711
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,809
So you can find
the exact place again, right?

712
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:21,409
This darn brat.
What is this crazy punk saying?

713
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:23,980
What? How did you know?

714
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,119
Is Bong Hee arrested?

715
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,150
We don't have time.
If it gets longer,

716
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:30,320
your daughter-in-law
will have to come clean.

717
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,820
There's only one way to get her
out of the police station quickly.

718
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,289
We should make it look like...

719
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:39,630
you never took ten million dollars
in the mountain.

720
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,760
But how?

721
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,829
How would we make it
look like it never happened?

722
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:45,800
We should make them
find the money in the mountain.

723
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:48,300
We should bring the money
back to where it was.

724
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,809
If they find the money there,

725
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,909
there will be no thief.

726
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:55,179
But how would we bring back
the money, you lunatic?

727
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,550
We've already spent some of it.

728
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:58,710
We have the money.
We made up for it.

729
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,650
I'll tell you about it later.

730
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,079
We have to go now.

731
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,190
- Do you have the money?
- Yes.

732
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,889
What are you waiting for?
Lead the way. Let's go.

733
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,860
Wait. I'm coming with you.

734
00:43:08,889 --> 00:43:12,389
No. You're a cancer patient
who just left the hospital.

735
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:15,900
But your memory isn't so good.

736
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:18,530
What if you don't remember
the exact place?

737
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,739
I don't care. I'm going
even if I die in Mount Euak.

738
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,409
- My goodness.
- Please hurry!

739
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:25,070
- Okay. We're coming.
- Hurry!

740
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,539
Oh, dear.

741
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,260
Who are you?

742
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,829
Mr. Seo Gang Ju hired me.

743
00:43:49,469 --> 00:43:51,130
I was about to turn myself in.

744
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:53,300
I don't need your help.

745
00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:54,869
You've been arrested.

746
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,940
Things are completely different
from turning yourself in.

747
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,139
He asked me to tell you one thing.

748
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,909
Think about your parents-in-law.

749
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,110
Think about Sergeant Lee Mu Rim.

750
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:06,349
Don't ever say anything.

751
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,539
Do you consent
to recording your statement?

752
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:38,610
(Standby)

753
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:40,119
Yes.

754
00:44:45,219 --> 00:44:46,590
- Oh, dear.
- All right.

755
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,599
If it's ten million dollars,

756
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,670
it must be really heavy.

757
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,469
Do you think we can carry it?

758
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:04,610
I nearly died bringing it down.

759
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,309
Do you think we can carry it up?

760
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:08,980
We have to do it no matter what.

761
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,750
- Even if it kills us.
- Right.

762
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:19,019
Wait a second. Hold on.

763
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,130
- Are you busy?
- I am.

764
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:32,199
Ms. Ko was arrested by the police.

765
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,940
We will bury the money in Mount Euak
before the police find it.

766
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,110
We need to turn back time to...

767
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,079
before Ms. An, Mr. Lee,
and Ms. Ko dug up the money.

768
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,750
Bury the money and what?

769
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:45,409
Does that mean...

770
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,219
they never stole the money
in Mount Euak?

771
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,019
You have all the right to say no.

772
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:55,219
If you were involved in a crime,

773
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:58,030
it might put you in trouble too.

774
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,800
I'm sorry.

775
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,599
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

776
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,940
Are you done?

777
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,840
I'm sorry, but I need to go out
and take care of something.

778
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,039
You don't have to pay.

779
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,980
Please take your time
and close the door on your way out.

780
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,280
I'm so sorry.

781
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:03,530
Thank you.

782
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,929
Do you think the two of us
can carry ten million dollars?

783
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,199
Should we bring Da Rim too?

784
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,039
Tomorrow, my mom will be
criticized by the whole country.

785
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,300
I don't want Da Rim
to bury the money.

786
00:47:16,409 --> 00:47:19,440
That means Da Rim will play
a role in making my mom suffer.

787
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,510
Me being a bad guy
is enough for now.

788
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:29,650
My goodness.

789
00:47:29,989 --> 00:47:31,889
Thank you, Gi Dung.

790
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:35,460
You're here to help us, Gi Dung.

791
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,190
Thank you so much.

792
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,460
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

793
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,159
I can't thank you enough.

794
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:43,969
Here.

795
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:46,130
Excuse me.

(Cha Rim)

797
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,909
- This winter...
- Your phone...

798
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,880
has been ringing for quite a while.
You can answer it.

799
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,349
- I'm sorry.
- Go ahead.

800
00:48:01,449 --> 00:48:03,190

(Cheonglyeom Police Station)

802
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,280
Hey.

803
00:48:29,909 --> 00:48:31,880
Was this why you asked me
to lend you money?

804
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,719
Is this why you quit your job
without telling me?

805
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:38,389
Am I a stranger to you guys?

806
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,619
If your mom doesn't get released,

807
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,929
I'm going to kill you.

808
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,030
Where's Mu Rim?

809
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:53,739
(Shared security awareness,

(Honest police with integrity)

811
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,039
Can I meet with the chief?

812
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,710
The chief is now
conducting an investigation.

813
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,909
Please step back a little.

814
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,250
I think there's a misunderstanding.

815
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:12,190
What did Ko Bong Hee do wrong...

816
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:14,059
to make the chief investigate her?

817
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,329
I can't tell you about the details
of the investigation.

818
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,690
- What?
- If you keep being like this,

819
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,329
we will consider it
an obstruction of official duties.

820
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,230
- Please get out.
- Get off me.

821
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:25,769
You guys are making a mistake, okay?

822
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,000
If you abuse
your authority like this,

823

I won't let it slide!

824
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,210
Can't you find
someone else to arrest?

825
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,179
The woman in there can't even
think about committing a crime.

826
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,179
Does she have a lawyer?

827
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,650
Please leave.

828
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:44,389
Let go of me! Even if everyone
in the world is a thief,

829
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,119
Ko Bong Hee can't be one of them!

830
00:49:46,489 --> 00:49:49,260
She wouldn't even steal...

831
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,030
a dollar bill from others.

832
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,099
She would rather suffer a loss.

833
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,329
There's no way
she steals money from others.

834
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,000
Ms. Ko Bong Hee, do you even know
whose money it is?

835
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,079
This money.

836
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,550
This bundle of cash.

837
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,349
Where did you get this?

838
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,659
(50 dollars)

839
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,230
They have the AA serial numbers,
which are the same as...

840
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:32,130
the money Yang Gil Soon stole.

841
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,539
They were issued 15 years ago.

842
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,840
They are not in circulation anymore.

843
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,469
Go ahead and explain it.

844
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,050
What were you talking about...

845
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:49,150
with Sergeant Lee Mu Rim in the car?

846
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:51,820
Why did you come
to the police station?

847
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,090
Ms. Ko.

848
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,260
Why did you forbid
your mother-in-law...

849
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,469
from talking about the money
and Mount Euak?

850
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,900
Bong Hee told me...

851
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,800
not to talk about Mount Euak.

852
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:12,570
Bong Hee told me
not to talk about the money.

853
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:16,510
How did you pay
the 800,000 dollars...

854
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,179
for your youngest daughter's
eye surgery?

855
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,219
Was the eye surgery...

856
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,190
paid for only in 50-dollar bills?

857
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:31,960
There's a record
of a cash transaction.

858
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,599
Did they pay for the catering
and venue...

859
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,099
only in 50-dollar bills?

860
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,099
Yes.

861
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,000
When it was
tens of thousands of dollars?

862
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,539
How long...

863
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:49,480
How long are you going to
keep your mouth shut...

864
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,449
and not say a darn word?

865
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:11,900
What will happen to Mother?

866
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,369
Will she be questioned for 48 hours?

867
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:15,400
Mu Rim.

868
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,670
Go home.

869
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,269
She won't be going home that easily.

870
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,539
What? How could you...

871
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:24,349
Have you known all along?

872
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,619
How can you seem unfazed?

873
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:28,579
Mom's been acting weird.

874
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,849
She was going to turn herself in,

875
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,960
and I agreed to it.

876
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
What?

877
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,760
How do you all know this?

878
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:44,000
Tae Woong. Mu Rim, have you lost it?

879
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,829
How could you make Mom
turn herself in?

880
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:49,139
Was that why she moved the money
to under her own mattress?

881
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,940
How can you live with yourself?
And you call yourself her son?

882
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,780
You should've discussed it with us!

883
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,909
This was the best I could do
to cover it up.

884
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,650
Are you saying
you're proud of yourself?

885
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,980
I don't know...

886
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,750
how much the chief knows.

887
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,320
Do you even hear yourself?

888
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:09,289
You jerk.

889
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,329
- Don't.
- Stop it.

890
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,760
Why would you fight each other?
Stop this.

891
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,699
- That's enough, Tae Woong.
- Tae Woong, please.

892
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:17,099
Mu Rim...

893
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,909
We will now begin the countdown.

894
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:28,940
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

895
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,949
- six, five, four,
- six, five, four,

896
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:35,949
- three, two, one.
- three, two, one.

00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:47,659
Once again, we strike the bell...

898
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,000
at the Bosingak Pavilion.

(Cheonglyeom Police Station)

900
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:22,800
I'm afraid
she'll be questioned all night.

901
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,599
Go home. I'll contact you...

902
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:26,969
when I hear anything new.

903
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,610
Hello.

904
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,579
Where's the Public Service Center?

905
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:41,150
I heard reports could be made
at all hours.

906
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,150
This way, please.

907
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,320
Goodness.
The lead detective is here.

908
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:50,960
What brings you by?

909
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:54,329
To report a theft and to request
that you find my money.

910
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,159
Things were hectic back then,

911
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,530
and I said
they had stolen 1,000 dollars.

912
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:02,500
Let me correct that.
They stole ten million dollars.

913
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:06,239
Honey.

914
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,179
Why are you referring to me
as your wife?

915
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,110
I thought we were divorced.

916
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,250
Wait.

917
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:18,190
What are you all doing here?

918
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,730
Why isn't Seo Gang Ju picking up?

919
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,369
He said he'd be returning
the money today.

920
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:32,829
You said he had the entire amount.

921
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:34,369
He would've given it back.

922
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:36,400
He said he was at his mother's.

923
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:40,440
Darn it.

924
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,679
Isn't he picking up?

925
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,780
Chief.

926
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,260
- Ms. Baek.
- Yes.

927
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,489
Are you sure
you lost ten million dollars?

928
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,059
That's right.
You can confirm it with Mr. Oh...

929
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:04,400
who was caught
after breaking into my safe.

930
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,469
He's at a detention center.

931
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:14,110
January 1, 2025.

932
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:16,610
It's not even half past midnight.

933
00:56:17,449 --> 00:56:19,280
That's right. As of today,

934
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,820
I'm not obligated to pay any tax
from that inheritance.

935
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,690
I see. So that's why.

936
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,360
If being brazen was a crime,

937
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,329
you'd be locked up for good.

938
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:39,199
Whatever.

939
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:41,639
It's been ages since the thieves...

940
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:44,469
broke into my house
to steal from my safe,

941
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:46,539
but you've gotten nowhere
with the investigation.

942
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:47,909
What do the police do around here?

943
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:48,909
We...

944
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,610
weren't lounging around.

945
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,090
Yang Gil Soon,
who had escaped the police,

946
00:56:57,219 --> 00:56:59,150
buried the money here in Mount Euak.

947
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,219
We went digging...

948
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,519
along with those at Love Capital...

949
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:05,059
who received texts
from Yang Gil Soon.

950
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,159
- Who?
- But nothing was found.

951
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,000
Who else tried to dig it up?

952
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,780
It's true you lost
ten million dollars.

953
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,050
That's what I said.

954
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,280
Now, take me to this site...

955
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,349
and dig up the money
buried by the accomplice.

956
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:33,920
The owner of the money
should've been there...

957
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,360
rather than a bunch of nobodies.

958
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,289
How much did you dig up?

959
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:38,889
Are you sure it was the right place?

960
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,130
If the thief...

961
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,230
had texted the exact location,

962
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:45,000
the money would've been there.

963
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,130
The coordinates suggest...

964
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:50,000
that the money was buried
within a 20m radius.

965
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,269
Under the tree
that was marked with the pants...

966
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:54,610
Are you sure you searched
every inch of that place?

967
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,309
Is this you telling me
that my money isn't there?

968
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:58,780
The thief texted you
the coordinates,

969
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,250
but the money wasn't there?

970
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:01,780
Who are you to tell me
to give up on my money?

971
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:07,159
Until you dig at that location
and let me see what's under there,

972
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:08,219
I won't believe you.

973
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,960
We'll go there and dig right now.

974
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,429
You will dig...

975
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:13,929
- as I'm watching...
- Hey!

976
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:16,099
This coming from a tax evader?

977
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,300
Don't you know how late it is?

978
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,340
Who are you to order the police
as you please?

979
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:24,070
I'm not a tax evader!

980
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:26,139
You've got to be kidding me.

981

what your mother is up to?

this once?

for another favor like this.

Is this it?

- Dig deeper.
- It's not deep enough.

- It won't go any further.
- Darn it.

- Dig deeper.
- Okay.

1027
