1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,139
What if they collapse
like Grandpa...

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:05,910
when they find out the money's gone?

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,250
It's all my fault.

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:12,720
I'm the one to blame,

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:16,789
but there's nothing I can do.

6
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,489
My grandparents and my mom...

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,399
dug up the money from Mount Euak...

8
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,899
to pay for my eye surgery.

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,870
Gang Ju, what can I do?
What do I do?

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,310
What do I tell my grandma
and my mom?

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,579
What if the news
shocks them to death?

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,929
(Episode 23)

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,659
It seems that Mr. Lee Man Deuk
had an episode...

14
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,890
that was caused
by vasovagal syncope.

15
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,129
Blood and oxygen supply
to his brain...

16
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,629
was abruptly restricted,

17
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,400
which can happen
after a sudden change...

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,670
in one's physical
or emotional state.

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,370
This won't kill him, will it?

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,739
He is elderly
and has a chronic illness,

21
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,040
so we'll monitor him
closely tonight.

22
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,540
This is crazy.

23
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,459
Da Rim.

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,299
You were there.

25
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,099
How did Grandpa faint...

26
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,199
and why?

27
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,240
Mu Rim...

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,340
Why did he collapse
when he was perfectly healthy?

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,710
You said he didn't trip and fall.

30
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,509
Did he get bad news from someone?

31
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,810
What on earth could've shocked him?

32
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,210
You were the last person
to be with him.

33
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,180
Didn't he tell you anything?

34
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,650
He was conscious...

35
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,319
when you went to see him
after he had collapsed.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,219
- Tell me.
- Come on.

37
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,930
Why are you interrogating her?

38
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,360
She's not at fault.

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,860
Da Rim, I'm afraid
that's become a habit of his.

40
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,199
That was the detective
in him speaking.

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,539
Let's hurry inside.

42
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,849
My goodness.

43
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:15,530
Goodness.

44
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,500
Don't stand there
and have a seat, Mi Yeon.

45
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:21,569
Why are you acting like a damsel
in distress?

46
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,270
This isn't the time
for you to pass out.

47
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,139
Neither Bong Hee nor Da Rim
is picking up their phone.

48
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,250
So what happened?

49
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:29,379
How bad is it?

50
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Come on.

51
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,960
Gosh, you're frustrating!

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,659
Where's the ER?

53
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,460
Gi Dung, lead the way.

54
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,400
Gi Dung, didn't you hear me?

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,930
Even Ms. An has passed out.

56
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,099
Both elders might not survive this,

57
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:52,639
so how can you worry about Mi Yeon?
This isn't a date.

58
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,139
Gi Dung.

59
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,479
What was that you just did?

60
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,759
Gi Dung?

61
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,779
What if they collapse
like Grandpa...

62
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,620
when they find out the money's gone?

63
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,089
What do I tell my grandma
and my mom?

64
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,329
What if the news
shocks them to death?

65
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,949
Father.

66
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,949
If you don't wake up,

67
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:17,459
Mother won't make it either.

68
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,759
Half a person
needs the other half a person.

69
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,899
Please stay...

70
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:26,829
with Mother and me...

71
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,870
a while longer.

72
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,769
If you don't,
I'll be angry with you.

73
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,839
Father, hang in there.

74
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,060
Mother, are you all right?

75
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,230
Hey, Tae Woong.

76
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,759
Take Cha Rim and Da Rim home.

77
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,100
Get them to wash up and go to work.

78
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,300
You'll then open the dry cleaner's.

79
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,430
I'll stay here with them.

80
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,769
I'll stay, so you head home.

81
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,839
We'll have to close the store
for a few days.

82
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,610
You're saying that
as if something's going to happen.

83
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,779
It won't.

84
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,379
Nothing's going to happen.

85
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,720
We'll go about our days as usual.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,019
Head home.

87
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,259
Sure.

88
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,319
(My son)

89
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,189
Where is he and what is he up to...

90
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,990
that he hasn't come back
or answered my calls?

91
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,199
Darn it. All this
because he's fallen for a girl?

92
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,000
My gosh.

93
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,269
Mi Yeon won't be able to work
for the time being,

94
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,139
so let's hire someone new.

95
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,579
Okay?

96
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:25,480
Is there really something
between you two?

97
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:28,949
Would that be a problem
if there were?

98
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,250
What?

99
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,060
It'll seem like
something is going on...

100
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,189
if you keep looking at us
through those tinted glasses.

101
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,029
You have fallen for her.

102
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,399
You couldn't take your eyes off her
when a customer called for you.

103
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:44,800
As if I didn't notice.

104
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:47,839
Mother.

105
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,439
I'm still young,

106
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,610
and I am a man.

107
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,550
A man for crying out loud!

108
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,620
I've been trying
to put you and Bom first,

109
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,079
so it's upsetting
to hear you say that.

110
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,089
I've been...

111
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,790
fighting the urges!

112
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,089
It's hard for me as well!

113
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,230
Tears still well up in my eyes
every time I think of my daughter.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,300
Your wife who died
while giving birth to Bom.

115
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,300
Are you saying
you've already moved on?

116
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,339
Yes!

117
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,310
I've moved on.

118
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,949
How can I live
haunted by memories of her?

119
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,220
I had to care for you and Bom,

120
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,549
so I moved on a long time ago.

121
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,590
That was the only way
I could function!

122
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,320
You cared for me?

123
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,830
Actually,
it was the other way around.

124
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,460
I had to walk on eggshells
around you...

125
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,929
and made a living for myself...

126
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,659
so that I wouldn't be a burden
to you.

127
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,700
Even though I'll be turning 60 soon,

128
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,029
I cooked for another family...

129
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,740
and worked at the restaurant
in the evening.

130
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,210
Has there been a day
when my hands didn't smell...

131
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,279
of chili powder and garlic?

132
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:59,240
But here you are yelling
in my face...

133
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,980
saying that you have moved on
from my daughter.

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,750
That makes me cry inside.

135
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,690
I should be the one to die...

136
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,320
before old Lee Man Deuk does.

137
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,519
I bet that when I die,
you'll have a massive grin...

138
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,990
while sending out my death notice.

139
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,059
Is this how you betray me?

140
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,929
How could you?

141
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,730
(Kids' Medical School Prep Center)

142
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:20,830
Father. Do you recognize me?

143
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:24,659
Gil Rye.

144
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,100
Man Deuk. You're awake.

145
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,299
Darling honey.

146
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,009
Da Rim. Your grandpa's awake.

147
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,379
Fortunately for all,
the worst is over.

148
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:42,149
His blood vessels are weak,

149
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:43,750
so he must avoid
extreme emotional swings,

150
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,419
and he needs
complete and utter rest.

151
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,019
Total rest. Do you understand?

152
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,320
- Yes. Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

153
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,620
Thank you.

154
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,559
Man Deuk. Thank you.

155
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,830
Thank you, darling.

156
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,669
Bong Hee.

157
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,269
Yes, Father.

158
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,899
Gil Rye.

159
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,539
Yes? What? Are you thirsty?

160
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,279
- Do you want some water?
- Okay.

161
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,039
The money under the mattress.

162
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,779
It's all gone.

163
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,919
What? Why...

164
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,250
Why would he say that
when he just woke up?

165
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,490
The money
under the mattress is gone.

166
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,490
Bong Hee. Someone took it all.

167
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,960
There was nothing there.

168
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,269
Father. Why would there be no money
under the mattress?

169
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,200
I don't know, but there isn't.

170
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,240
My gosh. You got mistaken again,
and now you're talking nonsense.

171
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,639
Why would the money have gone?

172
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,279
Only us three know about it.

173
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,580
Who would know and take it?

174
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,379
Father. Is that why you passed out?

175
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,549
Did you faint out of shock
when you saw...

176
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,190
the money had gone?

177
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,929
It's true. I'm not mistaken.

178
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,029
What should we do now?

179
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,360
- Darn it.
- Hey.

180
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,500
Don't cry.

181
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,070
The doctor said
you needed complete rest.

182
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,039

183
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,679
Do you want to bust
another blood vessel?

184
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,879
This won't do, Bong Hee.

185
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,049
Go home and see
if the money's under the mattress.

186
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,850
- Okay.
- No, Bong Hee.

187
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,350
Don't go on your own.

188
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:29,620
Go...

189
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,419
with Gil Rye.

190
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,190
You might get the shock of your life
and end up like me.

191
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,059
Take Gil Rye with you and...

192
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,500
Okay, fine.

193
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,000
The doctor told us to let you rest
with no extreme emotional swings.

194
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,009
Da Rim, I'm glad you're here.

195

196
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:54,309
Don't worry.
Your grandpa's much better.

197
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,820
Well, your grandma and I
will go home for a bit.

198
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,649
What? Why do you have to go home?

199
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,049
We just want to get changed.

200
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,720
Help your grandpa with dinner.

201
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,330
- Okay.
- Your grandpa...

202
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,899
needs utter rest.
Remember, Da Rim. Keep him calm.

203
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,529
Okay, Mom.

204
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,899
Father. We'll be back soon.

205
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,970
Have dinner with Da Rim.
We won't be away for long.

206

Don't cry, Grandpa.

209
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,929
I don't see
why I should live any longer.

210
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,070
I'm just a burden to you all.

211
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,679
Why did I regain consciousness?

212
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,179
Why would you say that?

213
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,220
What good would come of...

214
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,950
my regaining consciousness?

215
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,389
I wish...

216
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,259
I had just...

217
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:17,190
Grandpa.

218
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,129
I wish I had just died.

219

221
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,509
Can you see well?

222
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,509
Yes.

223
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,580
That's all that matters.

224
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,490
Thank you, Grandpa.

225
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,559
Why would you thank me?

226
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:53,059
Don't thank me.

227
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,200
You should thank your mom.

228
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:11,620
Let's go.

229
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:15,789
Shin, are you here to see your mom?

230
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,019
Is Grandpa okay?

231
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,490
Were you worried about him too?

232
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,330
- You sweet boy.
- Mom said Grandpa...

233
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,600
- What?
- Wait here, Mother.

234
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
- Okay.
- Shin?

236
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,009
Hey.

237
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,409
Is Father getting better?

238
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,679
He's much better now.
Mother's outside. I have to go.

239
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,080
See you, Shin.

Why are you here?

242
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,820
Did you skip your academy?

243
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,620
I didn't go
because I didn't register.

244
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,990
Why didn't you register?

245
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,429
Your dad didn't give you the money?

246
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,370
Can you wait at home?

247
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,970
I'm still at work.

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,179
But...

252
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,649
Do you like meat?

253
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,350
Mom. I need to go to the restroom.

254
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,460
Well, ours is occupied right now.

255
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,389
You can go home instead.

256
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,960
Do you know the door code?

257
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,259
- Yes.
- Good.

258
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,100
I'll cook you some meat. Be quick.

259
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,399
- Okay.
- Okay.

260
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:42,769
I can cook him dinner later, Boss.

261
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,220
Help me lift it up, Mother.

262
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,820
Let me see.

263
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,730
Put some muscle into it.

264
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,170
If something happens
to your grandma today,

265
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,200
I'll follow her.

266
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,009
It would be easier
on your mom and you all...

267
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,079
if you were
to mourn us both together.

268
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:26,980

didn't go home to get changed?

where he put things,

273
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,329
and he seems to see things too.

274
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:47,769
He isn't in his right mind.
Could he have dementia?

275
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,339
Did he look under the mattress
of Mu Rim's bed?

276
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,740
What?

277
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,490
We should have him tested
for dementia while he's admitted.

278
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,690
What? There's a test for that?

279
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,220
You get tested too.

280
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,559
Me too? No, I'm too afraid.

281
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,529
Why would I get tested?

What?

You should eat the food
served in the hospital...

What are they doing?

345
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,529
Father, do you see this?

346
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,940
Do you see the money?

347
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,970
You were mistaken, Father.

348
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,839
You might've been surprised
after checking Mu Rim's bed.

349
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,210
See? The money's still there.

350
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,180
Here. Do you still think
the money is gone?

351
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,750
I thought you wouldn't believe it
after seeing the photos,

352
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,690
so I brought the money here.

353

Look. It's here.

354
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,359

00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,630
I clearly saw it.

356
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,500
Our money is still hidden
under your mattress,

so you don't have to worry about it.

358
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,079
Was I mistaken?

359
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,750
We saw it with our own eyes.

360
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,720
You have to believe us.
Don't say anything silly.

361
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,619
So the money is still there?

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,339
- Oh, dear.
- I'm so relieved.

367
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:52,609
Were you afraid it would be gone?

368
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,720
Where are you?

369
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,730
I was about to call you.

370
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,160
So where are you?

371
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,769
(Last night)

372
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,900
(Nothing's more valuable than money.
The late Baek Woong)

373
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,910
Is anyone there?

374
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,410
I'm right here.

375
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,519
Is anyone over there?

376
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,390
Answer me!

377
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:09,890
Please.

378
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,690
Is it a ghost?

379
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,690
Is that you, Grandpa?

380
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,559
You're protecting me, right?

381
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,329
Grandpa, it's me, Gang Ju.

382
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,299
Do you not recognize me
because I've grown so much?

383
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:20,299
I'm Gang Ju.

384
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:22,069
Baek Ji Yeon's son, Gang Ju.

385
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,369
Go away!

386
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,779
What was that? Who are you?

387
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:34,609
Are you a dog? Go away!

388
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:37,950
If you move one step forward,

389
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,980
I'll teach you a lesson.

390
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,369
I found it.

391
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,500
Thank you, Grandpa.

392
00:24:57,869 --> 00:24:59,099
Thank you so much.

393
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,809
- Hey.
- Where are you?

394
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,950
Hey.

395
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,250
I was about to call you.

396
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,460
(Washing blankets,
mending, antibacterial cleaning)

397
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,680
What...

398
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,660
Why did you do that?

399
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,430
It's your mom's money.

400
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,630
What are you going to do?

401
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,029
Hey, your grandfather
almost passed away...

402
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,599
when he found out
the money was gone.

403
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,400
What if your grandmother
and your mom also...

404
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,599
I'm scared.

405
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,210
Someone might actually die.

406
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,970
What if they really pass away?

407
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,910
Wouldn't that be even worse...

408
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,480
than getting caught by the police?

409
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:26,750
If we keep the money here,

410
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:29,089
it'll be evidence for the police
to arrest your family.

411
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,150
But without the money here,

412
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,390
your family members might pass away
considering the situation.

413
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,660
If something happens
to your grandparents,

414
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,259
you won't be able to hold out.

415
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,930
If something bad happens
to you and your family,

416
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,500
what should I do
after taking the money?

417
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,200
I was going to bury the money
in the ground anyway.

418
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
So I decided to keep it in a place
that can save people's lives.

419
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,250
Grandpa got better after he learned
that the money was still there.

420
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,220
Mom and Grandma checked the money
under the mattress...

421
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,490
and told Grandpa
that he was mistaken.

422
00:28:05,089 --> 00:28:07,390
It made him get better.
He was thrilled.

423
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,730
I'm glad.

424
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:26,579
What...

425
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,380
Keep it verbal, will you?

426
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,250
Right, I was...

427
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:41,089
I was too ashamed to say
that I was grateful.

428
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,529
How ashamed are you?

429
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,160
Extremely.

430
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:49,369
Then,

431
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,240
you can kiss me here.

432
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,299
What?

433
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,339
You're extremely ashamed right now.

434
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,420
I may be ashamed,
but I haven't fallen for you.

435
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,890
- Darn.
- Hold on.

436
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,660
You're burning up.

437
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,660
You're going to get sick
at this rate.

438
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:16,890
Have you had dinner?

439
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:18,829
I don't have the energy to eat.

440
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,000
What on earth is this?

441
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:26,500
You got blisters
from all that shoveling.

442
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,000
Do they sting?

443
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,009
Yes.

444
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,710
How did you even drive here
with hands like these?

445
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,309
It'll hurt even more
if these blisters pop.

446
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,019
- I'm cold.
- What?

447
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,450
You're staying with your mom
at a hotel.

448
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,490
Go there and sleep.
I'll drop you off.

449
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,230
I've wronged her so much
that I can't face her today.

450
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:50,890
I'm not going.

451
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:52,329
Really?

452
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,230
Would you rather stay here?

453
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:57,930
The heating is almost fixed,
so the unit is warm now.

454
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,569
Tae Woong's bed and furniture
are still outside,

455
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,240
but you only need
a pillow and duvet.

456
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,009
I'll get you some from my place.

457
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,109
- Your duvet?
- Yes, mine.

458
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:10,910
Whatever.

459
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,619
Wait here. I'll be right back. Okay?

460
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,619
Wait here.

461
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:44,750
Lie down.

462
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,549
Sure.

463
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:50,089
My gosh.

464
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:57,690
Goodness.

465
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:04,529
You can go now.

466
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,740
I'll get some shut-eye
and head home.

467
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,269
Would you like some cup noodles?

468
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,109
- Are you asleep?
- Yes.

469
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,250
Maybe I should massage your legs.

470
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,609
Are you that ashamed?

471
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,750
Yes.

472
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,750
The money isn't
for your family to keep.

473
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:26,160
Of course not. That's absurd.

474
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,730
I'm no thief.

475
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,059
I thought you came
from a family of thieves.

476
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,700
Every penny will be returned.

477
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,529
My gosh.

478
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,470
I'm only joking, Da Rim.

479
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,339
We'll return all the money
including what we have spent.

480
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,349
I'll do whatever I can
to repay the cost for my surgery.

481
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:55,180
If I can't manage,
I'll even ask Tae Woong for help.

482
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:59,559
Do you really want to ask the man
you like for a loan?

483
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,319
What will you say to him?

484
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,890
Can you tell him...

485
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,660
that your mom and grandparents
are thieves?

486
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:07,630
Like I said, it'll be a last resort.

487
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,200
While VAT is still due,

488
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,130
my mom will only cause trouble
with that money,

489
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,170
and taxes will be unbearable for us.

490
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,170
But once that period expires,

491
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:17,670
you'll return the money to her.

492
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:18,839
Got it.

493
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,680
Don't touch me.

494
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,289
Is this because you're ashamed?

495
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,859
Does that feel good?

496
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:35,890
My arms feel foreign to me.

497
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,000
It's the same with my legs.

498
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,430
Right.

499
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,569
- Da Rim.
- Yes?

500
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,339
Have you fallen for me a little?

501
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:54,609
No.

502
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,579
If shoveling my butt off for you
still doesn't make me desirable,

503
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:00,920
what will get you
to see me romantically?

504
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,319
Hold on.

505
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,329
I'm Gang Ju's mother.
We should meet, Ms. Lee.

506
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:13,000
What is it? Who called you?

507
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,829
Don't tell Gang Ju
and come to see me.

508
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,269
I'm outside the grocery store.

509
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,339
I know you're home.

510
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,900
Hae Ja said she saw you
getting home from work.

511
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,069
I'll be waiting.

512
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,109
Who is it?

513
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,839
What?

514
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,279
Oh, it's Tae Woong.

515
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,220
Don't go.

516
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,980
Tae Woong's looking for me.
I'll get going.

517
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,690
I can't believe a phone call
has you rushing off to him!

518
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,660
Darn.

519
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,470
Gang Ju didn't come home last night.

520
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:58,039
Don't tell me you were together.

521
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
We weren't.

522
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,849
- Is that true?
- Yes.

523
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,920
Don't just stand there
and have a seat.

524
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,219
Yes, ma'am.

525
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,019
I kept thinking about it,
and something didn't feel right.

526
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,929
Your mom and I
exchanged foul comments,

527
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,000
but nothing seems
to have been resolved.

528
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,099
I don't trust my son.

529
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:26,139
It's as if he'll betray me one day,

530
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:28,070
so I'm not at ease.

531
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,869
Let me hear it from you.

532
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,239
Why did you come to our hotel room?

533
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,789
Is she really that in love
with Cha Tae Woong?

534
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,929
Why did you get down on your knees?

535
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:58,130
- Ms. Baek, I'm sorry.
- What?

536
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,269
Why are you doing this again?
Come on.

537
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,769
What is it, Ms. Lee?

538
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:06,409
Are you...

539
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,280
Are you really pregnant?

540
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,219
I'm sorry
that my mom and grandparents...

541
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:20,260
dug up and stole your money
at Mount Euak.

542
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:21,289
What?

543
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:25,360
Whatever I say won't make up for it.

544
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,030
I was able to see again
thanks to your money.

545
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,230
Thank you.

546
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:32,000
No, wait.
I'm sorry about everything.

547
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,869
What is it?

548
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,579
What is it, Ms. Lee?

549
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,210
My gosh.

550
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:44,980
Why are you looking at me
without saying anything?

551
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,980
That terrifies me even more!

552
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:48,849
Did my son say...

553
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:53,460
he'd go behind my back
and take care of you and the baby?

554
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,590
No, we're not together like that.
You don't need to worry.

555
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
Really?

556
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:04,099
Like Director Seo said,
we agreed to break up.

557
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
I don't trust what my son says.

558
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,679
You can trust him, ma'am.

559
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,579
I mean...

560
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,980
I got greedy for money...

561
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,320
and wanted to snag a rich man,

562
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,780
which is why I left home
to be with him,

563
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,250
but I'll end it on my end.

564
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:24,719
Something must've come over me,

565
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,690
and I got down on my knees
to seek your approval.

566
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:31,190
Seeing you and my mom
argue that day...

567
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,500
had me come to my senses.

568
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:38,369
Your legs will be cold.
Stand up and sit.

569
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,869
I'll take your word for it.

570
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,679
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:57,289
The woman Director Gang Ju...

572
00:36:57,389 --> 00:37:00,690
worries about, cares for,
and loves the most...

573
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,889
is you. Didn't you know that?

574
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:04,690
I didn't and I don't.

575
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,730
He loves you so much
and won't disappoint you.

576
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:11,900
He's sweet, caring, and kind.

577
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,969
He has a positive attitude
and doesn't act out.

578
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:18,010
Even though he's well-educated
and has had a privileged life,

579
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,610
he's considerate
and cares for those who are in need.

580
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,409
He's manly...

581
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,250
and has a lot of love to share.

582
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:27,519
You know, he's adorable.

583
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,190
- Don't worry though.
- Exactly!

584
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,190
Is it right for you to covet my son,
whom I raised to be a fine man?

585
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,099
- It's wrong.
- It's wrong, Ms. Lee.

586
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,360
I shouldn't covet him.

587
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,829
Keep your word.

588
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:44,869
Yes, ma'am.

589
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,639
Gang Ju can't know about this.

590
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,880
Of course.

591
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:59,780
I'm sorry!

592
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,679
- Tae Woong, let me.
- It's fine.

593
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,780
I'll do that. Take them off.

594
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,809
He'll be discharged tomorrow.

595
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:30,849
Really?

596
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,420
Yes. The doctor stopped by
after he had dinner.

597
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:37,090
What a relief.

598
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,289
I briefly cleaned the living room,

599
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:41,989
so clean your grandparents' room.

600
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Let's keep your mom
from having to clean up...

601
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,590
the second she gets home.

602
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,199
Sure.

603
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:49,199
I'll do the dishes too.

604
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,099
It's fine. I said I'd do it.

605
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,670
- Let me do it.
- I'm almost done.

606
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,559
Da Rim.

607
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,530
Have you had dinner?

608
00:39:22,769 --> 00:39:23,929
Should I make you tteokbokki?

609
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:25,170
What?

610
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,539
It's your favorite.

611
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,409
No, I'm good.

612
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,010
I should wrap this up first.

613
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:36,579
Close the door, Tae Woong.

614
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Sure.

615
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,159
Could he be too hungry
to fall asleep?

616
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,429
Whatever.

617
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,920
(Father)

618
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,760
Yes, Father.

619
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,889
How have you been?

620
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,590
What? Well...

621
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,030
How about a cup of coffee?

622
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,260
Come by the house.

623
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,699
Sure. I'll be right there, Father.

624
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:08,500
Have you been well, Father?

625
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,099
You seem different.

626
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,639
Do I?

627
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,570
I don't mean that in a bad way.

628
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Right.

629
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,710
Have you been house-hunting?

630
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,690
Yes, I have.
Actually, Mom's taking the lead.

631
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Right.

632
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Gang Ju,

633
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:37,989
I was thinking about...

634
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,130
giving Tae Woong a chance
at your old job.

635
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,559
I'm also going to have him
move in with me.

636
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,130
I'm giving you a heads-up
as you might get the wrong idea...

637
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,539
if you hear it from someone else.

638
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,739
Avoiding him won't solve anything.

639
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,409
I'll try living with him...

640
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,039
and call it quits
if we don't get along.

641
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:54,480
The same goes for the job.

642
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,550
He'll stay if he performs well.

643
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,550
But if he doesn't,

644
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,619
he'll get the boot like you.

645
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,889
It isn't his fault
that he was born my son.

646
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:11,659
I think it's my responsibility...

647
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,730
to at least give him a chance.

648
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:17,699
Why don't you get into movies,
which is your passion?

649
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:20,670
Do you have anything to say?

650
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,340
Is it over between us?

651
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,369
Would you like it to be over?

652
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,079
You seem to want
to end what we have.

653
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,010
I never asked for it first,

654
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,510
so why are you making it sound
like I wanted to break things off?

655
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,119
Is it because...

656
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,789
you want me
to take the blame for everything...

657
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:39,690
so you can care for your son
without tiptoeing around anyone?

658
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,889
Don't ask me about it...

659
00:43:43,389 --> 00:43:44,590
because I won't answer.

660
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,929
That's cowardly.

661
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:49,000
Gang Ju. Seo Gang Ju.

662
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:57,070
Don't forget to take your things.

663
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,179
How else can Tae Woong
move into your room?

664
00:44:07,219 --> 00:44:08,619
I'll head out first.

665
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,170
He's too soft for his own good.

666
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:28,469
Father!

667
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,809
You're fond of Tae Woong...

668
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:37,380
because he made a fortune...

669
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,050
by building a life for himself
from the ground up like you.

670
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,690
You've never been one
to care about blood ties.

671
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:45,889
I won't go into movies.

672
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:48,389
You always referred to it
as a pipe dream,

673
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,659
so why are you suggesting
I finally get into it?

674
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:54,099
I started enjoying
how we made clothes at the company.

675
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,659
The competition each season...

676
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,300
challenged me in a good way
and brought out my competitive side.

677
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,070
I've been wanting
to do better every time!

678
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:01,699
I'll prove that I'm your son...

679
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,840
even though...

680
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:06,440
we're not related by blood.

681
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,139
Just you wait.

682
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,650
I will also...

683
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:15,949
build my career from the ground up.

684
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:25,789
Sure.

685
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:30,000
I wish you the best.

686
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,699
Was that a hint of disdain
in your voice?

687
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:46,980
Ms. Lee, good morning.

688
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,219
Good morning.

689
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:27,389
Where do I go?

690
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:43,570
(Chief Secretary)

691
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,039
Yes, Chief Secretary Lee.

692
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,349
We found your personal items
while cleaning your old office.

693
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,480
Should we send them to you...

694
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,150
or dispose of them on our end?

695
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,920
Sure thing.

696
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:01,989
Will someone be appointed to fill
Director Gang Ju's position?

697
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,489
It can't remain vacant.

698
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,210
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

699
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,139
- Hello.
- Welcome back.

700
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,579
- Hi.
- I'm glad you recovered.

701
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:26,349
It wasn't a big deal.

702
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,079
It was harder on the family.

703
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:30,750
You know that much?

704
00:47:31,489 --> 00:47:34,389
Don't you dare scare us
like that again.

705
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:39,489
Mom, Dad. You lost weight already.

706
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,929
Give me that.

707
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:45,269
Let's hurry upstairs and go to bed.

708
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,539
- I'm too tired to even stand.
- Okay.

709
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:48,670
What?

710
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,269
- I'll carry you, sir.
- Goodness.

711
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:54,039
- Oh, dear.
- Thank you.

712
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,050
It's so nice to be back.

713
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,320
Gi Dung's so sweet.

714
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,389
He's not sweet at all.

715
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,059
What's the matter?
Did you two fight?

716
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,730
Gi Dung would never do
anything wrong.

717
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,360
- I bet you...
- He said...

718
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,000
he was a man.

719
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:20,940
He is a man.

720
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:24,969
Is he seeing someone?

721
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,710
I don't know.

722
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,340
What's up with her?

723
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:32,409
Goodness.

724
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:34,179
Oh, dear.

725
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:38,449
- I can manage.
- It's okay.

726
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:41,190
Oh, dear. At last.

727
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:45,090
- Oh, my gosh.
- Goodness.

728
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,760
- Oh, dear.
- Thank you.

729
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:51,429
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

730
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,570
- Let's leave and let them rest.
- Okay.

731
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:00,210
Shall I get you something to drink?

732
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,809
No, we're fine.

733
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:04,380
Give me whatever you have
that needs washing.

734
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:06,519
Like socks and underwear.

735
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:07,750
Shall I wash this too, Mom?

736
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,260
- Hey. That's...
- What's all this, Mom?

737
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,760
How dare you go through my bag?

738
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,000
What...

739
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:25,170
Why do you have
so many 50-dollar bills?

740
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,170
Oh, that?

741
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,239
- That's for...
- I went to the bank...

742
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:32,239
and got cash
to settle the hospital bill.

743
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,210
What else could it be for?

744
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,210
I just brought it home
because Bong Hee paid.

745
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:43,119
Yes, that's right.
Bong Hee paid before we could.

746
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:47,289
Mom.

747
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,829
- What?
- It's Shin.

748
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,329
He missed his prep center class...

749
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:55,530
because he couldn't register
for this month.

750
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:59,130
Can you give me 2,000 dollars?

751
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,110
Do you mean the prep center
kids go to...

752
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,610
if they want to become doctors?

753
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:09,139
He'd come to see me yesterday...

754
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,449
because he couldn't go there
and had nowhere else to go.

755
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:13,750
Is that so?

756
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,320
You must have the money, then.

757
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:20,090
It's not for anything else.
It's so he can study.

758
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:25,090
How much...

759
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,730
does that class cost?

760
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:29,900
Is it 2,000 dollars per year?

761
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:31,000
Per month.

762
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,000
- My gosh.
- That's crazy.

763
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,769
What about Shin's dad?

764
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,880
His son wants to study
of all things,

765
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,940
and he won't pay for the class?

766
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,750
He's worse than scum
I'd expect to see in a septic tank.

767
00:50:46,949 --> 00:50:48,019
Darn it.

768
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:49,989
Here.

769
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:56,019
You're giving me all this?

770
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,099
Thank you, Mom, Dad.

771
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:02,329
Thank you.

772
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,429
Shin. I'll go to the bank
and wire the center your tuition.

773
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:32,829
You can go back.

774
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:35,530
Where did you
suddenly get the money?

775
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,869
Your grandparents gave it to me.
Don't worry.

776
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,469
I see.

777
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:45,539
Mom. Yesterday, I saw lots of money
under their mattress.

778
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:49,239
- What?
- When I went to the toilet,

779
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:52,309
Grandma and Auntie got cash
from under the mattress.

780
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:54,449
Is it their emergency stash?

781
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,420
Hurry to class, Shin.

782
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:58,650
Thanks, Mom.

783
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:13,840
You fool.

784
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:17,909
You have to see to believe,
don't you?

785
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:20,409
(Cheonglyeom Wedding Hall)

786
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:22,739
(50 dollars)

787
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,119
It's weird enough to fool a ghost.

788
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,949
- You fool.
- My gosh.

789
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,900
Tae Woong.

790
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:52,309
Go on inside, sir.

791
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,190
(Chairman Ji Seung Don)

792
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:14,900
(Do you want to stay here
until the repairs are done?)

793
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,570
I'm a few days late
because Mr. Lee was unwell.

794
00:53:20,769 --> 00:53:22,699
The suitcase I left was my reply.

795
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,170
I'll move in this evening.

796
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,150
What's your future goal?

797
00:53:32,449 --> 00:53:35,280
Money. I want to make a lot of it.

798
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:36,719
How about working here?

799
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:39,420
I only have a high school diploma.

800
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,590
Degrees don't matter.

801
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:44,130
You started with 5,000 dollars
and profited in the stock market.

802
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,030
You bought a block of residences
while living in a rooftop unit.

803
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,130
That's your portfolio.

804
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:53,300
Use that skill and get
the fashion lab to make us money.

805
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,570
That's a position
you can lose at any time...

806
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,440
if you cause losses
or become a nuisance.

807
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:01,780
You can make up your mind
after you tour the place.

808
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:04,679
I'll see you at home later.

809
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:10,389
Ms. Lee.
I want to see Ms. Lee Cha Rim.

810
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,750
Yes, sir.

811
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,440
Hi, Da Rim.

812
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,969
What's Tae Woong doing
in the chairman's office,

813
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:33,579
and why does the chairman
want to see you?

814
00:54:46,389 --> 00:54:47,460
Ms. Lee.

815
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,329
You must know him
since you recommended him.

816
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:53,530
Show him around the fashion lab.

817
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:55,159
Yes, sir.

818
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,139
They all left for lunch.

819
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:08,940
You managed to keep a poker face.

820
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:10,650
It's not your first time here.

821
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,820
Doesn't it feel like home seeing
how often you came over to help me?

822
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:17,389
You kept your mouth shut
as if you'd never been here.

823
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,219
As if you needed me
to show you around.

824
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,320
You're a true go-getter
with a poker face.

825
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,059
Not at all like Director Gang Ju.

826
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,230
There's nothing more to see
because you were here before.

827
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,400
(Managing Director's Office)

828
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,409
You should've packed up sooner.

829
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,250
I apologize.

830
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,389
Aren't those my clothes
you're wearing?

831
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,289
Sorry.

832
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:58,159
Whatever. Keep them if you want.

833
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,460
Oh, wait.

834
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:06,670
Can I use this office?

835
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,170
Will you not use it
if I say you can't?

836
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:10,710
I won't.

837
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:13,579
I don't want to go down
as someone who stole your spot.

838
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,210
It's not my spot anymore.

839
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,449
In the house or at the company,
there's nothing I can call mine.

840
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,250
You can have them all.

841
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:27,219
You can't get back
what you once give me.

842
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:31,789
Because I never return
what I once take.

843
00:56:32,829 --> 00:56:34,300
Father's not easy to live with.

844
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,429
Good luck.

845
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:38,769
I wish you the best.

846
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,010
I knew this would happen.

847
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:55,880
I'm your superior.

848
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:57,789
We have boundaries.

849
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,360
Yes, sir.

850
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,670
Hey.

851
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,769
Did you know all about it?

852
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,079
Are you worried
about Director Gang Ju now?

853
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,679
Why do you even care about him?

854
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,650
I thought you'd be thrilled
once Tae Woong took his office.

855
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,590
You're happy, aren't you?

856
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,989
I'm a little...

857
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:33,989
A little what?

858
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:37,530
I mean, it's just...

859
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:40,130
There goes Tae Woong.

860
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,699
He's going to be the new prince.

861
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:46,230
This is only fair.

862
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,739
Then is he going to be the pauper?

863
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,070
What?

864
00:57:50,369 --> 00:57:52,210
If Tae Woong is the prince,

865
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,079
is Director Gang Ju
going to be the pauper?

866
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,280
He will if he's incompetent.

867
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,710
His parents are getting divorced.

868
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:59,980
They're not even related by blood.

869
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,719
Chairman Ji
and he will be strangers.

870
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,449
And Tae Woong is his son.

871
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:06,190
But Director Gang Ju is his son too.

872
00:58:07,219 --> 00:58:08,920
Stop pretending you're innocent.

873
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:11,360
When Tae Woong entered
the director's office earlier,

874
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,889
he looked just like Chairman Ji.

875
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,599
I'm going to make him successful.

876
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:19,130
With my help, he can make it.

877
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:23,139
So you stay out of this.

878
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,769
Tae Woong is certainly
Chairman Ji's son.

879
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,639
When I saw him in the office today,

880
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,309
I could tell
he was an ambitious man.

881
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:32,750
Tae Woong isn't right for you.

882
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,320
Why would you ask for trouble?

883
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:40,820
I believe you'll get yourself sorted
and move on.

884
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:46,860
See you.

885
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,800
Please open it for me.

886
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,150
Are you home?

887
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,679
Come up to the rooftop.

888
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,699
Did you move all these by yourself?

889
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,630
Why did you move Tae Woong's stuff?

890
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,769
I'll make money.

891
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:02,269
What?

892
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,070
Hey.

893
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:07,840
You should make money here with me.

894
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:09,210
- Here?
- Yes.

895
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,949
But this is Tae Woong's place.

896
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:15,579
You should go to Tae Woong
and get his permission.

897
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,119
I won't pay rent.

898
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,050
Minimum costs, maximum profits.

899
01:00:19,590 --> 01:00:20,659
We should save money.

900
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:23,389
You said you would pay back
the money spent on your surgery.

901
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,230
You should work two jobs.

902
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,260
You don't have time.

903
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:27,960
Make money here with me.

904
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,630
You'll pay back the money
spent on your surgery, and...

905
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,269
- What about you?
- I'll build...

906
01:00:32,269 --> 01:00:33,699
my career from the ground up...

907
01:00:33,699 --> 01:00:34,900
to get my father back.

908
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,139
I'll prove that I'm his son too.

909
01:00:37,469 --> 01:00:41,139
And I'll bring Father back to Mom.

910
01:00:41,809 --> 01:00:45,010
My mom got divorced pretending
she was fine because of me,

911
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,909
but she's still in love with him.

912
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:48,019
What do you say?

913
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,079
I like that.

914
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,219
Trust me.

915
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,960
Actually, I had no idea
what I should do to make money.

916
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,929
I want to work with you.

917
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,429
And I like that you're with me.

918
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,300
I want to make you
earn a lot of money.

919
01:01:05,769 --> 01:01:07,369
To get your money back
as soon as possible?

920
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:10,099
Yes.

921
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:14,539
So what are you going to do?

922
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,579
I'll do all the dirty work.

923
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:21,219
Do you see my project proposals
that the company rejected?

924
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,219
This is a lot, right?

925
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:23,619
Yes.

926
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:26,019
Just because they rejected it
doesn't mean it's a failure.

927
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:29,090
Big companies tend to avoid risks
and be conservative.

928
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:32,989
I have a production network,
but not a distribution network.

929
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,099
So it'll be a live commerce.

930
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,329
It might be successful
with a new business.

931
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,610
Oh, gosh.

932
01:01:51,250 --> 01:01:52,409
What was that?

933
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,050
I don't know.

934
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:56,820
Because you felt shameless?

935
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,849
I think so.

936
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,159
I hope
you'll feel shameless every day.

937
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:06,590
That shouldn't happen.

938
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:08,599
I hope you'll feel really shameless.

939
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:10,630
I said no!

940
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:16,340
Thank you.

941

942

(Iron Family)

948
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,010
What case is it that requires
an undercover operation?

949
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,710
He died after giving us the money.

950
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,710
Let's go and find it.

951
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,880
The money is in Mount Euak.

952
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,980
My mom is fretting about me
going out with you.

953
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:11,190
I'm glad that she's fretting.

954
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,719
We're not dating.

955
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:13,960
I just want to make a lot of money.

956
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:16,389
Hae Ja, is Chairman Ji living alone?

957
01:04:16,389 --> 01:04:17,590
Clean up my room for me.

958
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:18,829
I'm moving back in.
