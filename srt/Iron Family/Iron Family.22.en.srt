(Episode 22)

2
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:09,349
It is indeed cancer.

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:10,449
What?

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,019
Goodness me.

5
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,789
My time must be coming first.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,089
The cancer cells
haven't invaded the submucosal layer.

7
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:24,100
According to the biopsy,
the cells are well-differentiated,

8
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,730
so only a laparoscopic procedure
is needed.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,829
Hold on.

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,969
You're saying
it's in the early stages.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,340
- That's right.
- Goodness, Mother.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,369
Still, it's cancer.
Won't she need radiation therapy...

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,840
or chemotherapy?

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,109
She won't need
any additional treatment.

15
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,679
- My gosh.
- Really?

16
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:43,649
- Goodness.
- Thank you, Doctor.

17
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,049
What did I tell you?

18
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,450
I said you'd live to be 100.

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,990
Unbelievable.

00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:02,500
Goodness.

23
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,170
Mom, what did the doctor say?

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,969
- What...
- Move, will you?

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,810
She's my woman.

26
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:11,480
I only have a few days to live.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,709
Mom!

28
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,549
Mother, don't shock her like that.

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,480
It's in the early stages.
Only a minor procedure is needed.

30
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,219
She's pulling your leg.

31
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,859
Please tell me that's true, Mom.

32
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,019
Unbelievable.

33
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:28,629
Someone might think
you're a devoted daughter.

34
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,659
If only you had kept
your marriage happy.

35
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,769
You're the reason
I have this cancer,

36
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:36,200
so it's up to you
to nurse me back to health.

37
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,469
I'll go and deliver
the overdue laundry.

38
00:01:39,739 --> 00:01:41,670
Cancer isn't frightening
as long as you have money.

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,909
Isn't that right, Tae Woong?

40
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:45,879
Don't worry about
the hospital bills.

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,280
We won't ask you for a penny.
Don't worry about it.

42
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,450
- I'll be right back.
- Sure.

43
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,959
Drive safely.

44
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:08,530
I have money too.

45
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,840
I probably have more than you do.

Bong Hee.

48
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,479
Yes, Father.

49
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,680
What's this on our bed?

50
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,810
Did Mi Yeon already get it done?

51
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,050
You loved keeping the floors
nice and warm.

52
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,020
The bed might feel cold for you,
so I bought an electric pad.

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,259
Bong Hee,
what if this starts a fire?

54
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,930
It'll be a huge problem
if this catches fire.

55
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,930
Don't worry, Father.

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,729
Electric pads these days
are safer than ever.

57
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,370
You'd enjoy sleeping
on a warm surface.

58
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,930
Is that so?

59
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,199
My goodness.

60
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,639
When on earth
will the construction be done?

61
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,939
Tell me about it.

62
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,539
You should take
your hearing aid out.

63
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,810
Right. Sure thing.

64
00:02:58,979 --> 00:02:59,979
Here.

65
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,449
Right.

66
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,689
Mom, would you like it to be hot,

67
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,960
warm, or lukewarm?

68
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,400
Here. You can leave us.
I'll manage this.

69
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,099
Do you know how to work it?

70
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,969
Do you see me as a fool?

71
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,599
Goodness, Man Deuk.

72
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,000
Lie down
and let your back get toasty.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,039
Sure thing, Gil Rye.

74
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,949
Gil Rye,
don't show your back to me...

75
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:35,050
and face me instead.

76
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:38,460
You're such a nuisance.

77
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,389
All this bossing around.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
- There.
- Right.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,370
If the doctor had said
you wouldn't live much longer,

80
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,439
I would've followed you in death.

81
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,439
Unbelievable.

82
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,639
I can't even die freely
because of you.

83
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,210
How would you survive without me?

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,909
You two are the corniest.

85
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,580
After I get back from the sauna,

86
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,280
I'll cook you something
that's easy on the stomach.

87
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:14,189
You know,

88
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm going to live
a day longer than you,

90
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,829
So don't you worry.

91
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,329
Do you mean that?

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,040
You have to keep your word.

93
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,180
Bye.

95
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,930
Get the door, Gang Ju.

96
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,540
Hey.

97
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:16,290
Ms. Lee, did the chairman send you?

98
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Come in.

99
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:32,800
Have a seat.

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
The chairman didn't send me here.

101
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
I came by...

102
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,019
to see you.

103
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,689
Is that so?

104
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,019
What business
could you have with me?

105
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,620
Mom, shouldn't you dry your hair?

106
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:55,160
You hate it
when your hair sticks out.

107
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,589
Dry your hair first.

108
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:57,730
What business do you have with me?

109
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,629
- Ma'am.
- Hey.

110
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:01,500
I haven't been able to tell my mom.

111
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,000
She's still in the dark.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,199
You can't come here out of the blue.

113
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,439
I'm prepared for the outcome.

114
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,410
I'll tell her everything.

115
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,639
Tell me what?

116
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,879
Also, what's with
that humongous suitcase?

117
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:15,149
It's nothing, Mom.

118
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,050
She thought I was here alone.

119
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,920
No, I knew she was here.

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,449
I wanted to tell her myself.

121
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:24,490
I wanted to tell your mother
in my own words.

122
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,459
No, Mom.
We're not done discussing this.

123
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,829
She came here out of the blue.

124
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:29,829
I'll sort this out.

125
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,160
What will you sort out?

126
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,870
What's going on between you two?

127
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,670
Also, explain that suitcase.

128
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,040
Ms. Lee,
shouldn't you be at the office?

129
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,110
What could be
in this huge suitcase...

130
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,110
Mom.

131
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:47,949
The two of us...

132
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,910
have been planning a trip.

133
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,550
- What?
- What?

134
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,850
We're dating.

135
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,819
We're going somewhere far,
so she brought the big suitcase.

136
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,089
Ms. Lee, is what he's saying true?

137
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,759
Are you two going on a trip?

138
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,129
What the...

139
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,230
Are you two actually dating?

140
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,500
No, that's not what I'm here
to tell you.

141
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,870
Ms. Lee!

142
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,870
- Hey!
- What?

143
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,339
If you tell her now,
it'll shock my mom.

144
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,379
I already told you...

145
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,439
that we had to plan this
and break the news slowly.

146
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,850
We have to wait...

147
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,120
until we're ready to tell
both families about this.

148
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
We're not ready yet.

149
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,250
"Both families?"

150
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,449
What are you two up to?

151
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:31,519
Why are you here with a massive bag
as if you're packed to elope?

152
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,660
And why did you
barge into our suite?

153
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:35,389
Why?

154
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,129
Mom.

155
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,629
- I love her.
- What?

156
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,870
You crazy fool.
Shut your mouth and keep quiet!

157
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,000
You explain, Ms. Lee.

158
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,540
Don't keep your mouth shut so tight!

159
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,810
You came here
with a bag full of stuff.

160
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,949
Was your plan
to go on a trip together...

161
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:55,750
and come back pregnant or something?

162
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,519
What was the plan?

163
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,620
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,620
It's all my fault, ma'am.

165
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,560
What? Oh, then...

166
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,959
What did you do wrong, Ms. Lee?

167
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,060
It's not her fault. It's mine.

168
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,100
Darn you!

169
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,000
Okay. You're both at fault.

170
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,069
What did you do?

171
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,110
It all happened because of me.

172
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,209
Oh, no.

173
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,310
Mount Euak...

174
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,220
We were going to forget about
the company and go traveling!

175
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,419
She came here thinking I was alone!

176
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,320
- Mount Euak...
- No!

177
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:37,590
I got fired...

178
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,820
and Father hates me now. I'm so sad.

179
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,289
- My grandparents...
- No!

180
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:43,860
Stop!

181
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,399
I have to put up with
your mood swings,

182
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,669
and it's just too much.

183
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:49,330
You're stressed out
about the divorce...

184
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,500
and anything
and everything annoys you.

185
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,639
I want to leave with her.

186
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,610
Is that all you can say?

187
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,509
She was the only one
who was there for me.

188
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,279
I barely made it through
thanks to her.

189
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:02,210
But if I were to tell you about her,
you'd never approve,

190
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,120
and I thought I'd get hurt again.

191
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:05,279
That's why I suggested a trip.

192
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,490
That's why she came here
with this huge bag.

193
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,950
All because of you!

194
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,620
You only care about yourself.

195
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,090
Let me love whoever I want.

196
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,059
It's not a request.
It's a notification.

197
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,899
Are you out of your mind?

198
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,269
Is a screw loose in your brain?

199
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,730
Yes! I'm crazy about her.

200
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,970
I've fallen for her completely.

201
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,309
Do you know what she's like?
You don't, do you?

202
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,269
She's your polar opposite.

203
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,480
And that's why I like her.

204
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:35,710
Don't you dare touch a hair
on her head.

205
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,179
If you do,
I'll fight right back, okay?

206
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:39,350
Don't hurt her!

207
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,820
Oh, my gosh.
What kind of girl is she?

208
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,360
How did you bewitch him?

209
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,789
Why did you turn him into a moron?

210
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,899
My son has changed.
You weren't like this.

211
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,330
You! Come with me! We're leaving!

212
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,629
My mom will say cruel things.
Let's go!

213
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,840
Don't mind her at all.

214
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,100
You just need to love me.

215
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,809
Our love is just ours.

216
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,509
All will be well if we're happy.

217
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,639
Where are you going, Gang Ju?

218
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,580
No. Are you insane? You can't go!

219
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,649
Stay here!

220
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,149
- Let go, Mom!
- My goodness.

221
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,549
Ma'am!

222
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:14,289
Get up.

223
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:17,220
Why would you go on your knees
when you did nothing wrong?

224
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,889
- Come along.
- I'm sorry, ma'am!

225
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,259
- I'll come back!
- Come!

226
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,860
Seo Gang Ju!

227
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,299
Hey!

228
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,529
Darn you! That fool...

229
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:31,440
Hey!

230
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,409
Let go of me.

231
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,149
My goodness.

232
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,549
Why are you acting like this?
What are you thinking?

233
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,950
- Go home.
- Why did you ruin everything?

234
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,220
I'll explain outside.

235
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,090
The doors are opening.

236
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:54,860
Come with me.

237
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,100
Why did you cause a mess here
instead of going to work?

238
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,570
Trust me and get in.

239
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm upset to death
because I upset my own mom.

240
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,710
I can get angry too.

241
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,080
I don't like you enough...

242
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,809
to hurt my mom
with such scathing words.

243
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,419
That was the only way
to get out of there.

244
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,830
That darn fool.

245
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:32,360
That darn fool.

246
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,340
My life's a mess
since I lost my money and marriage,

247
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,539
so when did he find a girlfriend?

248
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,210
That moron.

249
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,779
Hey.

250
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,549
Let go of me.

251
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,460
- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.

252
00:11:57,919 --> 00:11:59,259
- That hurts.
- Careful.

253
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,190
Keep still.

254
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,230
- You're hurting me.
- Sorry.

255
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,230
Don't get out, okay?

256
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:09,570
Stay right there.

257
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,519
I was out of my mind.

258
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,559
My poor mom...

259
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,830
Why didn't you let me
talk to your mom?

260
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,230
You even told
blatant lies to stop me.

261
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,830
If you return the cash,
she might get it back,

262
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,570
but the public will bury her.

263
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,740
They'll shoot daggers and lasers,
and I want to shield her from that.

264
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,610
I can't explain why.

265
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,440
What does that mean?

266
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:56,779
Why would the public bury your mom?

267
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,279
- Well...
- It's your mom!

268
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,450
Get out right this instant.

269
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,990
Mom. Step back from the car.

270
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,019
Hey!

271
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,529
Seo Gang Ju. Where are you going?

272
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,059
Don't follow us, Mom!

273
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,230
- Hey! You can't do this to me!
- Don't follow us!

274
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,399
- Step back!
- Seo Gang Ju!

275
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,570
- Seo Gang Ju!
- What is she doing?

276
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,500
Why did she come all the way here?

277
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,039
Oh, my gosh.

278
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:26,679
That punk lost his mind over a girl.

279
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:30,919
Hey, Seo Gang Ju! You dirtbag!

280
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,350
Go to work. You're late.

281
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,590
I called in sick.

282
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,330
You were really determined,
weren't you?

283
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,990
Where are we going?

284
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,899
What do you want to do now?

285
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,570
Seo Gang Ju.

286
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,600
Stop it.

287
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:54,710
Save me!

288
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,179
What did the doctor say?
Is she okay?

289
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,559
Yes, she's okay.

290
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:14,529
It's early days,
and it hasn't spread.

291
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,190
They won't need to open her up.

292
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:19,200
They can make a small hole
and use a laparoscope to get it out.

293
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:21,970
That's such a relief.

294
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,509
You should teach
your daughter better.

295
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,909
What's the matter?

296
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,679
Which daughter?

297
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,610
Cha Rim or Da Rim?

298
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,580
It has to be Cha Rim.
Da Rim wouldn't do anything bad.

299
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,419
I don't know anything
about Cha Rim or whatever.

300
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,789
I'm talking about Ms. Lee,
the secretary!

301
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,990
Oh, my Da Rim?

302
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,159
Listen carefully.

303
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,500
You can't ever go to see
my mom again.

304
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,500
- Don't do anything.
- How can I not do anything?

305
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,539
That money that was under
my grandparents' bed...

306
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,269
is proof that my mom
and grandparents are thieves.

307
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:04,480
What were you going to do with it?

308
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,679
What were you going to do...

309
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,879
if you weren't going to give it
to her?

310
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,350
Da Rim.

311
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,320
That cash is dirty money.

312
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,889
My grandfather left it
to Mom 15 years ago.

313
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:21,259
To avoid paying taxes on it,

314
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,990
she hid it in a safe,
and it got stolen.

315
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,399
Two thieves tried to get away
with the cash,

316
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:27,360
and one buried it at Mount Euak
and your grand...

317
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,100
Both the chairman and I found out
about the money after it was stolen.

318
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,940
If my mom gets the money back,
she'll be guilty of tax evasion.

319
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,379
That's why you can't just show up
and try to return it to her!

320
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,649
If I keep it at home,
my mom will be guilty of theft.

321
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,450
What were you going to do
with her money, then?

322
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,320
What do you want to do?

323
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,090
I can't keep it at home.

324
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,529
What if my brother were to look
under the mattress?

325
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:57,529
All three will go to prison
for theft,

326
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,129
and my family will be crushed.

327
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,000
My brother's a detective.

328
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,070
His wife's a police officer,

329
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,669
and her mom is their chief.

330
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,639
You take the money.

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,139
I'll talk to...

332
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,909
my family somehow.

333
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,009
I'll bury it on my mom's property.

334
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,409
Is that why you broke into my house?

335
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,649
Yes.

336
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,049
It's dirty money,

337
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,950
so I'll bury it
and never tell my mom.

338
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,460
I'll then persuade her
to spend it wisely later on.

339
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:30,830
I'm sorry.

340
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,230
Now get out.

341
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,000
I shared my family's worst secret.

342
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,100
My family is full of thieves.

343
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,740
It's just as humiliating.

344
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,570
Tax evasion is worse.

345
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,379
Theft is worse.

346
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,009
- Get out.
- Okay.

347
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,850
(Ms. Bae)

348
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,480
Hello. What?

349
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,620
My mom?

350
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,320
Why? What is it?

351
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,820
To Cheonglyeom-dong.

352
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,090
What is it? What's wrong?

353
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,900
She's so brazen.

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,339
She brought a bag
the size of a house...

355
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,839
to a hotel room
thinking he was alone.

356
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,079
Are you sure
you're talking about my Da Rim?

357
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,849
I don't know what her name is.
You know who I mean.

358
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,690
She must've done something wrong.
She even knelt down before me.

359
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,690
How many times
do I have to tell you?

360
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,390
Da Rim is at work now.

361
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,829
So your daughter told you
she'd go to work,

362
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:39,299
but she was actually
going to elope...

363
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,500
with a man without telling you?

364
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,299
Ji Yeon.

365
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,240
I'm not sure what she did
to seduce my son,

366
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,539
but Gang Ju, who is tenderhearted,

367
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,970
only took care of her
while I was there.

368
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,180
The bag was big enough
for a month's worth of stuff.

369
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,309
You should teach
your daughter better.

370
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:57,180
Is that true?

371
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,250
Excuse me.
That's not the right order.

372
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,690
There's no way
my daughter seduced him first.

373
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,460
You say
I should teach my daughter better,

374
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,630
but it's you
who should teach her son better.

375
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,859
Your son must've wanted
to impress my daughter.

376
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,799
He brought some apples and pears
for my parents-in-law.

377
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:15,569
And when they refused to accept it,
he brought it to me.

378
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:17,000
Do you have any idea...

379
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,839
how many times he went around here
with two boxes of fruit?

380
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,569
She just started her job
at the company,

381
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:24,680
so it must've been hard for her
when her boss chased after her.

382
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:26,809
Apples and pears?

383
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,549
I can't believe this.
This is driving me crazy.

384
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,819
Ji Yeon, I know I'm not
supposed to weigh in here, but...

385
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,490
- You stay out of this.
- Still, I have to say this.

386
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,089
- I told you to stay out of it!
- Gang Ju liked her first.

387
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:41,930
He discussed it with me before.

388
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,829
I told him not to sway Da Rim...

389
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,730
saying it wasn't a good idea,

390
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,329
but he's liked her...

391
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:48,930
since before Da Rim
recovered her sight.

392
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,099
He ate at my restaurant a lot
just to see Da Rim's face.

393
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,299
That's enough.

394
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,910
We really don't like your son.

395
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,509
He set this place on fire,
so we had to renovate it.

396
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,680
He paid for everything.

397
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,009
We lost a lot of customers
because of that.

398
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,720
You should go and teach your son...

399
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,119
instead of making a fuss here.

400
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,650
Why did your daughter kneel down
before me then?

401
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,619
Is she pregnant or something?

402
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,160
What did you say? "Pregnant?"

403
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,940
- That's impossible.
- Then why did she kneel down?

404
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,500
Why did my son drag her out
when she was on her knees?

405
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,869
And what was the big bag for?

406
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,980
I bet they slept together.

407
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,180
The daughter of a dry cleaner's
seduced a director...

408
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,150
and wanted to become his wife.

409
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,789
Why would my son go out...

410
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:44,720
with a girl from a family
who does the laundry?

411
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,190
What?

412
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,660
What about my daughter?

413
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,190
What's wrong with being a daughter
of a dry cleaner's?

414
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,200
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

415
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,799
- Mom!
- My goodness.

416
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,200
- Gosh, Mom!
- Oh, no!

417
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,240
Oh, dear. Mom!

418
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,809
She is pregnant,

419
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,839
and she wanted my approval.

420
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,809
That's what that shameless girl
tried to do.

421
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,319
If you threw it on my face,

422
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,019
I would've let it slide
for my daughter's sake.

423
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:16,890
But I can't let you get away
with this.

424
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,619
This, this, and this.

425
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,029
- My gosh.
- This.

426
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,390
Ms. Ko!

427
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,130
You should've thrown it at my face.

428
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,829
Why did you do it
on my customers' clothes?

429
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,029
Your son set my place on fire,

430
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,299
and now you're here...

431
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,740
to stain my customers'
precious clothes?

432
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,240
You may have money,
but you have no manners.

433
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,309
- My gosh. No...
- Mom, please.

434
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,410
How dare you mess things up
like that?

435
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,650
You don't even know
how to do the laundry,

436
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,420
so you bring all your clothes here
including underwear!

437
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,150
It's hard to make money,
but not to spend it.

438
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,289
All you can do is spend money!

439
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,460
You take these and wash them.

440
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,660
Have you ever done
the laundry before?

441
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,900
I heard you got divorced.
You deserve it.

442
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,630
I wonder
why he didn't leave you sooner.

443
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,630
I think Seung Don put up with you
for quite a long time...

444
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,670
when you didn't even wash
his shirts or underpants.

445
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,240
Wash them.
You go and wash them yourself!

446
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
What? Seung Don?

447
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Is Seung Don your friend?
Is he your husband?

448
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,380
Is he your husband then?

449
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,849
What? Darn it. Hey!

450
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:18,279
Hey! You must be flattered...

451
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,250
that you washed
Seung Don's underpants and socks!

452
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,250
Are you done talking?

453
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,750
I guess money is the only thing
you can show off.

454
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,059
Hey, I have some money too.

455
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,720
I can make bedsheets with money
and sleep on them!

456
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,690
Mom, please. We shouldn't be
doing this to Ms. Baek.

457
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,960
What are you staring at?

458
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,829
Mom, let's go.

459
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,869
Talk. Everyone's here, so be honest.

460
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,880
Are you pregnant? Is that it?

461
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
- What?
- What?

462
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:47,910
What are you talking about?

463
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,309
Why did you kneel down before her?

464
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,079
Why did you go to the hotel?

465
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,990
Is it true that you were going
to elope with him?

466
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,619
Tell me the truth.

467
00:21:58,519 --> 00:21:59,589
No.

468
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,759
- Did you sleep with him?
- What?

469
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,930
If they slept together, it's over.

470
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
In this day and age,

471
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,200
- what's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

472
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,839
That's not the end or the beginning.

473
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,640
Don't be silly.
They're old enough to do stuff.

474
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,940
Gosh, Mom. We didn't sleep together.

475
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,880
It doesn't matter
whether you slept with her or not.

476
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,549
So tell me.

477
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,309
Tell me why you went on your knees!

478
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,319
We will break up!

479
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Da Rim.

480
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,720
Let's end it here.

481
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,559
I don't want to go this far
just to be with you.

482
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,859
Da Rim, let's not do this.
This isn't just right.

483
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,460
Let's end things here
before things get worse.

484
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,099
Let's break up.

485
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,329
Mom, let's go.

486
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,730
All I have is you.

487
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,299
- Hey.
- Hey, where are you going?

488
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:48,839
You have to wash these
or pay for the damage!

489
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:51,240
Wait right there!

490
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,339
Mom, please stop it.
I will wash them.

491
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,210
If you wash them right away,
they'll be clean.

492
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,180
Why did you lie to her?

493
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,980
If you ever meet...

494
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,190
that darn brat again
who set our store on fire,

495
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,089
you won't get to see me again.

496
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,099
Gosh, that was so brutal.

497
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,740
Gosh, let go of me. Hey!

498
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,440
Seriously...

499
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,240
Do you want me to drive?

500
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,509
I'm worried about you.

501
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,819
You're all I have.

502
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,119
- I love you.
- Get lost, you fool.

503
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,089
You're lying.

504
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,690
Darn it.

505
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,609
(Love Capital)

506
00:23:57,609 --> 00:23:58,609
What?

507
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,079
Do you have a shovel or something?

508
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,450
- What for?
- For shoveling.

509
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,450
What else would I do with a shovel?

510
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:07,480
You can find it over there.

511
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,630
Are you in a baseball team or what?

512
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,809
Where's Ms. Lee?

513
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,009
She's not feeling well,
so she's taking a day off.

514
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,910
She called and said she was sorry.

515
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,279
- What's wrong?
- She's sick from fatigue.

516
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,019
Fatigue?

517
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,859
Sir, what are you going to do with
the Fashion Research Department?

518
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:23,430
You didn't like all the candidates.

519
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,789
Should we find someone from outside?

520
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,170
Should we choose one from the team?

521
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:31,900
Pardon?

522
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,569
Then do you want to promote Mr. Yu?

523
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,480
Mr. Yu is good-natured,
but he's a bit of a pushover.

524
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,039
And he doesn't want
to take responsibility.

525
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,579
Then what about Design Director Kim?

526
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,750
No one on the team
follows Design Director Kim.

527
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,890
Is Designer Lee Cha Rim below her?

528
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,490
Isn't it too soon
for Assistant Manager Lee?

529
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,890
There will be a backlash.

530
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,089
Assistant Manager Lee will be...

531
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,430
the first one to be promoted
in the end.

532
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,900
People are cynical about her
because she stands out.

533
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,099
But her performance is the best.

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,170
What do we do?

535
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,579
Then don't worry about the employees
and move forward with it.

536
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,150
Mr. Lee,
why are you being like this?

537
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,950
- Pardon?
- I do worry about the employees.

538
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,849
I'm being really cautious
not to demoralize them.

539
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,259
Right. I see.

540
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,589
We'll think more
about that decision.

541
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,500
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

542
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm exhausted.

543
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,539
Aren't you?

544
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,470
We're lucky to be attending
the med school prep center.

545
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,779
My son.

546
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,710
Shin.

547
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,049
The doors are opening.

548
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,460
- Which floor?
- Second floor, sir.

549
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:02,430
Second floor.

550
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,990
The doors are closing.

551
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,230
Is Ms. Lee feeling very sick?

552
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:11,569
Da Rim?

553
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,599
Didn't she come to work today?

554
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,809
- I heard you were sisters.
- We are.

555
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,180
By the way,

556
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,079
I hope things are going well
at the Fashion Research Department.

557
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,250
It's a mess.

558
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,049
We need more hands on deck.

559
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:31,150
Decisions aren't being made,
and we're extremely busy.

560
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,130
It's like
you're shooting arrows at me.

561
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,500
You fired someone
while we were short-staffed.

562
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,599
Shouldn't you have sent someone
to replace him?

563
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,029
You were giving me an earful.

564
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,769
Why are you searching elsewhere?

565
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,809
You don't seem to realize
you already have the right person.

566
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,579
Are you recommending yourself?

567
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:56,809
No, sir.
I may be brazen, but not like that.

568
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,920
I know how to design clothes,
but I still have a lot to learn.

569
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,119
Instead of someone who nitpicks
about the design of our clothes,

570
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,759
the role should go to someone
who can plan ahead...

571
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,589
and analyze the market.

572
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,390
So? Where nearby should I look?

573
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,630
Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning.

574
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,640
Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning?

575
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,619
(Tae Woong)

576
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:44,160
Tae Woong, did you check
the recruitment form I sent you?

577
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,299
I'm making deliveries, so bye.

578
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,210
He's now taking my calls.

579
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,140
We could've eaten somewhere fancy.

580
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:05,150
The lady who lives with Dad
won't let me have ramyeon.

581
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,880
I figured I should grasp
this opportunity.

582
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:11,960
She must be feeding you
healthy food. I'm glad.

583
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:18,029
Why did you come
when we text every day?

584
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:27,140
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

585
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,869
Dig in.
You can have mine too if you want.

586
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:46,490
- Mom.
- Yes? Do you want pickled radish?

587
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,789
Dad and the lady he lives with...

588
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,029
said I didn't have to attend
the med school prep center...

589
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:57,299
and that I shouldn't be studying
so much for med school...

590
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,599
since I'm still young.

591
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,539
They said
I didn't have to become a doctor.

592
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,440
What?

593
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,009
How do you feel about it?

594
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,880
I want to keep studying there.

595
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,549
So? Won't they pay for your classes?

596
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:17,519
Unbelievable.

597
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,430
Go ahead and eat, Shin.

598
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,569
Mom.

599
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:32,740
Do you have money?

600
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,470
Dad said it cost a lot...

601
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,180
and asked if I needed
to keep taking those classes.

602
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:41,779
He keeps asking me that.

603
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,250
Darn it.

604
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,619
If only I can win
the lottery somehow.

605
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:54,420
(Love Capital)

606
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,599
(Love Capital)

607
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,000
- The two of us got thinking.
- Right.

608
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,599
Out of the five who can weld,

609
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,269
these four have been excluded.

610
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,369
That only leaves us with Gil Soon.

611
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,480
Could Gil Soon
have stolen the money?

612
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,420
- What?
- Sung Hoon.

613
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:56,549
Let's be honest.
None of us knew Gil Soon could weld.

614
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,789
(Love Capital)

615
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,710
Has there been any progress?

616
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,109
Did you find out
where the accomplice...

617
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,839
hid the money?

618
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,420
You sound like you know where it is.

619
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,220
If I knew, I wouldn't be here.

620
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,390
How was the shoveling?

621
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,519
You must've been digging somewhere.

622
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,289
I see dirt on your pants.

623
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,759
What? Sure.

624
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,730
I planted a tree in our garden.

625
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,230
- What tree?
- One that blooms flowers.

626
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,599
You know how my mom loves flowers.

627
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,269
If there isn't any progress,
we should give up.

628
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,839
Are you still doubting the people
at the dry cleaner's?

629
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,250
Like I said, they're innocent.

630
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,349
The son is a detective
in the violent crimes unit...

631
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:01,049
at Cheonglyeom Police Station.

632
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,150
You have a point.

633
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,690
Anyway, thanks for the shovel.

634
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,019
Let's give up on finding the money.

635
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,089
My mom's stressed out anyway...

636
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,059
and is getting exhausted.

637
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Maybe we should.

638
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,500
Sure. I'll say we called it quits
and get going.

639
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,170
I'll be the one
to break it to my mom gently.

640
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:24,869
My gosh.

641
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,880
Doesn't it seem like
he's hiding something from us?

642
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,319
We're hiding something from him too.

643
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,119
Is that so?

644
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,130
Maybe he wants
to find the money himself...

645
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,430
and avoid paying us our fee.

646
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,500
What?

647
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,259
- Sung Hoon.
- Yes?

648
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,170
Should I track
Gil Soon's whereabouts?

649
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:50,369
Yes.

650
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,369
Meanwhile, I'll track
Gang Ju's whereabouts.

651
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:03,009
(Cheonglyeom Pharmacy)

652
00:34:03,849 --> 00:34:05,210
Do you have any calming pills?

653
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,950
- How many would you like?
- Three, please.

654
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,389
Is it safe for a 90-year-old woman
and an 88-year-old man to take?

655
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,119
Sure.

656
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,920
Will this help...

657
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,360
even with the most shocking news?

658
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,929
Here you go.

659

(Damga Charcoal Grill)

660
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:32,480
- Sir.
- Yes?

661
00:34:33,579 --> 00:34:35,380
- Do you need anything?
- I'm back for a second time...

662
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,380
- because I loved the food.
- I see.

663
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,780
Would you consider expanding
to a second location?

664
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,750
If you decide to,
I'd like to run a restaurant.

665
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,920
Is that so?

666
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,030
I haven't thought about that yet,

667
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,489
but I'm glad you enjoyed the food.

668
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,000
The meat will soon be served.

669
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,230
Right. Thank you.

670
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,800
I'll get the meat.

671
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,099
Why isn't she here
when it's so busy?

672
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,469
She needs to be here on time.

673
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,340
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

674
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,820
Why isn't she here?

675
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,250
Mother,

676
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,449
can you stay late today?

677
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:18,719
What?

678
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,059
I don't think
Mi Yeon will come to work today.

679
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,889
Why is that? Is she quitting?

680
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:27,960
She won't come.

681
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:30,900
She'll probably quit.

682
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,070
Then we need to hire someone new.

683
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:39,179
Let's hire a strong man this time.

684
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,780
I apologize. I'm sorry, Boss.

685
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,219
I thought
you weren't coming in today.

686
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,820
Says who?

687
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,690
Gi Dung said so.

688
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,989
Did I actually say
I wasn't coming in, Boss?

689
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,300
No.

690
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,369
Excuse me.

691
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,170
Yes?

692
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:15,280
What's with the mix-up?

693
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,599
Put them on the couch.

694
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,110
Can you handle your alcohol?

695
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,820
Not really.

696
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,349
Would you like a drink?

697
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,710
I have more clothes to deliver.

698
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,179
Even one shot is enough
to stop you from driving.

699
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,480
I know that.

700
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,650
You're using work
as an excuse to leave?

701
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,690
- Yes.
- My goodness.

702
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,369
Goodness.

703
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
What?

704
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,710
Your part-timer's drunk.

705
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Where is he?

706
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,760
I'll tell Mom first,

707
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,800
then we'll talk to
my grandparents together.

708
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:51,000
Won't that reduce the shock
a little bit?

709
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,579
I'm glad you're here.

710
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,320
Mom.

711
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:08,179
I have something to say.

712
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,920
Do you?

713
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:12,289
What could you have to say?

714
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:15,260
How dare you?

715
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,860
You packed a bag
the size of a house...

716
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,489
and left home
to travel with a guy...

717
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,059
without a word to your mom...

718
00:39:20,059 --> 00:39:22,329
or grandparents whom you lived with.

719
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:23,400
What could you have to say?

720
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,369
Here. You should eat this first.

721
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,769
Is everything that the witch said true?

722
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:34,539
No, it's not that.

723
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,980
I'm glad you're here.
Watch the store for me.

724
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,719
Hey. I have...

725
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,789
enough money to marry you off.

726
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,530
If even a tiny part of you
fell for him...

727
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,929
because he was rich, give up.

728
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,769
We can afford to marry you off
so no one will look down on us.

729
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:03,039
Date a hardworking guy
even though he may be poor.

730
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,280
Okay?

731
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Mom.

732
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,119
The money's gone.

733
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,690
It belongs to Ms. Baek.

734
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,789
It's not ours.

735
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,360
There's no money...

736
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,099
under the mattress.

737
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,239
Goodbye. Come by again.

738
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,480
What's that suitcase for?

739
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,380
Are you going somewhere?

740
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,550
Isn't this my suitcase, Bong Hee?

741
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,550
Give me a bottle
of your strongest liquor.

742
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,960
- Did you put on lipstick?
- Don't.

743
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,030
I want whatever is strongest.
Be quick!

744
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,800
Hey.

745
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,300
Are you off to seduce someone?

746
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,570
Are you trying to get someone drunk
to take him to bed?

747
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,539
I'm going to go all the way tonight.

748
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,210
Where are you going?

749
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,210
My goodness.

750
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,059
Are you a heavy drinker
or do you not know how to go slow?

751
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,190
I was...

752
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
never able to go slowly.

753
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:43,429
It was all or nothing.

754
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,269
I either hit a home run
or got struck out.

755
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,239
I won big or lost all I had.

756
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,010
It sounds like...

757
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,750
you earned your money
in a risky way.

758
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,480
You got lucky.

759
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,820
Do you think someone like me
could ever have been lucky?

760
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,690
I was good at what I did.

761
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:55,900
What's this?

762
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,809
You have lots of spare rooms.

763
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:01,280
I'm going to spend the night here.

764
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,510
Who? You?

765
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,449
Yes. Why? Can't I?

766
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,119
Are you insane?

767
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,550
My apartment has just one bathroom.

768
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,559
It gets crazy in the morning
now that Tae Woong moved in.

769
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:16,030
We could even kill, you know.

770
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:19,059
How many bathrooms
do you have? Three?

771
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,000
It looks like there might be four.

772
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,630
For just one person.

773
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,300
Get me a glass too.

774
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
Pour me one.

775
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,849
Hey. I called you here
to take him home.

776
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,420
You can't drink.

777
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:44,650
I got into a huge fight
with your ex today.

778
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,289
She mocked and humiliated me...

779
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,260
because I work in a dusty store
and make chump change.

780
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,199
I'm the one who washed your suits,
shirts, socks...

781
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,300
and underwear
for the past ten years.

782
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,969
And Hae Ja cooked for you.

783
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,710
What did that woman ever do for you?

784
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,610
The person who does all that
doesn't have to be my wife.

785
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:14,880
Did you fall madly in love
with her, then?

786
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:24,460
You dated a pretty woman in college
and got laughed at for it.

787
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:26,030
Isn't that enough
to make you get a grip?

788
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:28,030
How could you marry a woman
like her again?

789
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:29,829
All you want from a woman
is being pretty?

790
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,969
That's why you ended up like this.

791
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:37,969
To me, being pretty is...

792
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:40,809
different from
what people call "pretty."

793
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:46,150
You are still out of your mind.

794
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,619
You look pretty too today.

795
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,489
Are you making fun of me now?

796
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,960
You raised...

797
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,860
all your daughters well.

798
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:02,059
I think they take after you.

799
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,829
If I look closely,
you look pretty too.

800
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,139
What does that mean
I look pretty at a closer look?

801
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,710
Is that a curse?

802
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,539
That means I look ugly
if you don't look closely.

803
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:14,780
Seriously, that's...

804
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,280
Tae Woong.

805
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:19,210
Do you think she's ugly?

806
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:21,750
Never.

807
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,219
Even Cha Rim and Da Rim aren't
as pretty as she is.

808
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:25,889
See?

809
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:28,420
Something's wrong with his eyes.

810
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,260
And something's wrong
with your eyes.

811
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,559
I mean, you are his father.

812
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:35,960
We don't have any special bond.

813
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:38,230
I'm not sure
if I can say I'm his father.

814
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:39,739
That's what I mean.

815
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,940
Drink it.

816
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:53,250
He pretends he can hold his liquor,
but he suddenly gets drunk.

817
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,690
Gosh.

818
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,519
So...

819
00:47:01,219 --> 00:47:03,030
I'm telling you...

820
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,329
to live together and see
if you two can get along.

821
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:07,659
You can't build a bond...

822
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,400
without doing anything.

823
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,400
You know an attachment is
stronger than love.

824
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,409
Seung Don.

825
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,840
Tae Woong.

826
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,320
Appearance or blood.
That doesn't matter at all.

827
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,480
You may not notice it,
but you two have a lot in common.

828
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:33,159
You two are smart, arrogant,

829
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,360
good at making money,
uncompromising,

830
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,559
and popular with girls.

831
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:38,329
Darn it.

832
00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,000
He's just like the old you
from college.

833
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:44,929
That's Tae Woong.

834
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,639
Maybe that's why I like you.

835
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,710
Darn it.

836
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:53,239
What am I saying? I take it back.

837
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,340
They can't even drink
as much as I do,

838
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,679
but why am I blabbering?

839
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:00,550
Are you saving it
for your ancestors?

840
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,679
Gosh, you fools.

841
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,010
If I had married him,

842
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,650
would I have lived
in a place like this?

843
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,190
(35 Buja-ro, 2 na-gil)

844
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:46,130
Why did I put on the lipstick?

845
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:53,500
Hey, I didn't put this on
to impress you.

846
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:59,639
I put on the lipstick
even when I go home.

847
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:04,309
I'm not a woman who wears lipstick
to look pretty to others.

848
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,849
Hey, don't flatter yourself.

849
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,150
I didn't put this on
to look pretty to you.

850
00:49:14,889 --> 00:49:16,219
Why did I even go to his place?

851
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:51,630
Mom, why are you so late?

852
00:49:53,659 --> 00:49:55,659
Am I not allowed to come home late?

853
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:57,329
Did you drink?

854
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:01,369
Am I not allowed to drink?

855
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:04,610
By the way,
why are your lips so red?

856
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,280
Hey, am I not allowed
to have red lips?

857
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,980
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

858
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:17,090
Forget it. Let's talk tomorrow.

859
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,019
Tell me now!

860
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,460
You know the expensive soju, right?
I only drank half a bottle of it.

861
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,159
Oh, right. I had some whiskey too.

862
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,130
It's expensive, so it tastes good.

863
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:29,699
It's so smooth.

864
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,500
You're going to work tomorrow.

865
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:35,469
Tell me now.

866
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,969
You stink of alcohol.

867
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:39,710
I'll talk to you tomorrow
after work.

868
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:43,409
All my daughters are
shamelessly greedy.

869
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:45,550
You like a man for money!

870
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,449
- Gosh.
- It's embarrassing.

871
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,719
I'm really embarrassed.

872
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,469
It's all over now.

873
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,110
I buried it in your land,
so forget about it.

874
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,570
I didn't take your money.

875
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,929
Gosh.

876
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:39,329
Oh, dear.

877
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,239
Will you stay here...

878
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:18,070
until the renovation work is over?

879
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:13,860
See you, Ms. Lee.

880
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:16,059
I will see you tomorrow.

881
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,400
(Crosswalk)

882
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,670
Did you tell them?

883
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,369
I'll tell Mom when I get home.
What about you?

884
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,269
I buried it.

885
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:35,940
Good.

886
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,579
What are you going to tell her?

887
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:42,349
I'll take care of it.

888
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,250
I'll tell Mom first.

889
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:48,420
Then I'll tell my grandparents
with Mom.

890
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:52,190
My mom has high blood pressure.

Did you buy a calming pill?

Yes. But I should buy one
for myself.

I'm so nervous.

894
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,570

Go eat your dinner, Da Rim.
