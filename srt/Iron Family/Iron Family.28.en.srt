(Episode 28)

00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,450
Ms. Kim is going back
to Jiseung Apparel.

3
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:51,859
That's why she went...

4
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:52,890
to the sewing factory
without telling us...

5
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,590
to stop us from using her work
by taking her designs...

6
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,359
and samples.

7
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,060
Production came to a halt.

8
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,829
Did Ms. Kim betray us?

9
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:05,769
Why are you apologizing?

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,640
My not being good enough
led to this.

12
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,939
I should've stopped her
from leaving us.

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,310
How is that your fault?

14
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,250
I thought you'd be on my case.

15
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,049
Ms. Kim's a poor judge of character.

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,420
I thought I'd get an earful...

17
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,019
for taking her designs
to the factory...

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,329
without double-checking
her employment status.

19
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,799
Am I one to scold a CEO?

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,629
You're a secretary
who scolds her boss.

21
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:43,170
We can quickly find
another designer,

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,209
CEO Seo.

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,620
We're seriously running out of time.

27
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,590
Oh, no.

28
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,259
Aren't they wads of 50-dollar bills?

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,990
Have they been tied
with elastic bands?

30
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,360
That I can't see.

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,509
Come on.

32
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,819
(Unmanned lockers)

33
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,900
How much do you think
she's keeping in here?

34
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,020
I'm nervous about this
now that I've taken a lot.

35
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,689
It's not like I can
keep the money here forever.

36
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,219
I almost took a million dollars,

37
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,490
so I'll leave after Mom's surgery.

38
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,069
I...

39
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,080
I'd like to start anew.

40
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,349
I want to live with Mi Yeon, Mother.

41
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,090
Are you...

42
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,159
telling me to move out?

43
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,090
Of course not.

44
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,230
I'll be the one to move out.

45
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,759
What about Bom?

46
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,639
Bom's my daughter, so of course...

47
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,699
I'll take her with me.

48
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:30,009
Along with Mi Yeon's son Shin...

49
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:32,709
You'll have Bom call
that vixen Mi Yeon her mother...

50
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:35,050
for the rest of her life?

51
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,250
Gi Dung, I can't allow that.

52
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,389
She's not just your daughter.

53
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,220
She's also my granddaughter.

54
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:44,990
Bom?

55
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,329
I'll raise her.

56
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,230
Shack up with Mi Yeon
for all I care.

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
But Bom...

58
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,970
will stay with me.

59
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,639
Mother!

60
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,709
Let me take you home.

61
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,310
I guess men are all the same.

62
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,980
You're my son-in-law
and nothing more.

63
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,990
I'm only your mother-in-law,

64
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,259
so how could I comment on your life?

65
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,930
Do as you wish. It's up to you.

What's going on?

69
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:47,750
Why haven't you
sent over the design?

70
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,149
I'm working on it, sir.

71
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:51,220
You can't accept other orders
until the end of the year.

72
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,370
Are you kidding me?

73
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,610
What is it?

74
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,339
Where are we meeting Designer Yoon?

75
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:11,939
We'll get there early.

76
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,439
What? Why?

77
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,449
Well...

78
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:16,310
Unbelievable!

79
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,620
Let's meet first
and then work out the details...

80
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,949
of your contract, Designer Oh.

81
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,519
Ms. Oh, wait.

82
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,589

83
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,290
- Ms. Oh?
- Come here.

84
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,370
Complete the phrase.

85
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
There's nothing...

86
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
To lose.

87
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,079
That's it.

88
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,310
Don't have a change of heart.

89
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,279
- Right.
- Designer Choi,

90
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,019
we'll offer an incentive
on top of your salary...

91
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,850
that is as generous as
what you used to receive.

92
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,050
You have a lot of experience...

93
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,420
working on puffer jackets.

94
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:02,629
Right, of course.

95
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,160
- Ms. Choi, I'll await your call.
- Sorry.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,069
Your seat belt.

97
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:18,079
Darn. Will Ms. Wang agree
to work with us?

98
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,209
She asked for a high incentive.

99
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:22,079
We must seem like pushovers to her.

100
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,649
Judging by what we paid
for her design,

101
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,449
we'll have to sell the jackets
for over 1,500 dollars.

102
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,449
She may be prickly,
but her designs are solid.

103
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,290
Should we order in?

104
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,360
I bet you're hungry.
How about what my mom made?

105
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,889
I'll go see if Mom is home
and call you if she's not.

106
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:34,930
Come downstairs.

107
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,889
Okay. I will.

(Bong Company)

109
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,040
You're not supposed to be here
when I'm out.

110
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,050
I asked the owner of this room
about the passcode.

111
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,379
Why didn't I think of that sooner?

112
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:01,920
I see.

113
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,920
I guess you're getting along well
with Cha Tae Woong.

114
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,959
He's even nicer to me
than you are now.

115
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,259
You kept avoiding my calls
and refused to let me in here.

116
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,870
How can you say you're my son?

117
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,970
You should stay close
to Cha Tae Woong then.

118
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,639
I get that you don't want
to move in with me.

119
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,740
I should barge in here
whenever I have time then.

120
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,379
Don't you dare change the passcode.

121
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,910
The owner of this place
will kick you out...

122
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,149
as soon as you change it.

123
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,149
Cha Tae Woong and you
seem to have hit it off.

If I see you with that brat here
one more time,

125

I'll cut ties with you.

- Mom.

128
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,460
Are you coming with me?

129
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,970
Let's say you tell the police...

130
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,269
that you lost ten million dollars
and ask them to find the thief.

131
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,470
Do you think the police will believe
what you say?

132
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,169
There has been no record
of using the money...

133
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,039
or having it in your account
for 15 years.

134
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,210
How can you prove
that you actually had...

135

ten million dollars?

136
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,679

137
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,649
Before he died, he wrote that...

he was leaving ten million dollars
to his daughter.

139
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,690
I see.

140
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,419
Lawyer Kang told me to submit it
while talking to the police.

141
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,730
I can't just show up empty-handed
and ask them to find my money.

142
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,200
The police wouldn't believe me.

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,000

There's no way she can have my son.

148
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,960
You should tell her that
falling for someone so blindly...

can be a crime.

Are you saying
my daughter is a criminal?

152
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,440
It's my fault that I made her
a daughter of a poor family...

who runs a dry cleaner's, not hers.

I let someone so shallow like you...

look down on her.

156
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,909
How shameless you are.
You just said you were to blame.

Fine. Go ahead and punch me.

Just punch me and go to jail
so I won't have to see you again.

Instead of making a fuss here,

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
you should go and watch your son.

Why do you think
he's sneaking around here?

That's because
he likes my daughter better.

It's obvious that your son is
chasing after my daughter.

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,590
The one who washes the man's
underpants likes him more.

00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,279
Is it that you like him
or he likes you?

181
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,679
Can't you tell?

182
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:18,850
Who likes whom better?

183
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,080
I do!

184
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,419
Darn it.

185
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,690
- You silly thing!
- It hurts.

186
00:11:25,289 --> 00:11:27,460
What do you like about him?
What's so great about him?

187
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,889
Why do you like him more?

188
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,929
Even if I end up in jail
or the inferno,

189
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,169
I will never approve of him!

190
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,269
Why would you end up in jail?

191
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,370
Life is like a jail.

192
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,509
My mind is in the inferno,
do you understand?

193
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,340
If you go to the inferno,
I'll go there with you.

194
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:49,909
Why? Just stay here with him
and wash his underpants.

195
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:04,600
She's been really feisty recently.
She can even tip a cow.

196
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,269
I know. She's so vigorous.

197
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:11,440
She even made
all kinds of kimchi we like.

198
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,470
And the portions are copious.

199
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,639
Mother.
You're going to hospital tomorrow.

200
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,649
The surgery will go well.
You don't have to worry.

201
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:22,950
Okay.

202
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,049
I just can't sleep.

203
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,850
It's not like
you've never had surgery before.

204
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,389
Turn off the lights, Bong Hee.
We should go to sleep.

205
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,690
Goodnight.

206
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,330
Everything will be fine.

207
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,340
They say repeated
general anesthesia is not good.

208
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,309
You'll be fine
as long as you remember me.

209
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,779
I'll forget only about you.

210
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,190
- As if.
- You fool.

211
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,389
You silly thing.

212
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,059
Oh, dear.

213
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:09,889
Goodness.

214
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,759
Hey, Mom.

215
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:46,929
I made the godeulppaegi kimchi
you like.

216
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,730
You did? What's gotten into you?

217
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,710
Grandma is getting surgery tomorrow,
and you made godeulppaegi for me?

218
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,610
I'm the only one who eats it.

219
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,039
Because you were the only one
who liked it,

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,049
it wasn't easy to make
godeulppaegi kimchi.

221
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,149
I'll come to pick it up.

222
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:06,580
You must be busy because of Grandma.

223
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,549
- Cha Rim.
- Yes?

224
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,860
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,330
For what?

226
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:18,230
I knew you liked it,
but I didn't make it.

227
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:22,529
Right. You were being mean.

228
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,539
I guess it's been over ten years.

229
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,840
You didn't make it even once
after Da Rim went blind.

230
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:32,139
You finally sound like my mom
after a long time.

231
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,179
You're also my daughter.

232
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,019
My reliable child
who takes good care of herself.

233
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,289
Thank you.

234
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:44,659
Thank you.

235
00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:00,639
Before the thief died,

236
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,870
he had sent the location
of where the money was buried.

237
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,740
The cops know that his minions
are looking for the money now.

238
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,909
They will close in on our family.

239
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,049
It's only a matter of time
before they find out everything.

240
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,809
I'll turn myself in...

241
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,309
once your grandmother's
cancer surgery is over.

242
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,980
I will deliver myself to the police.

243
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,919
Let me serve in prison alone.

244
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,919
Please let your grandparents
get away with it.

245
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,460
Patient, An Gil Rye.

246
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,759
She's old, so make sure
to monitor her vitals well.

247
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,429
Administering general anesthesia.

248

(An Gil Rye: Surgery complete)

255
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,549
We successfully removed
the cancerous tumor.

256
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:55,019
And no possible metastasis
was detected.

257
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,059
- My goodness.
- Thank you so much.

258
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,429
Despite her age, she endured well.

259
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:04,500
However, her blood vessels are weak,

260
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,730
so there may be an infection
due to bleeding.

261
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,400
We will watch her closely
for a few days.

262
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,799
As I told you before,
she can experience...

263
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,970
some delirium symptoms
because of general anesthesia.

264
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,039
In a greater or lesser degree,

265
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,539
delirium gets better over time,
so you don't have to worry.

266
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,779
- Okay.
- Thank you, Doctor.

267
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:24,549
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

268
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,250
- I'm glad it went well.
- Yes. Thank goodness.

269
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,789
Mr. Bong.

270
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,130
Why won't you give me the designs?

271
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,630
I can't wait any longer.

272
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,759
My factory's at a full stop
waiting for you.

273
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,369
How much longer must I do that for?

274
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:42,829
Where's your conscience?

275
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:44,769
Hello?

276
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,069
Why are you in the dark?

277
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,680
Was that Mr. Bong?

278
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,349
Did your grandmother's surgery
go well?

279
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,279
- Yes.
- Good.

280
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:02,519
I didn't know it would be so hard
to find a designer.

281
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,589
Shall I talk to Cha Rim again?

282
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,829
She won't join us
unless we tell her the full story.

283
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:11,599
This is madness.

284
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,299
The moment...

285
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:18,700
she realizes the money
under the mattress was stolen,

286
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,500
she becomes an accomplice too.

287
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,869
I can't tell her everything
and incriminate her too.

288
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,079
I at least spent the money
to get my sight back.

289
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,980
She doesn't deserve to go down
when she didn't get a cent.

290
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:33,950
I need to pay Mr. Bong a deposit
to secure his services...

291
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,650
so he doesn't quit on us.

292
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,960
Can we use some of the money
that's under the mattress?

Yes.

296
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,299
Okay.

297

Here.

298
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,079
- Thanks.
- Cover up.

299
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:15,029
Take your time.
I won't steal your food.

300
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,289
I want to go home and eat rice.

301
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,259
- Grandma.
- Hey.

302
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,269
You met up to come here?

303
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,940
Yes. I got out
during my lunch break.

304
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,869
- Where's Mom?
- We're out of diapers,

305
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,069
so she went to get some.

306
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,539
Your aunt's watching the store.

307
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,740
Did you two eat lunch?

308
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,579
- No.
- Hang on, then.

309
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:37,049
Drink this at least.

310
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,390
- Here.
- Gosh.

311
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,990
Why do you have
so many vitamin drinks?

312
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:48,130
We bought a lot in advance
in case we had visitors.

313
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,089
I drink a few
to keep my energy up too.

314
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,430
This doesn't feel like food.

315
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,829
It's disgusting.

316
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,170
You can only have light gruel...

317
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,440

318
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,839
My poop will be so runny.

319
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,940

320

322
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,089
You're so lucky, Gil Rye.

323
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,690
Is she getting better?

324
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,460
Yes, of course she is.

00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,029
- Yes.
- Give me a second.

327

Here we go.

328
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,670
- Drink this.
- Thank you, Grandpa.

329
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:35,369
Did you have lunch?

330
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:37,769
I'm here as a guardian.

331
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:40,640
I can eat at any time
or even skip a meal.

332
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,750
Don't stand around us. Take a seat.

333

00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,500

Listen.

347
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,509
We gave Mi Yeon a million dollars,

348
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,319

the same amount.

Let's not discriminate.

351
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,500
We can give them all a million each.

352
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,799
Shall we do that?

353
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,900
We can't take the money with us
when we die.

354
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,839
Why don't we give it
to the kids now...

355
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,269

00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,829
What are you on about?

358
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,900
You want to be generous
with money you don't have?

359
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,140
- Hello.
- Hello.

360
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,069
- Here's your medicine.
- Thanks.

361
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:27,450
Ma'am, you're doing great.

362
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:31,619
Nurse. Can you give me
some actual food?

363
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,259
Please?

364
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:36,789
Your vitals are all normal.

365
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,130
I might survive the surgery
only to starve to death.

366
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,069
You'll get actual food
before you starve.

367
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:45,539
- Don't worry.
- What?

368
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,299
- Thank you.
- Bye.

369
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,410
Hey.

370
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,609
That evil wench.

371
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,210
She did all the talking
and left without giving me food.

372
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,980
Is she determined
to starve me to death?

373
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,650
Are they trying to kill me?

374
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,720
Fine! Kill me!

375
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,819
- My gosh.
- You witch.

376
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:07,190
Grandma. Why are you cursing?

377
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,660
Are you that hungry?

378
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,730
What?

379
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,230
Hi, Da Rim.

380
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,599
Da Rim.
I'll give you a million dollars.

381
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,069
Grandma!

382
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:21,339
- Gil Rye.
- Mother.

383
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,140
I have a lot of money.

384
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,509
Cha Rim, you get a million too.

385
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:30,680
We already gave Mu Rim
150,000 dollars at the wedding,

386
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,720
so you'll get the remainder
to make a million.

387
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,819
And then...

388
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,690
How much does that leave me with?

389
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,990
Yes. The remaining two million...

390
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,799
should go to Bong Hee.

391
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,099
What an exciting idea.

392
00:23:48,099 --> 00:23:50,630
You just made me a millionaire.

393
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:55,769
What about me?

394
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,369
Why did you leave me out?

395
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,680
What?

396
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,440
She's so hungry...

397
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,680
she's not in her right mind, is she?

398
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,519
I think she's delirious.

399
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,779
Yes.

400
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:09,289
The thing she had
after her last surgery?

401
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,519
Yes.

402
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,619
- Is that it?
- Yes.

403
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,789
Oh, is she saying
she has lots of money...

404
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:17,390
because she's delirious, Mom?

405
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,170
Mother,
you must want to be rich so bad.

406
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,430
Did you want to hand out...

407
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,799
millions of dollars
to all your grandchildren?

408
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,839
Come on, Grandma.

409
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:34,279
Why would you give Mom two million?

410
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:35,779
Kids.

411
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,009
- How about you all leave?
- Yes.

412
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,480
Are you playing favorites with Mom?

413
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,750
You said you left
on your lunch break.

414
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,549
You should get back to work.

415
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,819
Let's go so Grandma can rest.

416
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,190
- Okay.
- Yes.

417
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,630
She must take her medicine and rest.

418
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,000
The doctor did say
she could say some odd things.

419
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,099
- Yes.
- Yes.

420
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,970
The doctor said
it would go away after a while.

421
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,099
You can all go and not worry.

422
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,940
You'll just confuse her more.

423
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
Go on.

424
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,839
Will she offer us
ten million dollars next time?

425
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,910
I hope she doesn't get
more confused.

426
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,250
She won't forget us, will she, Mom?

427
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,450
Let's all go.

428
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,880
- Okay.
- Let's go.

429
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,990
- Don't go!
- What?

430
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,220
I really have the money.

431
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:20,359
Don't think I'm stupid.

432
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,529

433
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,930
Are you all...

434
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,099
looking down on old me
because I don't have money?

435
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,599
I really do have money...

436
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:35,910
under this thing here.

437

438
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:41,109
I'll give you a million each.

439
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:42,809
- Where is it?
- Grandma!

440
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,720
We'll come back to see you.
Try to get some sleep.

441
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,750

442
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,819
I'll bring you some tasty snacks.

443
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:52,089

444
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,519

445
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,430
Will you stop it?

446
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,859
You're embarrassing yourself!

447
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,359
Wait.

448
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:00,829

451
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,400
Why isn't it here?

- Go on. Run along.
- But...

What?

465
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,119
Hold on. Why is there no money...

Don't worry about your grandma.

471
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:19,440
She suffered from delirium...

472
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,509
the last time
she underwent general anesthesia.

473
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,180
Now that she's older,
the delusions must be worse.

Don't worry about us.
Be on your way since you are busy.

475

will her delusions last?

476
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,630
It's hard to tell.

477
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,759
By the way,
I put kimchi in the fridge.

478
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:40,029
Take it with you, Cha Rim.

479
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,529
Sure.

480
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,000
You should head inside.

I hope she comes back
to her senses soon.

483
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,220
Mu Rim, did you really receive
150,000 dollars as a wedding gift?

484
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:10,890
- Yes.
- Gosh, that's a lot.

485
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,700
Did we have that many relatives
to give us money for our weddings?

486
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,769
It must be because
he was the first to get married.

487
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,599
- Come on. Let's go.
- Sure.

488

- I want to hurry home.
- Right.

491

For that, you need
to come to your senses.

you said
they'd be charged heavily...

500

since they returned to the site
to steal once again.

501
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,799

all by myself.

00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,819
Right. Your aunt came by.
I should get back there soon.

538
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:03,589
- You got off work early today.
- Right.

539
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,460
I'll go and get the kimchi.

540
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,200
- Will you?
- Yes.

541
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,200
I bought us some time
by agreeing to pay...

542
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,339
the factory CEO a down payment.

543
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:17,670
A down payment? How much?

544
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,140
Well, 100,000 dollars.

545
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:20,539
Did you say 100,000 dollars?

546
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,250
We'll lose that money
if we can't hire a designer.

547
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,150
Should I get it back?

548
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,180
I have a lot of money.

549
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,680
Cha Rim, you get a million too.

550
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,410
Cha Rim, Da Rim.

551
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,980
I'll give you a million each.

552
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,220
What?

553
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,019
Mom actually bought a bed.

554
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,490
Bong Hee.

555
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,960
Is it under your mattress?

556
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,660
Why isn't it here?

557
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
Goodness.

558
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,009
(50 dollars)

559
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:06,920
What the...

560
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:10,019
What on earth? How much is all this?

561
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,730
No one's home, right?

562
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,860
Right. My aunt's at the hospital...

563
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,059
and Mom's at the dry cleaner's.

564
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,579
- Hey, not there.
- Oh, right.

565
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,150
Cha Rim!

566
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,949
Ms. Lee?

567
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,389
Do you know about this?

568
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,389
Have you known all along?

569
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,130
Whose money is this?

570
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,730
Was I the only one in the dark?

571
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,869
How is there 5.2 million dollars
underneath Mom's mattress?

572
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,570
- Only 5.2 million?
- Only 5.2 million?

573
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,710
Are you sure you counted correctly?

574
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,010
Are you sure you counted them all?

575
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,510
Shouldn't there be
around 6.2 million?

576
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,809
Grandma, Grandpa, and Mom...

577
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,579
didn't spend the money
on themselves.

578
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:12,050
Where did a million dollars go?

579
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:16,650
What...

580
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,590
What the...

581
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,760
(Setting)

582
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,929
(Operate)

583
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:36,809
What's taking Cha Rim so long
to get the kimchi?

584
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,340
I need to ask Mom about this.

585
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,010
I must ask her why we have
so much money in our house.

586
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,820
Cha Rim, hear me out.

587
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,119
Let's head upstairs.

588
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,719
Ms. Lee, we'll fill you in.

589
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,760
Let go!

590
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,989
Does Mu Rim also know?

591
00:35:55,659 --> 00:35:57,030
Was I the only one in the dark?

592
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,130
Have I been the only one
who didn't know like some moron?

593
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,829
Why is the money that Mu Rim
received as a wedding gift...

594
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,429
still here as well?

595
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:06,400
Does he also know?

596
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:08,269
I must ask Mom!

597
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:09,670
Cha Rim, please!

598
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,340
This isn't our money.

599
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,739
It's not our money?

600
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:17,550
Then why does Mom have this
under her mattress?

601
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,250
Why did Grandma offer
a million dollars...

602
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,179
to each of us including Mu Rim...

603
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,449
like it's her money?

604
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,889
You're absolutely right,
so let's talk it out upstairs.

605
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,619
Meanwhile, that punk
isn't even our family.

606
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,230
But what is he doing here?
And why does he seem so calm?

607
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,860
As if he's done this before
like hundreds of times,

608
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,159
why is he placing the money
like that?

609
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,869
I know. I understand.

610
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:38,599
Let go of me!

611
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,639
Cha Rim!

612
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,099
- Get off me!
- Please.

613
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:42,409
- Help me!
- Let go!

614
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:43,739
Gang Ju, help me!

615
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:45,840
- Hang in there.
- Hey!

616
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,710
- Let go!
- Help!

617
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,349
- My gosh.
- Let go of me!

618
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,719
(Cha Rim)

619
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:05,230
(Mom)

620
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:17,710
(Washing blankets,
mending, antibacterial cleaning)

621
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,510
When is your mother-in-law
leaving the hospital?

622
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:23,179
Hae Ja, can you
mind the store for a moment?

623
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,809
Cha Rim doesn't cook,

624
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,980
so she can't even find
what she wants in the fridge.

625
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,579
- I'll be right back.
- Go ahead.

626
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:35,590
(Cheonglyeom Villa)

627
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,530
- Let go!
- Come here.

628
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,559
- Hey!
- Stop it, Cha Rim.

629
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,099
- Hey, let go of me!
- It's 500,000 dollars.

630
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:42,929
- Put me down!
- I'm sure they counted it wrong.

631
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:45,130
- Open the door.
- Seriously, let go of me!

632
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,739
- I'm sorry!
- Hurry and get the door.

633
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:48,869
- Get off me! Hey!
- I'm really sorry.

634
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:50,710
I'll report you to the police!

635
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,010
- You might bump your head.
- Hey!

636
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,739
Hey!

637
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,750
I'm going to...

638
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,949
- Hey!
- I'm sorry!

639
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,280
My goodness.

640
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:37,489
Ms. Lee, just hear me out.

641
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,820
I'll tell you
what this is all about.

642
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,619
You know my house was robbed.

643
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,590
It was 10 million dollars
and not 1,000 that was stolen.

644
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,630
The two thieves ran off,

645
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,630
but when one was arrested that day,

646
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,760
the accomplice buried the money
in Mount Euak.

647
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,099
Your grandparents and mom
stumbled upon it and dug it all up.

648
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,099
They couldn't tell
other members of the family...

649
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:51,099
and hid the money in the AC
at the dry cleaner's,

650
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:52,099
but I torched the place,

651
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:53,469
so three million dollars
burned to ashes.

652
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:55,039
They spent 800,000 dollars
on your eye surgery,

653
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,440
and the rest of the money
is underneath this mattress.

654
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:11,150
So what Grandma said was all true.

655
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,119
I'm sorry, Cha Rim.

656
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,289
What? Don't be.

657
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,659
You don't have to apologize.

658
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,969
Now that you know that we have
the stolen money at home,

659
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,630
from this moment on,

660
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,000
you're an accomplice too.

661
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:28,739
If I don't want to be an accomplice,

662
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:31,170
I should go and report it
to the police right away?

663
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:33,239
"The money belongs
to Ms. Baek Ji Yeon."

664
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:35,579
"And it was my Grandmother,
Grandfather, and mom..."

665
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,110
"who took the money
that the thieves buried..."

666
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,150
"in the mountain."

667
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,590
"Oh, right. It's him
who burned three million dollars."

668
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:46,159
We can't ask him to return the money
according to the law.

669
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,059
It's us who stole the money
and put it in the AC.

670
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,929
And he didn't know anything
when he started the fire.

671
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,489
So we have to pay back
the three million dollars as well.

672
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:53,059
Are you taking his side
even at this moment?

673
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:56,329
Fine.

674
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,869
The three million dollars
that we didn't even get to use.

675
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,570
And the 800,000 dollars
for your eye surgery.

676
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:03,469
And Mu Rim, who is a cop,
got the fake money gift...

677
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,809
of 100,000 dollars at his wedding.

678
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:06,880
They should arrest
all my family members then!

679
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,710
And I will be a reprobate
who turned all my family members...

680
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,050
including my grandparents
in their 90s and mom to the cops.

681
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,789
Regardless of the time
the three serve in prison,

682
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:21,090
their children will have to pay back
the 3.8 million dollars for life.

683
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,329
Do you think my company will...

684
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:25,360
let a daughter of thieves like me
work for them?

685
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:27,130
So I'm doomed in this life, right?

686
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,300
Speaking of which, Ms. Lee...

687
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,400
Unless...

688
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,199
you're giving me the three
million dollars now, get lost.

689
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,710
Hey.

690
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,710
They didn't spend even a penny
of the stolen money for me.

691
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,079
What am I supposed to do?

692
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,019
I thought it was strange when Mom
made godeulppaegi kimchi for me.

693
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,050
Cha Rim, we should make up
the money we spent...

694
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,289
and return it to the owner.

695
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,230
Where would you get
such a big money?

696
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,889
You should quit the company
and give us the design.

697
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,230
Have you lost your mind?

698
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,800
We have no time to waste.

699
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,400
On January 1,
when the tax deadline is over,

700
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,300
Ms. Baek will go to the police...

701
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,099
and report the stolen money
of ten million dollars.

702
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:08,940
Once she does, we'll be finished.

703
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,340
We have to return the money
before that happens.

704
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,139
With your design,
we can make the money.

705
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:15,909
Shut your mouth.

706
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:19,079
You know what I went through to make
the design director at Jiseung.

707
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,420
And now you're telling me
to quit my job?

708
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,420
We were going to find a designer...

709
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,989
without telling you the truth.

710
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,320
But we have no other option.

711
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,489
I'm sorry.

712
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,230
Grandma said
she'd give you one million dollars.

713
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,400
She was really
going to give you the money.

714
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,929
It wasn't the delirium.
She really meant it.

715
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,269
Please, Cha Rim.

716
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:40,369
You received
one million dollars today.

717
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,369
You said we should return
the money to the owner!

718
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,510
With your design,

719
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,980
we can sell thousands of jackets.

720
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,909
You actually said you could sell
tens of thousands of pieces.

721
00:41:49,909 --> 00:41:51,710
You were the designer...

722
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,650
with the highest sales
in Jiseung Group.

723
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,780
You're the best.

724
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,590
We can make four million dollars!

725
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,690
It's no big deal!

726
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:01,159
Please, Cha Rim.

727
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,989
Oh, right. Please, Cha Rim.

728
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:06,099
Come on! Please get off me!

729
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:07,960
You darn leeches!

730
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,869
I can't believe this.

731
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:16,639
We can do this.

732
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,369
We can do this!

733
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:24,380
Why would I say that
to work with you guys?

734
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,820
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

735
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,889
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

736
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:34,889
Don't cry, Ms. Lee! We can do this!

737
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,489
We can do this, Cha Rim!

738
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,610
Why are you...

739
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:53,480
leaving so early?

740
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,750
I couldn't wait to see you.

741
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,320
I didn't know
you'd want to come with me.

742
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:08,619
You don't have to worry now.

743
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,190
You're not alone anymore.

744
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,460
Don't worry about money.

745
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:42,090
I...

746
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,889
have money.

747
00:43:46,099 --> 00:43:47,460
I'm going to Singapore.

748
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,699
I'll go there...

749
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:51,030
and make Shin a doctor.

750
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,369
Oh, right. Do you know how I can
move to another country with cash?

751
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:58,309
How much?

752
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:02,139
A lot. A big cash.

753
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,119
Singapore?

754
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,199
You'll quit, right?

755
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,570
I won't.

756
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,610
I know you will.

757
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,639
I can't.

758
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,579
I'll give you
as much incentive as you want.

759
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,809
And I won't get on your case.

760
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,610
I'll do whatever you want.

761
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,119
Stop seeing my sister.

762
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:14,750
We're of the same age.

763
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,420
When I treat you with respect,
you should do the same.

764
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:19,519
I'll go and report
your mom's tax evasion.

765
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:21,920
"We don't have much time left.
Hurry and charge the tax."

766
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,989
I'll tell the cops.

767
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:27,800
It's like reporting your family
to the police.

768
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,900
Are you stupid?
The stolen money's right here.

769
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,639
Be a dutiful child
while you still can, Cha Rim.

770
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,440
Be a filial daughter
while you can, Cha Rim.

771
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:23,050
What happened to you last night?

772
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,320
I left when I got
an urgent call from work.

773
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:28,360
How could you just vanish
leaving the kimchi outside?

774
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,929
It was so much work.

775
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:31,090
What if it turned ripe?

776
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:32,429
You don't like ripe kimchi.

777
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:34,130
Did I tell you to make the kimchi?

778
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:36,800
You like it when it's freshly made.

779
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,570
I kept it in the coldest part
of the fridge for you.

780
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:43,710
I see you did a great deal for me.

781
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,679
Was it tasty?

782
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,150
It looked like you tasted it.

783
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,579
Don't act like you care about me.

784
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,550
I'm not used to it.

785
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,119
It's so unfamiliar!

788
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,880
Yes, her surgery went well,

789
00:47:20,309 --> 00:47:22,340
but she was saying weird things.

790
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,809
She insisted on giving
the family money.

791
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:33,860
Goodness.

792
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,230
Are you here alone?

793
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,599
Who are you?

794
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,070
I'm Soo Ji's mom.

796

Oh, the police chief.

797
00:47:52,809 --> 00:47:57,079
You're just fine
and your mind's clear.

798
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,750
I might live
to be a hundred years old.

799
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:05,190
- Ma'am.
- What?

800
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,789
You got lost on Mount Euak once...

801
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:09,829
and we all had to look for you.

802
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,530
It was the night...

803
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,159
someone in Cheonglyeom-dong
reported a theft.

804
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:17,369
What?

805
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,639
Bong Hee told me
not to say anything.

806
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:24,070
- What?
- Bong Hee told me...

807
00:48:24,909 --> 00:48:27,210
not to talk about Mount Euak.

808
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,849
Bong Hee told me
not to talk about the money.

809
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:35,650
Bong Hee will scold us.
Stop asking questions.

810

Bong Hee.

811
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,829
I didn't tell her anything.

812
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:51,199
What? What do you mean?

813
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,239
Hello, Ms. Yun.

814
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,469
Yes, hello.
I came to see how she was doing.

815
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,639
It must be hard nursing her.

816
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,679
It's not hard at all.

817
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,079

Does she eat well?

820
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:16,019
I want to go home.

821
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,960
I'll come and get you
when you get discharged.

822
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,030
What?

823
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,329
You must be busy.

824
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:23,530
It's fine.

825
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:25,570
Get well soon.

826
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:28,670

Yes?

828
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,820
Lend me some money.

829
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,289
Will you lend it to me?
I need quite a lot.

830
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,230
Do you think...

831
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:34,570
I'm an ATM card?

832
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:38,809
You really think...

833
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,780
I'm a walking bank.

834
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:43,809
You won't even ask...

835
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,980
what the money's for?

836
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:49,119
Are you disgusted
that I only care about your money?

837
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:55,920
You crushed my self-esteem
to rock bottom.

838
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,030
Fine. I get it.

839
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,130

We gave Mi Yeon one million dollars,

891
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,579
so let's hand the others
the same amount.

892
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:42,550
Auntie.

893
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,289
Grandma gave her a million already?

894
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,219
Auntie got a million dollars
and is pretending she didn't.

895
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:50,030
Did Grandma really give it to her?

896
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,260
Why?

897
00:54:52,929 --> 00:54:54,099
What do you mean by that?

898
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,269
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

899
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,039
(50 dollars)

900
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,349
Yes?

901
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:17,420
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

902
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,159
Did you look into
the money launderers?

903
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:21,659
Where are they located?

904
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:24,329
I'm still looking.

905
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:25,929
Are you?

906
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,630
Your investigation
hasn't turned up anything yet.

907
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,469
That's right.

908
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,869
Did you also look into White Bear?

909
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:35,900
I checked with Intellectual Crimes.

910
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,869
Like you said,

911
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:40,340
there was nothing illicit
about his inheritance.

912
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:43,409
Baek Ji Yeon paid her taxes as well.

913
00:55:43,409 --> 00:55:45,679
There wasn't any information
about ten million dollars in cash,

914
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,320
so I asked for a follow-up.

915
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,090
I'll keep tracking the money
and report back to you.

916
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,920
Sure.

917
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:55,820
You're dismissed.

918
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:57,789
Right.

919
00:55:57,789 --> 00:56:01,030
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

920
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,440
This is Lieutenant Oh
at Intellectual Crimes.

921
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,110
This is Chief Yun.

922
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:16,179
Hello, ma'am.

923
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:19,250
The follow-up
on the ten million dollars...

924
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,880
requested by Sergeant Lee Mu Rim.

925
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,250
Report to me first
before you go to anyone else.

926
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,619
And discreetly.

927
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,289
Do you catch my drift?

928
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:34,159
Sure. Keep up the good work.

929
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,260
- Auntie!
- My gosh!

930
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,829
Auntie.

931
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,900
Are you stealing this money
behind Grandma and my mom's back?

932
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,500
Grandma didn't give it to you?

933
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,900
Why are you stealing from them...

934
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,969
and in small amounts
up to a million dollars?

935
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:54,280
Do you even know what this money is?

936
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,380
This isn't our money.

937
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,739
By spending it,

938
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,409
you'll be found guilty of theft.

939
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:02,449
What? This money isn't...

940
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,219
What is this money, then?

941
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:07,260
Whose money is this?

942
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,289
Your parents and my mom
stole this money,

943
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:12,489
and here you are
stealing it from them.

944
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,559
Thieves stole this
from Ms. Baek Ji Yeon.

945
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,800
Grandma, Grandpa, and Mom
stole it from them.

946
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,599
And now you're stealing it
from your family!

947
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:21,170
How can you even live with yourself?

948
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:23,570
I...

949
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:27,409
I don't get what you're saying.

950
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:30,079
Forget that and lead the way.

951
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,579
Where did you hide
the million dollars?

952
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:33,480
Where did you hide it?

953
00:58:34,019 --> 00:58:35,250
Give it back!

954
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,849
This money must be returned
to its owner.

955
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,920
Because of this money,
our family will end up behind bars!

956
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:45,260
Auntie!

957
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:46,690
Please!

958
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,059
Darn it.

959
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,469
Hold on.

960
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:55,239
Unbelievable. Will you stop talking?

961
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,969
I deposited it in the bank.

962
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:58,570
How stupid do you think we are?

963
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:01,380
Banks are required to report
cash deposits over 10,000 dollars.

964
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,579
There's no way
you took it to a bank.

965
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:05,110
I said I'd get it to you tomorrow.

966
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,780
- Come on!
- My gosh.

967
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:11,150
I had no idea what that money was.

968
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,219
I'm sorry, but I spent it all.

969
00:59:13,219 --> 00:59:14,360
I spent every dollar.

970
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,519
I don't believe
anything you're saying.

971
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,860
Give it back.

972
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,889
I'll tell Shin what you did.

973
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,030
- Excuse me.
- Where next?

974
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,860
- To the right? The Left?
- Stop it!

975
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:24,400
- This way.
- Hey!

976
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:43,320
Design Director Lee Cha Rim.

977
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,059
Did you have her resign?

978
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:48,659
Did she give you her notice?

979
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,760
Are you playing dumb?

980
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,869
You dared to stab me in the back?

981
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,780
If she handed in her resignation,
have it approved.

982
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:17,190
Lee Cha Rim.

983
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:19,190
This company trained her.

984
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:22,219
She went from clueless
to being our top designer.

985
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:25,090
It was my dime that covered
for her mistakes as she improved.

986
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,059
So who are you to poach her?

987
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,769
I did no such thing.

988
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:36,639
She resigned of her own accord.

989
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,110
She wants to resign, so...

990
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:41,679
Hold on.

991
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,550
To be clear,
I was her direct supervisor.

992
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,750
You didn't speak
to her that often...

993
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,550
to say
that you trained her yourself.

994
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,690
I was the one
who worked on projects with her...

995
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:54,719
after I became managing director.

996
01:01:04,699 --> 01:01:06,599
Poaching employees
this disrespectfully...

997
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,000
in this field?

998
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:12,969
I'll show you
what ramifications that entails.

999
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,110
Do you run your business
by always being civil?

1000
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,219
Did you build the company
to this level...

1001
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,320
by being polite and courteous?

1002
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,489
I'll hire people
that can propel my business...

1003
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:29,289
and run my company.

1004
01:01:34,829 --> 01:01:36,400
I won't approve of her resignation.

1005
01:01:38,469 --> 01:01:39,800
If I don't sign off on it,

1006
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,199
she won't be able to leave.

1007
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:42,900
Is this how you run your business?

1008
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:44,940
I'm trying to earn some money.

1009
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,210
Is this you stymieing my efforts?

1010
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,519
Don't get in my way.

1011
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:00,289
It's not like
you ever did anything for me.

1012
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,389
Live a good life with your real son.

1013
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:06,389
When you kicked me out
and had him move in with you,

1014
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,030
you did as you wished.

1015
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:10,199
Not this time though.

1016
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:13,670
Approve...

1017
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,539
of her resignation.

1018
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:26,510
(Unmanned Storage Locker)

1019
01:02:28,949 --> 01:02:30,690
Open it while we ask nicely.

1020
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:33,789
It's not your money.
It isn't ours either.

1021
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:35,619
Why are you even crying?

1022
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:37,059
Don't you want to give it up?

1023
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,929
Enter your PIN.

1024
01:02:40,929 --> 01:02:43,030
(Enter your PIN.)

1025
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,670
- That's your passcode?
- Anyone could've guessed that.

1026
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,840
Your birthday is hardly a secret.

1027
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:56,639
It's my money. It's mine.

1028
01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:59,449
The money I could start over with
following my divorce.

1029
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:02,280
It's my love.

1030
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,789
Don't be a drama queen
when you're nothing but a thief.

1031
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:06,789
Move!

1032
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,590
What?

1033
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,369
(Iron Family)

1034
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:58,309
Are you saying
someone stole a million dollars?

1035
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:01,139
Will we be able to do this
before Ms. Baek goes to the police?

1036
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:02,940
Are you sure you got rid
of all the evidence?

1037
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,949
You stole it, didn't you?

1038
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:06,050
You've moved on to stealing now?
From your mother of all people?

1039
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,920
Does Gang Ju have leverage
over the two sisters?

1040
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:11,320
What's with you?
Is this some kind of protest?

1041
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,519
I'll prove to you
that money is all I care about.
