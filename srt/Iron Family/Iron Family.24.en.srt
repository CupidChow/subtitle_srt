1
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,409
Mom, I want soup as well.

2
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,409
Sure.

3
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,539
- Right.
- Hold on.

4
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,640
Will Tae Woong be working
at his father's company?

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,810
That's what Bong Hee said.

6
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,450
My gosh. If he does things right,
he might inherit the company. Right?

7
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,649
What? Bong Hee,

8
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,219
will Tae Woong end up running...

9
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,119
that big company one day?

10
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,189
Maybe.

11
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,899
Why? Would that be wrong?

12
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,100
- What?
- What?

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,530
No, we'd love that for him.

14
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,500
As if you need to ask.

15
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,739
The chairman isn't the type
to pass down the company to him...

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,069
just because
they're related by blood.

17
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,209
- What?
- What?

18
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,140
He puts everything
to the test first.

19
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:12,680
He values other things
over blood ties.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,750
- What?
- What? Other things?

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,750
As in what?

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,019
Who knows?

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,750
Hey. Then don't talk
like you know everything.

24
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,750
I heard
that the nuisance got the boot.

25
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,319
By the way, that nuisance
will be staying in the rooftop unit.

26
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,430
- What?
- Who?

27
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,859
- Who's staying there?
- That nuisance?

28
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,299
Wait. Are you talking about the son
of Chairman Ji's wife...

29
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,269
who set fire to our dry cleaner's?

30
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,069
Is he staying here because of you?

31
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,340
What? Gosh, no.

32
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,579
What is it?

33
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,810
Bong Hee, what's going on?

34
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,879
Are you sure?

35
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,420
Tae Woong took his room
at the house,

36
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,680
so he's taking Tae Woong's unit.

37
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,549
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

38
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:56,890
What choice did he have?
He's broke and homeless.

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,890
He's broke, homeless,
and apparently shameless.

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,129
Everyone has a sense of pride.

41
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,129
He just chose to be shameless
because he had to be.

42
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,099
That nuisance grew up privileged
with rich parents...

43
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,000
and has a huge ego.

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,900
Are you taking that nuisance's side?

45
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,409
We're on Tae Woong's side, you brat.

46
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,139
The nuisance is one of us as well.

47
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,639
What?

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,280
- What?
- What?

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,280
I mean,
why are we even taking sides?

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,550
That's childish.

51
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,319
I'll go and wash up.

52
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,620
Why you...

53
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,990
Hold on.

54
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,330
Is that nuisance staying
in Tae Woong's unit?

55
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,930
- Why?
- Talk about bedding the enemy.

56
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,830
You've got to be kidding me.

57
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,830
As for me,

58
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,069
a fire starts inside my chest
every time I see the man...

59
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,610
who burned
our three million dollars.

60
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,340
- We went through a lot for that.
- Tell me about it.

61
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,180
Exactly. He should keep his distance
from us,

62
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,310
not come to live here
in the same building!

63
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,580
Doesn't he know
that he's the reason...

64
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,650
that this old man and woman
almost died?

65
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,650
My gosh.

66
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,189
Mother, Father,
calm down and have your breakfast.

67
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,460
Goodness.

68
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,729
It's freezing.

69
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:10,830
It's cold.

70
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,129
It's freezing out here.

71
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,139
What...

72
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,620
It's freezing!

73
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,189
Darn it.

74
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,860
Now my hands are dirty.

75
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,469
Please. It's cold!

76
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:49,830
My gosh.

77
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,300
I have to wash them again.

78
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,039
You idiot.

79
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,770
What the...

80
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:58,139
Where's the towel?

81
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,280
Mother, Father, you're here.

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
Mi Yeon, I'm off to make deliveries.

83
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,919
Mother, I'm off to make deliveries.

84
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:09,949
Sure.

85
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,520
Hold on.

86
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,530
Now that Tae Woong isn't around,
we should hire someone.

87
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,829
I'll be around a lot
except for the evenings.

88
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,829
Get up there
and have your breakfast.

89
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,399
It won't take long.

90
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,670
Dad, do some exercise
at the community center.

91
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,300
You too, Mom. Got it? You promised.

92
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:29,269
My goodness.

93
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,209
You must've shocked her greatly...

94
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,779
when you lost consciousness.

95
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,819
She's nagging you to exercise...

96
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,250
all because she's worried
you might die.

97
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,689
Lucky you.

98
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,430
Let's not skip any sessions
at the community center.

99
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:50,060
Going back and forth
will serve as a workout too.

100
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,060
Sure thing.

101
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,160
Good.

102
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,470
I'm off to work, Auntie.

103
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,569
- Have a good one, Da Rim.
- Got it.

Have it with rice. It's too salty.

109
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,139
So? Are you now staying
at the rooftop unit?

110
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,980
Eating here
is just like eating at home.

111
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,550
You grew up
eating my mother-in-law's food,

112
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,279
so this is home-cooked food for you.

113
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,319
Gi Dung, you have more experience
as a businessman,

114
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,490
so can I come to you for advice?

115
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,689
- You bet.
- Thanks.

116
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,800
Hey. Do you think
it's easy to run a business?

117
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Ask anything and I'll...

118
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,569
Where'd he go?

119
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,600
Have a nice day.

120
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,810
My goodness. Come here.

121
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,180
That punk...

122
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,620
Do your best to stay away
from my mom and grandparents.

123
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:00,689
How can I do that
when I'm not a ghost?

124
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,149
Don't you know why?

125
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,459
Because I burned the three million?

126
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,790
That, plus my mom is worrying...

127
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,629
and fretting about me
going out with you.

128
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,660
My grandparents will feel the same.

129
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,459
Even though we're not dating.

130
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:15,699
- I'm glad that she's fretting.
- What?

131
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,170
She should fret.

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,399
We're not dating.

133
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,209
This is business.
I just want to make a lot of money.

134
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,740
What will you do today?

135
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,649
You want to know?

136
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,580
Not about you personally.
About our deal.

137
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
Junior Staffer Lee.

138
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,149
"Junior Staffer?"

139
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,159
Yes. I promote you
from the secretary.

140
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,299
What does a junior staffer do?

141
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:46,960
Everything.

142
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Then what do you do?

143
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,769
Everything. Do you have to ask?

144
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,539
We do the work of hundreds.

145
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,139
Don't! How dare you touch me?

146
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,879
You can touch me,
but I can't touch you?

147
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,450
You're crazy.

148
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,409
There are so many people
who could see us.

149
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:04,549
Are there?

150
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,750
I don't see anyone.

151
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,250
You can't. No way. You just can't.

152
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:13,960
You! You can't touch me again. Okay?

153
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:17,529
Why is it okay for you to grope me
but not for me to grope you?

154
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,460
Don't you touch me, then.

155
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,129
I'll do the exact same as you do.

156
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,169
Okay.

157
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,870
- I'll do exactly what you do.
- Fine.

158
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,440
While you're at work,
I'll name the company,

159
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,179
get a business license,
order business cards,

160
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,250
make some calls
to suppliers and factories,

161
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,179
and plan our cash flow,
so come home early.

162
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,919
Go ahead, Junior Staffer Lee.

163
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,889
"Yes, sir."

164
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,019
Answer first.

165
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,990
Junior Staffer Lee.

166
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,190
Yes. Sir.

167
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:51,559
Good.

168
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,370
You nuisance.

169
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,980
What if Mom, Grandma,
and Grandpa bully him?

170
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:10,980
He was spoiled.

171
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,379
He's like a child by water.

172
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,250
He's slow, can't hide his feelings,

173
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,850
and lets it show that he likes me.

174
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:17,659
It's insane.

175
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,490
It's crazy. Just crazy.

176
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,519
It's mild but moist.

177
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,759
I'm your superior.

178
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,460
We have boundaries.

179
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,059
As much as I made you wait,

180
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,360
I'll let you get right back at me.

181
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,779
Tell me if you need anything else.

182
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,350
Do you want more rice, Tae Woong?

183
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,730
Are they possessed by ghosts
who talked themselves to death?

184
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,799
They're exactly the same.

185
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:37,330
Why live together
if they won't say a word?

186
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,899
Ms. Baek would freak out...

187
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,840
if she were to know he moved in.

188
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,240
Why are you out here?

189
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,389
It's your first time
coming to work together.

190
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,730
I thought you'd feel uncomfortable.

191
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,159
Not at all.

192
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,529
People are bound to talk anyway.

193
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,070
It's best to show them
and shut them up.

194
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,879
Oh, Director Cha.

196
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,580
Your car and gym card will be ready
when you leave work today.

197
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

198

(Sergeant Oh,

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,230
Hey, do you have something?

200
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,299
Yes. You asked about Yang Gil Soon.

201
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,710
He fell from a derelict building.

202
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,610
- Yes.
- We got a tip-off...

203
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,379
and raided a smuggler's office.

204
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,809
We got Yang Gil Soon's photo...

205
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:29,710
from one of the forged passports.

206
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,350
I'll send it over. Take a look.

207
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,820
Okay.

Captain.

211
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,629
Do you have something?

212
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,429
It looks like Yang Gil Soon
tried to stow away from Incheon.

213
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,539
They raided a smuggler's office...

214
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,370
and found his fake passport.

215
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,440
I'll go to Incheon
and talk to the smuggler.

216
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,409
If they were there
when Yang Gil Soon died,

217
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,009
they could've taken the money.

218
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,379
Let's see...

219
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,990
Hyeong Cheol and Dong Hyeon
are questioning suspects.

220
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,460
Take Lieutenant Song with you.

221
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:16,059
Find out where the money is
and how much there is.

222
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,129
Get to it.

223
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

224
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:24,240
(Passports)

225
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,879
You know this guy, don't you?
Yang Gil Soon.

226
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,460
You were there, weren't you?

227
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:52,559
Did you kill him and take the cash?

228
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,669
Where is it now?

229
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,710
You forged private papers
and brokered a stowaway.

230
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,409
Murder and theft on top of that...

231
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,409
means you'll go away
for a long time.

232
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,519
We didn't kill him.

233
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,220
What cash?

234
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,820
All he had was 80 dollars.

235
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,059
He got worked up
and fell backward on his own!

236
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,899
How are we to believe that?

237
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,600
Why didn't you call it in?

238
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,799
Out of fear.

239
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,539
Of going down for murder too.

240
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:35,110
You can't dupe us!
Where's the money, punk?

241
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,470
We didn't take any money!

242
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,980
We only took his phone.

243
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,720
Which is it?
Which is Yang Gil Soon's phone?

244
00:15:58,659 --> 00:15:59,730
This one.

245
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,570
Is this it?

Hey. We wear the same sneakers.

254
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,299
Look at this.

255
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,470
It's from the same person.

256
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,009
It's the same number.

257
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,549
Doesn't this look like
Gil Soon's foot?

258
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,909
The pants.

259
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,580
When he died...

260
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,690
It looks like the pants in the photo
the detective showed us.

261
00:16:56,549 --> 00:17:00,419
There's no way he contacted us
from the afterlife.

262
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,389

Of course.

and store environment
improvement programs.

280

Does that mean I can receive
financial support without a loan?

Yes. Would you like to consult
with an expert?

I want to start a new business.

283

Is it possible?

Of course.
I'll help you with that too.

285

When you have a lot of money,

286
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,069
you don't tell me about it.
Why do you think that is?

287
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,740
Does that mean
you don't want to give me the money?

288
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,250
Where did they get
such a big amount of money?

289
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,890
Did they hit the jackpot
or something?

290
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,619
It's really strange,
and I'm really curious about it.

But I won't ask.

The moment I tell them
that I know about the money,

294
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,779
I won't be able to steal it.

296

at a time at ease.

My ex-husband is busy...

298

caring only about his new wife
and the baby in her belly.

299
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,589
So he wouldn't even pay for
my Shin's academy.

300
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,690
I don't mind being a thief.

301
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,289
I mean, it's not from a stranger.

302

Or two million dollars.

305
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,460
I'll just take that much
and run away.

and becomes a doctor.

who turned her internship...

312
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,220
into a full-time position.

313
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,059
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:26,799

I hope we'll get along well.

317
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,900
As you already know,

318
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,269
the only experience I have
in clothing is washing,

319
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,940
ironing, and delivering clothes
at a dry cleaner's.

320
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,769
And I know nothing about design.

321
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,710
Just get me a good design.

322
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,450
With the good design I get,

323
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,150
I'll make sure
you'll get more incentives...

324
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:48,220
than the employees of our rivals
regardless of a market situation.

325
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,490
Why do you think
Chairman Ji put me here?

326
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,660
I'll resign if our performance
turns out to be poor.

327
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,259
Let's put ourselves
in a win-win situation.

328
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,599
- Okay.
- All right.

329
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,329
By the way, I thought...

330
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,299
you and Design Director Lee
knew each other.

331
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,470
- Well...
- No.

332
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,109
I'm just Director Cha's subordinate.

333
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:14,509
All right then.

334
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:17,710
Let's get back to work.

335
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,049
Okay.

336
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,049
Is it true that you got promoted
to design director?

337
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,660
Congratulations.

338
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,190
What about Tae Woong?
Is it okay to work with him?

339
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,130
I told you to get over Tae Woong
and move on.

340
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,029
Do you still have feelings for him?

341
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,730
It's strange
that Tae Woong is Chairman Ji's son.

342
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,000
And it's strange
that I should call him Director Cha.

343
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,539
Tae Woong feels like
a different person now.

344
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,940
I feel awkward and distant from him.

345
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,970
I can't even look him in the eye.

346
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,079
For me, he finally looks like
real Tae Woong.

347
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,210
It feels like
he's finally found his place.

348
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,650
Maybe you know Tae Woong
better than I do.

349
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,089
Of course.

350
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,650
I'm sorry to say this,

351
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,819
you just imagined...

352
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,559
what Tae Woong would be like
when you were blind.

353
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,430
You have no idea...

354
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,529
how sharp he can be
to hurt others' feelings.

355
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,329
He never showed you...

356
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,000
the mean and hot-headed side
of him, did he?

357
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,869
Is he like that?

358
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,299
Since you had the eye issue,

359
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,710
he was just being nice to you.

360
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,480
But he always nagged at me.

361
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,150
"Your skirt is too short.
You should sit straight."

362
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,119
"Go easy on the alcohol."

363
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
"Be nice to your mom."

364
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,250
"Come home more often."

365
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,089
"Don't waste your money.
Are you out of your mind?"

366
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:30,150
"What's with your outfit?"

367
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,289
"Are you home or at the office?"

368
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,559
"What's wrong with your makeup?"

369
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,890
When he's frigid,
he's like a human freezer.

370
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,069
Cha Rim.

371
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,400
Yes?

372
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,170
He delivered clothes all day,

373
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,099
and he struggled
with the iron all day.

374
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,210
Because of the steam,
it's so hot in front of the iron.

375
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,009
When he washed his back
on the rooftop at night,

376
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:55,210
I noticed salt falling off his back.

377
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,180
You didn't know that, did you?

378
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,980
Salt?

379
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,690
When I was blind,

380
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,789
he was the one who was nicest to me.

381
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,359
You should be nice to him.

382
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,630
There's no way I can beat you.

383
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,569
Hey! I'll find a guy
who's a lot sweeter...

384
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,509
and more decent than Tae Woong
and set you up with him.

385
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,640
No thanks.

386
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,079

00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:48,029
I'm not the type
to approach others first,

390
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:49,500
and I don't talk a lot,

391
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,170
so I often come across as angry.

392
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:54,539
I'll work with you
to solve problems anytime.

00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,309

What?

400
00:24:39,819 --> 00:24:41,619
Junior Staffer Lee,
aren't you getting off work yet?

401
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:43,089
I'm leaving now.

402
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,650
CEO Seo.

403
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,529
If we want to make
million of dollars,

404
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,529
we'll have to have our own design.

405
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,759
But before that,
we need to open an online store...

406
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,170
and generate sales
of more than 2,000 dollars.

407
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,630
Only then we'll get the right
to start live commerce.

408
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,670
First,

409
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,440
we'll purchase some clothes
at the Dongdaemun Market.

410
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,170
Are we purchasing clothes?

411
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,269
Yes. Why?

412
00:25:04,539 --> 00:25:06,740
You want to buy clothes
and sell them?

413
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,839
Of course.

414
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,579
Then it won't have much margin.

415
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,750
Let's just go to Dongdaemun.

416
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,119
I've been calling around all day.

417
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:16,650
Hang on.

418
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,460
Wait.

Do you want me to come
and pick you up?

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,890
No.

421
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,329
Mom, some customers
drop off good clothes...

422
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:30,630
and don't pick them up
for over ten years.

423
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,799
Do we still have the clothes?

424
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,799
Yes.

425

- Sure.

00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,890
Is Seogang Apparel the name
of our company?

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,960
Yes. Anyway, what are these?

437
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,599
These are expensive clothes.

438
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,140
They're of fine quality.

00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,940
CEO Seo, let's sell these.

440
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,180
Junior Staffer Lee,
where did you steal these from?

441
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,309
My shoulders are killing me.

442
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,049
Just because we stole your money,
you keep accusing us of theft.

443
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:32,190
I'll let it slide since I'm ashamed.

444
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,859
That's not it. I just want to know
where you got these.

445
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,529
You carried both sacks
over your shoulders...

446
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,000
like a thief.

447
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,170
These...

448
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,099
My goodness.

449
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,569
This has been here for ages
without anyone claiming it.

450
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,170
Have you called the owner?

451
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,609
Of course.

452
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,539
She must've changed her number
because no one picked up.

453
00:27:54,609 --> 00:27:55,609
I went to the house...

454
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:57,380
only to find
that other people were living in it.

455
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,750
Unbelievable.
It's such a nuisance...

456
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:02,220
how some people
don't collect their clothes.

457
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,319
Should we throw them away?

458
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:09,230
Still, we should give it back
if they come by years later.

459
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,059
We couldn't possibly
throw them away.

460
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,660
It's not a storage facility
we're running.

461
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,799
People should be quick
to collect their clothes.

462
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:21,240
Some move and forget about them,

463
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,809
some leave them here
because they gained too much weight,

464
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,410
some leave them behind
because they're outdated,

465
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,849
and some won't come by
because it'll cost them.

466
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,579
What are we supposed to do
with all these? My goodness.

467
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:36,049
We must spend money
to run a business!

468
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:38,220
Why are you thinking
about spending money first...

469
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,619
rather than earning money?

470
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:42,130
It's better to sell the clothes
we buy in Dongdaemun.

471
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,460
Rather than buying clothes
in Dongdaemun, sell these.

472
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,960
Customers haven't claimed these
for over ten years...

473
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,130
and have forgotten about them.

474
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,599
Selling them won't be illegal.

475
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,240
What if the owners...

476
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,309
see that we're selling
their clothes...

477
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:56,670
and call the company?

478
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,109
Unclaimed laundry of three months...

479
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:02,309
can be legally disposed of
by those running a dry cleaner's.

480
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,710
Throwing them away could be better.

481
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,450
Selling other people's clothes
for a profit is another issue.

482
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,019
If we get off on the wrong foot
with consumers,

483
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,650
we might not be able to sell
our clothes via live commerce.

484
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:13,960
But I saved a ton of money for us.

485
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,529
Whatever we earn will be a profit.

486
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,859
Without spending a penny,

487
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,359
we'll wash, iron, and press them.

488
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,000
You can take photos
of me wearing them.

489
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
We'll then cut off my face
in the shots...

490
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,200
and sell them online
as vintage clothing.

491
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,599
They've come back in style.

492
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,869
Vintage clothing?

493
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,109
Seogang Apparel's a good name.

494
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,279
The admin ID is Seogang,
and the password is Darim.

495
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,019
One shouldn't be this clueless
when running a business.

496
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,450
We need to quickly earn money.

497
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,150
We don't have a lot of time.

498
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,190
Stop it!

499
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,690
Isn't it our goal
to earn 2,000 dollars,

500
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,160
which will get us a live channel
to sell our clothes?

501
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:53,930
Why spend money to earn that right?

502
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,299
Your love for freebies
will bite you in the back.

503
00:29:56,369 --> 00:29:58,500
Business is about trust.
We have to win people over.

504
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,569
What good would it do
to have people say...

505
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,140
that we're trying to run a business
by playing it cheap?

506
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:05,440
What if this hurts
your family's dry cleaning business?

507
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,950
I'm all for saving money,
but we'll never do this.

508
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:14,180
You frustrating brat.

509
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:16,420
How are we supposed
to run a business together,

510
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:19,059
and when will we be able to earn...

511
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,420
millions of dollars?

512
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,529
I can't run a business
with a rigid and frustrating man...

513
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:24,990
who won't take risks.

514
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,730
Junior Staffer Lee, stop that.

515
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,099
I had no idea...

516
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:37,710
you had the blood
of a businesswoman.

517
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,809
You'll either hit the jackpot...

518
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,609
or flop miserably.

519
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,779
Hitting the jackpot is key.

520
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:47,450
When will I earn 800,000 dollars
by earning penny by penny?

521
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,450
With this attitude,

522
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,650
you might end up
with a debt of 800,000 dollars.

523
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,160
It's better to approach negatively
when running a business.

524
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,559
Be prudent.

525
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:59,200
Should we run a business
thinking that we might tank it?

526
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,599
Why bother then?

527
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,029
- Have you eaten?
- As if I had the time.

528
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,000
I was too busy
carrying these over here.

529
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,970
Meanwhile, you were here
tapping away on your laptop.

530
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,880
Meanwhile, you're against...

531
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,150
selling the clothes that I busted
my butt off to carry home.

532
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,319
- Junior Staffer Lee.
- Darn. Whatever.

533
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:20,819
Where are you going?

534
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,990
I should take these back.

535
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:25,519
- I'll come with you.
- Forget it.

536
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,690
My grandparents and mom hate you,

537
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,859
so don't follow me out.

538
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,359
You'll have to answer to me
if no one buys the clothes...

539
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,500
we get from Dongdaemun.

540
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,599
Wouldn't that be a waste of money?

541
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,000
I guess you have
a lot of time on your hands.

542
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,670
- Darn.
- Be the CEO instead then!

543
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,210
What the...

544
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,809
Could they be accomplices?

545
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,049
They might not have been present
for the theft,

546
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:51,980
but they would've known
about the money.

547
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,019
They're loan sharks after all.

548
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:54,950
It didn't sit right with me...

549
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,450
not to investigate them
just because they had alibis.

550
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,920
- Let's wait and see.
- Sure.

551
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,500
Mom, I'm sorry.

552
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,799
I can't make it.
I'm on a stakeout with Mu Rim.

553
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:10,470
You'll have to eat dinner alone.

554
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,839
Hey. I told you I was making
something special tonight.

555
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,910
We agreed to eat together!

556
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,539
We're on a stakeout.

557
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,779
Where?

558
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:30,019
(Love Capital)

559
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,990
Sung Hoon, why weren't you
picking up your phone?

560
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:36,559
We received a text from a ghost.

561
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,630
What are you talking about?

562
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,099
There was a photo
of Gil Soon's sneakers...

563
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,230
and one of a tree
with his pants tied to it.

564
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,369
Did you also get the text?

565
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,640
Hold on.

566
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:49,509
(1 unread message)

567
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,279
Send me the texts you received.

568
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:05,789
- What the...
- What?

569
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,359
Mom, why did you come here?
It'll only burden us.

570
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,690
That's exactly why I'm here.

571
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:14,230
I'll see to it that you eat
this special meal.

572
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,930
Should it be this hard
to dine together?

573
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:21,269
Is it because you find it awkward
to eat with me?

574
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,240
Am I that tough to be around?

575
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:26,240
It's about time you eased up
around your mother-in-law.

576
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,609
I'm sorry.

577
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,049
If you spend your nights out here,

578
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,690
when will you have a baby? Here.

579
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,420
All right.

580
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:43,329
Come on. Open up.

581
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,859
- Mom, let me.
- Open up.

582
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,059
There you go. That's it.

583
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,369
Unbelievable.

584
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,269
My gosh. Eat first, okay?

585
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:55,509
We're not living in some war zone.

586
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,440
What case is it that requires
an undercover operation?

587
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,980
Right.

588
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,009
Here. Before Yang Gil Soon died,

589
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:07,049
he scheduled a text message
to be sent to those at Love Capital.

590
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,949
I see.

591
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:12,420
And because you turned on
his phone today,

592
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,019
they received the text.

593
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:17,230
That would've had them
squirming like eels...

594
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,059
that got sprinkled with salt.

595
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,730
They'll go and dig up
the money soon.

596
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,599
Meanwhile, you're here to see
if they were in on it too.

597
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,599
Good work.

598
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,369
This is good work, Sergeant Lee.

599
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,039
You're doing great.

600
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,179
- Mom, please.
- Right.

601
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:39,219
(Love Capital)

602
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,320
That's Kim Sung Hoon,
a savings bank vice president.

603
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,659
I see.

604
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,059
That punk...

605
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,500
is the actual bankroller
of that loan shark business.

606
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,469
Yes.

607
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,000
(Love Capital)

608
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Boys.

609
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:01,599
- Sung Hoon.
- Sung Hoon, you're here.

610
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,070
Before Gil Soon died,

611
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,070
he scheduled a text message
that would be sent to us.

612
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:06,139
- What?
- What?

613
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:08,809
Gil Soon was the thief
we were after all along.

614
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,750
Hey.

615
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,719
These texts indicate...

616
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:19,659
that he took ten million dollars
from Ms. Baek's house...

617
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,019
and buried the money...

618
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,190
under this tree marked by his pants
at Mount Euak.

619
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,269
There. Look closely.

620
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,599
It's a 50-dollar bill
that starts with AA.

621
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,670
- Sung Hoon!
- Sung Hoon!

622
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,570
He died after giving us the money.

623
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,110
Let's go and find it.

624
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:41,880
The money is in Mount Euak.

625
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
- Of course.
- Of course.

626
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,119
How much money are we talking about?

627
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,860
Chairman Ji is feigning ignorance,

628
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,360
but I'm sure there was a safe
in the house.

629
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,429
Hold on.

630
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:59,800
What's the name
of Chairman Ji's wife?

631
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,000
It's Baek Ji Yeon.

632
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,130
Baek Ji Yeon...

633
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:05,099
Baek Ji Yeon?

634
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,900
The daughter of White Bear?

635
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,340
White Bear? Who's that?
Do you know who it is?

636
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,510
Yes, a big player
in the loan shark business...

637
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,409
who dominated in Seoul.

638
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,449
His daughter's name is Baek Ji Yeon.

639
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:22,550
That's it!

640
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,590
About 15 years ago,

641
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:26,159
when 50-dollar bills
were first released,

642
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,889
There was talk that White Bear...

643
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:30,329
made 10 million in 50-dollar bills
in 2 days.

644
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,829
We even got a tip-off.

645
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,460
We were going to investigate,

646
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,429
but we couldn't do much
because he died.

647
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:39,869
But...

648
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,610
the inheritance process
was suspiciously clean.

649
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,880
We never found
the rumored ten million either.

650
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,980
(Love Capital)

651
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,150
Yang Gil Soon stole
Baek Ji Yeon's inheritance,

652
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,449
not Chairman Ji's slush fund?

653
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,719
You mean Yang Gil Soon stole...

654
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:02,389
ten million dollars?

655
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,230
My gosh.

656
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,829
Sergeant Lee.
This could be a huge deal.

657
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,170
Let's get going.

658
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,599
(Two-piece Black Suit)

659
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:18,869
(Product posted)

660
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,059
Don't just scan the ground.
Look carefully.

661
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,130
Find the tree
with his pants tied to it...

662
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,159
and dig underneath.

663
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,500
Hey, it's this way.

664
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,380
Hey. It's this spot.

665
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,980
- Dig right here.
- They must've found something.

666
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,380
Let's move in.

667
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,320
They're digging.

668
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:19,829
Gil Soon, thank you.

669
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,070
Gil Soon was really smart.

670
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,639
He sent the coordinates.

671
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:30,840
If we dig up the cash,

672
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,880
can we get two million
from Ms. Baek?

673
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,579
You morons.

674
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,119
Gil Soon was guilty,
so we must keep quiet.

675
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,820
He went to so much trouble...

676
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,789
to leave it to us, and then he died.

677
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,519
Who should we share it with?

678
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,119
Why should we share it?

679
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,690
It's for us alone.

680
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,559
Yes, you're right.

681
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:52,190
Gang Ju told us to stop looking.

682
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,559
We can keep the cash.

683
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:56,070
Stay away from Seo Gang Ju.
Don't get too close.

684
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,730
Don't let him come to our office.

685
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,000
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,070
- Let's dig.
- Okay.

687
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,639
(Recording)

688
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,909
I wish I could just kick them...

689
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,820
I mean, I'd love to question them.

690
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,820
The moment they dig it up
and take it,

691
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,289
we must take them down for theft.

692
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,250
I doubt they'll find it
before sunrise.

693
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,590
Sung Hoon.

694
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,360
Are you sure it's here?

695
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,000
We dug for hours
and haven't found a dime.

696
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,570
I can't dig anymore.

697
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,699
I'm done.

698
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,480
- Are you sure it's here?
- I can't dig anymore.

699
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:13,739
Darn it.

700
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,280
We can't stay here any longer.
Let's fill in the hole.

701
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,909
- What? That's crazy.
- You must be kidding.

702
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,550
Move it.

703
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,650
- Oh, my gosh.
- Fill in the hole.

704
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,420
Shoot.

705
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,030
What's this?

706
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,030
What is it?

707
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:39,239
It's a woman's button.

708
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:43,239
I came here to find cash, not this!

709
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,010
Get moving.

710
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,239
- Darn it.
- I'm so tired.

711
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,480
- Cover it up.
- Okay.

712
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Mom.

713
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:04,159
Mom. Wake up.

714
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,030
What? Any news?

715
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,230
Are we done?

716
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,030
Let's go.

717
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,369
- Take this.
- Hey.

718
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:12,869
- Take it.
- You take it.

719
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:18,369
My gosh.

720
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,440
Wait up.

721
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,590
Mom.

722
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,530
Did you find something?

723
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:44,730
What's that?

724
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:46,599
Is it cash?

725
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,039
Darn it. It's just a button.

726
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,340
Is something bothering you?

727
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:56,409
No.

728
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,349
Is she out of her mind?

729
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,789
She acted like she'd kill me.

730
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,000
She does whatever she wants.

731
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,469
My goodness.

732
00:44:42,989 --> 00:44:45,719
The house is as quiet as a temple.

733
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,170
What are you doing?

734
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:35,139
You should either get out...

735
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,409
or come in and sit.

736
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,010
Okay.

737
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:50,150
Have you been well?

738
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:51,590
What about you?

739
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:52,889
Well...

740
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,789
Have you been working out here?

741
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,460
I already paid for the membership.

742
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:00,929
So I'll keep working out here
until December 31.

743
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,400
I don't want to waste the money.

744
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,539
It's cold now, so the shower
at my place is uncomfortable.

745
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:13,940
The hot water is on and off.

746
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:15,710
Where are you staying?

747
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,519
My friend's place.

748
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,679
Why wouldn't your friend
fix the boiler?

749
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,389
It's not that he fixes it himself.

750
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:25,989
All he needs to do is call someone.

751
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:32,329
Can I keep calling you Father,
Chairman Ji?

752
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,130
Why do you even ask?

753
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:43,440
Just call me what you will.

754
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,670
Okay.

755
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:07,500
I'm not interested
in taking your position.

756
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:10,530
But Father can have someone
both on his right and on his left.

757
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,199
I know you are his son,

758
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:16,670
but you can't split your body
into two and take both his sides.

759
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:19,610
We're not related by blood,
but I like Father.

760
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,309
Even after he got divorced,
he's still my father.

761
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,719
Even after he fired me,
he's still my father.

762
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,590
I can hear your regrets
push their way through the wall.

763
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,659
If you take Father's right side,

764
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,519
I'll be on his left side.

765
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,389
If you take his left side,
I'll sit on his right side.

766
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:40,929
His stepson and his biological son.

767
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:44,130
He probably has two shoulders
and two arms...

768
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,500
to love and give a chance
to both of them.

769
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,940
So he can embrace
and encourage both his sons.

770
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:51,909
You can take his left arm.

771
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,710
And I'll take his right arm.

772
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:58,449
Do you want the right arm?

773
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:01,820
You lunatic.

774
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,820
I'm not trying to compete
with you for your place.

775
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:10,590
Don't worry about it.

776
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,730
You don't want to keep him all
to yourself, do you?

777
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,699
Don't push me away
so I can't come near him.

778
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:25,369
Let's stay by his side together.

779
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,920
This is the 500,000 dollars
that Gang Ju owes this company.

780
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,460
Yes, ma'am.

781
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,630
I paid it off.

782
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,329
So stop treating my son
like some debtor anymore, okay?

783
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,730
Yes, ma'am.

I have no one to talk to,

00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,969
so I was about to have cobwebs
around my lips.

They're designer clothes that were

00:55:58,929 --> 00:55:59,960
Really?

894
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,260
I'll come home...

895
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:05,429
and kick that darn thief out.

896
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:06,469
Please.

897
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:08,599
Please do that.

898
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,170
My gosh.

899
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,380
You did good work today, Da Rim.

900
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,250
Right. Have a pleasant night, sir.

901
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,420
Okay.

902
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,119
What?

903
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,460
(Order complete, 29 new orders)

904
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,460
(Sold out)

905
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,159
No way.

906
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:36,769
(Sold out)

907
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:39,030
No way!

908
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,260
Why are you out here in the cold?

909
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,000
What is it? Are you going
to pull out some fireworks for me?

910
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:18,469
Do you think I'm a joke?

911
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:21,880
Of course not.

912
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,380
Then what?

913
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:26,010
"Then what?"

914
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,119
That's right.

915
00:57:35,019 --> 00:57:37,889
It's not a question,
so you don't have to answer.

916
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,559
But I want to answer.

917
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:42,599
Forget it.

918
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,469
Who did this to you?

919
00:57:46,969 --> 00:57:48,000
You.

920
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:53,809
You're the only employee I have
who could hurt me like this.

921
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,340
But we're sold out.

922
00:57:57,250 --> 00:57:58,650
Do you know who bought them all?

923
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,579
Who?

924
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:03,989
Cha Tae Woong bought them all...

925
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:06,449
since it could cause trouble
for the store.

926
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:09,260
That's a fine talent you have.

927
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:12,130
Are you happy
now that you've made me a fool?

928
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:15,630
You took the photos all night
and posted them in secret.

929
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,900
Then you came to the rooftop unit
to take care of me...

930
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,170
just to make yourself feel better.

931
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:28,210
Don't cry.

932
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,409
You don't have the right to cry.

933
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:36,449
I'm sorry.

934
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,590
I made you look like a fool.

935
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,960
You didn't do anything right,

936
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,900
but you didn't do anything wrong.

937
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:52,630
It's not your fault.

938
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:54,940
It's mine.

939
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:03,309
Stop crying.

940
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,849
Get going.

941
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:13,250
Go to your grandparents and mom...

942
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,460
and calm them down.

943
00:59:31,769 --> 00:59:32,769
CEO Seo.

944
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:44,449
How was my late-night kiss?

945
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,289
How was it?

946
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,590
Wasn't that...

947
00:59:51,929 --> 00:59:54,030
your way of easing your mind...

948
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,099
after the big mess you caused?

949
00:59:57,829 --> 00:59:59,030
You just thought...

950
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,539
your kiss wouldn't cost you money,

951
01:00:01,539 --> 01:00:03,599
so you kissed me out of pity, right?

952
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:05,639
That wasn't it.

953
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:08,579
It wasn't?

954
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,980
To me, you're hope.

955
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,849
I like you.

956
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,250
I have feelings for my boss.

957
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,190
Junior Staffer Lee.

958
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:26,289
Was that a real kiss?

959
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,800
Yes.

960
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:39,369
I'll give you
a proper one next time.

961
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,510
I'll give you
a proper one next time!

962
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:00,699
No, let me go.

963
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,969
- Let me go.
- You can't leave like that.

964
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:07,739
I just did.

965
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:09,869
Hey.

966
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,039
There's no man in Korea...

967
01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:13,610
who'd let a girl run off
after hearing that.

968
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:14,880
You can be naughty.

969
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,210
Is it always on your terms?
Is this a one-way stream?

970
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,880
I don't think...

971
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:24,289
you kissed me in that motel room.

972
01:01:25,389 --> 01:01:26,619
It was me kissing you.

973
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:42,469
Dragging it out
will only make it awkward.

974
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,949
(Iron Family)

975
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,019
But you disliked Seo Gang Ju too.

976
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:34,360
Move out and stay away from Da Rim.

977
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,389
Don't you dare tell him to move out,
Cha Tae Woong!

978
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:37,760
The jerk who can't be read...

979
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,429
and Assistant Manager Lee
who's shallow make a great match.

980
01:02:39,429 --> 01:02:42,260
I'm now Design Director Lee,
you rotten brat!

981
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:45,769
Let's just look further into
that suspicious dry cleaner's.

982
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:47,170
They keep digging in vain.

983
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:49,239
Could it be that someone else
took the money first?
