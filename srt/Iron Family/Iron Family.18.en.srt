00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,270
(Episode 18)

3
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:22,223
Ms. Lee.

4
00:00:23,318 --> 00:00:26,688
The chairman approved of everything
Director Gang Ju put together...

5
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:28,533
for the FW season,

6
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:29,658
and that's a first.

7
00:00:29,658 --> 00:00:31,688
He didn't request any revisions.

8
00:00:32,627 --> 00:00:34,098
He called the director
to his office.

9
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,803
Does that mean he's coming around?

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,197
Probably.

11
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:40,298
Gosh, what a relief.

12
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:44,668
The tension
between the father and son...

13
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:47,037
has been making things difficult
for us too...

14
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:48,978
since we've had to tread carefully.

15
00:00:49,547 --> 00:00:52,307
I didn't expect you to say something
like that.

16
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,947
I'm also just another employee here.

17
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:57,918
Ms. Lee,
will you be working late again?

18
00:00:57,918 --> 00:00:59,117
Head home first.

19
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,864
I'm going to wrap things up
and head home early as well.

20
00:01:01,888 --> 00:01:03,857
Sure. See you tomorrow, Ms. Lee.

21
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:06,228
Yes, sir. Have a good night.

(Truth of embezzler
Seo Gang Ju's New York life!)

23
00:01:19,977 --> 00:01:22,108
Tae Woong is not one
to post something like this...

24
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,408
on a company bulletin board.

25

27
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,047
Wait.

28
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:31,217
It was uploaded at 7 a.m.

(Da Rim)

30
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:47,497
- Hey.
- Mom.

31
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:51,268
Didn't Tae Woong return from
New York on the 28th?

32
00:01:51,637 --> 00:01:52,938
Was it the 28th?

33
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:54,777
Yes, this Monday.

34
00:01:55,037 --> 00:01:56,548
Yes, it was Monday. Why?

35
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:58,077
When did he arrive
at the dry cleaner's?

36
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:01,348
It was right before dinner,
so around 6 p.m.

37
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:02,648
Why?

38
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:04,887
Really? Are you sure it was 6 p.m.?

39
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,587
Yes. He came home...

40
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:10,763
and ate with your grandparents
at their usual dinnertime.

41
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:13,033
Cha Rim joined us as well.

42
00:02:13,057 --> 00:02:14,928
What's this about? I'm busy as is.

43
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:16,367
Got it, Mom. I'll hang up.

44
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,027
Hey, can't you have dinner
with us today?

45
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:19,327
Why...

46
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:25,538
Goodness. Cha Rim?

47
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:26,878
Cha...

48
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:29,308
My gosh.

49
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,378
What is she going to say
to Tae Woong again?

50
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,848
This is embarrassing.

51
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:36,887
As if anyone would like
a gold digger.

52
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:39,088
Even I'd be put off
by someone like that.

53
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:44,258
How did I give birth
to someone as shallow as her?

54
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:49,133
Tae Woong,
don't fall for her antics.

55
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:51,343
Don't give her any chances.

56
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,538
Put up a steel wall.

57
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:55,938
Don't let her think
she has a chance.

58
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:01,077
They'll make a sweet couple though.

59
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:05,008
If I think about it,
they're compatible.

60
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,408
They look good together.

61
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:11,823
From New York to Incheon.

62
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,388
That means...

63
00:03:13,388 --> 00:03:15,857
he would've been stuck on the plane
for at least 15 hours.

64
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:27,367
What's your next plan?

65
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:28,867
I'll help.

66
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,107
Whatever my plan is,
you're not in it.

67
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:37,808
Okay, fine. I hear you.

68
00:03:38,048 --> 00:03:40,948
I'll let you play hard to get
since I made you chase after me.

69
00:03:40,948 --> 00:03:44,147
You can let me stew as well. Okay?

70
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:48,117
Also, Da Rim still has feelings
for you.

71
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:51,627
She thinks
she likes you romantically,

72
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:54,258
but she only loves you
like a brother.

73
00:03:54,798 --> 00:03:57,527
When she was blind,
you were the only man in her life...

74
00:03:57,527 --> 00:03:59,297
for over ten years.

75
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:03,238
Keep your intentions clear
so that you don't hurt her.

76
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:04,268
Behave accordingly...

77
00:04:04,268 --> 00:04:06,167
and draw a clear line.

78
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,684
Being who I am,
I can take my heart being broken.

79
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,308
But not Da Rim.

80
00:04:12,777 --> 00:04:15,147
The last thing I want
is to see her get hurt.

81
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:22,687
I'm just saying.

82
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,933
I know you'd never hurt her,
but just in case.

83
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,898
She should end up with a decent man.

84
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:31,228
I'd never hurt Da Rim,

85
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,768
so don't worry.

86
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,768
What do you mean by that?

87
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,138
I mean it as is.

88
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:39,237
Now, go.

89
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:54,687
Should we spend the night together?

90
00:04:55,017 --> 00:04:56,564
Maybe I shouldn't go home.

91
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,088
What about the other guy?

92
00:04:58,387 --> 00:04:59,798
- What guy?
- The guy you went on...

93
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:01,098
a blind date with.

94
00:05:02,457 --> 00:05:05,598
We didn't even start dating.
I dumped him.

95
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,297
You should've come out...

96
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,698
when I told you to that day.

97
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:14,677
And that day, I crossed the Pacific.

98
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:38,997
We'll see how long you last.

99
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,620
(Love Capital)

100
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:55,212
Darn it.

101
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:15,838
You found the thieves?

102
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,968
I'll come to Love Capital
after work.

103
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,087
(Love Capital)

104
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,057
(Love Capital)

105
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,394
Why are you just standing there,
Gang Ju?

106
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:35,857
Come have a seat.

107
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,127
Sit there.

108
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:50,367
What did you find
on the dry cleaner's CCTV?

109
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:55,683
They replaced the CCTV system.

110
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,507
Soon after your home was burgled.

111
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:02,677
They could've done it on purpose
to hide a crime.

112
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:04,593
Are you convinced...

113
00:07:04,617 --> 00:07:08,057
this family is
the thief's accomplice?

114
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:12,788
I set fire to the store,
and it burned down.

115
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:14,398
They replaced everything,

116
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:16,574
redid the interior,
and got new CCTV cameras.

117
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:19,168
Of all the people
who come and go from this place,

118
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:20,514
who could've worked with Mr. Oh?

119
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:22,997
Their son
is the only healthy male adult.

120
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:26,214
Do you think
a detective could be the accomplice?

121
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,937
Not the detective.

122
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,007
Even if we found...

123
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:32,447
a stack of AA 50-dollar bills
at his wedding,

124
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:35,478
does that justify
stealing their CCTV footage?

125
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:38,187
If Detective Lee were to find out
we suspected his innocent family,

126
00:07:38,187 --> 00:07:40,888
that would throw the chairman
in a rage.

127
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,687
Detective Lee Mu Rim's involved,

128
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:48,328
so we must be extra cautious
about going after them.

129
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,567
- Drop it.
- Hey. It's this.

130
00:07:53,197 --> 00:07:54,598
Look at this.

131
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,538
I called you over to see this.

132
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:57,968
See what?

133
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:00,677
My goodness.

134
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,687
Long time no see, Manager Kim.

135
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,603
You still do this, I see.

136
00:08:19,627 --> 00:08:20,958
Yes.

137
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:24,127
It's been a long time, sir.

138
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,228
We last met at White Bear's funeral.

139
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,598
Guys.

140
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:37,648
Are these the friends
you've been hanging out with?

141
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:40,947
Well, Chair... Fath...

142
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:44,318
Chair... Father... I just...

143
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:53,504
Were you looking for the thief
who colluded with my driver?

144
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,298
With Manager Kim and your friends?

145
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:58,997
Were you looking for
your mom's money...

146
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,438
behind my back?

147
00:09:01,498 --> 00:09:03,114
Father.

148
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,367
Were you looking for
your mom's money in secret?

149
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,014
It's not a small amount.

150
00:09:09,038 --> 00:09:12,277
How could you not try
to recover ten million dollars?

151
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,747
I'll help you, sir.

152
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,747
Mom's not looking for the money,
is she?

153
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:20,157
What?

154
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,234
- She's not.
- Is she lying low?

155
00:09:24,258 --> 00:09:27,298
Yes. Mom isn't looking for
the money anymore.

156
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,478
Hey. How did he know about this?

157
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,078
Did he follow you?

158
00:09:50,518 --> 00:09:52,323
Father!

159
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:53,688
Father.

160
00:09:55,018 --> 00:09:56,958
Father.

161
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:32,434
(35 Buja-ro, 2 na-gil)

162
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,798
Honey.

163
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:39,244
Where could you go
in the middle of the night?

164
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:41,838
Why would you leave?

165
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:44,137
Honey.

166
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,037
Honey.

167
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:50,248
- Honey.
- Father.

168
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,048
Father. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,548
Mom gave up looking,

170
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:56,024
but I... I'm the one to blame.

171
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,887
I'm done living with you two.

172
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:02,517
We can't live without you.

173
00:11:03,087 --> 00:11:04,727
I was stupidly foolish.

174
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,587
You know how much...

175
00:11:06,587 --> 00:11:09,458
Mom and I love and respect you.

176
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:13,798
I can't live with two liars.
I won't!

177
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:18,107
Let's see how you do
after you stabbed me in the back.

178
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,614
No, wait.

179
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:20,938
Hands off!

180
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:25,548
Honey. I really had no idea.

181
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:28,617
I didn't know he met with
Manager Kim to find my money.

182
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:30,124
You idiot.

183
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,987
Don't do what your father
tells you not to.

184
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:33,958
Don't you know
how scary he is when he's angry?

185
00:11:35,357 --> 00:11:38,728
Why would you leave
when Gang Ju's in the wrong?

186
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,404
You should leave!

187
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:44,767
You betrayed your father,
so you should move out!

188
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:46,928
Don't just stand there.

189
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:50,308
Why should your father leave
when you messed up?

190
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:53,307
Is that how little you think of
your father?

191
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:54,977
Why didn't you even
talk to me first?

192
00:11:54,977 --> 00:11:57,448
You should leave. Now go.

193
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,517
Do you love money that much?

194
00:12:00,618 --> 00:12:02,793
Does that matter more to you
than the company?

195
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:05,218
Get out of here, you fool!

196
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,948
How dare you?

197
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,078
Honey.

198
00:12:31,148 --> 00:12:32,478
Honey.

199
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:37,163
You know how timid
and easily scared I can be.

200
00:12:37,187 --> 00:12:40,857
You know I wince
when you so much as glare at me.

201
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,987
Why would I look for the money...

202
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:47,027
when I know you donated so much
for my sake?

203
00:12:48,428 --> 00:12:50,968
That fool was out of his mind.

204
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:53,644
He must learn a lesson.

205
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:55,913
Let's kick out Gang Ju...

206
00:12:55,937 --> 00:12:58,307
and live together, just you and me.

207
00:12:58,307 --> 00:13:01,938
Let's forget about him
and stay together. Okay?

208
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:29,413
Stay elsewhere just for a few days.

209
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:31,768
You and I are liars, to be honest.

210
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:33,407
And we got caught.

211
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:36,553
If your father were to leave now,
he would never come back.

212
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:38,283
You know what he's like.

213
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:40,053
So you'll kick out your son?

214
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:42,648
One of us has to survive.
We can't perish together...

215
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:44,647
if we're to make a comeback.

216
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:48,387
If we don't do this,
this will be the end of our family.

217
00:13:49,357 --> 00:13:50,828
My gosh.

218
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:55,428
Okay. Fine.

219
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:57,627
You can live without me...

220
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:00,997
but not without Father?

221
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,808
- It's not that.
- Whatever.

222
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,678
I too can live without you,
but not without Father.

223
00:14:11,847 --> 00:14:14,293
Stay at a hotel.

224
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:16,178
He's icy cold right now,

225
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,347
but I'll check on his mood...

226
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,688
and make him let you come back.

227
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:25,187
If he leaves with a suitcase now,
he'll never come back to us.

228
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:28,328
Whatever. I'll take care of this.

229
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,148
(35 Buja-ro, 2 na-gil)

230
00:15:34,998 --> 00:15:37,468
Tae Woong.

231
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,168
Tae Woong.

232
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:00,293
(Da Rim)

233
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:10,568
Why won't he pick up?

234
00:16:36,418 --> 00:16:37,757
Darn it.

235
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:40,328
My goodness.

236
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:04,225
(Posted on October 28, 07:11:28)

237
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,658
Who told you to come in
without my permission?

238
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,087
Mr. Cha Tae Woong.

239
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:48,898
What?

240
00:17:49,497 --> 00:17:51,228
Mr. Cha Tae Woong.

241
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,037
"Mr. Cha Tae Woong?"

242
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:59,138
How dare you call me like that?

243
00:18:00,108 --> 00:18:04,178
You are just as rude as your sister.

244
00:18:08,078 --> 00:18:10,418
After making the post
at seven in the morning,

245
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,987
how could you have dinner here
at six in the evening?

246
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,487
The flight from New York
to Seoul is 15 hours.

247
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:16,558
Including the time...

248
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,928
spent at immigration and customs
and from the airport to this place,

249
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:22,797
it'll take at least 17 to 18 hours.

250
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:25,928
You were on the flight
when this was posted.

251
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:29,567
Why would you say
that you did what you didn't do?

252
00:18:32,668 --> 00:18:35,384
Tae Woong, why did you lie?

253
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:37,723
I knew you wouldn't do such a thing.

254
00:18:37,747 --> 00:18:39,208
Why did you lie?

255
00:18:39,608 --> 00:18:42,118
You should go and tell him again.

256
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:45,547
Hurry and tell him
that it wasn't your doing.

257
00:18:49,858 --> 00:18:52,287
This doesn't matter to him.

258
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:55,398
He already thinks that I did it,

259
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,297
and that's what he wants to believe.

260
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,997
Let him believe
what he wants to believe.

261
00:19:00,937 --> 00:19:03,467
He has already concluded...

262
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,037
that I would do such a thing.

263
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:08,438
He has never accepted...

264
00:19:09,578 --> 00:19:12,208
the fact that I am his son.

265
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:14,948
Don't you even feel wronged?

266
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:20,355
(Truth of embezzler...)

267
00:19:25,828 --> 00:19:27,658
My mother who gave birth to me...

268
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:30,827
told me to make the post
so I could use it to my advantage.

269
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:32,628
And my father...

270
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:35,797
found me after 30 years,

271
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:40,567
but he blindly believed
I'd made such a post to harm him.

272
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:44,077
I don't care what he thinks of me.

273
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:46,208
What does that even mean to me?

274
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,517
It doesn't matter at all.

275
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,188
Get out.

276
00:19:57,328 --> 00:19:59,433
Why are you being like this
if it doesn't matter?

277
00:19:59,457 --> 00:20:02,358
Why do you drink every day
if you don't even care?

278
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:05,027
Hey, Cha Tae Woong!

279
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:07,737
Stop it.

280
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:11,084
Get me a blanket on your way out.

281
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,308
Why is your room so cold,
by the way?

282
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:15,337
You should turn on the boiler.

283
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:19,347
Seriously,
why are you being like this?

284
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:21,847
This is driving me crazy.

285
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:25,817
Hang on.

286
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:44,968
Goodnight, Tae Woong.

287
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:28,277
Mr. Kim.

288
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:32,218
What you found
on the CCTV at the dry cleaner's.

289
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:35,057
Just give it back
to the dry cleaner's.

290
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,450
(Love Capital)

291
00:21:39,936 --> 00:21:41,666
So what is it?

292
00:21:41,965 --> 00:21:45,305
Does the footage show how the people
at the dry cleaner's...

293
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,035
hid the AA 50-dollar bills...

294
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:50,106
that they stole from my mother
here and there in the store?

295
00:21:50,106 --> 00:21:51,406
No.

296
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:55,585
If that's not it,
what on earth did you find?

297
00:22:02,126 --> 00:22:04,085
Hey, this is it. Look.

298
00:22:04,755 --> 00:22:06,855
I wanted you to see this.

299
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:14,436
Did you know your father went in
and out of this place?

300
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,505
Why is he taking his shirt off here?

301
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,535
This woman looks so shy.

302
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:22,052
They don't look like the owner
of a dry cleaner's and a customer.

303
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:24,652
It's not even a hotel room.
In the dry cleaner's?

304
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,075
Hey.

305
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,985
I just can't make out
what they're saying.

306
00:22:29,985 --> 00:22:32,686
This is killing me, seriously.

307
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,956
He could've taken it off
to have it cleaned.

308
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:43,765
I know. But why?

309
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:44,802
What?

310
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,936
It's not like
your father has only one suit.

311
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:48,336
He's the chairman
of an apparel company.

312
00:22:48,336 --> 00:22:50,936
Isn't it like
he has more than 100 shirts?

313
00:22:52,475 --> 00:22:54,076
I think...

314
00:22:54,076 --> 00:22:56,646
he didn't change his shirt
on purpose.

315
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:58,275
He wanted to take it off there.

316
00:22:58,275 --> 00:22:59,716
Come on!

317
00:23:00,475 --> 00:23:02,616
Father isn't the type
to do such a thing.

318
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:04,285
Darn it.

319
00:23:04,846 --> 00:23:07,186
He even has a paper bag
full of dirty laundry. Look.

320
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:08,785
Gosh, that's...

321
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:11,785
Do you see the laundry
in the paper bag?

322
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:13,995
"What is your wife doing?
Doesn't she wash your clothes?"

323
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:16,226
They're probably speaking ill
of your mom. Don't you think so?

324
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,396
He could've changed his shirt...

325
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,866
and put the dirty one
in the paper bag.

326
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,866
But why...

327
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,136
You're right. Why didn't he do that?

328
00:23:25,005 --> 00:23:27,275
Doesn't it look like an affair
to you?

329
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:30,176
When Father eats with his employees,

330
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:32,545
he removes the plastic wrap of
jajangmyeon and mixes it for them.

331
00:23:34,275 --> 00:23:36,585
He's kind to his employees too.

332
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:38,755
He's tough only on me.

333
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:42,062
And they're friends from college.

334
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,386
Really?

335
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:46,926
But it smells fishy.

336
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,265
That's ridiculous.
You're just biased.

337
00:23:49,426 --> 00:23:52,335
And this has nothing to do
with the money.

338
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:54,595
Isn't this a bigger problem
than the money?

339
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:57,636
Your mom loves the chairman...

340
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,136
so dearly.

341
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:03,646
And I love and respect
my father too.

342
00:24:03,705 --> 00:24:05,916
Don't accuse him of something
he didn't even do.

343
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:09,316
So is this
what a respected father...

344
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:11,845
and a beloved husband would do?

345
00:24:12,386 --> 00:24:13,656
He's the chairman, after all.

346
00:24:13,656 --> 00:24:16,355
Why would he drop off his laundry
at the dry cleaner's himself?

347
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:21,555
I find this lady
at the dry cleaner's very fishy.

348
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:24,426
Don't you think so?

349
00:24:24,426 --> 00:24:26,396
No. It's not fishy at all.

350
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,505
I'll bring this back
to the dry cleaner's.

351
00:24:33,676 --> 00:24:35,305
- You will?
- Yes.

352
00:24:36,346 --> 00:24:39,976
And you should never tell Mom
about this.

353
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,792
This is driving me nuts.

354
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:50,656
(Love Capital)

355
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:54,525
Does Gang Ju even want
to find the money?

356
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:56,701
He's not in his right mind now
because Chairman Ji found out.

357
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:58,265
He even got kicked out of his house.

358
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:00,096
And yet he came here again.

359
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:01,781
That means
he won't give up on the money.

360
00:25:01,805 --> 00:25:04,082
But why would he sleep here?

361
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:05,676
He grew up sheltered,
so he can't stay there long.

362
00:25:05,676 --> 00:25:06,775
Just leave him be.

363
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,338
(Love Capital)

364
00:25:18,045 --> 00:25:19,785
She paid off her debt,

365
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,486
but why did he give her
the money back?

366
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:29,866
Crazy?

367
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:32,166
Did she say "crazy?"

368
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,366
Crazy?

369
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,511
This is driving me crazy!

370
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,105
Gosh, this is crazy.

371
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,676
Da Rim!

372
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:48,398
(Seoul Cheonglyeom Police Station)

373
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,048
Yes, thank you. Have a good day.

374
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,149
- Was that forensics?
- Yes.

375
00:25:58,289 --> 00:25:59,818
You're all here early.

376
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,089
We were waiting
for forensics to call.

377
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,558
What did they say?

378
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:05,575
No fingerprints were left behind,

379
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,458
but they managed to get
DNA samples...

380
00:26:07,458 --> 00:26:09,798
on the oxygen-cutting machine
that was in the unregistered car.

381
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,974
It matched Yang Gil Soon...

382
00:26:11,998 --> 00:26:14,139
who was once arrested for assault.

383
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:17,639
That's why his DNA was
in the DNA database.

384
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,339
Yang Gil Soon?

385
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,409
As in the dead loan shark?

386
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:24,285
Yes. Do you know him?

387
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:26,819
He used to run a loan shark business
called Love Capital,

388
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,154
and his death was recent.

389
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:29,819
He fell
from an abandoned building...

390
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:32,565
at an industrial complex in Incheon,
so his death was ruled accidental.

391
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:36,058
The Incheon Police said
no foul play was involved.

392
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:39,958
Wasn't his accomplice Oh Min Gi
arrested near Incheon Port?

393
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:44,728
Seeing how Yang Gil Soon also died
near Incheon Port,

394
00:26:45,268 --> 00:26:48,038
they were probably in hiding
waiting to be smuggled out.

395
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,839
It doesn't make sense
that they'd leave the country...

396
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,909
after stealing chump change
from Ms. Baek.

397
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,484
How much did these punks steal?

398
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,048
Do you think it was all in cash?

399
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,518
Of course, it was all in cash.

400
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:04,419
Cashier's checks
would be worth nothing to them.

401
00:27:04,988 --> 00:27:07,318
And stashed money is usually
in 50-dollar bills.

402
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:12,258
Would the safe still be
at Chairman Ji's house?

403
00:27:12,658 --> 00:27:16,528
Hold on. Oh Min Gi is locked up,

404
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,268
and his accomplice Yang Gil Soon
is dead.

405
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:24,169
What happened to
all the 50-dollar bills, then?

406
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:33,355
Da Rim, come on!
Have breakfast before you go.

407
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:36,149
Breakfast is ready, Mother, Father.
Please sit.

408
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:46,458
It's not coming back to me
even though I slept on it.

409
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:49,268
I even dreamed about
falling off a cliff...

410
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:51,474
while searching for the ledger.

411
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:54,339
You'll cross the River Styx
at this rate.

412
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,169
Should I fake dementia
in front of Mu Rim?

413
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:03,349
There's no need to fake it
since your actions are that...

414
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:06,718
of a man who has... My gosh.

415
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:09,748
You can't even be half a person,

416
00:28:09,748 --> 00:28:12,934
so why bother eating food
that is a full portion?

417
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,505
Mother, Father, that's enough.

418
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,234
I'm sure you put it somewhere safe.

419
00:28:17,258 --> 00:28:18,998
Remember how we found
your hearing aid...

420
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,159
in the fruit section of the fridge?

421
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,298
Do you even remember the money
we have under the bed?

422
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,515
Grandma, Grandpa,
did you hide money under the bed?

423
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,869
- What?
- What?

424
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,478
Do you have money stashed away?
I didn't catch you.

425
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,609
Even if it's gone,
don't think I took it.

426
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,218
Mom, that reminds me.

427
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,518
Something's up
with Tae Woong's room.

428
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,119
The boiler must be broken.

429
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:45,089
He might've frozen to death by now.

430
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,335
- What?
- What?

431
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,258
When I get my first paycheck,
I'll give you some of that money.

432
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:54,198
Gosh, I'll be late. I'm off to work.

433
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,005
Da Rim, what about breakfast?

434
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:57,498
I'm already late.

435
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:03,738
What... I'm sure
she didn't hear us clearly.

436
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:07,278
Shouldn't we see
how Tae Woong's doing?

437
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:15,548
- What?
- Hold on.

438
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:19,089
- Goodness. He's alone there.
- What's wrong?

439
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:23,258
My gosh. Hang on.

440
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:27,899
Goodness me. The floor is freezing.
What's wrong with it?

441
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:30,805
The boiler seems to be working.

442
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:32,938
What could be the problem, then?

443
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,768
- What?
- He'll catch a cold at this rate.

444
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:37,238
Goodness me.

445
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:40,508
The boiler must be malfunctioning.

446
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,849
- What?
- We should wake him up...

447
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:46,478
and have him sleep some more
at our place where it's warm.

448
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:47,518
- Sure.
- Right.

449
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:49,889
Tae Woong?

450
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,434
Hold on.

451
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,659
What's that?

452
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:02,929
Those are hearts, of course.

453
00:30:03,129 --> 00:30:05,369
- Hearts?
- Darn it.

454
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,809
Wait. Don't you know
what hearts are?

455
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,909
As if I wouldn't know
what hearts are.

456
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,879
Unbelievable. Bong Hee.

457
00:30:15,448 --> 00:30:18,349
A girl must be coming by his place.

458
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,625
Who else can it be but Cha Rim?

459
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,265
This is embarrassing.

460
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:24,518
Tae Woong is far from interested.

461
00:30:25,488 --> 00:30:27,488
Are you sure...

462
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:30,129
he doesn't have any kind of feelings
for her?

463
00:30:30,658 --> 00:30:32,758
I guess he at least likes her
a little bit.

464
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,468
Tae Woong. Sleep more downstairs.

465
00:30:51,579 --> 00:30:52,619

00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,159
Unbelievable.

476
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,768
Good morning.

477
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:14,689
Excuse me.

478
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,929
The FW collection was approved
without any hitches.

479
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:26,468
Is that so?

480
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:29,839
Congratulations on being praised
by the chairman.

481
00:33:31,668 --> 00:33:34,778

to bury the hatchet with Tae Woong.

What?

00:33:55,832 --> 00:33:58,832
Look. They've already moved your desk.

This is great news.

488
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:02,947
Congratulations.

489
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,431
Congratulations, sir.

490
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:07,647
You got through it.

491
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,572
Come on. You got through it.

492
00:34:09,742 --> 00:34:11,171

This was decided...

496
00:34:29,853 --> 00:34:31,493
by the disciplinary committee
this morning.

497
00:34:31,893 --> 00:34:33,563
You are to resign...

498
00:34:33,563 --> 00:34:34,594
after paying back 500,000 dollars...

499
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:35,809
the company paid you
to study abroad...

500
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:38,470
or pay a contract penalty
of 1.5 million dollars and stay.

501
00:34:38,494 --> 00:34:40,034
If you choose to stay,

502
00:34:40,034 --> 00:34:42,180
you will be relocated
to a factory outside the city.

503
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:43,503
You must've known...

504
00:34:43,503 --> 00:34:44,804
that you had to pay
three times the amount...

505
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:46,104
for breach of contract.

506
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:52,014
- Yes.
- How you can return the money...

507
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:53,990
is explained in detail.

508
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:56,559
Please read the document
and sign it.

509
00:34:56,583 --> 00:34:59,254
So I have to pay the money back
and leave the company.

510
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,053
Is the chairman aware of this?

511
00:35:04,424 --> 00:35:06,193
It was the chairman's order.

512
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:08,664

that no exceptions would be made.

Where did you go last night?

516

To a hotel.

517
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,689
Which hotel is it?

518
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,483
I'll bring your clothes
and underwear.

519
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:37,254
You left with nothing last night.

520
00:36:39,924 --> 00:36:41,224
Hey.

00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:43,430
Are you angry with me?

522
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:46,463
Are you upset I told you to leave?

523

I'm not upset.

Which hotel are you at?

525
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:52,863
Later.

526
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,374
He's angry.

527
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:02,344
He's angry that I kicked him out.

528
00:37:02,344 --> 00:37:04,544
You kicked out Gang Ju?

and listen in?

530

Are you a ghost?

531
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:12,959
He wasn't kicked out.

532
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:15,084
It's none of your business!

If the boiler's working
but the room's cold,

536
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:32,519
there's a problem
with the pipes under the floor.

537
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:34,643
Fixing that
will be a massive undertaking.

538
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,544
It must cost a lot.

539
00:37:37,413 --> 00:37:41,684
Did this have to happen
when winter's around the corner?

540
00:37:42,143 --> 00:37:44,253
- Darn it.
- You know who to call, right?

541
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:45,784
I already told Tae Woong...

542
00:37:45,784 --> 00:37:48,253
water's dripping
through the ceiling...

543
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:50,294
of the room right below the rooftop.

544
00:37:50,454 --> 00:37:52,754
But he has been strange lately.

545
00:37:52,893 --> 00:37:56,070
The landlord
should fix such things right away.

546
00:37:56,094 --> 00:37:57,934
He used to.

547
00:37:58,034 --> 00:38:00,063
He has a lot on his mind.

548
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:02,734
Call the workers for me.
I'll tell Tae Woong.

549
00:38:03,574 --> 00:38:05,333
It'll take a while to fix.

550
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,244
What? A while? How long is a while?

551
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,950
Where should he go
when it's this cold?

552
00:38:10,974 --> 00:38:13,713
They'll dig up the whole floor,
put in new pipes,

553
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,284
and waterproof the place...

554
00:38:15,284 --> 00:38:17,154
since water leaked to
the floor below.

555
00:38:17,154 --> 00:38:18,713
It'll take a long time.

556
00:38:18,954 --> 00:38:21,053
It could take up to ten days.

557
00:38:21,123 --> 00:38:22,123
What?

558
00:38:22,123 --> 00:38:24,754
Oh, dear.
What should we do, Bong Hee?

559
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,324
Don't worry, Mother, Father.

560
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:28,063
He can stay with us in the meantime.

561
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:29,364
Do we have an extra room?

562
00:38:29,364 --> 00:38:32,634
He can stay in Mu Rim's room.

563
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:34,603
Mi Yeon can sleep with Da Rim...

564
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,110
until the work is done.

565
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:38,910
Do you think that would be okay?

566
00:38:38,934 --> 00:38:40,773
You know, our bedroom...

567
00:38:40,773 --> 00:38:41,919
Don't.

568
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:44,344
Why would Tae Woong
go into your bedroom?

569
00:38:44,344 --> 00:38:45,774
Exactly.

570
00:38:46,184 --> 00:38:48,914
Make him your son-in-law already.

571
00:38:48,943 --> 00:38:50,853
Wouldn't that be nice?

572
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,623
He's hardworking,
he owns a building,

573
00:38:52,623 --> 00:38:54,184
and he treats you well.

574
00:38:54,284 --> 00:38:55,824
He has no nosy parents...

575
00:38:55,824 --> 00:38:58,054
and it'll be like
gaining another son.

576
00:38:58,054 --> 00:38:59,923
One who's rich at that.

577
00:39:00,193 --> 00:39:02,324
We're not that kind of people.

578
00:39:02,324 --> 00:39:03,864
Why would you say that?

579
00:39:03,864 --> 00:39:07,233
We don't treat him well
because we have an ulterior motive.

580
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:11,309
It would be nice to have
a rich son-in-law.

581
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:13,574
Marry Tae Woong to your daughter.

582
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:17,243
No one in the neighborhood
would criticize you for it.

583
00:39:21,143 --> 00:39:22,883
My goodness.

584
00:39:28,784 --> 00:39:31,954
The chairman's on the phone
with the factory in Vietnam.

585
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:33,693
I'll wait.

586
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:35,863
Is it urgent?

587
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:37,763
No.

588
00:39:38,563 --> 00:39:40,434
The call is dragging on.

589
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:41,764
Wait at your desk.

590
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:43,880
I'll call you when he's done.

591
00:39:43,904 --> 00:39:45,604
Come back then.

592
00:39:51,213 --> 00:39:52,450
Ms. Lee.

593
00:39:52,474 --> 00:39:53,843
Yes, sir.

594
00:39:58,413 --> 00:40:00,024
Serve the chairman well.

595
00:40:00,623 --> 00:40:02,184
You're doing well.

596
00:40:03,023 --> 00:40:04,423
Do right by him.

597
00:40:05,824 --> 00:40:08,294
Am I really doing well?

598
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:12,693
Yes. Do what you're doing now.

599
00:40:13,603 --> 00:40:16,010
I thought
I'd just have to do simple tasks.

600
00:40:16,034 --> 00:40:18,979
It's tough having to check
the chairman's mood all the time.

601
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:20,374
It's simple.

602
00:40:20,744 --> 00:40:22,419
It's not simple.

603
00:40:22,443 --> 00:40:24,044
You can manage, Ms. Lee.

604
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:26,344
Always side with the chairman.

605
00:40:26,344 --> 00:40:28,189
Side with him at all costs.

606
00:40:28,213 --> 00:40:30,814
Take his side even if he's wrong.

607
00:40:32,114 --> 00:40:33,754
Even if the company's his,

608
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,570
he needs at least one person
like that.

609
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:38,294
I'll remember that.

610
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:41,763
The call must be over.

611
00:40:42,934 --> 00:40:44,039
Yes, sir.

612
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:45,539
Bring me some tea.

613
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:48,939
Yes, sir.
Director Seo is here to see you.

614
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,573
Shall I send him in?

615
00:40:50,804 --> 00:40:51,809
Okay.

616
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,144
Yes, sir.

617
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:55,974
You can go in.

618
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:07,627
(Chairman Ji Seung Don)

619
00:41:10,824 --> 00:41:12,553
Do you have more to say?

620
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:22,270
(Letter of Resignation)

621
00:41:24,574 --> 00:41:26,234
I resign, Father.

622
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:27,903
Yes.

623
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:29,974
I accept the decision.

624
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:33,343
I'll repay part of my tuition
with my severance pay,

625
00:41:33,483 --> 00:41:36,483
and the rest in installments
as the company demanded.

626
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:37,814
Don't worry.

627
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:39,484
I won't take...

628
00:41:39,724 --> 00:41:41,224
the company's money.

629
00:41:43,353 --> 00:41:46,163
I should've given up on film studies
when I became your son.

630
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:47,823
I was left with a yearning...

631
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:49,993
and I got both degrees.

632
00:41:50,764 --> 00:41:52,493
I deeply regret it
and I feel remorseful.

633
00:41:54,534 --> 00:41:57,003
I accept the penalty,
and I step down.

634
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:59,074
I'll leave quietly
so I don't become...

635
00:41:59,074 --> 00:42:00,774
a poor example for others.

636
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:09,213
Is that it?

637
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:17,894
Yes.

638
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:20,624
That's it.

639
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,693
Goodbye.

640
00:42:45,253 --> 00:42:46,584
Everyone.

641
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:52,493
The second batch
of the fall and winter line...

642
00:42:52,753 --> 00:42:55,263
that we worked so hard on.

643
00:42:59,193 --> 00:43:00,939
It was approved in one go.

644
00:43:00,963 --> 00:43:02,303
- Yes!
- Yes!

645
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:04,650
- No revisions needed?
- Right.

646
00:43:04,674 --> 00:43:06,443
The chairman approved it too?

647
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:09,604
Yes. I'll treat you all.

648
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:11,613
Good job, everyone.

649
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:13,614
- Let's eat out!
- Great.

650
00:43:13,614 --> 00:43:15,414
- I'd love it!
- Awesome.

651
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:17,553
Well done, everyone.

652
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,568
You know Yang Gil Soon, don't you?

653
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:57,638
How much was in the safe?

(Shinhyub Bank)

655
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:15,273
Here.

656
00:44:15,297 --> 00:44:16,998
I took out...

657
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:19,604
a high-interest loan
when I was in a bind.

658
00:44:19,628 --> 00:44:21,437
I can't take it anymore.

659
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:24,168
I'd like to switch
to a lower interest rate.

660
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:26,608
Some people consult us
then change...

661
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:28,977
to a loan that's easier to repay.

662
00:44:29,378 --> 00:44:30,407
Do I qualify?

663
00:44:30,407 --> 00:44:33,077
Just a moment. Let me check.

664
00:44:38,288 --> 00:44:40,317
You seem to qualify.

665
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:42,457
Oh, thank you.

666
00:44:43,188 --> 00:44:45,658
That's such a relief.

Yes. I'm sorry
I can't do it for you.

We need to hire someone.

689
00:46:34,027 --> 00:46:36,138
If you keep going like this,
you'll get sick.

690
00:46:37,097 --> 00:46:39,814
I won't get sick. I'm just happy
that the business goes well.

691

and napkins to the customers.

Just stop eating anchovy chips.

696
00:46:54,757 --> 00:46:57,258
You should stop coming here now.

697

You should hire someone strong,
not pretty.

701
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:12,138
This lady is too slim.

702
00:47:13,567 --> 00:47:16,037

Can I meddle in then?

704

Let's be honest. Have you
ever done this kind of work before?

705
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:24,624
Do you know how to work?

706
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:27,117
Just look at the outfit
you're wearing.

If oil splashes on her clothes,

708
00:47:29,418 --> 00:47:32,003
she should have it dry-cleaned.
It's designer clothes.

I never got to wear one,

710

so I know what's expensive.

00:47:40,398 --> 00:47:41,937
I'm sorry.

00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:52,207
You'll be wearing the uniform.

716
00:47:54,847 --> 00:47:56,517
This is not up for discussion.

717
00:47:57,347 --> 00:47:58,948
She'll start working tomorrow.

718
00:48:09,828 --> 00:48:11,397
This is the last one, right?

719
00:48:12,567 --> 00:48:14,467
Here. Thanks. You may go home.

720
00:48:14,467 --> 00:48:15,930
(Chairman Ji Seung Don)

721
00:48:16,398 --> 00:48:17,968
Well... Sir.

722
00:48:18,168 --> 00:48:19,508
What?

723
00:48:22,078 --> 00:48:23,378
Here.

724
00:48:24,007 --> 00:48:26,448
What is this?
Do I need to sign this too?

725
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:31,847
What is this?

726
00:48:31,847 --> 00:48:34,693
It's Cha Tae Woong's plane ticket
that shows he was on the plane...

727
00:48:34,717 --> 00:48:37,117
when the post about Director Seo
was made on the bulletin board.

728
00:48:43,027 --> 00:48:47,028
Did I cross the line
without knowing my place?

729
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:54,038
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

730
00:48:56,407 --> 00:48:58,378
Did your fever break with
the medicine?

731
00:48:58,748 --> 00:49:00,077
Yes.

732
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:02,847
I asked them to come
as soon as possible.

733
00:49:03,378 --> 00:49:04,888
They need to rip up the floor...

734
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:07,687
and replace the heating pipes.

735
00:49:08,617 --> 00:49:09,957
Okay.

736
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:12,658
You should stay at our place
during the renovation.

737
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:14,287
Okay.

738
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:16,897
I'm glad that you keep saying that.

739
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,328
- Okay.
- Mu Rim, Cha Rim,

740
00:49:20,328 --> 00:49:22,038
and Da Rim always say no...

741
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:24,838
to everything I say.

742
00:49:25,608 --> 00:49:29,378
I hardly say yes to other people.

743
00:49:32,078 --> 00:49:35,017
Are you seeing someone?

744
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:38,293
Why do you ask?

745
00:49:38,317 --> 00:49:40,048
Well...

746
00:49:40,317 --> 00:49:41,963
I saw...

747
00:49:41,987 --> 00:49:45,557
two hearts drawn on the mirror
in your room.

748
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:47,287
You're popular.

749
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:49,758
Did you see that?

750
00:49:50,558 --> 00:49:51,843
It's no big deal.

751
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:53,298
But it's a heart.

752
00:49:53,768 --> 00:49:55,468
A heart shape is a big deal.

753
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:57,567
It is something.

754
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:00,807
Tae Woong, a heart means
she has feelings for you.

755
00:50:07,447 --> 00:50:08,778
Who is it?

756
00:50:09,277 --> 00:50:11,077
Can't you tell me?

757
00:50:11,947 --> 00:50:15,593
Who is it? What kind of woman is it?
Just let me see her.

758
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:17,588
It's not like that.

759
00:50:18,288 --> 00:50:21,457
Cha Rim and Da Rim drew one each.

760
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,028
Da Rim too?

761
00:50:40,608 --> 00:50:41,917
What?

762
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,247
Tae Woong is seeing someone.

763
00:50:58,527 --> 00:51:01,667
Is Da Rim hitting on you
because you're rich?

764
00:51:02,197 --> 00:51:06,167
I thought she just liked you
as her older brother.

765
00:51:06,338 --> 00:51:09,937
This is driving me crazy.
It's so embarrassing. Those fools.

766
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,423
I'm sorry, Tae Woong.

767
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:13,108
I'm so sorry.

768
00:51:13,148 --> 00:51:14,717
I raised them wrong.

769
00:51:14,717 --> 00:51:17,117
I raised them
into money-crazy girls.

770
00:51:17,418 --> 00:51:19,517
That's because they were raised
in a poor family.

771
00:51:19,617 --> 00:51:21,264
I'll make sure to teach them well.

772
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:24,217
How could they barge into
a grown man's room...

773
00:51:24,217 --> 00:51:26,863
and draw hearts
with their red lipsticks?

774
00:51:26,887 --> 00:51:30,227
That's just wrong.
They're out of their minds.

775
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:33,267
They weren't...

776
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:37,238
like that before, right?
Did it happen before?

777
00:51:39,067 --> 00:51:40,408
Mother.

778
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:46,207
Do you not want me
to be your son-in-law?

779
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:48,948
Am I not good enough...

780
00:51:49,217 --> 00:51:51,117
because there will be no in-laws
for you?

781
00:51:52,887 --> 00:51:54,187
What?

782
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:57,318
That's disappointing.

783
00:51:58,927 --> 00:52:00,287
My gosh.

784
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:02,727
Don't worry.

785
00:52:02,757 --> 00:52:05,468
They're just joking around with me.

786
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:08,073
Even when they were young,
they just came to my room...

787
00:52:08,097 --> 00:52:11,367
to learn computers, play games,
and eat ramyeon with me.

788
00:52:13,137 --> 00:52:15,608
They're like my younger sisters.

789
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:19,178
I'll go and deliver these.

790
00:52:28,217 --> 00:52:29,918
- Let's drink. Cheers.
- All right.

791
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:32,128
- Cheers.
- All right.

792
00:52:37,328 --> 00:52:39,227
Do you want to order more meat?

793
00:52:39,498 --> 00:52:41,097
The meat is so tender.

794
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:44,468
Gosh, it tastes so good.

795
00:52:45,137 --> 00:52:46,437
Ms. Bae.

796
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:48,808
I guarantee
that they offer the best food.

797
00:52:48,808 --> 00:52:50,684
Where is Ms. Bae?

798
00:52:50,708 --> 00:52:52,208
- Auntie!
- Yes.

799
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,478
- Over here.
- Okay.

800
00:52:53,478 --> 00:52:54,917
Do you want more?

801
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:58,388
- How could you start working here?
- Later.

802
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:01,334
- I'll get you more white kimchi.
- Okay.

803
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:02,633
Thank you.

804
00:53:02,657 --> 00:53:04,788
The more you order here,
the more money you save.

805
00:53:04,788 --> 00:53:06,927
It's good, right? Have some more.

806
00:53:06,927 --> 00:53:09,798
Can we do that, Director Seo?
It's really delicious.

807
00:53:12,128 --> 00:53:13,867
I'm not the director anymore.

808
00:53:14,268 --> 00:53:15,568
Why not?

809
00:53:16,168 --> 00:53:18,468
I quit today.

810
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:23,238
Did you get fired?

811
00:53:23,978 --> 00:53:25,307
Yes.

812
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:33,363
Come on.

813
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:35,418
Don't look at me
with such pitiful eyes.

814
00:53:35,418 --> 00:53:37,518
As you already know,

815
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:41,104
I studied something else
in New York, so I deserve this.

816
00:53:41,128 --> 00:53:42,628
It's okay.

817
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:44,797
Gosh, Chairman Ji is so strict.

818
00:53:44,797 --> 00:53:46,144
But still...

819
00:53:46,168 --> 00:53:48,838
So you're not coming to work
starting tomorrow?

820
00:53:49,067 --> 00:53:50,568
You seem excited.

821
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:52,284
Can you tell?

822
00:53:52,308 --> 00:53:54,568
Just get along
with Design Director Kim.

823
00:53:54,637 --> 00:53:56,777
If you don't accept
people have their own strengths,

824
00:53:56,777 --> 00:53:58,284
it'll only make things harder
for you.

825
00:53:58,308 --> 00:54:00,408
Why are you nagging me
when you already quit?

826
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:03,994
Gosh, this is so boring.
This tastes like water.

827
00:54:04,018 --> 00:54:07,264
Let's have some bomb shots
to celebrate his resignation!

828
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:09,817
- I'll mix the drinks. Give me that.
- Gosh. But...

829
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:11,117
- Okay.
- Give me the glasses.

830
00:54:11,117 --> 00:54:14,088
You've been through a lot
working with me.

831
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:16,403
- Thank you for everything.
- You did well.

832
00:54:16,427 --> 00:54:19,697
Since you had hard times,
I'll make it big.

833
00:54:19,697 --> 00:54:21,168
- All right.
- Okay.

834
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:22,538
- Nice.
- Let's drink.

835
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:24,297
- Do you want more?
- Thank you.

836
00:54:24,297 --> 00:54:26,338
- Gosh, this is too much.
- All right.

837
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:28,708
- You should pour him a glass.
- No, I can do it.

838
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,308
- Here.
- All right.

839
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,208
- Okay. Thank you.
- Let me do it.

840
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:34,247
- Have a good life.
- You should have some.

841
00:54:36,378 --> 00:54:37,847
He said it would start tomorrow.

842
00:54:37,847 --> 00:54:40,647
But why is she working here already
to make my stomach churn?

843
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:42,917
What do you mean
your stomach churns?

844
00:54:43,157 --> 00:54:44,818
You don't have to know.

845
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,058
Does that make butter?

846
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:50,327
The sweetest and tastiest butter.

847
00:54:50,728 --> 00:54:52,043
It exists.

848
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:53,798
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

849
00:54:55,768 --> 00:54:57,937
Something feels off, Bom.

850
00:55:00,038 --> 00:55:01,367
I feel it too.

851
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,758
What?

852
00:55:22,858 --> 00:55:24,597
What are you doing here?

853
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:28,267
Da Rim, it's you.

854
00:55:33,637 --> 00:55:35,307
Have a seat, Ms. Lee.

855
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:38,038
You should head home.

856
00:55:38,038 --> 00:55:39,707
Where's your car?

857
00:55:41,777 --> 00:55:44,378
Unbelievable.
I'll call you a driver.

858
00:55:44,947 --> 00:55:46,823
No, don't.

859
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,147
What...

860
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:52,988
Unbelievable.

861
00:55:56,197 --> 00:55:57,928
Why did you dodge me?

862
00:55:58,027 --> 00:55:59,197
You're pathetic.

863
00:55:59,197 --> 00:56:01,068
Do I seem pathetic to you as well?

864
00:56:01,597 --> 00:56:03,398
Now that you're out of the doghouse,

865
00:56:03,398 --> 00:56:04,668
look at you getting wasted.

866
00:56:04,668 --> 00:56:06,968
Should you be sprawled out
on the streets like this?

867
00:56:07,438 --> 00:56:08,438
Da Rim.

868
00:56:08,438 --> 00:56:10,977
Where did you park your car?

869
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:14,448
It's not here. I didn't drive.

870
00:56:15,578 --> 00:56:17,448
I'll take you home.

871
00:56:17,648 --> 00:56:19,048
No.

872
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:21,224
I don't have a home.

873
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:23,834
Whatever, then. Call a cab then.

874
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:25,487
I don't have any money.

875
00:56:25,487 --> 00:56:26,827
What?

876
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:29,727
The penalty for breach of contract
is no joke.

877
00:56:30,228 --> 00:56:31,727
I'm broke.

878
00:56:31,898 --> 00:56:33,367
What's this nonsense?

879
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:36,698
No one likes me.

880
00:56:37,297 --> 00:56:38,608
Are you a child or what?

881
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:41,914
My father doesn't return my love,

882
00:56:41,938 --> 00:56:43,937
and neither do you.

883
00:56:44,578 --> 00:56:47,278
No one is fond of me.

884
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:50,417
Cut out the pity party and get up.

885
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:52,218
I'll take you home.

886
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,823
Where?

887
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:55,458
Where else? Your house.

888
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:57,017
I'm homeless.

889
00:56:58,288 --> 00:56:59,888
I'm penniless.

890
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:02,957
I'm jobless.

891
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:05,767
What else? What else don't you have?

892
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:07,667
I have nothing.

893
00:57:07,867 --> 00:57:09,298
Are you a vagrant?

894
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:12,367
Yes.

895
00:57:12,668 --> 00:57:14,108
I'm sleepy.

896
00:57:15,677 --> 00:57:18,907
Hey, get a grip on yourself.

897
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:21,383
No, get your act together!

898
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:24,224
I'm sleepy, Da Rim.

899
00:57:24,248 --> 00:57:27,917
Your face will freeze off
at this rate.

900
00:57:27,947 --> 00:57:30,218
Get a grip on yourself.

901
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:35,528
Ms. Bae!

902
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:54,000
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

903
00:58:02,117 --> 00:58:03,588
Did you sleep well?

904
00:58:03,858 --> 00:58:05,488
This is no bed, you know.

905
00:58:06,228 --> 00:58:09,528
I apologize.
The alcohol got the best of me.

906
00:58:10,157 --> 00:58:12,028
Anyway, I slept well.

907
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:15,474
Wait.

908
00:58:15,498 --> 00:58:19,037
Ms. Bae, I'm sorry to ask,

909
00:58:19,467 --> 00:58:20,967
but can you get me
some of my underwear...

910
00:58:20,967 --> 00:58:22,778
when you go to my house?

911
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,708
I left without any.

912
00:58:24,708 --> 00:58:26,208
Fine. Eat up for now.

913
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:27,483
And don't worry.

914
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:30,278
Right. Thank you.

915
00:58:50,338 --> 00:58:52,543
Gang Ju slept at your restaurant?

916
00:58:52,567 --> 00:58:55,914
Ji Yeon, he even quit his job.

917
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:57,483
I heard you kicked him out
of the house.

918
00:58:57,507 --> 00:59:00,407
He must be extremely upset
judging by how he was misty-eyed.

919
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:01,817
He asked me to get his underwear
for him.

920
00:59:01,817 --> 00:59:04,854
You should come here.
He's having breakfast.

921
00:59:04,878 --> 00:59:06,124
Hurry.

922
00:59:06,148 --> 00:59:07,188
Got it.

923
00:59:07,188 --> 00:59:09,758
Get him his meal.
I'll be right there.

924
00:59:26,768 --> 00:59:28,068
What...

925
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,738
Could Father be here...

926
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:33,548
for me?

927
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:24,727
You weren't the one
who posted about Gang Ju.

928
01:00:34,308 --> 01:00:35,678
Gang Ju.

929
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:37,638
Why are you standing out here?

930
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:43,048
Mom...

931
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:50,588
Did your father come here...

932
01:00:50,887 --> 01:00:52,488
to see him?

933
01:00:54,257 --> 01:00:56,597
Mom, don't.

934
01:00:56,597 --> 01:00:57,958
(Washing, mending)

935
01:00:57,958 --> 01:00:59,343
Let go!

936
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:01,768
Let go. Let go of me.

937
01:01:01,768 --> 01:01:04,398
Why are we hiding
when we did nothing wrong?

938
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:07,738
They're the ones wronging us,
so why are we hiding instead?

939
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:09,408
Gang Ju.

940
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:13,077
I heard your father forced you out
of the company.

941
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:20,588
I'll shred them both into pieces.

942
01:01:20,648 --> 01:01:22,018
They'll be begging for mercy.

943
01:01:22,018 --> 01:01:23,387
- They're done for!
- No.

944
01:01:23,387 --> 01:01:26,128
Mom, please don't.

945
01:01:27,387 --> 01:01:30,273
He can't do this to you.

946
01:01:30,297 --> 01:01:33,897
I'm the one who did wrong.
You're innocent in all of this.

947
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:37,914
You love him dearly
and have been good to him.

948
01:01:37,938 --> 01:01:40,238
Not even his biological son
could be that sweet.

949
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:45,238
He shouldn't treat you this way,
Gang Ju.

950
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:47,647
Don't cry, Mom.

951
01:01:50,777 --> 01:01:54,417
I can manage without Father.

952
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:56,057
You liar.

953
01:01:58,117 --> 01:01:59,988
That's a lie.

954
01:02:05,998 --> 01:02:08,147
(We thank Cho Mee Ryung
for her special appearance.)

955
01:02:40,328 --> 01:02:42,444
(Iron Family)

956
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:44,838
He would've done something
about the money before he died.

957
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:46,437
I'm sure he left a trace.

958
01:02:46,437 --> 01:02:47,878
Mom, can I have the ledger?

959
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:49,178
Tae Woong,
do you have feelings for Cha Rim?

960
01:02:49,178 --> 01:02:50,678
I like you a lot more.

961
01:02:50,678 --> 01:02:52,154
Thanks, sister.

962
01:02:52,178 --> 01:02:53,723
I'm a woman too in every sense.

963
01:02:53,747 --> 01:02:54,878
Are you drawn to your own son?

964
01:02:54,878 --> 01:02:57,117
You took the initiative
to clear your son's name...

965
01:02:57,117 --> 01:02:59,687
but didn't even bother
to hear me out.

966
01:02:59,687 --> 01:03:01,218
Stop upsetting my son.

967
01:03:01,218 --> 01:03:03,487
I don't need you.

968
01:03:04,106 --> 01:03:05,961
