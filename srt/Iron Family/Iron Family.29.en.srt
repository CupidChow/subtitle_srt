(Episode 29)

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,440
It's my money. It's mine.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,210
The money I could start over with
following my divorce.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,150
It's my love.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,689
Don't be a drama queen
when you're nothing but a thief.

6
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:15,750
Move!

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,989
What?

8
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:23,030
Are you sure
this is where you kept it?

9
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:26,100
Are you lying to us
when it's actually stashed elsewhere?

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,339
No, this isn't happening.
This can't be!

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,310
Who sets a passcode
to match their birthday?

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,780
The security footage.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,780
We should ask
to see the security footage.

14
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,149
They'll ask what was inside.

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,310
What can we say to that?

16
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:44,719
That she stored stolen money?

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:47,990
If we get back a million dollars
from the thief,

18
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,090
it'll all be in 50-dollar bills.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,060
Wouldn't the authorities find us
just as suspicious?

20
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:57,960
I can't believe you.

21
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,069
What is this about?

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,469
Well...

23
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,969
We lost what was kept
in the storage locker.

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,709
Could we perhaps
check the security footage?

25
00:01:11,709 --> 00:01:15,049
We don't allow
personal viewing of that footage.

26
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:18,519
We have protocols
to protect the identity of others.

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,219
Contact the police first.

28
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,590
If they see fit, you can
view the footage with an officer.

29
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,019
Those pesky police!

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,359
What?

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,129
It's nothing at all.

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:32,230
Come along.

33
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,439
What do we do now?

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,609
How can we get it back?

35
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,040
Auntie. Can you think of
who would've taken it?

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,950
No, I can't.

37
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,579
I can't think of anything.

38
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,879
How could I know
who'd steal my money?

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,890
Darn it.

40
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,060
We lost even more
when we should be earning it back.

41
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,260
This is getting worse and worse.

42
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,500
How do we get it back?

43
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,760
We need to call the police
to see the CCTV footage.

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,969
There's nothing we can do.
The money's gone for good.

45
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,240
How can we get it back...

46
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,039
when there are no leads
and we can't see the CCTV footage?

47
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,539
We must call the police
if we want to see it.

(Unmanned Storage Locker)

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,879
I won't move
until I get the money back.

50
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,449
I can't go home.

51
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,120
I can't face my parents again.

52
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,620
Auntie.

53
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,449
Forget it. Leave her here.

54
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,689
Why even care?
Do you still call her family?

55
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:34,729
Girls. We must do what we can
to get the money back.

56
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,830
I had no idea
this money could send...

57
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,729
Mom, Dad, and Bong Hee to prison.

58
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,400
I swear, guys.

59
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:42,699
Yes.

60
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,099
Mu Rim's a detective.

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,009
Let's ask him to let us see
the CCTV footage.

62
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,939
Mu Rim will help.

63
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:51,810
- He will...
- Auntie, have you lost your mind?

64
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,050
Da Rim.

65
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,919
Auntie. Do you want to
get Mu Rim promoted?

66
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,620
You know what he's like.

67
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,830
This is madness.

(Unmanned Storage Locker)

69
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:20,770
Did you resign?

70
00:03:30,979 --> 00:03:32,650
Call Lee Cha Rim.

71
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:34,389
Yes, sir.

(Tae Woong)

75
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,409
What did you do that made her quit?

76
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,379
Did she resign because of you
or because of Gang Ju?

77
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,419
Why didn't you take it?

78
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,120
It was the jerk
I hated the most in the whole world.

79
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,930
He lives in fear
that all I want is his money.

80
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:19,529
The punk thinks I'm a parasite.

81
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:21,699
Who's that?

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,170
Get up! Let's make some money.

83
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:31,810
- What?
- Moping here like this...

84
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,250
won't make the thieves
return with the cash out of guilt.

85
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,509
We can't get it back
without calling the police.

86
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,949
Auntie. Stand up.

87
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:43,120
We can't report
someone stole our stolen money.

88
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,560
We're just as guilty.

89
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,759
We need to give it up.

(Bong Company)

93
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,439
What are you doing here, Ms. Lee?

94
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,509
Are you saying
someone stole a million dollars?

95
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,149
I'm sorry.
We need to make up for even more.

96
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,620
Now that Auntie knows,

97
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,560
we have one more accomplice
and even less money left.

98
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
I think Grandma noticed
Auntie was taking the cash...

99
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,699
and considered it
her share of the inheritance.

100
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,610
Hey, you two need to sit far apart.
It's a disgusting sight.

101
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,810
Oh, Cha Rim resigned.

102
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,079
The chairman said
he won't ever accept it.

103
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,379
Obviously.

104
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,819
The company would struggle
without me.

105
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,329
It was a joke.

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,000
We're in a stupid,
dismal, annoying mess.

107
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,699
Can't I crack a joke?

108
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:36,500
What if the chairman
doesn't accept your resignation?

109
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,639
If her resignation isn't processed,
we can't use her designs.

110
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,610
We'll have the same issue
we did with Mi Mi.

111
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,079
If Jiseung sues us
after the clothes are manufactured,

112
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,680
we'll be done for.

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,949
Why are you crying so sorrowfully?

114
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,220
What does that change?

115
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,620
Who could've taken it?

116
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,689
There are thieves everywhere.

117
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,459
Do you mean me?

118
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,269
Do you mean us?

119
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,670
Do you mean my family?

120
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,110
Man Deuk. When can I go home?

121
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,810
I want to go home.

122
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,779
Whether we're here or at home,
you're stuck with me all the time.

123
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,089
Why do you keep saying
you want to go home?

124
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,120
What old person
loves staying in a hospital?

125
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,990
Gil Rye. Should we call Mi Yeon
and talk to her?

126
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,759
Everyone's stressed out
because you're in hospital.

127
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,199
Let's tell her to take her share
and leave before you go home.

128
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,870
That she shouldn't come back
since the money isn't clean.

129
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,540
I didn't think
you'd quit and join us so soon.

130
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,949
Your resignation and mine
carry a different weight.

131
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,319
You have skill.

132
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,620
And you wanted to
succeed there with Tae Woong.

133
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,259
Are you asleep?

134
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,470
I really didn't want to quit.

135
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,939
But think about it.

136
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,339
It was Seo Gang Ju's money.

137
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,740
He's doing all he can
to make money to make up for...

138
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,810
what we spent
so we'll be punished less.

139
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,680
How could I not resign?

140
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,419
What on earth was Auntie thinking?

141
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,149
Hey.

142
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,990
This doesn't mean I accept
Seo Gang Ju as your boyfriend.

143
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,299
He's not manly,
sweet, or charismatic.

144
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,799
He's an unmindful simpleton
who acts stupid when drunk.

145
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,600
Do you know how giddy he gets?

146
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,269
He has zero charm.

147
00:08:56,309 --> 00:08:58,210
Da Rim. Are you asleep?

148
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,779
Honestly,

149
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:07,289
you can see now,
but you're a horrible judge of men.

150
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,750
Darn it.

151
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,460
I don't like
a single person in my family.

152
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,169
You're still up.

153
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,169
Why are you still up?

154
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:00,500
I can't sleep.

155
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,309
Now we need to sell much more
because of my aunt.

156
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,379
We must make it work somehow.

157
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,250
Cha Rim said you were manly,

158
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,779
sweet, charismatic, and mindful.

159
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:16,090
You kept your wits about you
when you were drunk,

160
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,090
and you're strong and firm.

161
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,830
She said you were never giddy
and full of charm.

162
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,299
Stay strong, Gang Ju.

163
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,600
It's obvious what she said.

164
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,070
The exact opposite of that.

165
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,139
How can you tell?

166
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:34,139
I've known Cha Rim for years.

167
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:36,409
Da Rim.

168
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,080
How much do you like me?

169
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,279
Do I need to explain?

170
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,250
Shall I sneak up to the rooftop?

171
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,750
We just said good night.

172
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,889
Who cares?

173
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,960
- Da Rim.
- Yes?

174
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,059
Is it stealing to take something
without the owner's permission?

175
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,899
Why? Do you want to steal something?

176
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,769
It's nothing.

177
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,940
I like you even though
you're from a family of thieves.

178
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,240
I feel just the same.

179
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,279
You should too.

180
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,779
Go to sleep now.

181
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,250
Goodnight.

182
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,279
Okay. Let me send you a kiss.

183
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,049
Goodnight.

184
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,789
Why did you tell him such a lie?

185
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:28,259
When did I say that?

186
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,830
You shouldn't go to the rooftop
by yourself.

187
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,100
Seo Gang Ju is just your coworker.

188
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,629
Just focus on making money.

189
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,899
I don't want you to be hurt.

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,110
Can't you see how it will end?
It's obvious.

191
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,029
With your grandfather's will.

192
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,029
He wrote that he was leaving...

193
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:08,129
ten million dollars to his daughter.

194
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,799
Lawyer Kang told me to submit it
while talking to the police.

195
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,440
(Security system activated)

196
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,370
Security system deactivated.

197
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,389
(If you keep this money in the safe
for 15 years after my death...)

198
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,299
I'm sorry, Grandpa. I'm sorry, Mom.

199
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,269
What are you doing here?

200
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,970
You're acting like you got caught
while stealing something.

201
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,470
Are you wearing the hat
because it's cold?

202
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,789
You're not supposed
to be here today.

203
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,620
Your mom is being
quite fickle these days.

204
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,019
She keeps changing her mind.

205
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,259
Ms. Bae.

206
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,730
What?

207
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,000
Please don't tell Mom
that I was here today.

208
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,100
Then...

209
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Then what?

210
00:14:58,169 --> 00:14:59,700
I will never forget your kindness.

211
00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:06,309
You're not supposed to say
you won't forget my kindness.

212
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,450
You should say
you would return my kindness.

213
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,710
I'll make sure
to return your kindness.

214
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,419
Forget it. It's no big deal.

215
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,850
Just finish what you were doing.

216
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,690
You're such a dutiful son.

217
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,889
You wouldn't do anything
to make trouble for your mom.

218
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,330
Okay.

219
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
My gosh.

220
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,149
Is there anything
we need to talk about?

221
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,090
Why aren't you giving me the money
for Shin's academy?

222
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,460
I gave up the alimony
in return for that.

223
00:15:57,429 --> 00:15:58,429
If you're going to be like this,

224
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,230
I want my alimony now.

225
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,669
- Wait.
- What?

226
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,340
Please give me some money
as alimony.

227
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,409
You can think of it as charity.

228
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,240
Just give me some money.

229
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,809
Please.

230
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:15,649
Hey, did you cause money trouble
for your family again?

231
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,549
If you don't,

232
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,350
I'll kill myself!

233
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,450
Hey! You're embarrassing me!

234
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,620
Get up.

235
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,519
I know I'm pathetic.

236
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,090
I'll come here
and do this every day.

237
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,889
I'm doing this in front
of your company building today,

238
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,159
but I'll go to your office tomorrow.

239
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,600
And to your place too.

240
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,000
This will be the least
embarrassing moment for you.

241
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:39,570
Hey, will you get off of me? Let go!

242
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,039
This is all your fault!

243
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,080
The whole thing started
because you cheated on me.

244
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,009
So please give me alimony.

245
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,750
Please.

246
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,879
Hey, stop it.
My pants are coming off!

247
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,389
Give me some money.

248
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,720
Hey, please.

249
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,990
Gang Ju stole something and left.

250
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,389
Steal what?

251
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,389
I don't know.

252
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,109
That darn brat.

253
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,480
I can't believe this.

254
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm telling you this
because I don't want you to suspect me.

255
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,650
Why? Did he actually take something?

256
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,700
(Bong Company)

257
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,200
You stole it, didn't you?

258
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Give it back to me.

259
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,109
You've moved on to stealing now?
From your mother of all people?

260
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,079
Hello, Ms. Baek.

261
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,009
- Hello, Ms. Baek.
- Hello, Ms. Baek.

262
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,720
I don't want people
to criticize you.

263
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,190
I don't want them
to point fingers at you.

264
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,990
Don't report it to the police.

265
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,759
You thief!

266
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,660
Give it back to me! I need it.

267
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,329
Give me that, you fool!

268
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:10,759
Please stop hitting him and talk.

269
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,630
Why are you being like this to me?

270
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,829
You stay out of this.

271
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,200
I don't know
what you're talking about.

272
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,269
What did I steal from you?

273
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:19,269
What?

274
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,240
You darn brat.

275
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,809
- Please.
- You're the only one who'd take it.

276
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,279
Who else would do that?
There's no one!

277
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,579
Do you want me...

278
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,549
to do nothing after losing my money
like a fool?

279
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,519
Like I said, I don't mind
what people say about me.

280
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,920
I don't mind getting criticized!

281
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,019
Gosh, my head.

282
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,390
Darn it.

283
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,460
What are they doing here,
by the way?

284
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,559
You should go home
and look for it again.

285
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,160
Seriously, I didn't take it.

286
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,500
You never told me where it was.

287
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,240
Move over. Go away.

288
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,599
Did you swallow it or something?

289
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Did you?

290
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,339
Give me that. Why can't I find it?

291
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,569
You know how much it is worth.

292
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,779
Spit it out, you brat!

293
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,779
Open up, Gang Ju. Spit it.

294
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,680
Spit it out, you darn brat!

295
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,950
What's wrong with you?

296
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:43,990
(Cheonglyeom Villa)

297
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,190
(Lawyer Kang)

298
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,759
Mr. Kang.

299
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,730
She won't report it.

300
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:59,369
We deserve to be beaten up.

301
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,609
I don't think she will give up.

302
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,509
I think she will come every day.

303
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,839
I will give her back the will later.

304
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,849
She won't be able to report it
to the police without the will.

305
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:14,849
I'm sorry.

306
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,059
Why are you quitting
Jiseung Apparel...

307
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,230
only to work for Gang Ju?

308
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:32,740
Secretary Lee also quit
to work for Gang Ju.

309
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,839
And now her sister, as in you,

310
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:38,039
resigned in order to work
for Gang Ju instead.

311
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,240
Does Gang Ju have leverage...

312
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,880
over the two sisters?

313
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:44,880
Of course not.

314
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,920
Please approve
of my resignation, sir.

315
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,890
I wish to design clothes
in my name...

316
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,990
and quickly make a fortune.

317
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,029
I've always been selfish,

318
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,430
but I'm looking out
for my family this time.

319
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,430
You want to make a fortune
working under Seo Gang Ju?

320
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,029
That's right.

321
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,069
I can't say raking in lots of money
is one of his talents.

322
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,609
How can I bank on one's talent?

323
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,779
Someone as arrogant
and egotistic as me...

324
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,579
needs a partner who will stay blind
to what's beyond the numbers.

325
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,480
Are you saying...

326
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,549
there isn't anyone like that
at this company?

327
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,059
That's right. There isn't.

328
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,170
What's with you?

329
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,980
Is this some kind of protest?

330
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,140
Why go to such lengths?

331
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,910
Why would you throw your life away
when I'm not worth it?

332
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,349
Did I hurt you that much?

333
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,890
Cha Rim, hey.

334
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,230
I'll prove to you that money...

335
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,000
is all I care about.

336
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,109
Goodness.

337
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,819
She'll be discharged soon.

338
00:22:24,819 --> 00:22:28,349
Don't you think you bought too much?
Who'll drink all that?

339
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,859
Why would you worry
when we can take it home with us?

340
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,420
Mother, have it with water kimchi.

341
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,329
Sure. Thanks.

342
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,799
By the way...

343
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,569
Mother, Father,

344
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,170
once Mother is discharged,

345
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,440
we'll close down the dry cleaner's.

346
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,109
- What?
- What?

347
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:54,410
It's been taking a toll on me...

348
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,210
ever since Tae Woong quit.

349
00:22:57,849 --> 00:22:58,950
Is that what you want?

350
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,789
We have more than enough money,
so let's do that.

351
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,349
You've worked hard over the years.

352
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,619
Right. I'll close it down, then.

353
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,359
You've practically
been running it by yourself.

354
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,730
We should've
closed it down ages ago.

355
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,029
We're sorry, Bong Hee.

356
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,140
Bong Hee, we're sorry.

357
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,740
Mother, Father,
please don't say that.

358
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,640
You've been running it
your whole lives,

359
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,009
and I felt guilty
about wanting to close it down.

360
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,980
I'm the one who's sorry.

361
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,779
Goodness.

362
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,920
- Hey.
- Grandma, Grandpa, it's me.

363
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,890
- I'll get you some water.
- Come on in.

364
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,259
- Have a seat.
- Right.

365
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,039
When will she be discharged?

366
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,380
Today...

367
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,220
The doctor hasn't
confirmed it yet though.

368
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:09,890
It won't be long.

369
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,119
Did you destroy all of the evidence?

370
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:17,289
Yes, don't worry about that.

371
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,599
I discarded the clothes we wore...

372
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:24,369
and moved the money
from under their mattress to mine.

373
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,309
Once I turn myself in,

374
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,480
talk sense into your grandparents.

375
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,849
Got it.

376
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,420
Mu Rim.

377
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,450
I...

378
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,119
How long will I be locked up
in prison?

379
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,000
If you turn yourself in,

380
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,500
you will be granted leniency.

381
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,769
It's better than being arrested.

382
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,509
You must turn yourself in.

383
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,119
Look after your grandparents for me.

384
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,130
Being incarcerated
will be viewed as a luxury...

385
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,769
since you kids will have it worse
with all that debt.

386
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,099
I feel bad for you all.

387
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,329
Is something up?

388
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,690
I'll be honest with you.

389
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:29,960
You'll be honest?

390
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,029
How terrifying.

391
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,930
I can't go to Singapore with you.

392
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,140
I'll leave my house
to my mother-in-law...

393
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:45,579
and move out with Bom
so that you and Shin...

394
00:26:47,509 --> 00:26:49,079
I'll work my butt off,

395
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,049
so let's give this a shot.

396
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:54,950
Trust me, depend on me,

397
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,819
and lean on me if you want.

398
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,589
I've lost all my money...

399
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,730
and don't have enough
to move to Singapore.

400
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,569
I've even lost my interest in you.

401
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,210
Being the gullible man you are,
you let me use you.

402
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,779
I was never serious about you.

403
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:27,720
So forget about me...

404
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,920
and don't try to get
to know me more.

405
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,720
It's embarrassing...

406
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,589
and annoying!

407
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:38,900
Mi Yeon?

408
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,920
What...

409
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,019
is...

410
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,559
this stinking situation?

411
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,559
- You.
- What...

412
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,569
I'm sorry I liked you.

413
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,099
Was it fun to toy with my feelings?

414
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,940
I'm the fool for being fond of you.

415
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,710
I'm the lunatic.

416
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,509
You.

417
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:34,880
Don't live this way.

418
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,329
(Your resignation has been approved.
Jiseung Group HR)

419
00:28:48,569 --> 00:28:49,930
My resignation has been approved.

420
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,440
- Really?
- Let me see that.

421
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,339
(Your resignation has been approved.
Jiseung Group HR)

422
00:28:55,339 --> 00:28:56,710
Let's take the sample
to the factory.

423
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,079
I'm going to look
into one of the materials.

424
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,940
- Sure.
- What about me?

425
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,250
Meet with the merchandiser
at Heung Mall in charge of our product.

426
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,480
- I'll be right there.
- Sure.

427
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,150
Are you saying I need the will...

428
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,119
to request a formal investigation?

429
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,660
That's right. Without it,

430
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,259
there's no way to prove
you had ten million dollars.

431
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,730
How did you come
to lose the will as well?

432
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,369
Are you trying to kick me
where it hurts?

433
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,240
You should come up with a solution,
not scold me.

434
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,410
What can I do?

435
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,440
Seriously.

436
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,750
This is driving me nuts!

437
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,450
There's a way,

438
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:42,220
but it'll be risky
and could cost you money.

439
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,390
What are you saying?

440
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,990
Lay it out for me.

441
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,410
When we begin the new year,
tell the police everything.

442
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,640
But only after January 1.

443
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Sorry?

444
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:11,410
Tell them how much you stole
from my house.

445
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,220
But only after January 1.

446
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:16,990
Do you mean that?

447
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,890
Will you be all right with that?

448
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,859
I thought the money
could never be reported.

449
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,759
What game is she playing?

450
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:27,400
Sure. It'll be fine after January 1.

451
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,599
You can speak the truth.

452
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:34,769
That won't benefit me at all.

453
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,640
Would you rather be broke
following a short stint in prison...

454
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,480
or come into money
after staying here a few more years?

455
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:44,680
It'll do you
more good than harm, Mr. Oh.

456
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,279
Hear the details from my lawyer,

457
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:50,490
and tell him anything you need.

458
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:55,230
I hear you.

459
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,329
I'll see you in the new year.

460
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,359
Happy New Year.

461
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,569
Right.

462
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,970
What the...

463
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:11,609
My gosh.

464
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,440
Seriously? What are you doing here?

465
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,480
My back was killing me.

466
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,109
Your back hurt?

467
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,549
You're a guest,
so sleep in the guest room.

468
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,720
We're divorced.

469
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,660
Now, get lost.
Go back to the guest room.

470
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,259
How am I a guest
when this is my house?

471
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,490
- You're the guest.
- Don't push me.

472
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,529
Don't push!

473
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,269
This is the bed I bought.

474
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,000
- Don't push.
- This is my bed.

475
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,839
You contributed nothing when we wed!

476
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,509
Darn, my tailbone.

477
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:46,410
My tailbone.

478
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,940
Just because you're now a hotshot...

479
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,109
doesn't mean I'll forget
how you used to be broke.

480
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,250
Darn it.

481
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:58,660
(Heung Mall)

482
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,819
You can't change your design
at the last second.

483
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,289
We'll promote a different company
this time around,

484
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,529
so let's reschedule.

485
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,529
Leave the sample with us.

486
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:08,059
We're sorry about this,

487
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,900
but we had
to abruptly switch designers.

488
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,000
Couldn't you at least
check our sample jacket?

489
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,769
It was made
by the most profitable designer...

490
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,339
at Jiseung.

491
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,309
As in Designer Lee Cha Rim?

492
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
That's right.

493
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:26,420
Did Ms. Lee leave Jiseung Group?

494
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,750
Yes, and that Ms. Lee
designs for us now.

495
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,819
Is that so?

496
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,220
Not just us
but other shopping platforms...

497
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,789
have been asking Ms. Lee
for a collaboration.

498
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,859
No one was able to sign her.

499
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:43,630
There's no way
Jiseung Group let her go though.

500
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,440
Of course.

501
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,710
This is crazy.

502
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,150
When will Swallow Mall
promote its puffer jacket?

503
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,680
It's a seasonal item,
so at the prime-time slot of 8 p.m.

504
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,849
This is good enough to go up against
what Swallow Mall is promoting.

505
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,220
It's not just Swallow Mall.

506
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,690
Other platforms will be promoting
their products then.

507
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,859
Give us that time slot,

508
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:10,130
and we'll put up a fight.

509
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,259
Since it's our first product,

510
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,500
we'll sacrifice
the designer's fee...

511
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,230
and upgrade the jacket...

512
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,569
so that it'll have an edge.

513
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,900
What do you say
to tripling the amount that we sell?

514
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:27,910
Triple.

515
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,380
(White Grape)

516
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,089
(Incoming call)

517
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:45,829
Is your phone blowing up
with job offers?

518
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:51,630
Word has already traveled...

519
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,039
that Lee Cha Rim left Jiseung Group.

520
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,109
Goodness.

521
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,640
It's nice and refreshing.

522
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:02,849
I've been running around all day.

523
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,950
What's Jihee Apparel?

524
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,279
Even Bill Fashion contacted you.

525
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,449
Turn off my phone.

526
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:09,989
It's not like I can accept
any of their offers.

527
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,090
How many companies...

528
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,090
will be promoting...

529
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,289
their puffer jackets
in that time slot?

530
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,690
Seven.

531
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,000
Seven? That's a lot.

532
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,829
How did it come to that?

533
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:22,630
It's the last shopping season
before the new year.

534
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,230
That's why this is
an opportunity, Da Rim.

535
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,340
People are waiting
to buy puffer jackets...

536
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340

718
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
I know...

719
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:58,469
you'd be too embarrassed
to be seen with someone like me.

720
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,579
What does that mean?

721
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,179
Goodness.

722
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:05,849
You ask too many questions today.

723
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:07,250
You're weird today.

724
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:10,750
Darn it. I finally confessed
how I felt after 30 years...

725
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,019
and it doesn't feel great at all.

726
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,989
I should've said it then
if I'd known I'd feel nothing.

727
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:20,000
My life must've gotten messed up
because I didn't tell you then.

728
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,239
If I'd told you how I'd felt then,
would my life have been different?

729
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,179
Are you unwell?

730
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,210
It's menopause.

731
00:44:38,179 --> 00:44:39,210
How much do I owe you?

732
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:42,420
Here.

733
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,420
Thanks for helping me
with the delivery.

734
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:48,619
Live happily and well.

735
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:50,760
As you do right now.

736
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,329
Oh, and Tae Woong.

737
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,469
Take good care of him.

738
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,199
Is she leaving like that?

739
00:45:01,369 --> 00:45:02,769
She's leaving, isn't she?

740
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:04,809
Bong Hee!

741
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:07,940
Hey.

742
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,780
We go live in five seconds.
Five, four, three, two, one,

743
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,480
cue.

744
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,019
- Hello.
- Hello.

745
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:19,289
Do you know why that happens?

746
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:21,159
It's because the padding...

747
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:24,429
- is so very even and light...
- Do you see how pretty it is?

748
00:45:24,429 --> 00:45:25,730
A down jacket like this...

749
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,460
Don't you want one like this?

750
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,400
This is the time to get one.

751
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,130
If you were thinking of
getting a down jacket,

752
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,800
now is the time to buy one.

753
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,510
This is the first release
of Seogang Apparel's jacket.

754
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,940
The company name
might sound unfamiliar,

755
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,349
but you'll recognize
the people behind the brand.

756
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,110
The person who manufactured this...

757
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,849
used to be an executive
at a famous fashion conglomerate,

758
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:50,619
and the designer
used to be a design director there.

759
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,090
What does that mean?
These were well-made.

760
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,659
In other words they're fantastic.

761
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:55,920
Let me show you.

762
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:01,159
(First Exclusive Release,
Seogang Apparel's premium jacket)

763
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,800
It's the first sale,

764
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,539
- so we planned...
- Is something wrong?

765
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,309
Swallow Mall was to go live
at the same time,

766
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:12,309
but they started early.

767
00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:14,480
To keep us in check,

768
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,210
they started 30 minutes early
and they're selling well.

769
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,110
Isn't that really bad for us?

770
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,750
No one buys
two down jackets in a season...

771
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,219
because they're expensive.

772
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,090
They'll cancel their orders
and buy ours.

773
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,559
Don't worry.

774
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,960
You can move so freely in these.

775
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:31,130
They're warm but the fit's slim too.

776
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,360
We know this is a great deal,
so come and shop with us.

777
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,429
"Are you sure this is
Seogang Apparel's first show?"

778
00:46:36,599 --> 00:46:38,469
They used great materials...

779
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:40,969
and it's nice to know
the customers appreciate it already.

780
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:43,739
The item you see here
is a goose down jacket...

781
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,840
and it's nicely filled.

782
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,679
Swallow Mall's selling
similar items...

783
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,179
from HS Fashion at the same time.

784
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,710
Hang on.

785
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,179
(Swallow Mall)

786
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:58,050
People. Heung Mall's
selling down jackets too,

787
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,119
and theirs are pretty.

788
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,059
I'm going to cancel this order
and buy theirs. See you.

789
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:03,429
(Swallow Mall)

790
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,860
There's no need to keep watching.

791
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,070
Orders are flooding in.

792
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,070
What is happening?

793
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,869
We have
an extra 30,000 viewers right now.

794
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,710
You're making
thorough comparisons, aren't you?

795
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,480
Will you buy ours?

796
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,610
Just a moment, everyone.

797
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:25,909
Why are the orders skyrocketing
when it's soon time to go offline?

798
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:27,750
If we keep selling at this rate,

799
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,989
we might have to schedule
a follow-up show right away.

800
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,960
Are you seeing this, Mr. CEO?

801
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,460
We're getting so many questions,

802
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:39,190
our consultants are glued
to the phones answering them.

803
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:41,630
Isn't this too great a response?

804
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:46,099
Our live show
ends in about ten minutes.

805
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,670
Oh, dear.

806
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,969
We're about to sell out
every item we stocked up on.

807
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,480
Director. How many do we have left?

808
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,980
Oh, my goodness.

809
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,480
We sold out.

810
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:02,519
My gosh. This is incredible, sir.

811
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:05,389
You want another live show?
Thank you so much.

812
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:07,989
We haven't even ended
our first live show yet.

813
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,929
It looks like we have no choice
but to schedule another show.

814
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,159
Thank you, everyone. Thanks a lot.

815
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,300
It's not good enough.

816
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:21,300
Mr. Seo. Can I have a word?

817
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,210
Sure.

818
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,070
(Meeting Room, Heung Mall)

819
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,309
Congratulations.

820
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,440
You sold out
on your first live show.

821
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,349
Seven home shopping channels
went live at the same time,

822
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:33,780
and it caused a huge stir.

823
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,349
An unprecedented number
of viewers came online.

824
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,190
The competition was stiff,
but your jacket got the most orders,

825
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,420
and it was a hit.

826
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:43,389
So what's your point?

827
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:46,090
Let's schedule a second show.

828
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,960
Let's sell as many as possible
before December's over.

829
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:51,730
What are the conditions?

830
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,269
We signed a contract for one show,
so we should sign a new deal.

831
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:57,869
We're getting calls
from other channels, you see.

832
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:00,710
Do you have any demands?

833
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,579
Can you send us the money
as soon as the sales are made?

834
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,550
You want to be paid
even sooner than right now?

835
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:10,590
Then you will have to pay
a higher fee.

836
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:14,119
Forget it. We can do it
with someone else.

837
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,159
I just got a call from Swallow Mall.

838
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,059
They said they would
wire the money right away.

839
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,260
Let's do it with Swallow Mall.

840
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,900
You know, due to our circumstances,

841
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,230
we should work with Swallow Mall.

842
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:27,000
All right. I understand.

843
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,070
Okay.

844
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:32,110
We will send you the money
right after the sales then.

845
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,380
And we will keep the commission
as low as possible. Okay?

846
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,380
Happy now?

847
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,380
Please do it with us.

848
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,960
Please schedule the next show then.

849
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:48,420
Thank you.

850
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,360
(Heung Mall)

851
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,230
Is it the CEO of the sewing factory?

852
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:58,730
Sir, can we have the goods
delivered on time?

853
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,670
We will do a live show
with Heung Mall on the 30th.

854
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:03,670
And we should also sell them online.

855
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,739
So you should start right away...

856
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,639
in order to have them
delivered on time.

857
00:50:06,639 --> 00:50:08,179
Okay. Thank you.

858
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,519
How much did we sell today?

859
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,150
Today?

860
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,460
It's over two million dollars.

861
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,059
At this rate, we will probably
sell all our products.

862
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:32,230
Actually, we should sell more
because of Auntie.

863
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:37,440
I don't think we can make up
for the money that Auntie lost.

864
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,880
With the fabric and materials
we have, we can't produce more.

865
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:45,550
Mom can't report it to the police
without the will,

866
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:46,750
so we have some more time.

867
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,920
We should hurry and get
more fabric and materials.

868
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:56,219
I feel as if my heart will
stop beating because of Auntie.

869
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,420
Hey, keep it down.

870
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,929
Where's the money?

871
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,039
What money?

872
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,340
We know.

873
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,309
So just tell us where the money is.

874
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,510
Why are you being like this to me?

875
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,849
Let's go and find the money.

876
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,559
- Darn it! How dare you...
- Come here.

877
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,530
(Unmanned Storage Locker)

878
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,059
Open it.

879
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,969
You've been throwing money away.

880
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:12,670
We know it isn't your money.

881
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:13,969
So open it.

882
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,539
Here...

883
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,840
I mean,
there's nothing in the locker.

884
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:21,340
Are you kidding me?

885
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,550
Just keep your mouth shut
and press the number.

886
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,130
- Hurry.
- Will you make it quick?

887
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,230
(Confirm)

888
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,670
Let me see.

889
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,110
Thief! Stop thief!

890
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,239
Help me! They are thieves!

891
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,150
Hey, you're the thief! We didn't...

892
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:59,110
Seriously... You!

893
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,420
Are you all right?

894
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,679
- Yes.
- Are you okay?

895
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,019
- I'm fine. You can go now.
- Are you not hurt?

896
00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:05,420
No. I'm fine.

897
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:20,000
(Mom)

898
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,469
Mom.

899
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,039
Make sure you're alone
on your way here.

900
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,019
What's with your face?

901
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:42,019
What?

902
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,860
- It's nothing.
- What?

903
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,179
All right. This is...

904
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,050
Put them on here.

905
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:12,920
Oh, dear. Gosh.

906
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:15,820
Take these and leave.

907
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:17,389
What?

908
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,300
What are these boxes?

909
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,099
(Taurine)

910
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,769
We should enter the passcode.

911
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,800
That brat is dumb,
so it must be something simple.

912
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,239
First...

913
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,210
(Enter your PIN.)

914
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,440
It can't be her birthday.

915
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,449
(Confirm)

916
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,179
See? I knew it.

917
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:42,920
This is driving me crazy.

918
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:59,030
- Oh, right. Honey.
- What?

919
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,539
You should go to the pharmacy
in the hospital...

920
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:03,409
and buy a few boxes...

921
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:05,110
of vitamin drinks.

922
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,440
If we keep the money in the boxes,
no one will find it suspicious.

923
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,179
My goodness.

924
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:12,349
You're so clever, Gil Rye.

925
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,030
Take the money...

926
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,869
and leave
before your mom is discharged.

927
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,469
Mom.

928
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:39,769
How could you even sleep
with the money at a place like that?

929
00:55:40,539 --> 00:55:43,380
There are a lot of people
around the locker.

930
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:46,820
What if someone saw you
with the money?

931
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,980
You knew the whole thing, Mom?

932
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,820
Dad.

933
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:58,059
Did you know that I was a thief?

934
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,659
Why did you not say anything?

935
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,969
We were going to give you
the money anyway.

936
00:56:05,369 --> 00:56:07,369
It's just that you took it
before we gave you.

937
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:08,639
That doesn't matter.

938
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,309
The money doesn't belong to anyone.

939
00:56:11,309 --> 00:56:12,840
So you should take it and leave.

940
00:56:12,909 --> 00:56:14,610
Live in peace with Shin.

941
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,750
Make sure not to cause
any trouble this time.

942
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,619
Don't tell anyone
that you have the money.

943
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:24,449
How could the money
not belong to anyone?

944
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:27,159
The owner of the money is dead.

945
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:28,860
So don't worry about it.

946
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:33,329
If things go wrong,
by a chance in a million,

947
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:35,230
you will have to return the money.

948
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,369
So you should go on your way
without looking back.

949
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:39,769
Okay?

950
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,969
I don't...

951
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,239
deserve parents like you.

952
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:49,210
Okay. We get it.
So just stop talking and leave.

953
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,550
We just want you to live happily.
That's all we want from you.

954
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,750
Are you serious?

955
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,280
Aren't you going to hate me?

956
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:00,190
Won't you blame me
even if I leave with this money?

957
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:02,960
- Of course not.
- Of course not.

(Sein General Hospital)

959
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,380
- It's all right. Just go.
- Go on ahead.

960
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,909
- Hurry.
- Go.

961
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:01,449
(Dry cleaning, mending)

962
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,889
I'll go somewhere new...

963
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:07,320
on my own and enjoy my freedom.

964
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,760
Somewhere I can eat,
sleep, eat, and sleep.

965
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,300
I'll enjoy my own time...

966
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,559
without having to care...

967
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,230
for my in-laws or my kids

(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

969
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,920
(Washing, mending, dry cleaning)

970
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:45,889
Hey.

971
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,900
Still,

972
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,670
you wouldn't want to be alone.

973
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,769
Do you want to come with me?

974
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:03,039
Will you come with me then?

975
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,619
Why do you keep asking
when you're not coming with me?

976
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:16,460
Mind your own business.
Your life is yours to live...

977
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:19,889
and my life is mine to navigate.

978
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,570
Thank you for lending me...

979
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:31,070
tuition money.

980
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,380
If it hadn't been for you,

981
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,380
my graduation
would've been pushed back.

982
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:39,480
Then, I may not have been
this successful with my business.

983
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,119
I admit...

984
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:47,559
that I owe you my successful career.

985
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,730
The words of gratitude
are long overdue.

986
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:54,059
I also travel alone...

987
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,829
for vacations.

988
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,099
For the first time and last,

989
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,010
I'll offer to be your guide.

990
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,280
Just know...

991
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:09,409
we'll be booking...

992
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:12,510
separate rooms.

993
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,550
I may not seem like it,
but I'm a chairman of a company.

994
01:00:15,849 --> 01:00:17,550
Odd rumors...

995
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:19,289
wouldn't benefit me.

996
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,119
Right. Let's do this.

997
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,260
Let's go.

998
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Come on.

999
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,630
Where to?
Where would you like to go?

1000
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,440
Where is this place you're going?

1001
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:37,610
You have to tell me in advance
so that I can clear my schedule.

1002
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:39,309
My gosh.

1003
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
Hey.

1004
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,929
Don't you want me to come with you?

1005
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:01,599
Why are you crying?

1006
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,840
Has life been...

1007
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,469
that rough?

1008
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,880
Goodness me. You're ridiculous.

1009
01:01:15,579 --> 01:01:18,880
Is it upsetting
to close the dry cleaner's for good?

1010
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:25,090
My gosh.

1011
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,820
Why did you have to come back?

1012
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,230
You...

1013
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:36,429
You always seem to blame me.

1014
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,469
Thanks.

1015
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:43,699
I appreciate this
even if you didn't mean it.

1016
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,139
Thank you, my friend.

1017
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,349
I meant what I said.

1018
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,090
I can go by myself.

1019
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:03,190
This time around,
it'll be easier that way.

1020
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,230
It's true.

1021
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:14,800
Then,

1022
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:17,610
will you go by yourself this time?

1023
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:21,639
When I get back,

1024
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,650
don't be a stranger.

1025
01:02:30,989 --> 01:02:32,789
Why would I do that?

1026
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:45,530
Here.

1027
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,639
- Can I blow my nose?
- Of course.

1029
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:47,760
It's over now.

1030
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,070
Both our moms can sleep with ease.

1031
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:52,429
Thanks.

1032
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,699
I'm glad we were able
to give all her money back.

1033
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,340
I'll drop your grandma off
at home...

1034
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,070
and turn myself in
at the police station.
