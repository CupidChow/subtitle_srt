Can't you do that as her mom?

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,859
Then why did you steal my money
in the first place?

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,870
I'm so sorry, Ms. Baek.

00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,440

in the same neighborhood.

Let's go, Mom. Come on.

24
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,620
You should go home.

25
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,019
I'll drive you. Come on.

to leave the neighborhood?

You got your money back.
I gave you the money!

more about her mom, not me?

I'm being criticized by everyone?

Is it fine
as long as I have the money?

that's how you're feeling.

for the ten million dollars,

Well... I'm putting the apartment
and the store on the market.

185
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,289
Both?

186
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,659
Yes.

187
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,320
Out of the blue?

188
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,889
Does Tae Woong know?

189
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,000
See you.

190
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Bong Hee.

191
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,169
Where to?

192
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,600
Far away from Cheonglyeom-dong.

193
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,669
Mom will find a short-term rental
we can move into right away.

194
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,940
I should return the deposit
with some extra money...

195
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,980
for the apartment and store
right now.

196
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:26,940
Tae Woong.

197
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:29,809
You live with Ms. Baek.
Can you keep an eye on her?

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,149
See if she reports us or not.

199
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,950
Why won't you answer?

200
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,059
I want to move out of that house.

201
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,690
Gang Ju's back.

202
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,090
I should vacate his room.

203
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,860
Should I just live with you?

204
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,429
In my studio apartment?

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,039
Can't I?

206
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,309
What a cheap beginning.

207
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,039
You don't like the idea?

208
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
As if I don't.

209
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,710
Lots of couples get disappointed
after they move in together.

210
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,049
I'll dump you
if I don't like your lifestyle.

211
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,250
You do that.

212
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,960
Da Rim handed in her resignation.

213
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,059
What do I do?

214
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,629
Do I approve it?

215
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,700
Send her to another team...

216
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,899
so she can work.

217
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,940
She's too inexperienced
to find another job.

218
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,169
Let her stay and work.

219
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,970
Approve her resignation.

220
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,809
(Online approval)

221
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,850
(Approved by Design Manager)

222
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:46,990
Should I really approve it?

223
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,529
Approve it.

224
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,830
Did you two break up?

(Online approval)

227
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,139
You won't approve it?

228
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,809
She was so pleased
to become a regular employee.

229
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,649
(Approved: Lee Cha Rim,
Approved: Cha Tae Woong)

230
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:07,870
Did Da Rim come back
after quitting her job?

231
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,279
She brought her stuff back.

232
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,049
You should eat
even if you don't feel like it.

233
00:16:17,049 --> 00:16:18,149
Why didn't you?

234
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,419
Shall I reheat your soup?

235
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,190
It doesn't taste good.

236
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,860
I can't taste anything.

237
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,990
Don't act like children.

238
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,690
What's the point of eating?

239
00:16:31,299 --> 00:16:32,299
Grandma.

240
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,929
I can't chew or swallow.

241
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,600
You're not dying.

242
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:39,600
You have years to go
until you turn 100.

243
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:42,340
Here. Eat.

244
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,779
Empty your bowls.

245
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,649
I'm too weak to hold a spoon.

246
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,820
Gil Rye. If you don't have
the energy to hold a spoon,

247
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,220
then dying is the only thing
you can do.

248
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,659
Don't even say that.

249
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,289
I need you two to stay strong.

250
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,330
Don't be like this.

251
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,960
Here.

252
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,269
Open wide.

253
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,740
Everything tastes bitter.

254
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,869
Eat anyway.

255
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,910
Come on.

256
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,210
Yes.

257
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,950
You too, Grandpa.

258
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,519
Open your mouth wide.

259
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,650
It's like chewing sand.

260
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,589
I really will feed you sand
if you keep complaining.

261
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,390
You must eat to live.

262
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:34,019
My arms are aching now.

263
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,730
Eat even if you don't feel like it.

264
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:43,069
Chew slowly and carefully.
I won't allow leftovers.

265
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,140
Chew thoroughly and slowly.

266
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,269
Take your time.

267
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,750
After this,
take a walk around the block.

268
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,619
I'll pack your things.

269
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,950
Why should we
walk around the block...

270
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,660
we'll move away from?

(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

272
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,769
Hae Ja.

273
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,609
They put their apartment
and store on the market.

274
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,539
Are they going through something?

275
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,109
Yes.

276
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:28,809
Like what?

277
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,480
Do you know something?

278
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,519
They don't deserve to live here.

279
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,359
What does that mean?

280
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,259
When are they leaving?

281
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,730
They'll leave
before they even find new tenants.

282
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,269
It's so odd.

283
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:51,000
They're acting as if
they're fleeing from creditors...

284
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,240
who are chasing them.

285
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,569
But I know
they're not that kind of people.

286
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:57,670
Right?

287
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:01,150
You never know what people are like.

288
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,319
Mother.

289

My goodness.

290

I'm not a gossip.

291
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:23,900
Until the family leaves,

292
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,839
and even after they leave,
you can't tell anyone.

293
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:30,569
Mother.

294

295
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,230
I will soon.

296
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,869
Where's Tae Woong?

297
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,700
He went to a factory
and will go home from there.

298
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,799
Shall we go home together?

299
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:01,200
No.

No.

Shall we have a drink?

303

No.

You've really changed.

305

Whenever I suggested something,

306
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:18,059
you'd jump up and say yes
even before I finished talking.

307
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,089
You never knew how to say "no."

308
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,160
Have you fallen out of love?

309
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Yes.

My word.

about it?

321
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,119
You said you'd break up.

322

You said you had to break up.

323

Her family will leave
the neighborhood soon.

and grandparents to prison...

330
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,279
and still date her?

was approved, right?

344
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,819

00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,119
Okay. Wait up, Mom.

Still.

As if that'll change anything.

353
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:56,549

00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,349
Why won't you approve
of my resignation?

371
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:45,519
- Your resignation?
- Yes.

372
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,720
Is that what you came here for?

373
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,059
Yes.

374
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,029
You're my subordinate...

375
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,700
who resigned without notice,
but you're brazen about it.

376
00:26:00,099 --> 00:26:02,230
I'm only letting it slide
since you've been doing a good job.

377
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,269
Have a drink.

378
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,960
Is it sweet?

379
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,559
- Sorry?
- Is it bitter?

380
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,890
I don't know.

381
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:32,299
Isn't it salty?

382
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,529
I served you my tears.

383
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,410
What a joke.

384
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,240
Was that funny?

385
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,619
Is breaking up...

386
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,730
the only option we have?

387
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,630
Is that really the only way?

388
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,160
Could there be another option...

389
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,200
but we're choosing
to break up instead?

390
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,940
Shouldn't we think harder?

391
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,769
Maybe we shouldn't give up.

392
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,009
This is the only way.

393
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,539
Why ask when knowing the answer?

394
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,079
Da Rim.

395
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,619
We should move on,

396
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,819
so stop texting me.

397
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,559
Let's not see each other again.
Don't acknowledge me anymore.

398
00:27:37,529 --> 00:27:39,329
Being hung up on each other
won't do us any good.

399
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,140
- Da Rim.
- Don't say my name.

400
00:27:47,369 --> 00:27:48,769
Approve of my resignation.

401
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,390
(Online approval)

402
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:07,460
(Approved: Lee Cha Rim,
Approved: Cha Tae Woong)

403
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,700
(Approved)

404
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,039
(Online approval,
Approved: Seo Gang Ju)

405
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:36,920
You should leave first.

406
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:38,990
You leave first.

407
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,630
- Da Rim.
- You idiot.

408
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,900
I told you not to say my name.

409
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,200
All right.

410
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:54,869
Ms. Lee.

411
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:56,539
Junior Staffer Lee.

412
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,839
Seo Gang Ju.

413
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:00,109
Yes, Da Rim.

414
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,349
Stop saying my name.

415
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,490
Crosswalk.

416
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,730
The Big Dipper.

417
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,289
Gil Rye.

418
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,619
Yes?

419
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,289
What good would it do
to live longer like this?

420
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:53,160
Only Bong Hee
is being called a thief...

421
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,730
and being banished
from the neighborhood.

422
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,569
Da Rim has to end her relationship
with Gang Ju...

423
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,039
when she loves him.

424
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,369
Because of us,

425
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,140
Mu Rim will live his life
worried about being fired.

426
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,980
That means he'll end up...

427
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,809
losing Soo Ji too.

428
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,490
His chief will give him the boot.

429
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:22,230
We haven't done anything
for the children...

430
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,589
rather than be a burden.

431
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,559
The last thing I wanted...

432
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,230
was to grow old like this, Man Deuk.

433
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,869
Same here, Gil Rye.

434
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,470
Does going to the afterlife
still scare you?

435
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,210
What?

436
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,809
The time will eventually come,

437
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:46,049
but don't you want to do something
for the kids before we leave?

438
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,619
What?

439
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,319
Will we only be a burden to Bong Hee
until the day we die?

440
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,789
- What?
- We can't let...

441
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,700
our grandchildren break up...

442
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:03,200
with the people they love
because of us.

443
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,099
Da Rim and also Mu Rim.

444
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,170
As if we have any power.

445
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,640
What could we do for them?

446
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,910
There's nothing we can do.

447
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:15,910
Of course, there's something.

448
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:17,509
What?

449
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,390
- Get me a pen and a piece of paper.
- What?

450
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,589
What for, Gil Rye?

451
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,400
We'll confess to Ms. Baek...

452
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:36,700
that we're the ones
who stole her money...

453
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,269
and ask for her forgiveness.

454
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
We should take full responsibility
for everything.

455
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,210
There's nothing
for us to be afraid of.

456
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,740
Gil Rye...

457
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,750
If we die,

458
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:52,579
Ms. Baek won't report the theft.

459
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,589
If we die,

460
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,450
will she take pity on us...

461
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,559
and choose not to report us?

462
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,490
Will she forgive us?

463
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,630
Just bring me a pen and some paper.

464
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Okay.

465
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:09,500
This is the only way.

466
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,150
(Police)

467
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,849
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

468
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:30,849
Chief.

469
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,319
We should find a new dry cleaner's
for our uniforms.

470
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,430
- Why?
- It turns out...

471
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,130
Sergeant Lee Mu Rim's family
is closing down the store.

472
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,700
They will move.
They're leaving Cheonglyeom-dong.

473
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,970
What?

474
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:45,700
That's strange.

475
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,339
They wouldn't leave
the neighborhood so easily.

476
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,039
Oh, right. A few days ago,

477
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,740
we watched some CCTV footage
at the subway station.

478
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,740
Didn't Lieutenant Song Soo Ji
tell you about it?

479
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:57,779
CCTV footage? What is it about?

480
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,799
What is this?

481
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:20,099
I think Sergeant Lee's aunt
is hiding money.

482
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:35,450
Retrieve the videos on the SD card.

483
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,150
Whose is this?

484
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,559
It's from
Sergeant Lee Mu Rim's dashcam.

485
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,630
Keep it to yourself.

486
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,230
Why are you being like this
to your son-in-law?

487
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,660
Mu Rim deleted only the videos...

488
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,630
of him and his mom
talking in the car.

489
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,470
People will talk if we have
our department take care of it,

490
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:53,700
so make sure
to find an outside agency.

491
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,670
Find a good one
who can get things done quickly.

492
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,710
Okay?

493
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:00,779
Chief.

494
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,309
Do you want Lieutenant Song
and Sergeant Lee to split up?

495
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:09,650
Hey. It will be fine
if there's nothing bad.

496
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,159
I also hope there will be nothing.

497
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,650
Where would you like to go?

498
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:42,889
Yes?

499
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,349
Well...

500
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,889
We'd like to go to a bridge
over the Han River.

501
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,860
Where would you like to go
after crossing the river?

502
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,300
Well...

503
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,570
Sir.

504
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,239
We will get off
in the middle of the bridge.

505
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,510
In the middle of the bridge?

506
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,280
Okay.

507
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,130
Thanks.

510
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:49,719
I'm Lee Man Deuk,

511
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,789
the father-in-law of Ko Bong Hee,

512
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:54,460
who runs Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning.

513
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,059
I'm An Gil Rye, her mother-in-law.

514
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,900
Ms. Baek, we are so sorry.

515
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,670
We've committed a grave sin.

516
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,539
Actually, we were the ones
who stole the money.

517
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:08,639
It was our doing.

518
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:12,579
We are the ones to blame.

519
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,380
Bong Hee just came with us...

520
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,010
because we weren't strong enough
to carry the money.

521
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:20,179
But she didn't want to go.

522
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:22,050
It was us who did the whole thing.

523
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:31,860
We were blinded by money
and told her to go with us.

524
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,329
The only thing Bong Hee did wrong
was not disobeying her in-laws.

525
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,469
Please don't hate
our daughter-in-law.

526
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:40,469
Bong Hee.

527
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,860
I'm sorry...

528
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,130
that Da Rim regained her sight
and fell in love with your son.

529
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,030
How could one not fall in love
with a man like Gang Ju?

530
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,309
Thanks to your son
whom you raised well,

531
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:21,579
our family could get some money
and feel happy...

532
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,380
though it was for a short while.

533
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,219
The children didn't do
anything wrong.

534
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,059
Since we have nothing...

535
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:38,789
but our own lives
with little time left,

536
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:42,269
we'd like to be punished
by taking our own lives, Ms. Baek.

537
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,670
Can the two of us...

538
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,500
take all the blame and leave?

539
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,909
We will take the blame...

540
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:58,510
for everything our daughter-in-law
and grandchildren did and leave.

541
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:03,019
Please forgive us
with a generous heart.

542
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,389

of Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning,

What if something happens
to Mother and Father?

551
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,699
My gosh.

552
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,840

Where do you think...

555
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,409
Mother and Father went
in this cold weather?

556
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:05,110
Where did they go
to take their own lives?

557
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,150
What should I do?

558
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,849
What do I do?

559
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,150
Mother.

560
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,690

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,489
Where should I go to find them?

563
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000

Aren't you getting off?

Are you out of your minds?

00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,449
What were you thinking?

580
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:22,789
Do you want us all to just die?

581
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,119
How could you do this to me?

582
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:30,090

How could you
even entertain this thought?

588
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,679
Didn't you think about Bong Hee?

589

We thought we'd just drag you
and the kids down.

592
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,289
Why do you think you're a burden?

593
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,530
You don't have to do anything
to be a parent.

594
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,769
Even if you do nothing
but sit next to me,

595
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:14,070
you're moral support, not a burden.

596
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,340
What more could you do?

597
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,710
Why are you always apologizing?

598
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,139
Old people are still parents.

599
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,849
If you were to die like this,

600
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,219
I'd never survive.

601
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,550
Just being there with me,

602

I'm not.

After my husband died,

619
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,079
I've been pretending
to be strong and brave.

620
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,119
Don't you tell me
to be strong and brave too.

621
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,119
I pretended because I was a mom.

622
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,760
I'm not brave at all.

Leave.

627
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,460
Da Rim's grandparents
wrote a letter...

628
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,760
and left it in our mailbox.

631
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,900

632

- Bring these and follow me.
- Okay.

Will you open an account
at Myungmoon Savings Bank?

648

Yes. A bank beats any safe.

649

00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,389
She'll take the money
to the bank tomorrow.

656

She'll go from the police station
to the bank.

en route as we planned.

- Yes.

mapped out the route,

660
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:57,340
and rehearsed as well.

661
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,539
The stowaway brokers
have our fake passports too.

662
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,340
We just have to wait at the dock...

663
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:03,909

under their mattress?

676

677

- also dig up that money?
- What is this about?

and said his mother was innocent?

- That punk.
- Shall I call him?

- What is it?
- Can I at least...

713

say goodbye
to Da Rim's grandparents?

Of course not.

you can find our new place
on the day of your memorial service?

Seo Gang Ju hasn't contacted you
after the breakup, has he?

722
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,949
I told him we were moving today.

723
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:04,150
He's nowhere to be seen.

724
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,489

to get over you.

725

00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,360
Stop talking about Gang Ju.

728
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:19,400
Sure.

729
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:35,849

- Are you all right? Step aside.
- No.

733
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,130
Only grab the big shards.
You'll cut yourself.

734
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,159
Sure.

735
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,329
Mu Rim.

736
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,469
Are you sure...

737
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,869
you're able to continue working
as a police officer?

738
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,840
Are you pretending
that everything's fine...

739
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:04,880
just to ease our minds?

740
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,050
Mom, I'm asking you.

741
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,320
Don't feel guilty about this.

742
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,559
This was my choice.

743
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:19,030
I believe
it's right to protect my family,

744
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:20,960
and I don't regret it.

745
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:22,099
You...

746
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:25,670
Are you and Soo Ji all right?

747
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,599
I'll handle it.

748
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,610
What will you handle?

749
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,739
You probably know this,

750
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:36,650
but Soo Ji and I
were never going to work out.

751
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,750
I tried to be greedy for once,

752
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:40,880
but I've been struggling.

753
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,019
Mu Rim...

754
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,719
I'm truly all right.

755
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,099
(Police)

756
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:11,610
It's Unit 202.

757
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,579
Make the arrest
as quiet as possible.

758
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:14,679
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

759
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:15,719
Go.

760
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:37,769
Ms. Yun.

761
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,880
Sergeant Lee, where are you headed?

762
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:42,840
Are you fleeing?

763
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:46,010
Are you running away, Ms. Ko?

764
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:48,980
Why would we run away?

765
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,090
We're only moving.

766
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,460
It's not like we committed a crime.

767
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,590
- Mom!
- Mom!

768
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,329
- Goodness, Bong Hee.
- Bong Hee!

769
00:55:59,329 --> 00:56:00,500
- Bong Hee!
- Oh, no.

770
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,730
Ms. Ko Bong Hee.

771
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:03,730
You're under arrest...

772
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,869
for grand larceny
regarding Ms. Baek's ten million dollars.

773
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:08,300
You have the right to an attorney...

774
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,409
and the right to remain silent.

775
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,309
You may challenge the arrest...

776
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,610
and file for damages.

777
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,179
- Mr. Lee Man Deuk.
- Yes?

778
00:56:19,179 --> 00:56:21,449
You're under arrest
for grand larceny.

779
00:56:21,449 --> 00:56:22,750
- Grandpa!
- You're under arrest.

780
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,989
- Father!
- But...

781
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:25,489
- Ms. An Gil Rye.
- No!

782
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,360
You're under arrest
for grand larceny.

783
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,690
- Mother.
- You're under arrest.

784
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,860
Grandma, Grandpa!

785
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,530
- Father.
- What do we do, Mom?

786
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,300
Chief, what proof do you have
for this arrest?

787
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:37,969
You punk.

788
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,469
You're not even police.

789
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,909
No...

790
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:51,409
Mu Rim!

791
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:53,010
Mu Rim.

792
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,579
- Mu Rim...
- Mu Rim.

793
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,449
- Mu Rim!
- You can't.

794
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,519
Sergeant Lee Mu Rim,

795
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,289
you are under arrest on charges...

796
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,730
of dereliction of duty,
which includes...

797
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,559
impeding an investigation
and evidence tampering.

798
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,530
Mu Rim, no!

799
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:13,739
My gosh.

800
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:16,170
Lee Da Rim, Lee Cha Rim,
and Lee Mi Yeon.

801
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,570
The three of you
are being charged...

802
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,670
with the acquisition and possession
of stolen property.

803
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,610
We request
your voluntary cooperation.

804
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,710
We're off to the police station.

805
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:27,420
You only have to arrest us.

806
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,780
Please don't take them, Ms. Yun.
Ms. Yun, please!

807
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,090
- Ms. Yun!
- The others did nothing wrong,

808
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,219
- Ms. Yun.
- Goodness.

809
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:35,519
Just arrest us two.

810
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:38,030
- Grandma, Grandpa!
- No!

811
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,090
- Grandma!
- Mom...

812
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,429
- Mom!
- No!

813
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:44,170
Mom...

814
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,599
- Mu Rim isn't...
- Go on.

815
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,340
- Mu Rim did nothing wrong.
- Go.

816
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,940
- Mu Rim did nothing wrong.
- Come on.

817
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,510
What am I hearing?

818
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:58,380
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

819
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:01,949
They wouldn't commit crimes.

820
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,889
What on earth is going on?

821
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:06,389
I knew there had to be a reason
for them to move out suddenly.

822
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,420
I thought that if they moved away,
that'd be the end of it.

823
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,159
What's going on, Gi Dung?

824
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,130
Move.

825
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,530
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

826
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:16,530
Mr. Lee.

827
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,670
Bom, let's go inside.

828
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:21,570
No. Mr. Lee and Ms. An
are being taken away.

829
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,670
- Mr. Lee!
- Get in. You shouldn't see this.

830
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,530
Hold on.

831
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,769
What...

832
00:58:51,469 --> 00:58:53,300
Did you put them in handcuffs...

833
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,570
when they don't have
the strength to resist?

834
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,599
Isn't this police brutality?

835
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,869
Step aside.

836
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,840
We're conducting official business.

837
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,010
Why are you arresting them?

838
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:06,280
You'll ride in this van.

839
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:08,519
Get in.

840
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,389
- Da Rim.
- Go on.

841
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,889
Oh, dear.

842
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:15,489
Did my mom report this?

843
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:19,130
Was it my mom?

844
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,460
No, it wasn't her.

845
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,329
Now, go. Please leave!

846
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:25,929
- Gang Ju...
- Then what?

847
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:26,969
Come on.

848
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:28,070
But...

849
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:32,539
Wait. Chief, hold on.

850
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:34,480
Why are you arresting them...

851
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,010
when the owner of the money
didn't report it?

852
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:38,050
My mom knows the truth,
but she didn't report it.

853
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,619
What do you think that means?
She forgave them.

854
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:42,420
They're moving out due to guilt,

855
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,789
so how could you barge in here...

856
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,420
and arrest the whole family?

857
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,559
That may be true for your mother,

858
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,190
but the police
are making the arrest...

859
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,889
based on evidence
linking them to the theft.

860
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:53,829
They didn't steal anything.

861
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:56,460
Mr. Oh and Yang Gil Soon
stole the money.

862
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,769
All they did was dig up
what Yang Gil Soon had buried...

863
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:01,139
and put every cent of it back.

864
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:04,170
The entire ten million was buried,
which wasn't an easy feat,

865
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,670
but you still find them guilty?

866
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:07,380
I see you know a lot
about this case.

867
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:08,980
Seo Gang Ju, hey!

868
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:10,980
He doesn't know anything.

869
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,510
He has nothing to do
with our family, okay?

870
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,849
That's not true.
You're right. I know everything.

871
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:20,519
Even so, I helped them hide the cash
that belonged to my mother.

872
01:00:21,019 --> 01:00:23,489
I waited so that they could make up
for the money they had spent.

873
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:24,960
They gave back every penny,

874
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,460
and my mom will get
all her money back.

875
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,559
Isn't that enough?

876
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:29,800
Now, uncuff them. Let them go.

877
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,469
Digging a hole in this cold
almost exhausted me to death,

878
01:00:32,469 --> 01:00:34,670
and all that work can't go to waste.

879
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,599
I can't allow that.

880
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:38,210
When did you bury it?

881
01:00:38,739 --> 01:00:39,840
Shut your mouth.

882
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,280
On December 31.

883
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:43,710
It was the day Ms. Ko was arrested.

884
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,449
Did you bury the money
to have Ms. Ko released?

885
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:48,750
Yes!

886
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,719
There's nothing more to investigate
since all the money showed up.

887
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,019
My mom knows that as well.

888
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,289
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

889
01:00:56,289 --> 01:00:58,260
You buried it to get
Ms. Ko Bong Hee released?

890
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,489
I did.

891
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,630
I know you're Ms. Baek's son.
What's your name?

892
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,429
What?

893
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:06,900
What's your name?

894
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,039
It's Seo Gang Ju.

895
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,639
- Mr. Seo Gang Ju.
- Yes.

896
01:01:09,639 --> 01:01:12,110
If what you just said is true,

897
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:15,210
you committed a serious crime
of concealing evidence.

898
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:17,449
Do you know
that makes you an accomplice?

899
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,380
I need you
to come to the police station.

900
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,820
Fine, let's go. Arrest me too!

901
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,150
No, Gang Ju.

902
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:29,159
What are you thinking?

903
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,989
I'm an accomplice.

904
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:32,590
I was in on it too.

905
01:01:32,929 --> 01:01:34,599
I'm with your family.

906
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:37,170
I went to Mount Euak
with your grandparents.

907
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,099
There was a lot of digging
and burying.

908
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,469
I carried your grandma down
away from the police.

909
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:44,610
If you're guilty, I am too.
If you're arrested, I should be too.

910
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:47,039
I should be punished too!

911
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:48,840
I'm a thief as well!

912
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,940
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

913
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,650
Will you keep your mouth shut?

914
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,730
(Iron Family)

915
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:39,829
This all happened...

916
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:42,000
because we needed money
for my eye surgery.

917
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,730
Didn't you come here to settle?

918
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:45,099
Why should I settle?

919
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:47,170
Mom. I won't break up with Da Rim.

920
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:48,739
Your threats are powerless now.

921
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,670
The money Gil Soon tried to give us
as he was dying.

922
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:51,670
Let's get it tomorrow.

923
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:53,840
I'll announce the sentence
for the theft case...

924
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,880
involving ten million
from Mount Euak.
