00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:03,270
(Episode 31)

2
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,450
We took Ms. Ko to a holding cell.

3
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:44,619
We'll see...

4
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:46,719
if the chief will question her
when she gets here.

5
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,619
Where are the rest of the officers?

6
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,920
Ms. Baek Ji Yeon reported
ten million dollars was stolen.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,259
They went to Mount Euak.

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,329
- Mount Euak?
- Mount Euak?

9
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,799
The money's not there. We dug it up.

10
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:01,200
Are you crazy?

11
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:13,579
Regardless of the reason,
how could you shout like that?

12
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:15,510
She's your mother-in-law,
but she's your chief first.

13
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,049
Are you saying it was right of her
to do that without a word to us?

14
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,359
- Goodness.
- Darn it.

15
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,390
- Dig deeper.
- Okay.

16
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,829
- Oh, gosh.
- Dig some more.

17
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:32,200
The hole must be deep.

18
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,969
My feet are freezing cold.

19
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,109
- Watch your step.
- I will.

20
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,250
Are you sure you know the spot?

21
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,780
Yes, I'm sure.

22
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,049
- He buried it so high up.
- Be quiet.

23
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,060
This is the best we can do.

24
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,930
We must dig
before the police get here.

25
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,800
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

26
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,139
We can do it.

27
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:14,710
We can do it.

28
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:15,939
We can do it.

29
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,680
We can do it.

30
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,560
It's within a 20m radius.

31
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:32,960
Search in a circle.

32
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:34,229
Okay.

33
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:37,300
Now listen.

34
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,530
You lost ten million dollars...

35
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,300
and reported to the police...

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,229
that you'd lost 1,000 dollars.

37
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,439
Yang Gil Soon,
Oh Min Gi's accomplice,

38
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,310
buried the ten million here
before his death.

39
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,909
I told you clearly
that the money wasn't here,

40
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,539
but you refused to believe me.

41
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,680
So we'll dig in that spot again.

42
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:55,610
Watch carefully.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
I will,
so start searching thoroughly.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
It's freezing cold.

45
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,819
You're so good
at making everyone hate you.

46
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:05,360
Sorry, guys.

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,229
She's the type to get in our way
by whining and complaining...

48
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,699
until we do as she asks.

49
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
I really don't like you.

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,030
Let's just pretend, then go.

51
00:03:14,469 --> 00:03:16,969
- My goodness.
- The money is not here.

52
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:20,069
That's why I'm questioning
Ko Bong Hee.

53
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:23,009
We won't do this again.
I'll stop that from happening.

54
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,139
Let's put up with it just tonight.

55
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,210
- Okay.
- Get digging.

56
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,669
Look.

57
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Hey.

58
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:03,409
Wasn't that a metal detector?

59
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,979
- What?
- They found the bag of cash.

60
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,250
Let's go.

61
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,189
Watch your step.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,629
Here? Is this the spot?

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,899
Get out of their way.
Let the detectives do their job.

64
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,470
- Let go of me.
- What's wrong with you?

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,529
- Keep still.
- Goodness.

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,839
You haven't dug a hole in your life.
Don't get your hopes up.

67
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,069
You find metal shards
all over a mountain.

68
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,240
Coins or pieces of gear
that hikers lost.

69
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,910
It could be a lighter
or a trekking pole.

70
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,680
We even find belt buckles.

71
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:41,720
Why are you so pessimistic?

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,220
You should dig with the mindset
that you'll find the cash.

73
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,459
Will you be quiet?

74
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,329
Darn you.

75
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,959
Darn you.

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,660
My gosh.

77
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,300
I found something.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,639
What? What did you find?

79
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,790
My money!

80
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,259
I said it would be here!

81
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:26,000
Look at this! It's my money!

82
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,800
I told you my money was here!

83
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,040
I found it!

84
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,410
Didn't you say you dug...

85
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,439
and couldn't find it?

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,980
Ms. Baek. Stay back.

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,649
We must confirm if this is yours.

88
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,079
We'll seize it for now.

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,720
Why would you seize it
when it's mine?

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,120
- Wait.
- Let's go.

91
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,889
You're being weird.

92
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:54,189
What are you doing?

93
00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:55,959
- Look.
- Wait.

94
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,600
Stop!

95
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,970
This is it.

96
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,540
It proves the money is mine!

97
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:15,750
I need some light.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,850
(To my dear daughter Baek Ji Yeon,
from your father Baek Woong.)

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,230
Dad!

100
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,800
I found the money!

101
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,699
Thank you, Dad!

102
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,629
I love you!

103
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,980
Are the police behind us?

104
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,990
What? Do you see the police?

105
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,720
- I don't.
- I don't see them yet.

106
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,259
We're moving so slowly.

107
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,459
We'll get caught at this rate.

108
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,000
There's no path here,
so I doubt they'll come this way.

109
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,370
But keep looking behind
just in case, Gi Dung.

110
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,740
Okay, I will.

111
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,939
- Gil Rye.
- What?

112
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,610
How many times have we been here?

113
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,110
Enough to say we work here.

114
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,550
My daughter Mi Yeon.

115
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,279
You can marry her, Mr. Nam.

116
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,350
- I refuse the offer.
- What?

117
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,689
- I won't have her.
- Why not?

118
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,290
I'm here to help you two.

119
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
What the heck
did that brat do this time?

120
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,930
Your feet might freeze.

121
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,100
We don't want you to get frostbite.
Get on my back.

122
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,399
My feet are the least
of our problems.

123
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,569
Poor Bong Hee.

124
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,180
She must be so cold
and afraid all on her own.

125
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,610
Do you think we can get off the mountain
before dusk?

126
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,680
Yes. That's why I need you
to get on my back.

127
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,379
- Come on, get on.
- What?

128
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,620
- I will, then.
- Yes.

129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,850
- Oh, dear.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Nam.

130
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,689
My legs feel like jelly.

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,490
- I'll carry you, then.
- Okay.

132
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,730
Goodness.

133
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,990
Oh, dear. I'm up.

134
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,160
- Sir.
- What?

135
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,399
Do you see any people
or lights behind us?

136
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,129
- What?
- I don't.

137
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,500
- Good.
- Let's go.

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,569
I don't see them.

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,339
- Okay.
- Think again.

140
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,610
- No. It's fine.
- Watch your step.

141
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,090
Let's hurry.

142
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,919
Be sure to get everything.

143
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,960
Come this way.

144
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's talk later.

145
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,169
Isn't that a bag of cash?

146
00:08:56,139 --> 00:08:58,110
That's the cash, isn't it?

147
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,879
Did they bury it back?

148
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,710
Who did?

149
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,080
Who else could it be?

150
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,279
There's only one person.

151
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,950
Gang Ju?

152
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,129
(50 dollars)

153
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,840
(50 dollars)

154
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,120
It's ten million in total.

155
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,529
The serial numbers are crucial.

156
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,389
Take photos that show them clearly.

157
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:50,629
Okay.

158
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,559
(Evidence 1)

159
00:09:54,929 --> 00:09:56,129
(Evidence 2)

160
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:58,570
They're all thugs. Let me in.

161
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,840
(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

162
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,110
Open the door.

163
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,179
Stop it.
You're hampering the investigation.

164
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:07,549
You said the thief took my money
and buried it there.

165
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,480
You found it there, so it's mine.
What do you need to investigate?

166
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,250
Crime-related evidence is seized.
That's the law.

167
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,950
Wait until we're done.

168
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,789
I don't believe this.

169
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,490
Why won't you let me take it?

170
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,600
Hand it over. You found the will!

171
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,429
- Stop it.
- That proves it's my money.

172
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,870
Will you be quiet?

173
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,210
You can come in.

174
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,179
(Violent Crimes Unit 1)

175
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,850
Chief wants to see
Detective Lee Mu Rim.

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Now?

177
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,039
(50 dollars)

178
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,909
Are you sure
it's ten million dollars?

179
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,679
(Evidence 3, Evidence 4, Evidence 5)

180
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,909
If you're done checking the bills,
can I take them now?

181
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,350
The bills with serial numbers
starting with AA...

182
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,919
are worth 6.15 million dollars.

183
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,620
The other 3.85 million dollars
don't have AA serial numbers.

184
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,090
Pardon?

185
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,659
AA serial numbers?

186
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:31,460
The 50-dollar bills
issued 15 years ago...

187
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,799
are only 6.15 million dollars.

188
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,830
So what?

189
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,870
I can't take the money?

190
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,399
As I told you before,

191
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,639
evidence is supposed
to be confiscated.

192
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,480
All confiscated items are subject
to the direction of the prosecutor.

193
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,750
We need approval
from the investigative agency...

194
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,879
to confirm
that the money belongs to you.

195
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,750
If you want your money back,

196
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
you should apply for a return
of confiscated items.

197
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,620
A return of what?

198
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,490
Come on.

199
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,399
After the money was stolen from me,

200
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,029
you never know
how much of it the thief used.

201
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,870
There's no way...

202
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:12,169
I know how many bills were replaced
after they left my safe.

203
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,309
Seriously...

204
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,980
(Application for Return
of Confiscated Items)

205
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
(Baek Ji Yeon)

206
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,820
Are you done
filling in the application?

207
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,350
And there's the will.

208
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,289
If it wasn't my money,
why do you think...

209
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,049
my father's will was found
in the bag?

210
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:33,159
When will it be approved?

211
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:35,259
It will take at least 3 to 4 days.

212
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,929
I'm sure this is my money.

213
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,799
Please get it done quickly.

214
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,669
Thank you for your hard work
at the beginning of the New Year.

215
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,820
The will was found in the bag
filled with money.

216
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,820
So there's no doubt.

217
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,779
She'll get it back.

218
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,250
What kind of law is this, Chief?

219
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,460
She won't pay any tax
just because it's been 15 years?

220
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,220
That's just not fair.

221
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,440
What's happening to my mother?

222
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,049
Baek Ji Yeon.

223
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,279
Baek Ji Yeon!

224
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,850
Seriously.

225
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,889
Wait. What are you going to do?

226
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,720
When our house was robbed,
I came to the police station...

227
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,789
and said we lost only 1,000 dollars.

228
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,799
This makes me your accomplice
who covered up for you.

229
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,000
And what if it's leaked?

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,669
You won't be the only one
who gets criticized.

231
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you know
what will happen to my company?

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,700
I mean my company, Jiseung.

233
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:56,009
Just say that
it's my father's money.

234
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,210
Reveal everything.

235
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,080
And you and I are strangers now.

236
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,049
Stay out of my business.

237
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,549
I'm glad you brought it up.
We're strangers, you say.

238
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:08,289
We're strangers now,
so you shouldn't come to my house.

239
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,450
- Don't come into my house.
- I said it was my house.

240
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,220
- It's my house.
- It's mine.

241
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,159
- It's my house!
- I said it's mine!

242
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't come to my house.
Go somewhere else.

243
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,299
Darn it!

244
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,269
You darn thing!

245
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,669
- Sir.
- Darn it!

246
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,940
Hey.
What are you doing here, Mr. Seo?

247
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,710
Director Seo Gang Ju asked me...

248
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,210
to defend the suspect.

249
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:36,580
Who's the suspect?

250
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,419
Ko Bong Hee?

251
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,019
What is the exact charge?

252
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,090
I'm not supposed to say
the client's charge.

253
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,669
Why is everyone being like this
to me today?

254
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,429
I'm sorry, sir.

255
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:57,570
My goodness.

256
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,039
Please come out.

257
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,830
Before Ms. Baek Ji Yeon,
the owner of the money, reported it,

258
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:32,700
we couldn't confirm
who the money belonged to,

259
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,409
so I couldn't tell you anything.

260
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:35,870
After she reported it,

261
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,039
we found the stolen money
in Mount Euak.

262
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,509
We found it at the location
where the money was buried.

263
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,919
You are released without charge.

264
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
But...

265
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,330
I don't understand how you ended up
with 10,000 dollars...

266
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,759
with AA serial numbers?

267
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,830
Where did you get the money?

268
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,970
It was the money gifts
for my wedding.

269
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,440
I see.

270
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,509
I'm sorry for the trouble.

271
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,720
Mom.

272
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,200
Director Seo, the money was found
in the mountain.

273
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:40,299
Ms. Ko Bong Hee will be released.

274
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,139
Are you sure? Okay.

275
00:16:44,409 --> 00:16:45,539
Ms. An, Mr. Lee.

276
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,480
Your daughter-in-law
will be released.

277
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,210
- My goodness.
- Oh, dear.

278
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,450
Gosh, what a relief.

279
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,620
Gang Ju,
let's go to the police station.

280
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,090
Right. We should be with her.

281
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,690
We're the ones who started it.
Let's go.

282
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,690
Okay.

283
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,990
My goodness.

284
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,230
They released her
as soon as the money was found.

285
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,329
That's right. What can they do?

286
00:17:22,779 --> 00:17:24,420
The girls know everything.

287
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:28,819
Everything?

288
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,890
Yes.

289
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,359
They knew all about it.

290
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,390
It's the girls and Seo Gang Ju
who made up for the money...

291
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,930
and buried it in the mountain.

292
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,160
- My goodness.
- Mom.

293
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:42,730
Are you all right?

294
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:44,200
Well... I...

295
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,339
I don't think I can face them now.

296
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,740
And Seo Gang Ju is in on it too?

297
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,450
Mu Rim.

298
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:01,750
I want to be alone...

299
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,849
for a moment.

300
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Okay.

Mom has been released.

303
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,710
Ms. Baek's money was found
in Mount Euak,

304
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,740
so they released Mom.

305
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,039
Mu Rim, I think...

306
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,950
Seo Gang Ju buried the money
in the mountain...

307
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,849
instead of returning it to his mom.

308
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,119
You're at the police station.
Will you keep it quiet?

309
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:12,390
She doesn't want to see us now,

310
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,829
so I let her leave
through the back door.

311
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,730
You guys should go home now.

312
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:20,799
You two, Auntie.

313
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,970
- Go home.
- Okay.

314
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,450
Isn't that Ms. Ko?

315
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,119
- Where?
- Where?

316
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,519
- Is that Bong Hee?
- What?

317

My goodness.

318
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,890
- I think it's Bong Hee.
- What?

319
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:54,029
Are you all right?

320
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,730

- Well...
- We buried it.

324
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,680
He came over and told us to bury it.

325
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,980
He asked us to go there together.

326
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,849
He took us to the mountain
and buried the money.

327
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,619

328
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,099

Please don't worry about it.

330
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,369
I buried ten million dollars,

331
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,569
so she'll get all her money back.

332
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,769
And it's me
who burned three million dollars.

333
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:41,279
Da Rim, Cha Rim, and I worked hard
and earned enough money to bury.

334
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,819
The majority of what you spent...

335
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,019
was 800,000 dollars,
which was for Da Rim's surgery.

336
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,150
Don't be too bad about it.

337
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,190
- Bong Hee, get in here already.
- Get in.

338
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,190
- Mother.
- Get in.

339
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,930
- Goodness.
- Get in already.

340
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,960
- Mother...
- There, there.

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,829
- Goodness me.
- My gosh.

- Goodness.

- My gosh.
- Bong Hee.

344
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,809
- Our Bong Hee.
- I was scared out of my mind...

could happen to you.

Thanks, Gi Dung.

349
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:28,559
I can't believe it.

350
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:32,029
I don't get it. Why did they
arrest you of all people?

351
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,369
They should've arrested us
since it was our fault.

352
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,769
Mother, Father,

353
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,339
how did the kids
find out everything?

354
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:49,109
I'm too ashamed to show my face,
Bong Hee.

355
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,349
Rather than giving it to his mom,

356
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,920
that punk buried the money
to help us out.

357
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:00,359
Goodness me.

358
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,259
Would his mom know
what he was doing?

359
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:07,730
I wouldn't have stolen it...

360
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,930
if I'd known
the money was Ms. Baek's.

361
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,569
- Same here!
- Same here!

362
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,599
My gosh.

363
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,650
Where are you? I want to see you.

364
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,890
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

365
00:22:31,819 --> 00:22:32,990
The ten million dollars.

366
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:35,789
Since we buried the money
where we found it,

367
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,299
does that mean
we're clear of any wrongdoing?

368
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:42,869
Every penny was returned
to its rightful owner,

369
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,069
so that's my guess.

370
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,470
I'm not sure.

371
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,140
I don't know if this means
we aren't guilty of anything.

372
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,339
I have no idea.

373
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,380
- What now?
- Oh, dear.

374
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,480
Gi Dung, I'm sorry to ask,

375
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,089
but can you take them home?

376
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,190
Where are you off to?

377
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,220
Well,

378
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:09,859
my mom would've known
that I buried the money...

379
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,500
after seeing the will.

380
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,700
Take them home, please.

384
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,319
Unbelievable.
Are you kidding me with this?

385
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:39,460
Tell me about it.

386
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,339
Did my mom get home?

387
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,039
You should head home.

388
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,950
Where are you headed?

389
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,279
Is my mom still
at the police station?

390
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,349
She left.

391
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
I see.

392
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,059
Can I give you a hug?

393
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,500
As if you need to ask.

394
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,769
Gosh.

395
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,480
I never wish to have a day
like this again.

396

397

I'm so sorry.

401
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:54,430
I knew you'd feel this way,

402
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,500

I didn't take you to the mountain.

I'll do right by you...

406

and your mom
for the rest of my life.

407
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,460
Are you going to marry me or what?

408
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,460
I will if that's what you want.

409
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,200
I'll do anything.

410
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,630
Are you marrying me out of debt?

411
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,430
That's odd. I don't want that.

412
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,099
Don't think you owe me anything.

413

in this world.

Come on.

417
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,720
I'm scared someone else
will steal you from me.

418
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,349

don't even acknowledge me.

419
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,359

the whole story,

423

taken over again?

I want it to be a son just like you.

431

What if he ends up
as a disloyal son like me?

432

Don't wish that.

433
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,230

are already at the table.

- He's not taking the day off today.
- Yes, do that.

Sure.

Tell him to hurry
before the rice cakes go mushy.

468
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,980
Could he be asleep?

469
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,309
I'll go get him.

470
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,849
- You should eat.
- Okay.

471

Yes.

at fault.

479

Are you still hung up on me?

480
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,660
If not, what's with the attitude?

481
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,890
This is tteokguk and nothing else.

482
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,759
What?

483
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Who are you to dictate how I feel?

484
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,230
Hey.
If I sit here and gobble this down,

485
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,170
you'll think I'm spineless.

486
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:34,140
The moment I eat
the tteokguk you cooked,

487
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,940
you'll think I'm an easy sap.

488
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,009
I'm not hung up on you, so leave.

489
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:40,140
I'll eat tteokguk made
by everyone else...

490
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,609
but never the one you made.

491
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,190
I heard you were opening
a restaurant at another location.

492
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,490
I'll lend a hand.

493
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,960
Thank you for carrying my parents...

494
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,569
down the mountain trail.

495
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,269
I'll leave the tteokguk here.

496
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:39,900
Where's Gang Ju? Wasn't he home?

497
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,569
He wasn't. I guess he left.

498
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:43,970
Where did he go so early
in the morning?

499
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,150
Mom.

500
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,750
Grandma, Grandpa.

501
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,779
Yes?

502
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:53,180
It's a new year,

503
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,880
so share some wise words with us.

504
00:31:56,089 --> 00:31:57,220
Don't you have anything to say?

505
00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:02,789
As if a thief like me could dare...

506
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,259
to share any words of blessing.

507
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,299
What about you, Grandma?

508
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,769
I'd gladly crawl into a rat hole
if there was one.

509
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,000
And you, Mom?

510
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,369
I'll join your grandma.

511
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,779
Why did you leave out the back door?

512
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:21,180
You didn't dig up the money
for yourself...

513
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,809
but for your children.

514
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,279
I'm the reason
why you chose to steal that money.

515
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,819
I'm sorry and also grateful...

516
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,450
for making me see again.

517
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,720
It's my fault.

518
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:37,559
None of this would've happened...

519
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,660
had I told you I had enough money.

520
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:42,900
Tae Woong, don't think that way.

521
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,130
We didn't tell you anything.

522
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,740
We caused serious trouble
when we were near death.

523
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,009
I'm sorry.

524
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:54,210
I hope this won't hurt you...

525
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,109
in any way.

526
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,650
The money was found at the mountain,
so there's no need to worry.

527
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,920
For the money you three spent,

528
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,950
Da Rim, Gang Ju, and I
earned the amount,

529
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,289
and then we put it in the bag.

530
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,690
The owner of the money
got it all back,

531
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,130
so think that it took a round trip.

532
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,890
It got here from the mountain...

533
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,160
and was then returned.

534
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,500
Anyway, just forget about it all.

535
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,369
I desperately ask this of you.

536
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,769
If there's any trouble,

537
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:22,609
please tell me first, Mother.

538
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:24,769
Okay, I hear you.

539
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,480
Mom.

540
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,849
What are you going to do
with the store?

541
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,450
I should keep running it.

542
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,589
Why? Because we're broke now?

543
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,460
Stop it. Don't talk about money now.

544
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,730
You'll only pressure the kids.

545
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:45,029
Listen, Mother.

546
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,460
You've earned this break.

547
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:50,869
No, I'd feel better running it.

548
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,740
Mom, use this time to take a break.

549
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,210
The three of you should go on a trip
to somewhere nearby.

550
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,039
- What?
- You never had the chance...

551
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,210
while running the store.

552
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,549
You never went anywhere
after I was born.

553
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,220
It's been over 30 years.

554
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,349
Goodness.

555
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:11,619
As if we deserve it
after what we did.

556
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:14,119
A vacation
when we stole from someone?

557
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,730
We'll be punished by the heavens.

558
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,800
I'll help out a lot
at the dry cleaner's.

559
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,500
Me too.

560
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:26,599
Same here.

561
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,940
Right. I will as well.

562
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,809
I will too.

563
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:34,780
The best kind of money
is what you earn yourself.

564
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,380
That's for sure.

565
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:51,829
You...

566
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,130
Why did you have Lawyer Seo
represent Bong Hee?

567
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,369
A police chief...

568
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,469
wouldn't have accused Bong Hee
without probable cause.

569
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,340
That's outrageous.

570
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,969
Did you know your mom
would report to the police?

571
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:07,110
It sounded like you also knew...

572
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,480
where they'd dig
in search of the money.

573
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,280
What were you up to at that hour?

574
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,119
At that hour,

575
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:18,650
I went to the mountain
to bury Mom's money.

576
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,699
Sir, the news is running a story...

577
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,730
about the company and Ms. Baek.

578
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,769
The brazen Ms. B locates money...

579
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,539
that was hidden for 15 years.

580
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,539
The shocking truth...

581
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,039
behind the shocking money
found at Mount Euak.

582
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,940
The truth behind the robbery...

583
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,940
that took place last September
in Cheonglyeom-dong...

584
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,949
finally came to light.

585
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:45,380
The victim was B,

586
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,579
the ex-wife of A, who's the chairman
of a well-known fashion company.

587
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,489
At the time,
B reported to the police...

588
00:35:49,489 --> 00:35:51,050
that only 1,000 dollars
had been stolen,

589
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,260
but it turned out to be
a complete lie.

590
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:57,429
We'll hear the details
from our reporter.

591
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,960
What was stolen
wasn't 1,000 dollars...

592
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,730
but ten million dollars,

593
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,469
which was all in 50-dollar bills.

594
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,070
This ten million dollars
was found...

595
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,570
at Mount Euak in Cheonglyeom-gu
at dawn on January 1.

596
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:13,409
Even though B was robbed
of ten million dollars,

597
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:17,079
she reported the amount
as only 1,000 dollars for a reason.

598
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,949
The reason was tax evasion.

599
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,090
The ten million dollars
was an inheritance she received...

600
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,159
from her loan shark father
who passed away 15 years ago.

601
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,519
- Is that...
- Only until midnight...

602
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,789
- you?
- of December 31 last year...

603
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:32,260
was the ten million dollars...

604
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,659
- taxable with additional charges,
- They won't know it's me, right?

605
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,699
which would've brought the total
to 13 million dollars.

606
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:38,070
Will they know the news is about me,

607
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,170
Hae Ja?

608
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,139
As soon as midnight struck...

609
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:44,010
and it became January 1, 2025,

610
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,239
she reported to the police
that she'd been robbed...

611
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:49,710
of 10 million dollars, not 1,000,
which led to its discovery.

612
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,750
The ten million dollars
that was found at Mount Euak...

613
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,119
is currently being investigated
and analyzed by the police.

614
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,489
As long as there aren't any issues,

615
00:36:56,489 --> 00:36:58,619
the money will be returned to B.

616
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:01,289
She evaded the tax
on the ten million dollars,

617
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:04,559
but since she only reported
that 1,000 dollars was stolen,

618
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,599
the authorities can't charge her
with anything,

619
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,170
which makes this case
a perfect example of tax evasion.

620
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,750
I did the right thing, Father.

621
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,920
The people at the dry cleaner's
only dug up the money...

622
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,489
to pay for Da Rim's eye surgery.

623
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,690
When Ms. Ko asked you to pretend
that you lent her 800,000 dollars,

624
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,199
if you had taken
a bit more interest...

625
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:41,900
into why she needed the money,

626
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:44,099
this wouldn't have happened.

627
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,070
I burned the three million dollars
the grandparents first took.

628
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:50,940
It's my fault.

629
00:37:52,909 --> 00:37:54,409
But you're not innocent
in this matter either.

630
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,550
We're the ones
who drove them to steal that money.

631
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,519
What?

632
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,079
Your friend asked you to pretend...

633
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,489
to have lent her 800,000 dollars.

634
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,619
There's nothing decent
about not even asking why.

635
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,960
Are you saying...

636
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,860
this is all our fault?

637
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,699
Da Rim's mother had been arrested,

638
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,599
and I couldn't think of
a better option.

639
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,539
It was the best play I could make.

640
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,210
I'm lost.

641
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,449
The chairman
of a well-known fashion company...

642
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:33,750
and the tax evader
who owns the ten million dollars...

643
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:36,789
- are currently divorced.
- They'll be reporting this all day.

644
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,050
Darn.

645
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,929
(Cheonglyeom Police Station,
Chief Yun Mi Ok)

646
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,929
You should apologize.

647
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,630
Being a chief...

648
00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:53,699
doesn't mean you can arrest
an innocent woman on New Year's Day.

649
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:55,239
What?

650
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,440
You didn't even properly apologize
when she was released...

651
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,940
and continued to be suspicious
of her money.

652
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,050
Is it because...

653
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:05,880
our family couldn't possibly receive
that amount of money?

654
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,650
Isn't my mom allowed to carry
around 10,000 dollars in cash?

655
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,489
What's so strange about that?

656
00:39:12,489 --> 00:39:15,190
Actually, it's very strange.

657
00:39:17,429 --> 00:39:18,460
Your family?

658
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,570
Let's be honest.
Your family is broke.

659
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,699
Your mother?

660
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,340
She gladly took
the 100,000 dollars I offered her,

661
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,409
and you've been living with me
instead of getting your own place.

662
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,170
Of course,
your family doesn't have any money!

663
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,110
Are you done talking?

664
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,150
Are you bragging
that you gave her 100,000 dollars?

665
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,320
You don't know
how much that hurt my pride.

666
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,619
Yes.

667
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,320
I hated having to move in with you,

668
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:52,429
but I had no choice
because my family was poor.

669
00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:55,360
I couldn't afford to rent a place,

670
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,269
so I was forced.

671
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,840
Are you out of your mind, Mom?

672
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,440
Are you all right?

673
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:03,869
Let go of me.

674
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,250
Darn it.

675
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,440
You didn't register as a couple yet,
did you?

676
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:43,150
Don't you dare
get a marriage license.

677
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,690
You're a police officer,
and so am I.

678
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,159
We can't be in-laws
with a family of thieves.

679
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,619
They'll drag us down.

680
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:55,760
Mom.

681
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
Do you still suspect Mu Rim's mom?

682
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,960
What do you mean,
"a family of thieves?"

683
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,400
That money
shouldn't have been in circulation.

684
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,400
They were 50-dollar AA bills
from 15 years ago,

685
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,940
and she had
10,000 dollars' worth in her bag.

686
00:41:08,539 --> 00:41:10,710
Do you believe what Mu Rim said?

687
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,039
We had a wedding,
and we're living together.

688
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,710
That doesn't mean anything.

689
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,750
You don't have kids.

690
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:19,079
It's easy to make a clean break.

691
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:21,219
Mom. You should've talked
to me first...

692
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,320
and told Sergeant Lee too.

693
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,420
Hey. And what if I did?

694
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,789
Would he bring his mom in?

695
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,820
He'd cover for his family.

696
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,889
Sergeant Lee's not like that.

697
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,260
Do as I say.

698
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,559
That's what is best for you.

699
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,530
- Mom.
- It's an ongoing case.

700
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,300
Mom.

701
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,670
Chief. Wait.

702
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:50,280
(Stay Out, Ongoing Investigation)

703
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,780
It's exactly where we dug.

704
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,389
This doesn't make sense.

705
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,590
It was the dry cleaning folks.

706
00:42:00,289 --> 00:42:01,860
Let's say they took the money.

707
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,329
Why would they put it back?

708
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,630
They're not stupid. That's stupid.

709
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,500
Not even a ghost could explain this.

710
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:10,969
The police have the cash, right?

711
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,840
Yes. Why?

712
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:16,309
Baek Ji Yeon hasn't paid us a dime
for our troubles.

713
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,139
We can't give up
without taking a cut.

714
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:44,000
(Mom)

715
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:10,230
You will find
Grandfather's will soon.

716
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,429
Didn't you say you'd move back in?

717
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:15,000
Stay with me.

718
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,429
(Evidence 3, Evidence 4, Evidence 5)

719
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,699
Everything's so suspicious.

720
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:28,610
So, when can I get my money back?

721
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:32,349
It's clean enough
to take to the bank.

722
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,150
Think about the amount of interest
on ten million dollars.

723
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,019
What did the police say?
Why are they dragging this on?

724
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,159
They're currently testing to see
if the will is real.

725
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,889
Fortunately for us,
the will doesn't say...

726
00:43:45,329 --> 00:43:47,730
all the bills' serial numbers
start with AA.

727
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,000
Even if there are bills
that start with other letters,

728
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,099
they can't trace it
because it's cash.

729
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,210
The crucial fact is that the will
was found in the bag with the cash.

730
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,840
They'll take their time,

731
00:43:58,039 --> 00:43:59,679
but they'll have to give it
to you eventually.

732
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,380
It'll take a while for a prosecutor
to clear it, so let's wait.

733
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,349
Why is it so hard
to get my own money back?

734
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,750
I want it back soon.

735
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:37,079
I heard you found the money.
I'm happy for you.

736
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,650
Why didn't you call me
when you went to the police?

737
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,449
Why did you go alone?

738
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,190
What did the police say?
Do you get it back soon?

739
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:49,059
You're scaring me.
Don't look at me like that, Mom.

740
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,199
The bag you brought yesterday...

741
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:00,869
and the one
at the police station today.

742
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,239
Was it the same one?

743
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,210
There are
many identical bags out there.

744
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:09,340
Did you take the will
and leave it there?

745
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,250
I never even saw that will.

746
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:15,619
Did you see me take it?

747
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,219
If you wanted to return it,

748
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:19,050
why did you bury it up a mountain?

749
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,489
Did you see the news?

750
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,320
It's all thanks to you.

751
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,530
You did this to me.

752
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:25,929
No.

753
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,630
How would I know
where to bury the money?

754
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:31,769
You said the police told you...

755
00:45:32,269 --> 00:45:34,099
where the thieves buried it.

756
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:36,239
It was there
because the thieves left it there.

757
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,210
Why would you say I buried it?

758
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,380
Hey.

759
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,750
They didn't take the will.
That was at home.

760
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,219
What are you talking about...

761
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:48,619
when the thieves
took the cash but not the will?

762
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,050
I don't know anything
about the will.

763
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:54,389
Don't suspect poor innocent me.

764
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:55,989
You didn't take the will?

765
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,829
I didn't.

766
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,530
Look me in the eyes.

767
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,929
It really wasn't you?

768
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,170
It wasn't.

769
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,539
Are you even my son?

770
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,280
Yes.

771
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Get out.

772
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,860
It really wasn't me, Mom.

777
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,070
Thank you.

778
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:18,570
How is...

779
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,639
your mother doing?

780
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:23,380
She's doing well.

781
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,780
Could she really be fine
after being in the news?

782
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,550
Only people who know her
will recognize her.

783
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:36,159
She wasn't mentioned by name.

784
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,199
Don't worry.

785
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:47,099
Both my mom and I got into this
expecting to be criticized.

786
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,969
She deserves to pay for tax evasion.

787
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,380
If you put it like that,

788
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,750
I stole, so I should go to prison.

789
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,150
I'm really sorry
for taking your mother's money.

790
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:09,590
I should say this to her in person.

791
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:12,690
I used my parents-in-law...

792
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,530
and detective son as an excuse.

793
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,199
I should've said we stole the money,

794
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,340
and I'm so sorry
I can't apologize in person.

795
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:30,480
You can't ever do that.

796
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,650
Are you telling me
to live like a coward?

797
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,159
How would I be able to pretend
that nothing happened?

798
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,630
You're not being a coward.

799
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,130
Da Rim and Cha Rim
paid back the money you spent.

800
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,699
Though Mom is being criticized,

801
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:55,269
she got her money back anyway.

802
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:58,409
She didn't pay taxes,

803
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,679
so she was going
to be criticized anyway.

804
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,940
And it's me
who burned three million dollars.

805
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:05,179
More importantly,

806
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,449
Da Rim got her sight back.

807
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,190
If you're put in the same situation,
you'll have to do the same thing.

808
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,320
So Da Rim can regain her sight.

809
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,989
Do you like Da Rim?

810
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:18,389
It's impossible not to like her.

811
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,960
It's a really good thing...

812
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,670
that you let Da Rim
regain her sight.

813
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:44,849
Aren't you going home?

814
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,059
I can't go home.

815
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:52,760
Is it that you can't go
or you refuse to go?

816
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,199
You can be honest with me.

817
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,300
I'll do just as you say.

818
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:04,869
There's something in what Mom says,

819
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:07,010
but I'll just do as you say.

820
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,820
Do you really want to end things?

821
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:23,289
Why are you being like this to me?

822
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,400
The weather got cold.

823
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,599
It's cold.

824
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:35,900
Tae Woong, do you know
the TJ building is put on sale...

825
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,570
at a cheap price?

826
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,110
I didn't know...

827
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,909
- What was that?
- What?

828
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,980
Watch out, Tae Woong.

829
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:44,650
What are you doing?

830
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,849
Hey.

831
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,820
What was that?

832
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:51,550
Hey!

833
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,960
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

834
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:57,159
- Here. Wipe it.
- My gosh.

835
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:58,690
No, I'm okay.

836
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,199
Oh, dear.

837
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,429
What was with that guy?

838
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,969
Isn't it obvious?

839
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:08,539
It's because of the tax evader
in the house.

840
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:13,210
It's just amazing people come here
so early in the morning.

841
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,079
Gosh. You should go in
and get changed first.

842
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:21,050
It's okay. We can go to the gym...

843
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,019
and ask Mr. Park
to bring us new clothes.

844
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,820
- Okay.
- I'm sorry for this.

845
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,820
It's all right.

846
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,920
Let's go. All right.

847
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:37,369
- Let's go.
- Sure.

848
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,920
I haven't seen Gang Ju lately.

849
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:59,019
That brat.

850
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,789
I don't think
he has time to work out now.

851
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,960
- Hello.
- Hello.

852
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,300
We're opening today.

853
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,570

00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:14,400
Hello. We're opening today.

857
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:17,969

859

Please enjoy it.

860
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,210
Thank you for coming.
Please enjoy your meal.

861
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,480
It's nice.

862
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:25,949
This looks great.

863
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:28,349
- Hey, you're here.
- This is for you.

864
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,550
- You must've worked hard.
- You don't have to do this.

865
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,650
You're the best.

866
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,289
You're finally opening
the second branch.

867
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:35,889
The owner of the second branch
worked hard for this.

868
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,760
I'm just helping him
with the opening event.

869
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:39,460
Thank you for coming.

870
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,059
- Please come in.
- Okay.

871
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:42,730
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

872
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:44,329
- I'll bring this in.
- Thank you.

873
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:45,329
See you.

874
00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:49,099
- Hello.
- Hello.

875
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,480
We have a lot of customers today.
Things are crazy here.

876
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,510
This is the first day,
and things are going well already.

877
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,510
This place is famous
for good food already.

878
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:01,119
Excuse me.

879
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:02,219
Yes.

880
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:04,789
Gi Dung, over here.

881
00:53:04,789 --> 00:53:06,289
- Enjoy it.
- Okay.

882
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,429
Auntie was too busy to come.

883
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:16,300
She was out of it that day,
so she couldn't even thank you.

884
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,400
So I just came with these two.

885
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,769
It looks delicious.

886
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,940
It melts in my mouth.

887
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,480
You went to Mount Euak...

888
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,380
and kept it to yourself.

889
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,179
Thank you so much, Mr. Nam.

890
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,789
- It's no big deal.
- You carried our grandparents.

891
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:38,320
Without you,

892
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,260
we wouldn't have been able
to bury the two heavy bags.

893
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,420
That's true.

894
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,829
Thank you.

895
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

896
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,400
Mother's here.

897
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,329
- Eat.
- Okay.

898
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:52,730
By the way,
why are you guys here together?

899
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,440
You know we work together.

900
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,440
How's Mom doing?

901
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,769
She says you're no longer her son.

902
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,909
It sounds like she's doing well.

903
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,449
Your mom is living in misery now.

904
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:05,750
What's the point
of getting the money back...

905
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,250
when she can't even
step out of the house?

906
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,090
(Chairman Ji Seung Don)

907
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,500
You must be tired.

908
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,000
Drink it, Father.

909
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:26,940
Thanks.

910
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,710
Well...

911
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:37,949
- Yes?
- About Seo Gang Ju's company.

912
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,550
Why don't we buy it?

913
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:44,289
Don't you think
they are too good to let go?

914
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:45,550
Who?

915
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,420
Design Director Lee?

916
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,260
And Seo Gang Ju.

917
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,829
Then you'll have to compete
with him.

918
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,929
I thought that was
what you wanted the most.

919
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:54,860
You must like it.

920
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:58,900
Are you confident?

921
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,940
Or are you just being nosy?

922
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,510
I know you care about him.

923
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:07,880
You failed to hide it.

924
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,079
They had the top sales this season.

925
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,949
Other companies would want
to collaborate with them.

926
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,219
I need someone competent around
to keep myself alert.

927
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,159
You should talk to him.

928
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,269
No. Gang Ju hates me.

929
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:33,030
You should talk to him.
He'll be flattered.

930
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,710
I'll think about it.

931
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:40,010
"The rich lady's tax evasion
of 13 million dollars..."

932
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,380
"that devastated the ordinary people
at the beginning of the New Year."

933
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,610
"For the rich lady, the tax evasion
of 13 million dollars was..."

934
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,409
"as easy as shopping."

935
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,980
Hey, it wasn't easy at all.

936
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:55,190
No one knows what I've been through.

937
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,059
They have no idea how hard
it has been for the past 15 years.

938
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,210
Who is it?

939
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:17,250
Ms. Baek.

940
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,250
Would you please donate
some money to help out?

941
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:21,880
You got
the ten million dollars back.

942
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,719
What? Who are you?

943
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,059
How did you find my place?

944
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:32,090
There's no one
who doesn't know about you.

945
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:35,329
You're the most famous person
in this country now.

946
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:38,099
You should spend money like that
on good causes.

947
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,030
Please make some donations.

948
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,500
I know what I should do
with my money.

949
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,510
Don't tell me what to do.

950
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,710
Get lost before I call the police!

951
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,760
You frauds. Get lost this instant!

952
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,130
You're using donations as an excuse
to extort money from me.

953
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:08,500
Don't ring the doorbell again.

954
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,769
I'll call the police
and put you guys behind bars.

955
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,329
That's ridiculous.

956
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,900
You're the one
who should be put behind bars.

957
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,039
It's you who is a fraud here.

958
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,809
How shameless you are.

959
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:23,239
- Can't you just help out?
- Right.

960
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,050
It's dirty money anyway.

961
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,320
My gosh.

962
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,030
Oh, dear.

963
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:59,309
- Ms. Baek.
- Ms. Baek.

964
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,119
How do you feel
about getting your money back?

965
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:02,980
- Ms. Baek.
- Did you say...

966
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,690
you lost 1,000 dollars,
not 10 million, to evade tax?

967
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,019
Where do you plan
to spend the money?

968
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:08,590
Are you happy
that you got the money back?

969
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,559
- Ms. Baek, please say something.
- Let me ask you one thing.

970
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,360
- How are you feeling?
- Ms. Baek.

971
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,630
- Say something about the tax.
- Move over.

972
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:15,760
- Ms. Baek.
- I said, move over.

973
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,070
- Baek Ji Yeon.
- Go away.

974
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:19,269
What are you doing
in front of her house?

975
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:20,900
- Hae Ja.
- Go away.

976
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:23,239
Move over before I call the police.

977
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,409
Go away!

978
00:58:24,409 --> 00:58:25,809
Just go.

979
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:28,239
Take photos of their faces.

980
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,340
- Ms. Baek Ji Yeon.
- Hurry.

981
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,949
Move over. Go away!

982
00:58:31,949 --> 00:58:33,280
What do we do?

983
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,320
Go back. Drive the car back inside.

984
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:38,719
My goodness.

985
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,460
What do they think they're doing?

986
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,920
- My gosh.
- Hurry.

987
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,159
- Ms. Baek!
- Oh, no.

988
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,840
Ji Yeon, I'll get going.

989
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,179
Don't watch the news or go online.

990
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:06,480
Don't even think about
reading online comments.

991
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,519
Just get some sleep.

992
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,780
I'll get going.

993
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:22,460
My gosh.

994
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,380
(Is 10 million dollars
all that she kept hidden?)

995
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,849
(She has a huge garden,
and money could be buried there.)

996
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:39,280
Look at all these comments.

997
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,679
Is ten million dollars
all that she kept hidden?

998
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,650
She has a huge garden,
and money could be buried there.

999
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,750
Who wants to dig with me?

1000
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,690
A social evil and a worthless being.

1001
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:51,590
Have her pay a fine
and confiscate her assets.

1002
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,559
Don't even think about
spending the ten million.

1003
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:54,760
I'm watching you.

1004
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,300
I hear you live in Cheonglyeom-dong.
Be careful at night.

1005
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:59,530
Her father ruined her
by leaving her that money.

1006
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,000
The law is too soft.

1007
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,969
She should be locked up forever
for hiding ten million dollars.

1008
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:05,539
How about a beating
for every ten dollars you spend?

1009
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:08,809
Be careful. I might go in there
and rob you again.

1010
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,309
Shouldn't her identity be revealed?

1011
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,909
She was already doxed. This is her.

1012
01:00:13,050 --> 01:00:14,949
The piece of trash
hated by the nation was born!

1013
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:17,219
(The piece of trash
hated by the nation was born!)

1014
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,219
Hated by the nation?

1015
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,369
What do I do?

1016
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,610
I can't believe her and this family.

1017
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,550
- Tell me about it.
- Unbelievable.

1018
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,320
So shameless.

01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,650
I thought no one was home.

Oh, no!

1025
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:51,309
Do you at least know
what you did was wrong?

1026
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:53,750
How dare you hide from us?

1027
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,880

Move. Get out of the way.

because we're morons, you know.

- This rotten cow.
- Unbelievable.

1031
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,389
- Darn.
- It's a waste of food. Let's go.

1032

Thank you so much.

I haven't been able
to leave the house.

1036
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,150
It's like I'm a prisoner
in my own home.

1037

I can't leave the house,

1038
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,880

from being in prison?

did something happen to you

1043
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,199
I reported my money to the police?

1044

Why are you making me worry as well?

01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,840
Da Rim, don't be
in a relationship with Gang Ju.

1046

I'm not the only one he likes.

1047
01:03:30,949 --> 01:03:32,909
He likes how I come
from a big family.

at the wedding.
