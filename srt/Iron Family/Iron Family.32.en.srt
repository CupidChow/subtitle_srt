1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,509
I can't believe that woman!

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,320
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,619
I haven't been able
to leave the house.

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,219
It's like I'm a prisoner
in my own home.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,460
I can't leave the house,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,129
so how is this different
from being in prison?

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,559
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,340
Here's your dry cleaning.

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,939
Wait. Come inside and wash up.

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,210
- Gosh, no.
- I feel too guilty.

11
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm all right, Ms. Baek.

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,250
How can you make more deliveries
covered in all this?

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,920
Wash up inside.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,920
It's all right.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,320
I'd be too guilty.
Come inside and wash up.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,049
- But...
- Come on.

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,829
Don't you think
they're too close at the hip?

18
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,869
Who cares if they are?

19
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,400
- What?
- Those are the days.

20
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,040
Don't they make a sweet couple?

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,480
He wasn't a nuisance but a blessing.

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
Would you like to come over
for some ramyeon?

23
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,519
What?

24
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,219
Yes.

25
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,319
He's sweet,

26
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:25,060
he doesn't hurt women,

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,530
and he's also good to women.

28
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,530
Right.

29
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,560
He's like me.

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,670
Honey, he's way better than you.

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,799
On top of everything,
the nuisance earns a lot of money.

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,939
Don't you want to keep him close by,
repay him for his kindness,

33
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:43,310
and be good to him until we die?

34
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,609
What an admirable young man.

35
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,480
He grew up as a lonely soul
without a father in the picture.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,219
I'd love a grandson-in-law
like Gang Ju.

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,920
Unbelievable. Dream on.

38
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,680
Do you also think I was wrong?

39
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,449
Everyone is pointing
a finger at me...

40
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,180
for not paying the tax.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,319
Is that what you also think?

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,090
No.

43
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,490
Really?

44
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:33,060
There are a lot of people
who still live a good life...

45
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,430
after committing worse crimes.

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,699
People like me.

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,530
You're the only one...

48
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,840
who hasn't been criticizing me.

49
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,800
The whole country is criticizing me.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,810
Ms. Baek, please hang in there.

51
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,210
It won't last for long.

52
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,409
You should call me
when it's too tough.

53
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,409
Can I do that?

54
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,050
We're hitting it off
all of a sudden.

55
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,620
Weren't things uncomfortable
between us?

56
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:05,620
I said all kinds of harsh things...

57
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,189
about how my son was
out of your daughter's league.

58
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,659
It's true that they're
in different leagues.

59
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,259
You weren't wrong about that.

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,430
You might feel uncomfortable
to hear this,

61
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,939
but Gang Ju and I are
like arch enemies now.

62
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,770
He doesn't feel like my son.
I don't like how he behaves.

63
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,240
He wouldn't listen to me.
He's changed a lot.

64
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,509
And he insists on
dating your daughter...

65
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:29,379
without listening to me.

66
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:30,620
To be honest,

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,819
I still don't like it.

68
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,689
How do you feel?

69
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,259
They aren't right for each other.

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,430
They should break up.

71
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,729
They shouldn't be together.

72
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,810
Sir, I just wired the money.

73
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,939
Are you kidding me?

74
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,879
You sent 10,000 dollars,
not even 100,000 dollars.

75
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,150
You know how much you owe me.

76
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,620
All your products are sold out,
and things are going so well...

77
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,919
for your company.
Why can't you send me money?

78
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:10,919
Well...

79
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,360
Can you please make
another 1,000 pieces for now?

80
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,629
We can send you the money
as soon as we sell them.

81
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,269
What did you do with the money
you already made?

82
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,300
Why do you keep asking for a favor?

83
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:25,800
I can't make your products
unless you pay me!

84
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:27,939
Sir...

85
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,449
It's hot. Let's eat.

86
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,579
Okay.

87
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:46,959
Da Rim.

88
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,629
Our suppliers are upset.

89
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,300
I understand how they're feeling.

90
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,899
The sewing factory, fabric supplier,
material supplier,

91
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,040
and even shipping company.

92
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,540
We owe them
more than one million dollars.

93
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,110
We promised to pay them
in the New Year,

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,449
but we buried all the money
in Mount Euak.

95
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,879
I'm so sorry.

96
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,220
We'll send all the money we make...

97
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,589
to the suppliers from now on.

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,329
And our products are selling well.

99
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,730
Do you think it'll keep going well?

100
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,000
If we leave them alone,

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,670
they'll end up breaking up.

102
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,439
You don't have to try too hard
to split them up.

103
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,079
It'll only make them
more affectionate to each other.

104
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,680
So you're also
against their relationship, right?

105
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:43,050
We're on the same page.

106
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,680
You won't support them, will you?

107
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,079
Don't betray me.

108
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,050
They can't be together.

109
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,519
There's no way it will work.

110
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:52,920
You'll see. They will break up.

111
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,699
I wish I knew
you'd be like this sooner.

112
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:00,569
By the way,

113
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,870
on the day
I reported my money to the police...

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,540
What are you all doing here?

115
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,180
Did something happen to you?

116
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,279
All your children were there.

117
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,149
Did something happen to you?

118
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,490
What?

119
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,649
Well...

120
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,860
Well... I...

121
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
I had a big fight...

122
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,329
with one of my customers,
so I went there.

123
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:36,129
A fight? About what?

124
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,439
He dropped off his clothes,

125
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,569
- and he said he dropped off...
- What?

126
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,910
He dropped off his clothes?

127
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:44,939
I mean,

128
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:47,110
he didn't drop off his clothes,
but he said he did.

129
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,379
I guess it was something expensive.

130
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,720
I bet it was a luxury brand.

131
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,490
A lot of dry cleaners close down
because of complaints like that.

132
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:57,689
Right.

133
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,060
What should we do with this?

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,959
- Do you want to get changed?
- No, it's okay.

135
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,329
You should get changed.

136
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,399
No, Ms. Baek. I should get going.

137
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:13,540
Will you?

138
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,810
Thank you.

139
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,519
Isn't she acting strange?

140
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:29,550
What was Ms. Ko doing here?

141
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,920
She just took off
without saying hi to you.

142
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,060
Did you tell her
to come into the house?

143
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,129
I can't do that?

144
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,199
You should go out
to receive your clothes.

145
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,300
She already delivered them
to our house.

146
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
You don't have to bring her in.

147
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,370
Why don't you just ask her
to hang the clothes in the closet...

148
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,670
or dress you?

149
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,870
My gosh.

150
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,209
I'll make sure
to pick up the clothes next time.

151
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:53,810
It's not like I will bite her.

152
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,949
I won't do anything bad to her!

153
00:07:58,779 --> 00:07:59,779
Oh, right.

154
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,250
Why did you go there?

155
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,160
Was it because of
the dry cleaning lady?

156
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,420
Where?

157
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,529
When I went to the police station
to report my money.

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Well...

159
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,129
I was with Tae Woong.

160
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,970
And he asked me for help
saying Bong Hee was there.

161
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,610
It was just a nonsense.

162
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,610
What nonsense?

163
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,209
It was a case of theft...

164
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,079
or something.

165
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,250
But she was released without charge.

166
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,620
I mean, she's been running the store
for decades.

167
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,950
She would never do things like that.

168
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,389
Well...

169
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,289
You two are saying different things.

170
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,090
It's strange.

171
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,559
- What's strange?
- What's strange?

172
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,129
The dry cleaning lady says
it was a fight...

173
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:45,759
about whether the customer
dropped off clothes or not.

174
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,299
And you say it's a case of theft.

175
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,799
It's the same thing.

176
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,299
Well...

177
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,070
The customer kept saying
that he dropped off his clothes.

178
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:56,039
And he thought it was a theft.

179
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,940
Right. So it's the same story.

180
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:03,210
I see.

181
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,750
- Yes.
- Right.

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,330

189
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,649
How audacious you are.

190
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,990
I thought you were going on a trip
or something.

191
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,500
I was going to turn myself in.

192

After turning myself in,

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,870
I was going to get a good rest
in prison.

194
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,240
Go ahead
and report me to the police.

195
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,980
I stole your ex-wife's money.

196
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,779
You report it.

197
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,649
I'm so ashamed and embarrassed
that I can't face my children.

198
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,960
And I can't face you either.

199
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,190
I can't stand this.

200
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,429
What are you raising your voice for?

201
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,399
I did something horrible,
but it has nothing to do with you.

202
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,039
Why is the dry cleaning lady
being nice to me?

But there's no money in this world
that it is okay to steal.

making me worry as well?

211

It's not like I'm causing trouble
because I want to.

212
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:37,600
I just had to lie because of you,
and it was terrifying.

213

What's the big deal
about being terrified?

214
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,970
Do you always have to feel at ease?

215
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,820
I always accused her of lying,

216
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:55,350
and that's how we got divorced.

spend the night together?

All this is because of
what you and I did.

It was the same bag.

307

Only you'd have stolen the will.

308

You don't have a fever.

309
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,009
Why did you bury the cash
in the mountain?

310
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,680
I didn't.

311
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,150
How did you know
exactly where to bury it?

312
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,059
Exactly. I'm not a thief.

313
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,920
How would I know where to bury it?

314
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,930

315
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,559

our marriage yet.

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,180
already took a hit...

359
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,420
because I arrested someone
who I had to acquit.

360
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,559

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,130
Also,
the guilty should pay the price.

363
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,900
Should I let it go and apologize...

364
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,569
when something feels off?

365
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,039
I can't do that.

366
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,470
Let's get to the bottom of this...

367
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,269
and when the truth is out...

368
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,410
What if it wasn't her?

369
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,640
If it wasn't her,
I'll apologize sincerely then...

370
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,940
to Mu Rim's family.

371
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:50,210
Don't stop me.

372
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,220
It doesn't feel right.

373
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,220
What do you both want from me?

374
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
I'm stuck between you two...

375
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,160
and you're pulling me
to either side!

376
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,190
What are you worried about?

377
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,660
Once she's proven innocent,

378
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,089
get a marriage license then.

379
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,130
It'll be over before then.
Don't worry about that.

380
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,599
Mu Rim wants us to break up.

381
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,799
Even I'd be sick of a mother-in-law
like you!

382
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,740
Da Rim, don't be
in a relationship with Gang Ju.

383
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:22,009
Don't date him.

384
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,210
Please don't tell me it's love.

385
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,119
Why not?

386
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,450
As if you don't know.

387
00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:31,720
Before you fall for him harder,

388
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:35,089
before you like him
to the point you'll get hurt,

389
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,690
we're telling you this in advance.

390
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,359
Think about your situation with him.

391
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,029
Even you must know this isn't right.

392
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,470
- Grandma.
- Yes?

393
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,700
- Grandpa.
- Yes?

394
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,339
Have you been in love?

395
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,210
Yes, of course.

396
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,880
I still love your grandma.

397
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,809
You should end it with her, then.

398
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,619
Get a divorce,
and I'll break it off with Gang Ju.

399
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,920
What? What is she saying?

401
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,059
- Allow me.
- Goodness.

402
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,630
- There.
- But...

403
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,500
I heard you were busy.
You should just head up.

404
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,440
I'll take those too.

405
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,039
- Goodness. But...
- I'll take them.

406
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,109
They're heavy.

407
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,640
Have me do
whatever requires strength...

408
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,539
and whatever Tae Woong used to do.

409
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,779
I'm no stranger.

410
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,079
- By the way, Mother,
- Yes?

411
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,150
are you free tomorrow?

412
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,490
Yes, I'll be at the store all day.
Why?

413
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,089
I'll watch the store for you...

414
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,930
while you see a dermatologist.
I got you an appointment.

415
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,359
A dermatologist? What for?

416
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:49,099
I'm going to keep living this way.

417
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:51,869
A few laser treatments
will clear the redness.

418
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:53,839
You'll look way prettier
with that gone.

419
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,710
Who does Da Rim get her beauty from?
You, of course.

420
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,240
And Da Rim's stunning.

421
00:23:59,109 --> 00:24:00,809
I won't go,
so cancel the appointment now.

422
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,819
You being like this
is uncomfortable.

423
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,819
Come on.
It's the least I can do for you.

424
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,750
It can't be canceled, so be it.

425
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,420
You're going, okay?

426
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,359
There we go.

427
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,069
How can a son
of a family that was robbed...

428
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:26,940
marry the daughter
of the family that stole?

429
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,579
What if his mother
happens to find out later on?

430
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,809
That won't happen.

431
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,380
- What?
- Listen to your grandparents.

432
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,250
We know he's a decent guy,

433
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,849
but this isn't meant to be.

434
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,930
This is where you should end things,
Da Rim.

435
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:53,400
- Grandpa.
- Yes?

436
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,700
You and Gang Ju are a lot alike.

437
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:58,099
What? How so?

438
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,069
They're both adorable.

439
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,539
What? You...

440
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,039
What do you mean he's adorable?

441
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,210
There isn't anything cute
about Man Deuk. Unbelievable.

442
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,680
He's so adorable...

443
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,819
that I want to carry him around
in my pocket.

444
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,049
Are you insane?

445
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:18,490
I want to carry Gang Ju around
in my pocket as well.

446
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:20,759
I don't want to spend
a single second away from him.

447
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,559
I want to live a happier life
with him by my side.

448
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,799
I want us to work hard
for a good life together.

449
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,299
You have no idea how lonely he gets.

450
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,799
I'll shower him
with all the love he needs and more.

451
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:33,369
There's no time to play a game...

452
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,339
of who likes who more.

453
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,309
I'll like him more than he likes me.

454
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,039
So don't ever tell Gang Ju...

455
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,950
that we should break up...

456
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,309
or we can't end up together.

457
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,779
If you hurt him,

458
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,220
I won't let it slide.

459
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:51,960
Let's see.

460
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,759
Aren't I good at this?

461
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:58,400
I learned from watching Ms. An.

462
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,670
The laundry must first be sorted
by color. Right?

463
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,369
You have better things to do
than these chores.

464
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,640
Get upstairs.

465
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,369
What's wrong with doing this?

466
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,309
I'm helping you out,
we're getting close,

467
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,339
and you'll then grow fond of me.

468
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:14,779
I've always wanted a big family.

469
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,150
Anyway,

470
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:17,809
I love doing this.

471
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,319
You crazy...

472
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,420
You can be comfortable around me.

473
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,720
- Gang Ju.
- Yes?

474
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:30,730
How can I be comfortable around you
after what I did?

475
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,269
Mother.

476
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,440
Forget about that.

477
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,369
The issue was solved.

478
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,680
We came up with the money together
and returned it.

479
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:49,380
Be at ease now.

480
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,109
There you go.

00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,220
All done.

What should I do next?

484
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,730
Head upstairs.

485
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,859
- I want to learn how to do that.
- But...

486
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,630
- Come on.
- There it goes.

487
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Da Rim, take him upstairs.

488
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:15,470
Mom, take a liking to him.

489
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,269
I'm not the only one he likes.

490
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,140
He likes how I come
from a big family.

491
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,579
He hasn't been sticking around
to brag about the money he buried.

492
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:27,750
Take half of the love
you have for me,

493
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,150
and give it to him instead.

494
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,960
Why bother being loved
by someone like me?

495
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,630
He wants to be loved.

496
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,400

- Yes.

- Yes. And now...

for everything.

Enough with the pretense

00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,900
dismiss any matters
related to Ms. Ko Bong Hee.

544
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,140
She's not a suspect,
so leave it out.

545
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,480
There's nothing to follow up on.

546
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,549
You don't have to investigate
any further.

547
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,079

eventually.

once he feels better.

554

Don't try too hard.

555

Let him spend the night elsewhere.

556
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,069

Even I'd be upset about all this.

558
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,680
Exactly.
That's why you should apologize.

559
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,250

The reason I called everyone over...

566
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:59,019
is because we must make it look like
this case never happened.

Well... Wait, Mu Rim.

585
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,529
I almost forgot. You came here...

586
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:20,769
and cuffed me the other day.

587
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:23,170
Do you think
it was caught on the CCTV?

588
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,480
I checked the footage.

589
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,509
The storage period
of the video recordings has expired,

590
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,650
so the video has been deleted.

591

a lot shorter than you think.

that Mu Rim is a cop.

And I looked closely
into Mr. Nam's case...

595
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,730
as I didn't want him
to be our accomplice.

596
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,900
Well... As for me, I think...

597
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,630
It's fine.

598
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,670
I'm in on this with you guys.

- He's so cool.
- My gosh.

Are you proud of what we did?

602
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,279
This is a nest for criminals.

603
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,659
Mr. Nam is a third party
who is not a family member,

604
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,230
but he helped to make up
for the stolen money...

605
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,760
when the crime had
already been committed,

606
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,530
so he is not guilty
under the criminal law.

607
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,360
The same goes for Mr. Seo Gang Ju.

608
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,599
The son of the owner of the money
buried the money he made himself,

609
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,539
so he's not guilty
under the criminal law.

610
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,909
It was the money he newly earned,

611
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,639
and he put it there
to make up for the damage.

612
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,480
I know it is a little late,

613

What? Yes.

619
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,880
Mind your business. Aren't you busy?

620
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,750
Are you going to a bathhouse
by yourself?

621
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,750
Yes.

622
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,679
I'm coming with you.

623
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,420
- Gosh, no.
- I'll wash your back.

624
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,949
No. It's okay.

625
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,590
- Will you wash my back too?
- What?

626
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,760
This is nice.
I wanted to take a bath. Let's go.

627
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,329
- Why are you being like this?
- Come on.

629
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:29,230
This is really nice and refreshing.

630
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,599
You're good at scrubbing.

631
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,570
The dirt and dead skin cells
were like noodles.

632
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,670
Maybe we should throw a party
with the noodles.

633
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,210
Yours were just as bad.

634
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,239
I didn't have anyone
to wash my back before.

635
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,380
Then we should throw a party
with what we got.

636
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,780
That's gross.

637
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,989
Mr. Lee, we should do this again.

638
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:51,989
Next time, I will give you...

639
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:55,019
a back massage like this.

640
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,190
No, you don't have to do that.

641
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,000
Come on.

642
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,000
I like you.

643
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,400
To be honest, you are
my second favorite after Da Rim.

644
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,340
I didn't have a dad,
so I was brought up by my grandpa.

645
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,469
I feel like I have a grandpa,
which is really nice.

646
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:14,579
All right.

647
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:16,849
So we're doing this again.

648
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,210
Okay.

649
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,150
What is going on with them?

650
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,590
Hello, Chairman Ji.

651
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,190
Hey.

652
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:34,429
I haven't seen you around
for a while.

653
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,929
I was eating with my mom.

654
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,070
Did you have dinner?

655
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:38,869
Did you eat?

656
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,309
Did you get the money?

657
00:36:50,309 --> 00:36:52,050
It's my money.
Mind your own business.

658
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,880
Since when did you care about me?

659
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,179
She's right. Stay out of it.

660
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:56,619
Mom reported to the police
to get it back.

661
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:58,250
You didn't help at all.

662
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,219
You're trying hard.

663
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,929
So when will you move out?

664
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,599
This isn't your house. It's mine.

665
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,170
I clearly returned the money.

666
00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,469
When will you move out with Gang Ju?

667
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:14,699
I'll redecorate the dressing room.

668
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,610
It's been spoiled
because of the thieves.

669
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,809
No, I'll redecorate
the interior of the whole house.

670
00:37:19,809 --> 00:37:21,380
I'll start fresh.

671
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:22,980
Will you, Mom?

672
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,050
I'll redo the kitchen
and the windows.

673
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,619
I'll remove all traces...

674
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,519
of you and the thieves.

675
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:32,250
So you all should move out.
This is my house.

676
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,190
Gang Ju, you too.

677
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,030
Don't even touch a single nail.

678
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,630
This is my house, okay?

679
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,530
If you want to redecorate a house,

680
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,329
buy one and do it there.

681
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:43,000
Though it's your house,

682
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,230
it'll be nice
to have everything renovated.

683
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,300
It'll be like a new house.

684
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,070
What?

685
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,170
If you're going
to renovate the house,

686
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,510
can you get rid
of the face sculpture?

687
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,309
I freak out every time I see it.

688
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,349
- I agree.
- Why should I get rid of it?

689
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:58,349
It's what makes this house special.

690
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,380
She's right.

691
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,320
The front door of this house
has Mom's face on it.

692
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,349
Grandpa built this house for Mom.

693
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:07,119
You should sell it back to Mom.

694
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,889
Obviously,
this house belongs to her.

695
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,389
You disrespectful brat.

696
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:13,300
Father,
maybe we should just move out.

697
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,329
No, we can't do that.

698
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:17,829
We might end up
living together forever.

699
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:19,199
Why don't we just live together?

700
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,369
It'll be nice and noisy.

701
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,000
In harmony. What do you think, Mom?

702
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,539
Don't you like it, Father?

703
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,239
Wouldn't it be better...

704
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,840
than living alone with Tae Woong,
who's awfully quiet?

705
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,320
He's not fun.

706
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,909
Tae Woong suggested it.

707
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,079
We want to take over your company.

708
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:02,880
What do you think?

709
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,750
What will be the price?

710
00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:13,320
Gang Ju,
you've become a real businessman.

711
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,030
You should offer the price first.

712
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,730
It is not right
to tell me the price...

713
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,900
after talking about
all other conditions.

714
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,030
Let me make this clear.

715
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,369
We are drowning in debt now.

716
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
We're in the red.

717
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,570
As you know, we buried
four million dollars in Mount Euak,

718
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,340
which was what we had made.

719
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,079
Our suppliers are pressing us
for payment.

720
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,380
The sewing factory,

721
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,179
fabric supplier,
and material supplier.

722
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:40,920
We owe them
about 1.4 million dollars.

723
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,019
And we should pay the taxes.

724
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:43,949
There's a deficit
of two million dollars.

725
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,719
We have a lot of problems
to take care of.

726
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,889
Taking it over is not a good idea.

727
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,559
Good job.

728
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,260
You buried the money without
considering the consequences.

729
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,730
That makes you look like
a good businessman.

730
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,730
That's excellent.

731
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,300
Why are you praising me?

732
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,340
Thank you.

733
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,400
I see you differently now.

734
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,179
I will have the amounts
deducted from the price.

735
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:10,610
You want a discount?

736
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,650
You fool.

737
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,920
Keep your private matters
and business separate.

738
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,989
I'll let you use
one manufacturing line.

739
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:21,159
I want you to make the most...

740
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,460
out of Design Director Lee's work
without worrying about money.

741
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:26,960
I want to do things right.
I'm offering my cooperation.

742
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,070
Okay.

743
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:36,739
Good.

744
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,840
Let's chant together.

745
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,710
Let's chant,
"Go, Seogang and Jiseung!"

746
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,710
Do you do things like this?

747
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,809
Come on. Put your hand on here.

748
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,750
- Me?
- It was your idea.

749
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,719
- Hurry and do it.
- Okay.

750
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,150
Seogang and Jiseung. Let's go.

751
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,289
Let's do this.

752
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,059
Oh, right. Yesterday,

753
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:59,090
I attended Da Rim's family meeting.

754
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,159
And you weren't there.
You weren't invited, were you?

755
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,670
I attended the family meeting,

756
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,369
and you weren't there.

757
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,809
I'll get going then.

758
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:16,349
By the way, is Bong Hee doing well?

759
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,579
No. You know what she's like.

760
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,179
All right then.

do I have to live like this?

764
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,469
You fools.

00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:49,070
"Ms. Ji Yeon?"

767
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,869
I heard you dug up Mount Euak...

768
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,079
to find my money.

Is this Yang Gil Soon?

773
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,929
This wild boar...

774
00:43:11,929 --> 00:43:14,099
took my ten million dollars?

775
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,659
Stay still!

776
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:29,750
Calm down, Ms. Ji Yeon.

777
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,610
You lot. You were going to find...

778
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,320
my money and keep it,
you rotten scum!

779
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,519
No, ma'am. We had no idea.

780
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,260
We found out
only after we got Gil Soon's text.

781
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,159
Yes, but it wasn't there. That's it.

782
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,230
We didn't do anything.

783
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,329
We looked and were going to tell you
if we found the money.

784
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,199
Would you believe that
if you were me?

785
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:51,130
I'll make you pay for this.

786
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,599
Darn you.

787
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,409
Darn it.

788
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,710
To think that I asked...

789
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,750
thieves like you
to look for my money.

790
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:05,909
Darn it.

791
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:09,119
We did more than enough, okay?

792
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,690
Did you think
we'd be your servants forever?

793
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,260
Hey. You lost all sense of reality
because we were polite to you.

794
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:18,559
We groveled to you
when White Bear was alive.

795
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
You're not our mistress forever.

796
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,570
You put us to work
without paying us a dime.

797
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,440
Right. Hand over what you owe us.

798
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,699
What do I owe you? What did you do?

799
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,269
I was the one who called the police
who found the money.

800
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:34,210
You made us work for months
free of charge.

801
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,409
You should pay us for our efforts!

802
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,449
Do you know how much we did...

803
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,119
to find that money?

804
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,550
That punk Gang Ju...

805
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,750
told us to stop looking!

806
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,460
Why take it out on us?

807
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,329

- I should just...
- Darn you.

- You heard the man.
- Get out of here.

812

- Go.
- Get lost!

815

Not only did he betray me,

816
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,260
he dared to threaten me too?

817
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,400
My gosh.

818
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,840
- I'll take that.
- What?

819
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,510
What's he doing?

820
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,070
Take just five.

821
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,440
Why is he helping that family?

822
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,579
- Isn't it heavy? I'll take it all.
- Is he...

- I'm really fine.

834
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,610

You don't have to try too hard
to split them up.

839

It'll only make them
more affectionate to each other.

Thank you so much.

848
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,230
I decided to do business with you...

849
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,670
because of your high interest rates,
and I did some research.

850
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:14,300
I found something that bothers me.

- While working here,

856
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,090
he doubles as a loan shark too.

857
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,690
Is that allowed?

858
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,619

00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:41,719
You don't like sour foods?

897
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:44,320
I hate sour things.

898
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,360
- That's so sour.
- I didn't know.

899
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,860
- My gosh.
- Eat this, then.

900
00:49:50,389 --> 00:49:51,989
- Open up.
- No.

901
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:54,730
Come on.

902
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,929
It's sweet, this one.

903
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:00,969
- It's sweet?
- Like sugar.

904
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,469
- Is it really?
- It's crazy sweet.

905
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:05,469
It'll make your teeth rot.

906
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,179
- Isn't that sweet?
- Goodness.

907
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:11,949
Sour things are good for you.

908
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:14,150
Darn you. Seo Gang Ju!

909
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,050
Seriously, you fool.

910
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,090
Does Gang Ju...

911
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,760
peel tangerines for you too?

912
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,190
That punk.

913
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,500
He's being nice to the wrong person.

914
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,199
His own mom's like this.

915
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:35,670
Why are you getting so upset
about that?

916
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,840
He's close to inheriting
the dry cleaner's.

917
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,610
What do you mean by that?

918
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,010
He can not only
operate the machines,

919
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:46,110
but has been ironing clothes
and making delivery runs.

920
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,150
He spends time
with Bong Hee when he can...

921
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,989
and has been like a son to her.

922
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:51,019
What?

923
00:50:51,019 --> 00:50:52,389
He went to the bathhouse
with Da Rim's grandfather...

924
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:53,719
and scrubbed his back.

925
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,960
He peeled roasted sweet potatoes
for Da Rim's grandma.

926
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,460
He even gave them piggyback rides
on a snowy day.

927
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,130
Also, he booked an appointment
with a dermatologist...

928
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,030
to reduce the redness
on Bong Hee's skin.

929
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,699
She was adamant about not going.

930
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,969
They used to hate his guts
calling him a nuisance,

931
00:51:12,909 --> 00:51:15,639
but now they're as thick as thieves.

932
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Maybe...

933
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:21,050
something happened between them
I didn't know about.

934
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,789
That darn brat.

935
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,489
By the way, did you get your money?

936
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,889
No.

937
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,230
Even though the money
is clearly mine,

938
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,460
the police won't hand it over.

939
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,170
What could prove
that the money's yours?

940
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:41,039
The notes don't have your seal
or your name on them.

941
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,469
There's definitive proof.

942
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:46,809
All the notes have serial numbers
that begin with AA...

943
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:48,079
That reminds me.

944
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:51,409
Do you remember the money
you gave me?

945
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
What?

946
00:51:53,179 --> 00:51:56,150
The money I asked you about
at the wedding.

947
00:51:57,289 --> 00:51:58,989
Are you sure it was from a customer?

948
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:01,059
Oh, that?

949
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,230
I lied about it
because Gi Dung was also there.

950
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:07,059
You see,

951
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:09,030
Bong Hee gave it to me
to thank me for the meat.

952
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,199
We've been generous over the years.

953
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,039
She gave me that money
to thank me for our generosity.

954
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:18,739
It was 1,000 dollars in total
only in 50-dollar bills.

955
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,739
Was it from Ko Bong Hee?

956
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,949
She gave you 1,000 dollars
in those 50-dollar bills?

957
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,519
Yes. Why?

958
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:31,690
It's nothing.

959
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,659
Hae Ja, thanks for the meal.

960
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,289
(Lawyer Kang)

961
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:38,889
I'll get going.

962
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,429
Sure.

963
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:43,269
Come by whenever
you need someone to eat with.

964
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:48,570
Mr. Kang, it's me.

965
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:55,679
Ko Bong Hee was arrested
and interrogated.

966
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,150
She was released during the night
after the charges were dropped,

967
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,519
and no one will tell me
what she was questioned about.

968
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,079
During the night?

969
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,489
When exactly?

970
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:10,260
Was it after I got back
from Mount Euak with my money?

971
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,429
Chief Yun had her released
after she got back...

972
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:14,030
from Mount Euak.

973
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,429
Mr. Kang, hold on.

974
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:20,500
Once my money turned up,

975
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,940
Ko Bong Hee was released
from police custody.

976
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,780
Ko Bong Hee at the dry cleaner's...

977
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,480
had 1,000 dollars in 50-dollar bills
with the serial number AA.

978
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:34,019
Gang Ju stole my will...

979
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,119
and buried it in the mountain
with money...

980
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:38,150
that had the serial number AA.

981
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,019
No way.

982
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,289
He couldn't have.

983
00:53:46,329 --> 00:53:47,329
Gang Ju,

984
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,500
being blinded by his love
for Ms. Lee or whatnot,

985
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,500
took action...

986
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,139
when Ko Bong Hee was arrested...

987
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:58,269
and took back the money
he had brought me...

988
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,840
so that he could bury it
in Mount Euak again?

989
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,110
To release her from police custody?

990
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:09,349
That's insane, right?

991
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,090
That reminds me.

992
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,460
Gang Ju had Lawyer Seo
represent her.

993
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,559
Why get her a fancy lawyer...

994
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,329
when she wasn't accused
of anything serious?

995
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,960
(Enter passcode)

996
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,079
(Fingerprint doesn't match.)

997
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,789
(Fingerprint doesn't match.)

998
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:23,559
No, come on.

999
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:26,030
Stop that.

1000
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,630
Which finger did he have scanned?

1001
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,449
(Fingerprint doesn't match.)

1002
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,750
There.

1003
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,829
Why scan a finger on his right hand
when he's a lefty?

1004
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:03,199
(Messages)

1005
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:06,070
I came to my mom's after getting
the rest in 50-dollar bills...

1006
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:07,170
to make up
the entire ten million dollars.

1007
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,170
It's over now.

1008
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:11,340
Both our moms can sleep with ease.

1009
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:13,039
I'll be in touch.

1010
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:15,880
What...

1011
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,210
What is this?

1012
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:21,280
What on earth?

1013
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,880
Who is it?

1014
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:58,019
What's this?

1015
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:00,820
(Both our moms can sleep with ease.
I'll be in touch.)

1016
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:17,039
Darn it.

1017
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:20,710
Mom, wait!

1018
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,679
No...

1019
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,250
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

1020
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:31,650
Mom, please.

1021
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:33,289
Please.

1022
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:35,389
(Calling: Mom)

1023
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,530
Please pick up.

1024
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,340
Mom!

1025
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,409
Let go of me.

1026
00:57:55,179 --> 00:57:56,409
How could you do this to me?

1027
00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,010
You said you had no idea.
You denied knowing anything!

1028
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:01,949
Mom...

1029
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,480
I gave you enough time
to come clean,

1030
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:06,719
but rather than me,

1031
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:10,659
you only cared for those
at the dry cleaner's.

1032
00:58:12,829 --> 00:58:13,829
You're...

1033
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:16,800
no longer my son.

1034
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:18,269
Please.

1035
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:22,969
Even when people
threw persimmons at me,

1036
00:58:22,969 --> 00:58:25,210
hollered insults,
pointed their fingers at me,

1037
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:29,210
and spoke ill about me
when they didn't even know me,

1038
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,809
I didn't feel like dying.

1039
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,519
I guess I'm being punished.

1040
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:39,619
Mom, please.

1041
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:41,519
Losing my own son.

1042
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,090
That's my punishment.

1043
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:47,559
Mom.

1044
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:50,300
Only she was able to sleep in peace.

1045
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,170
You saved that woman...

1046
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:00,679
while killing me in the process!

1047
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,780
I'll have you, that woman,

1048
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:08,280
the daughter, and that whole family
behind bars.

1049
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,590
Live your life
with that family you love dearly.

1050
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:15,119
I'll think...

1051
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,230
I never had a son.

1052
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:24,900
Got it?

1053
00:59:26,969 --> 00:59:27,969
I'm sorry.

1054
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:31,239
I'm sorry.

1055
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:35,239
You're sorry?

1056
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:36,949
I don't know...

1057
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:41,079
how I can make this up to you.

1058
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,219
Yes, you do.

1059
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:45,989
Live with that family you love.

1060
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:49,889
Ms. Baek?

1061
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:56,730
What brings you by at this hour?

1062
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,670
- I have something to show you.
- Mom.

1063
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,670
Mom, please.

1064
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:02,800
Which is?

1065
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,739
Please.

1066
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,380
Let go.

1067
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:11,550
What is all this? What's going on?

1068
01:00:12,849 --> 01:00:14,449
It's about my money.

1069
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,480
I'll end things.

1070
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:19,650
I'll break up with her.

1071
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,260
What a joke.

1072
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,289
Your words mean nothing to me.

1073
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,460
I'll sever...

1074
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,170
all ties with that family.

1075
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:36,900
They won't be in my life.

1076
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,469
Please.

1077
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:41,610
Please.

1078
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,849
What about the money?

1079
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:48,250
What is it? Is there more to it?

1080
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,119
We'll break up.

1081
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:54,559
I promise.

1082
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,230
We'll break up.

1083
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,789
My money.

1084
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:05,400
When can I get it back?

1085
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,969
What's taking so long?

1086
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,039
You came here this late to ask that?

1087
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:16,409
You won't stop at anything
to get your money.

1088
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:19,949
Go home and wait. We'll call you.

1089
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,320
Goodness.

1090
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:31,590
Thank you.

1091
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:33,289
Don't be mistaken.

1092
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,199
I can always change my mind.

1093
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,929
I'll break up with Da Rim.

1094
01:01:41,539 --> 01:01:43,070
I'll stay away
from the dry cleaner's.

1095
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,880
I'll cut ties with that family.

1096
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,579
I promise.

1097
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:54,880
I'll keep an eye on you.

1098
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:05,210
(Iron Family)

1099
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:07,219
- Why did you lie?
- Will you report it?

1100
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,449
I get it.

1101
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:11,389
Are you afraid I'll report
your girlfriend Ko Bong Hee?

1102
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:12,420
Forgive me.

1103
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,360
I'll make it up to you
for the rest of my life.

1104
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,659
Hey! Did you get my son-in-law...

1105
01:04:16,659 --> 01:04:18,260
to help you bury the cash
in the mountain?

1106
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,030
Let's break up.
