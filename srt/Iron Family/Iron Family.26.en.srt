00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,810
(Episode 26)

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:03,839
Mr. Kim,

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,839
where are you
in the search for my money?

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,080
Why haven't you been in touch?

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,880
Didn't Gang Ju talk to you?

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,179
About what?

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,949
He told us
not to look for the money.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,650
What?

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,190
I'm busy and will hang up.

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,730
Are you kidding me?

11
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,800
Talk about rotten luck.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,100
I told you not to take her call.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,340
You should just cut her dead.

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,969
I lost my appetite.

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,210
How dare they?

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,149
How dare they?

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,979
Darn.

18
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,359
Hold on. Let me help.

19
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,799
You're getting a call.

20
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:02,929
I'll do this, so answer your phone.

21
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,439
No, I can get it later on.

22
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,640
Whoever it is won't stop calling.

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,409
I'm sure they'll give up.

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,739
Who's even calling
at this late hour?

25
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:13,510
It could be the owner
of the sewing factory.

26
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,379
What if it's to decline
our additional order?

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,420
(Mom)

28
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,319
It's your mom.

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,049
Forget it. I'll call her later.

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,689
Goodness.

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,390
Exactly!
Is it right for you to covet my son,

32
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,930
whom I raised to be a fine man?

33
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:33,060
- It's wrong.
- It's wrong, Ms. Lee.

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,209
That brat.
He's not picking up again!

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,209
Unbelievable.

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,049
(Love Capital)

37
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,219
The fact that we couldn't find it...

38
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,549
only means someone else took it.

39
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:55,549
Don't you agree?

40
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,959
Who?

41
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,689
The only suspects we have
are at the dry cleaner's.

42
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,019
Who at the dry cleaner's?

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:02,090
The two elders in their 90s...

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,700
or the cop son?

45
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,260
One of the daughters
lives elsewhere,

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,300
the other daughter was blind
at the time,

47
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,030
and the part-timer isn't family.

48
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,639
Well, then that leaves the mother.

49
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,340
Think about 10 million dollars
in 50-dollar bills.

50
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,509
That would weigh more than 100kg.

51
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,080
Don't forget the weight
of the suitcase.

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,680
A woman in her 50s
couldn't carry that alone.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,849
Why not?

54
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,819
Middle-aged Korean ladies
are strong!

55
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,819
What?

56
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,560
There's an aunt in the picture.

57
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,590
She's pretty
and on the younger side.

58
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,830
Could it have been those two women?

59
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,830
Did they carry it down together?

60
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,960
They would've dragged the suitcase,
not carry it.

61
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,500
It probably had wheels!

62
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,699
- Right.
- Right.

63
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,069
Unbelievable.

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,669
My goodness.

65
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,680
(Delete?)

66
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,729
Out of the ten million dollars
we dug up,

67
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,469
the nuisance in the rooftop unit
burned three million.

68
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:21,139
We spent 800,000 dollars
on Da Rim's eye surgery,

69
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,310
so that leaves us
with 6.2 million dollars.

70
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,680
We gave 100,000 dollars to Mu Rim
on his wedding day,

71
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,250
but he gave us all of it back.

72
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,319
That means we should have
close to 6.2 million dollars left.

73
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,349
But what we have...

74
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,889
barely adds up
to 5.2 million dollars.

75
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,990
Are you saying Mi Yeon took
nearly a million dollars?

76
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,659
My gosh.

77
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:46,900
How is your daughter this brazen,
Man Deuk?

78
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,830
It doesn't look like
our daughter's afraid of the law.

79
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:53,300
I get how she can be ignorant
of the law,

80
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,740
but she stole the money...

81
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,310
by replacing it with law books.

82
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,550
Gosh, that little thief.

83
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,150
How much is she going to steal?

84
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,949
My goodness. Is she planning...

85
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,520
to take everything we have
little by little?

86
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,480
Even if we're questioned
about this money,

87
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,819
it'll be after Da Rim
regains her sight.

88
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,589
They won't make her go blind again.

89
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,589
She regained her sight
through surgery,

90
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,560
so it's not like
they can take it away.

91
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,029
All we need is
for Da Rim to see again.

92
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:24,860
- Right.
- Of course!

93
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,000
- So get digging.
- Sure.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,269
- Is your mouth the shovel?
- Fine.

95
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,839
Can you just scrape off
the top here?

96
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,939
Mother, where is it?

97
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,139
It's over here.

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,990
Hey. Goodness me.

99
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,019
Hold on.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Bong Hee, you look concerned.

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,389
What? Is something up, Bong Hee?

102
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:00,160
We might get caught
for stealing that money.

103
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,769
By none other than Mu Rim
who's a cop.

104
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,170
What do we do, Mother, Father?

105
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,740
What?

106
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,939
That can't be it, right?

107
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,639
The button came off, and that's it.

108
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,509
The button...

109
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,620
What is it?

110
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,290
It'll be nothing, right?

111
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,189
Have you taken your medicine?

112
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,699
- What?
- What? I'm not sure.

113
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,459
Did we or didn't we?

114
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,699
Didn't we take them?
I can't be sure.

115
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,410
I left these out
on the dining table...

116
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,579
so that you could take them
after having dinner.

117
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,480
I don't have high blood pressure,
nor am I diabetic,

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,189
so I'll probably die confused...

119
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:56,449
about whether or not I took
my medicine, Bong Hee.

120
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,790
How can you joke about that?

121
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:01,990
Remembering if we took
our medicine or not...

122
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,759
after meals?

123
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,959
You have no idea
how confusing it gets.

124
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,300
We just can't remember.

125
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,839
Even in death,

126
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,639
we might not even know
that we're actually dead.

127
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,139
We're taking so many pills...

128
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,410
that it's hard to tell
if we're alive or not.

129
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,819
- Right?
- Goodness.

130
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,220
You keep on forgetting
because you rely on me to remember.

131
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,389
Whatever.

132
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,519
We can take
whatever you have us take, right?

133
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,189
What about when I'm not around?

134
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,790
Don't rely on me like this.

135
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,930
Even if you serve me poison,

136
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,029
I won't question it at all, take it,

137
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,970
and die.

138
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,439
I still wouldn't regret it.

139
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,269
What?

140
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:51,110
Even if you don't give us medicine
and lie that we've taken them...

141
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:54,449
in the hope
that we finally drop dead,

142
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,519
I wouldn't doubt you for a second.

143
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,519
I'll continue to trust you.

144
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,389
Don't trust me.

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,589
Then who can we trust?

146
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:10,160
Who are we supposed to trust
if not you?

147
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,459
You have your daughter.

148
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,300
- Mi Yeon?
- Mi Yeon?

149
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,399
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

150
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:19,670
I wouldn't trust her words...

151
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,610
even if she said she made
red bean porridge with red beans.

152
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,079
I wouldn't believe her
even if she said she made...

153
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,410
pumpkin porridge with pumpkin.

154
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:29,709
Don't be like that.

155
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,819
After the divorce,
she's been living a straight life...

156
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,279
working at the barbecue place.

157
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,549
- As if.
- My gosh.

158
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,690
Take your meds.

159
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,690
Here you go.

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,419
Why did you want to see me?

161
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,820
Why have you been avoiding me...

162
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,990
and even avoiding eye contact
lately?

163
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,000
I have nothing to say.

164
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,700
I'm sorry...

165
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:27,840
about before.

166
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:30,539
I, too,

167
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,110
will follow my heart.

168
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,850
Where does it lead
if you follow your heart?

169
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,789
Can I follow my heart?

170
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,289
Go ahead and do it.

171
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,399
I'm hungry.
Why don't we order some food?

172
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,629
Aren't you going home?

173
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,570
I don't think we can finish this
even if we work all night.

174
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,809
I can do the rest.

175
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,039
You have work tomorrow. Go home.

176
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,779
- I don't want to go home.
- Go.

177
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,649
I don't want to leave.

178
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:10,580
Do you want to stay with me?

179
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:28,669
I should get going.

180
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,039
You said you'd give me
a proper one next time.

181
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,470
When will you do that?

182
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,039
When did I say that?

183
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,809
Look how you speak
with a forked tongue.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,409
It's you who started it first.

185
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,519
You made me suffer for eight years.

186
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,590
I'm getting back at you.

187
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,620
Junior Staffer Lee.

188
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,059
What? Can't I?

189
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,820
Da Rim.

190
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:55,360
I couldn't delete your number
for eight years.

191
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,730
I feel wronged that I held on
to the hope you might call me.

192
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,899
So I'll do the same
and torment you with false hope.

193
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:02,570
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,100
You coward.

195
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,799
It's my fault.

196
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:07,509
It's easy for you to say.

197
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,580
I'll stick to you like this
and torment you.

198
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,840
It'll be tough and painful, right?

199
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,679
It'll drive you crazy.

200
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,980
Are you a pervert or a lunatic?

201
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,789
I don't know. Just get back to work.

202
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,059
We should make money quickly.

203
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,559
Oh, right. And you should answer...

204
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,190
your mom's calls
no matter what happens.

205
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,200
You're supposed to answer her calls
under any circumstances.

206
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
My gosh.

207
00:11:57,789 --> 00:11:58,820
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,029
Well...

209
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,399
I've been holding myself back
for a long time.

210
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,429
So I was being hasty.

211
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
What?

212
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:22,480
Nothing.

213
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,750
What is it?

214
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,929
I've been fooled by men
my whole life.

215
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,529
I'll quit,
so you should find someone new.

216
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,169
I'll go far away.

217
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:49,570
Mi Yeon.

218
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,879
You can come with me if you want.

219
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,980
If you're not that serious,
it's fine.

220
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,360
Leaving Bom
and my mother-in-law behind?

221
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:50,029
I, Baek Woong,
who lives at 153 Cheonglyeom-dong,

222
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,870
Cheonglyeom-gu, Seoul,

223
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,210
leave my only daughter...

224
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,009
Baek Ji Yeon
ten million dollars in cash.

225
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:02,149
If you keep this money
in the safe...

226
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,850
for 15 years after my death,

227
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,950
not tell anyone about it,

228
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,350
and not spend a single cent,
then after 15 years,

229
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,490
it will be yours
and you won't have to pay...

230
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,860
a single cent of tax on it.

231
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,159
That's how the tax law works.

232
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:49,330
After midnight on December 31, 2024,
which is the 15th year,

233
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,700
it will all be your money
without paying any tax.

234
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,649
Starting January 1, 2025,

235
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,490
even if the whole nation finds out
about the tax you evaded,

236
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,320
they won't be able to ask you
to pay taxes...

237
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,230
or hold you accountable for that.
Do you understand?

238
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:52,960
Hey.

239
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,759
You're home late.

240
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,730
Yes.

241
00:16:08,409 --> 00:16:10,440
(35 Buja-ro, 2 na-gil)

242
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,149
You're home late.
Did you just get here?

243
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:25,960
Go upstairs.

244
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,759
- Okay.
- Okay.

245
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,460
Aren't you being rude?

246
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,200
Won't you say hello to me?

247
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,899
I'm Cha Tae Woong.

248
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,840
Cha Tae Woong.

249
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,870
I guess he hasn't changed
your family name yet.

250
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,539
You got the director position
at the company,

251
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:46,679
and you're his biological son,
but your family name is still Cha.

252
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,279
- Go upstairs.
- You even sound your own son out?

253
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,179
About giving him your family name.

254
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,829
This isn't your house anymore.
Get out.

255
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,240
Sit. We need to talk.

256
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,210
You always tell me to sit,
don't you?

257
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,839
You always have something
to say to me, don't you?

258
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,009
- I don't want to sit.
- I won't eat him up.

259
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,319
"Go upstairs."

260
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,890
How sweet. What a kind father.

261
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,019
What is it you want to say?

262
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,799
Here's the money
you paid for this house.

263
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,170
I'm returning it.
I'm not selling this house.

264
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,240
- Why not?
- Do you really not know?

265
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,839
I really don't know. Why?

266
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,339
Are you serious?

267
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:52,339
I seriously don't know. Why?

268
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,049
Don't pretend you don't know,
you hypocrite!

269
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,420
I seriously don't know,
so I'm asking. Why?

270
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,049
What?

271
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,420
I'm asking because the whole thing
doesn't make any sense to me! Why?

272
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,059
I'm asking
because I've never seen...

273
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,289
anyone so ridiculous like you. Why?

274
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,269
I didn't know you'd live here
with your biological son.

275
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,769
Is that why you bought this house?

276
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
This is why you kicked me
and Gang Ju out so hurriedly.

277
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,970
So you could do things like this!

278
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,880
You bought this house
in the name of alimony,

279
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,140
pretending to do it
for me and Gang Ju?

280
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,380
If I'd known what you were up to,
I would've pulled out all your hair!

281
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,150
I would've brought you down
a peg or two!

282
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,549
I would've ripped off
those arrogant cheeks...

283
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,859
and evil lips of yours!

284
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,559
How would you rip off my lips?
Will you do it like this?

285
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,759
Do you think I'm a lump
of scrap metal or something?

286
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,460
Sell this house to me!

287
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:48,470
I'm returning the money!

288
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,069
Why is everything so easy and simple
to you like this?

289
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,309
Just take this money and move out
with your son upstairs.

290
00:18:55,309 --> 00:18:57,240
Find a new place to live in!

291
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:00,380
I'll give you some time to find it.
So hurry and move out!

292
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,579
I can accept everything else.

293
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,980
But this is a house
that my father built for me.

294
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,990
I can never let you live here
with your own son!

295
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,589
I can't let it happen!

296
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,359
You had a son with someone else.

297
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,759
And you betrayed me and Gang Ju
because of the son.

298
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,259
I never betrayed you!

299
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,329
Gosh. Just because
you had some money to spend,

300
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,099
you bought this house
in the name of alimony...

301
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:24,130
pretending to be so generous.
Why didn't I see this coming?

302
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,470
I was so stupid...

303
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:27,910
that I couldn't see through
your deep, sinister mind...

304
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,569
that was twisted like colons...

305
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,509
reeking of poop.

306
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:33,380
It's my greatest regret!

307
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,250
What? I smell of poop? Turd?

308
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,680
What turd?

309
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,880
Did you ever smell my turds?

310
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,319
How low will you go?
What is the matter with you?

311
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,420
Darn you! What the heck?

312
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,559
What?

313
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,930
You still have...

314
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,240
feelings for me, don't you?

315
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,099
You're not completely over me,
are you?

316
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:03,269
Do you want to take back
the divorce?

317
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:05,509
Is the house an excuse?

318
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,009
Do you want to get back with me?

319
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,009
Are you crazy?

320
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,750
You think too much of yourself,
and your pride is way too big!

321
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,220
What? I think too much of myself?

322
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,690
Too much? Do I?

323
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,160
You made me
well and truly sick of you today!

324
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,490
I'm going to stay here. Take this.

325
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,029
I won't take it!

326
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,329
You sold it when you wanted to,

327
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,369
but you can't buy it back
just like that!

328
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,970
You can't, okay?

329
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,210
You packed up and left
when you wanted,

330
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,970
but you can't move in
just like this!

331
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,039
You can't!

332
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,210
Take this.

333
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,480
I won't take it!

334
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,789
For...

335
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,259
fifteen long years,

336
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,990
I put up with your whims,
and it came to this.

337
00:20:58,329 --> 00:20:59,799
I won't put up with it...

338
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:02,400
any longer.

339
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,269
Never!

340
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,519
Don't you have
anything to say to me?

341
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,589
Are you done fighting?

342
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,329
I'll keep on fighting
until you both leave.

343
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,230
Ask him to move out with you.

344
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,930
If Father wishes to leave,

345
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,769
I'll follow him without complaint.

346
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,170
"Father?"

347
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:43,609
"Father?"

348
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
Oh, dear.

349
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,640
I didn't know that's what I'd said.

350
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,650
I apologize.

351
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,309
Don't pretend to be sweet.

352
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,720
It makes me feel worse.

353
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,920
Say whatever you want to.

354
00:21:58,589 --> 00:21:59,789
It's fine even if it's vulgar.

355
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:01,789
Okay.

356
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,190
"Okay?"

357
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:06,529
Did you have to answer like that?

358
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,839
Does this mean
you don't want to leave...

359
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,339
on your own accord?

360
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,869
Fine.

361
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,640
By the way,

362
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:20,980
Seo Gang Ju...

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,210
is staying in my rooftop unit.

364
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,720
He wanted to swap with me.

365
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:42,829
Take a seat.

366
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

367
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,000
Goodness.

368
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:50,309
That was humiliating.

369
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,220
Father.

370
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,619
I said it once already,

371
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:06,789
and it made it easier.

372
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:11,960
If I'm getting in the way,

373
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,599
I'll leave.

374
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,369
Why should you leave?

375
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,440
She might get sick of this...

376
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:22,140
and leave again tomorrow.

377
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,210
It felt like
people actually lived here.

378
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,009
It was nice.

379
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:36,650
Was it?

380
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,089
This was the first time
we fought so fiercely.

381
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,900
I'm not alone now.

382
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,930
I found myself...

383
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,630
talking right back at her.

384
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,900
Gosh, my throat hurts now.

385
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,180
Thank you.

386
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,279
Hey.

387
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,089
How about I ask her to live with us?

388
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,829
Thanks to her,

389
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,259
it looks like we talked enough...

390
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:20,700
to last us a year.

391
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:28,640
Oh, my gosh.

392
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:31,440
- Are you okay?
- My throat hurts.

393
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,339
It hurts a lot.

394
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:37,880
Oh, dear.

395
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,119
(New order alert)

396
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:44,650
If you'd listened to me
and sold them for 60 dollars,

397
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,220
we'd have made
tens of thousands by now.

398
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,990
Money and dollars.

399
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,829
That's all you talk about, isn't it?

400
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,730
We want happy customers...

401
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,660
who will be willing to come back.

402
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,569
Money doesn't come first.

403
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:59,039
We must build trust to earn more.

404
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,069
Whatever.

405
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,839
You're bragging
when we're barely breaking even.

406
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,369
We don't even have a designer.

407
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
Who's that?

408
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,009
Is it Mom? Or Grandma or Grandpa?

409
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,980
I came straight over after work.

410
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,549
They won't know I'm here.

411
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:15,950
Shall I hide?

412
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,049
Why would you hide?

413
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,490
We're not guilty of anything.

414
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,930
Where should I hide?

415
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,329
Where should I go? What now?

416
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:25,900
We didn't do anything bad.

417
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,029
Hiding is too much.

418
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:28,769
That was barely a kiss.

419
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:30,170
Hiding is extravagant.

420
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,269
We're adults,
and we didn't do anything.

421
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,970
Why hide as if we did something?

422
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,410
That's just not fair.

423
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,539
Stay out here.

424
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,509
- Hey.
- Get out of the way.

425
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:40,509
Okay.

426
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:49,990
Let go.

427
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Hey.

428
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,589
Mom, let's talk downstairs.
Come with me.

429
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,789
You're acting weird.

430
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,559
Let's go downstairs.

431
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,269
I don't want to. I feel cold.

432
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,400
- Should I just stand here?
- Yes.

433
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,470
No. We can go downstairs.

434
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,569
Get out of the way.

435
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,710
Mom. You can't...

436
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,650
What is this mess?

437
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,849
It's like a bomb hit.

438
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,690
You didn't have to come in and look.

439
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,160
There's nowhere to sit.

440
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,259
Why are you here?

441
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,930
Why didn't you take my calls?

442
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,000
Did I have to hear
where you lived...

443
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,359
from Cha Tae Woong?

444
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:36,769
Did I have to hear
from someone else...

445
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,569
what you were doing
in this shabby room?

446
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:40,740
Come home with me.

447
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,069
We don't have a home.

448
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,009
I'm moving back in.

449
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,609
We can just barge in.

450
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:47,180
Isn't that what communists do?

451
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,680
I'll move back.

452
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,450
I returned the money
from the house to Ji Seung Don.

453
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,650
Mom.

454
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,319
By the way,

455
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,190
did you tell Kim Sung Hoon
to stop looking for my money?

456
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,019
You didn't even get my permission.

457
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,259
Who are you to tell me
I shouldn't look for my money?

458
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,230
I'm doing my best
to locate your money.

459
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,960
I'll get it back for you somehow.

460
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,970
Don't worry.

461
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,230
Forget it. There's no one
in this world I can trust.

462
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,240
Who can I trust
when my own son's like this?

463
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,569
I will officially report it
on January 1.

464
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,880
I was going to do
things elegantly...

465
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,880
without getting slandered.

466
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,450
What if I were to tell the police
I lost ten million dollars?

467
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,720
It's a massive amount.

468
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,750
They'd froth at the mouth
just thinking about finding it.

469
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,990
They can move way more efficiently
than some back-alley thugs.

470
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,789
They'll find the cash in no time.

471
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,289
Mom.

472
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,730
I'll become trash
who waited to report the theft...

473
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,069
until January 1 to avoid paying tax.

474
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,500
The tax deadline
for the ten million...

475
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,900
ends this December 31.

476
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:48,910
From January 1 onward,

477
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,309
even if the whole country knows
I didn't pay taxes,

478
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,640
they can't make me pay
a single cent.

479
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,980
You'll be too embarrassed
to show yourself in public.

480
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,309
Should I give up the money for that?

481
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,079
You can't live in this country
anymore.

482
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,089
I'll put up with all the curses
people throw at me.

483

Mom.

484
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,259
I gave all I had...

485
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:09,329
to Ji Seung Don to move back in.

486
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:10,529
We're penniless now.

487
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,299
If we're to make a living,
we must call the police...

488
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:14,829
and get the money back.

489
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,700
Once I get it back,

490
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,440
I'll let you do all you want,
darling.

491
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,670
You can make movies
or run a business.

492
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,509
You won't have to tiptoe
around Ji Seung Don anymore.

493
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:26,440
I'll let you do anything.

494
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,079
So this stuff.

495
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,480
Instead of doing this
for small change,

496
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,819
move back into my house.

497
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,390
Got it?

498
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,119
I'll get going.

499
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,720
But...

500
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:50,329
Come out.

501
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,039
You can come out.

502
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,849

What do we do?

509
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,259
What now?

510
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:58,230

This is bad.

512

That's right around the corner.

513
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:03,809
Once the police find out...

514
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:05,680
that she lost 10 million dollars
and not 1,000,

515
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,710
they'll investigate like crazy.

516
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,109
It'll then be over for us.

and my mom and grandparents
will go to prison.

How can we come up with the money
for your mom until December 31?

521
00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:26,329
Is it possible
to make all that money?

regain my sight.

Are you happy to see again?

531

I'm sorry I've been

she'll experience
some delirium symptoms.

And since she's old,

654
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,809

When she was 70,

656
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,980
she experienced such symptoms
right after the surgery.

657
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,119
Things can be a lot worse
when she's 90.

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,670
And you're saying
it's only 1,000 dollars?

719
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,170
Did they do all the shoveling
just for 1,000 dollars?

720
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,309
Don't be ridiculous
and just tell us the truth.

721
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,909
How much did you steal
from Baek Ji Yeon's safe?

722
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,510
Was it 10 million dollars
or 1,000 dollars?

723
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,280
You must've seen how much it was.

724
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:42,449
How much was it?

725
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,090
Hey!

726
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,769
This is what I take,
and I bought one for you.

727
00:44:57,369 --> 00:44:59,639
People of our age should eat well.

728
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,469
Even a slight fall
can cause serious injury.

729
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:03,769
(Bone MBP)

730
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:06,780
I should buy one for you.

731
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,010
Actually, I recently had a checkup,
and it got worse.

732
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,219
- So I was worried. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

733
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:25,289
I'll take good care of my health
and hold out like a rhino's horn.

734
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:30,170
Now that you're here,
I'm glad to have someone to talk to.

735
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:32,570
But was it okay last night?

736
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,539
This is the beginning of the war.

737
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,510
Why? What did he say?

738
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,809
I don't think they'll move out soon.

739
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,079
Then...

740
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,480
whose house is this now?

741
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,519
Of course, it is mine!

742
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,099
What's the matter? Why did you
call me out when I was at work?

743
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,599
Have a seat, Assistant Manager Lee.

744
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:08,039
Yes. May Design Director Lee
have a seat now?

745
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,010
Sure.

746
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:16,949
Design Director Lee.

747
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,179
You know Da Rim and I are
running a business, right?

748
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,690
You made it obvious by doing
all sorts of ridiculous things.

749
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,690
So I was wondering if you were...

750
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:29,760
No, I mean,

751
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,530
are you interested
in working for my company?

752
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:35,460
We are in urgent need
of a good designer.

753
00:46:36,929 --> 00:46:39,070
Once you hear the whole story,

754
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,340
you'll change your mind.

755
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,340
What's the whole story?

756
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,369
Well...

757
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,280
Just trust me and work with me.

758
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,980
I'll offer a competitive salary.

759
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:51,250
You're a designer
with a good fighting spirit.

760
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,349
It's the winter season now,

761
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,219
and clothes are expensive in winter.

762
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,090
We should sell premium down jackets
by the end of the year.

763
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:59,889
- Sales of 4 million dollars.
- "Sales of 4 million dollars?"

764
00:47:00,789 --> 00:47:03,360
What? With your skills and talent,

765
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,690
we can sell thousands of pieces
in no time.

766
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,599
With me,

767
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,699
you'll be able to sell
tens of thousands of pieces.

768
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,000
You might've been able
to convince Da Rim, who's naive,

769
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,530
but not me.

770
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,340
I'd give my work to Tae Woong.

771
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,469
Why would I give it to you?

772
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,969
When I'm supposed
to support Tae Woong,

773
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,610
I should quit and help you?

774
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,340
Did Da Rim tell you to do this?

775
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,250
I clearly made an offer.

776
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,679
You'll regret this later.

777
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,050
What?

778
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,380
What?

779
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:04,019
Mom. Shall we travel abroad
on January 1?

780
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,960
Shall we see the first sunrise
in the US or in Italy?

781
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,489
Forget it.

782
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,909
I won't go.

783
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,280
Mom. Would you like a face-lift?

784
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:30,809
I know a good plastic surgeon,
and he can book you for January 1.

785
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,809
You'll be bandaged
from head to chin,

786
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:34,119
so you can't talk for a while,

787
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,219
but the swelling will go down
in a month or two.

788
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,289
Shall I make the call?

789
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:40,090
You're being stupid and crazy.

790
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,730
This is insane.

791
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:56,940
(Bong Company)

792
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:00,679
When can I get the design?

793
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:03,349
- Soon.
- Soon?

794
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,679
Yes, soon.

795
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,420
Whenever I get it,

796
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:12,289
will you run the factory all night
and make 5,000 pieces?

797
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:15,519
Just get me the design first.
Did I say I wouldn't help out?

798
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,789
Whether it's a hit or a miss,

799
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:21,460
I need the design
if I'm to make 500 or 5,000 pieces.

800
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,230
I don't have a designer.

801
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:26,230
You've been doing this for years.

802
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,300
You know we're busy
at the end of the year.

803
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,469
We can't help if you don't get me
the design on time.

804
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,469
You know that, right?

805
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:33,239
I do.

(DD Kim)

807
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,679
- It's the designer.
- Okay.

808
00:49:40,949 --> 00:49:41,980
Hello?

809
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,650
You called, sir?

810
00:49:44,789 --> 00:49:46,659
I heard you moved
to the Pattern Team.

811
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:49,420
Why should a designer
work on patterns?

812
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,789
Why do you care?

813
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:53,929
I'm looking for a new job already.

814
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,000
That's perfect.
Design clothes for me.

815
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,300
Join my company. Seogang Apparel.

817
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,010
I heard.

818
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:06,909
If I join, will that make it
a total of two employees?

819
00:50:07,409 --> 00:50:09,579
I swear on my life
that it'll work out.

820
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,750
Why would I join a place
as small as a fly's bum?

821
00:50:12,949 --> 00:50:14,219
I'm not crazy.

822
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,889
Why not try acting crazy?
It's not too bad.

823
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:19,289
It's not that small.
I'm a lot bigger than a fly's bum.

824
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,619
It might tear.

825
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:23,429
You must take a chance
in order to fly or fall.

826
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,030
Failure is what?
The mother of success.

827
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,630
If you embrace a challenge,
you're bound to succeed.

Did you go somewhere?

833
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,760
We went to the lock-up
to see Mr. Oh.

834
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:00,099
That Yang Gil Soon's dead.

835
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,500
That he buried the cash
on Mount Euak.

836
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:05,429
And that Yang Gil Soon...

837
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,599
gave the coordinates...

838
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,769
to the loan sharks and not him.

839
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,940
We told him everything.

840
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,340
The wheels...

841
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:17,650
in his brain will be turning.

842
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,719
If he wants to get out soon,
he'll tell us...

843
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,650
whether it was 10 million
or 1,000 dollars.

846
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,300
Shouldn't we bring them in
and grill them?

847
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,730
I'll find out first
if they're laundering money.

848
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:42,769

will only make things worse.

They must feel really bothered...

895
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:33,760
if they agreed to come.

896
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:36,869
Where's Mu Rim?

897
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:39,170
He's on his way back to the station.

898
00:56:57,849 --> 00:56:58,889
Take a seat, Sergeant Lee.

899
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,860
You got these three texts,
didn't you?

900
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,829
We know everything.

901
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:13,469
Yang Gil Soon's the thief,

902
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:15,570
and before he died,

903
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,070
he texted you where he put the cash.

904
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:19,869
That's right.

905
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:22,579
Gil Soon texted us
where the money was,

906
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:24,679
so we went digging
thinking it was there.

907
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,050
It wasn't.

908
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,119
Is it a crime to do some digging?

909
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,320
You now know we aren't the thieves.

910
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,690
We received the texts
out of nowhere...

911
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,090
and dug at that location,
but nothing was there.

912
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:38,159
So what about it?

913
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,699
We're just as puzzled.

914
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,130
Why did Gil Soon
send us these texts?

915
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,400
If you know why,

916
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,840
please let us know, detectives.

917
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,010
Let's just...

918
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:58,510
look further into
that suspicious dry cleaner's.

919
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,219
What did you mean by that?

920
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:05,650
What suspicious dry cleaner's?

921
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:09,190
Come on. Hey!

922
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:16,059
You must be laundering money.

923
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,269
As if you don't know.

924
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,840
We're not the ones laundering money.

925
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,239
You heard the recording.

926
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:25,139
We wanted to look further
into the dry cleaner's.

927
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,039
We're to investigate
what they're up to.

928
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,280
When did we yap...

929
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,349
about laundering money ourselves?

930
00:58:55,769 --> 00:58:57,010
Sung Hoon, please get in.

931
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,010
Wait for me in the car.

932
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,340
Got it.

933
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,079
Detective.

934
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:16,989
You know, don't you?

935
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:19,130
Don't you poke at us.

936
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,559
The 100,000 dollars...

937
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,030
you received at your wedding
had serial numbers...

938
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,300
starting with AA.

939
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,829
Will you and your family be safe...

940
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,900
once I start talking?

941
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,639
They'll be watching your family
day and night.

942
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:31,670
If you keep this up,

943
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:33,739
I'll forget about the money
and everything...

944
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,409
and just reveal
50-dollar bills worth 100,000...

945
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,880
with serial numbers
starting with AA...

946
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:41,920
came from Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning.

947
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,719
What nonsense are you spewing,
you thug?

948
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,630
I see you're clueless.

949
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:53,829
Then see for yourself.

950
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,909
Let's go.

951
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,960
(50 dollars)

952
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,010
Cheers!

953
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:44,550
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

954
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,719
I'm thrilled.

955
01:00:49,219 --> 01:00:51,349
Design Director Kim,
thank you so much.

956
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:53,320
Let's do this!

957
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,119
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

958
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,219
Let's do this!

959
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,090
How's the meat? Have your fill.

960
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,130
- It's good.
- Is it?

961
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:02,860
(Cheonglyeom Dry Cleaning)

962
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:51,050
You should put it down.

963
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,449
Let's go.

964
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,550
No.

965
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,250
I can't.

966
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,610
Mother, let's go.

967
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,739
Mu Rim...

968
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,949
(Iron Family)

969
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,989
Thank you
for making this tough decision.

970
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:09,460
Here, I've kept dozens
of my treasured designs.

971
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,260
By the way,
what are you two to each other?

972
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:13,289
My poor son, what did I do to you?

973
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,000
Am I supposed to lock Grandma,
Grandpa, and you behind bars?

974
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,699
This isn't why I became a cop.

975
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:19,099
I don't know what's troubling you,

976
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,369
but don't worry too much.

977
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,739
You got Da Rim to see again.

978
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,110
I saw something in the alley
on my way here.

979
01:03:24,269 --> 01:03:27,039
Do you perhaps know the two men
in front of the grocery store?
