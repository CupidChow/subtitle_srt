00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,939
What am I doing
leaving my son behind like this?

5
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,640
Have you lost your mind?
How could you?

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,009
My poor Gang Ju.
What about my Gang Ju?

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,189
Fine. I'll give you all this money.

8
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:51,890
Take all my money, you punks!

9
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:56,189
You darn punks!

10

11
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,879
Oh, no. Gang Ju, my gosh.

12
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,549
Goodness, Gang Ju.

13
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:21,549

Are you his mother?

Are you his next of kin?

00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,060
Yes, I'm his mother.

21
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,129
My poor Gang Ju.
What happened to him?

22
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,700
According to witnesses,

your son was severely injured
while trying to hold on...

to this car key.

25
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,740
The assailants fled
but left the car behind.

26

They'll be captured soon.

What did the doctor say?

33
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,900
Will the surgery fix him?

34
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,400
He hurt his head. His head.

35
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,340
Didn't you see what happened?
I heard you were with him.

37

What about them?

38
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:53,180
They're the ones
who nearly killed Gang Ju.

39
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,719
Yes, Detective. Did you arrest them?

40
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,560
Why? What did he say?

41
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,870
They are caught.

42

48

several unregistered cars ready...

to hide from CCTV cameras.

50
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:45,759
They did?

51
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,729

for the other one quickly.

in the head with a baseball bat.

55
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:01,250
Mr. Seo had their car key
in his hand.

Chairman Ji, what nerve you've got.

71
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,069
Did you see that, detectives?

72
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,399

- What?
- We were after the money.

81
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,230
We weren't going
to lay a finger on Gang Ju.

82
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,959
But we didn't know he'd try so hard
to protect her mom's money.

83
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,470
Gang Ju brought this on himself.

84

It's too early to tell.

92

Are you saying he might not wake up?

93
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:20,379

how it goes.

When Gang Ju was in danger,

101

you drove away

I wouldn't have left
if I'd known this would happen.

105

I regretted it on my way,
so I came back.

106

I didn't even get to the bank.

107

If something happens to Gang Ju,

111
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,839
you and I will be to blame.

What should I do with Gang Ju now?

121
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,019
What do I do?

122
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,529

What's the big deal about this?

What's the big deal
about this darn money?

125
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,909
If I'd given this up,

126
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,309
none of this would've happened
to my Gang Ju.

127
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,179
He wouldn't be lying
in the hospital like that.

128

Gang Ju, please forgive your mom
this once.

129

Please forgive me.

until Mom, Grandpa, and Grandma
are released.

138
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:27,870
I think it's a good idea.

139
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,769
But we won't have any customers.

140
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,570
Our customers know
that I couldn't see before.

141
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,639
I'll tell them they took the money
from the mountain...

142

for me to regain my sight.

143
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,879
And I'll promise them
that we won't steal money again.

144
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,279
Will you do that?

145
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,149
We will close down when we have to.

146
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,720

like this.

all the years
of our family's hard work...

149
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,389
will go down the drain.

some time to spare.

168

Then I'll help you
with the delivery after work.

Then I'll do the mending after work
that Mom used to do.

- Are you serious?
- Really?

173

Should we put up a sign
that says "Specialized in mending?"

That'd be too much pressure
on Cha Rim.

You know it'd make her run away.

00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,580
I remember the three of us
used to help her.

184
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:25,679
Right.

185
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,340
I miss Mom.

186
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,340
Don't you think
the visiting hours are too short?

187
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:54,450
Right.

188
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:02,019
What is your mom doing at this hour?

189
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,220
She's working at
another barbecue restaurant.

190
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,690
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,059
At another barbecue restaurant?

192
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,700
Where is that other barbecue place?

193
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,639
What?

194
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,850
Have you guys heard or not?

195
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,750
It's Gang Ju. He's...

196
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,620
What is it, Gi Dung?

197
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,460
What happened?

198
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:40,860
(Sein General Hospital
Intensive Care Unit)

199
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,330
He's in the ICU.

200
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,690
You can't get in or visit.

201
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,799
Even his mom
only sees him 30 minutes a day.

202
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,169
She's out of her mind.
She's losing it.

203
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,200
What on earth is going on?

204
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:54,809
He said he had to fight
to keep his mom's money this time.

205
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,269
He fought back not knowing
or caring he could die.

206
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,840
He wanted to keep his mom's money.

207
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,179
(Silence)

208
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,120
They were indicted
for aggravated assault.

209
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,950
They have previous convictions
for assault and fraud,

210
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,419
so they'll do jail time.

211
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:11,919
Darn it.

212
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,789
Why does Baek Ji Yeon get away
with tax evasion?

213
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,659
Even though the tax deadline
has passed,

214
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:18,899
now that you know,

215
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,669
shouldn't you have done something
to make her pay the taxes?

216
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,600
If charged properly,
she should pay over 13 million.

217
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,470
Why did you return all that...

218
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:29,110
and allow her to go to a bank
in broad daylight?

219
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,440
Why did you arrest just us?

220
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,539
Have you lost your mind, punk?

221
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,750
You're not in the right.

222
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,779
Listen.

223
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,120
Do you think
we wanted to return the money?

224
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Keep your mouth shut, you dirtbag!

225
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:46,190
You're complaining
when a man might die?

226
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,840
Darn it.

227
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,450
(3H1 8032)

228
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,919
Is Gang Ju doing well?

229
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,250
He must've grown on me.

230
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,250
He's kind of cute.

231
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,159
He's in a hospital.

232
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,789
What? Why?

233
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:24,730
What did you say?

234
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,029
Don't tell her.

235
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,629
Why?

236
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,000
Grandma.

237
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,440
Who hurt that sweet boy?

238
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,639
Oh, no. What now?

239
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,110
Mom.

240
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,480
Oh, dear.

241
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,019
(2H3 6835)

242
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,159
Did you come on your own?

243
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,059
Did you end it with Gang Ju?

244
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,629
I miss him.

245
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,399
Is that too shameless of me?

246
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,440
Da Rim.

247
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,080
Mom.

248
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,379
Mom.

249
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,320
Gang Ju...

250
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,059
What should we do?

251
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,690
What should we do about Gang Ju?

252
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,970
Mom. When will the police
return your money?

253
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,840
Let me go with you.
I'll be your bodyguard.

254
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,440
This time around,
I'll give up my life...

255
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,009
before letting anything happen
to your money.

256
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,049
Mom, I'll be all right. It's okay.

257
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,599
You won't eat?

258
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,539
I should die.

259
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,210
I should die.

260
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,410
I should just die.

261
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,440
Will you starve yourself?

262
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,710
If they wanted to take someone,

263
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,349
they should take old me
who lived long enough.

264
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,680
He did nothing to deserve this.

265
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,589
We owe him...

266
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,559
a great deal.

267
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,990
I just...

268
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,900
can't eat.

269
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:47,700
Please. I beg of you.

270
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,640
Please let Gang Ju wake up.

271
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:54,039
Even if a crowd of people...

272
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,250
ask you for something,

273
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:59,579
push their requests aside
and grant mine first.

274
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,920
Let him wake up.

275
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,049
- Oh, dear.
- Goodness.

276
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,119
Are you trying...

277
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,630
to kill yourself with leg cramps?

278
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,660
Is that what you want?

279
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,599
You shouldn't kneel for so long.

280
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:14,900
Leave me alone.

281
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,569
I can't beg and plead
lying on my back.

282
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,440
I'm not done.

283
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:26,579
Please let Gang Ju wake up.

284
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:27,640
Please.

285
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,480
Won't you grant an old woman
her last wish?

286
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,650
Please...

287
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,680
- Oh, dear.
- My goodness.

288
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,289
Gil Rye. Your legs are killing you.

289
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,789
You'll die
if your circulation gets cut.

290
00:18:39,789 --> 00:18:42,160
Why won't you listen?

291
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,460
Oh, dear...

292
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
If something happens to him,

293
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,569
what will become of my Da Rim?

294
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,670
What will happen to us all?

295
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,809
After what we did to him
and all he did for us...

296
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,920
There's nothing else I can do...

297
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,650
but kneel and beg for his life.

298
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:11,319
The poor thing...

299
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,740
Gang Ju.

300
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,980
Gang Ju.

301
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,710
Gang Ju, please.

302
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,190
Please, Gang Ju.

303
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:52,230
(Sein General Hospital)

304
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,059
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,789
Everything in his life
has gone wrong...

306
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,029
since he met you.

307
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,900
- Go home.
- Ms. Baek.

308
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,630
Please let me see him.

309
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:32,069
Why should I waste...

310
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:34,200
my precious 30 minutes on you?

311
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,369
Go away.

312
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,220
(Damga Charcoal Grill)

313
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,730
Where are you going?

314
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,170
To the toilet.

315
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,529
Sit back down.

316
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,769
I really need to go.

317
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,039
You went to the toilet
five minutes ago.

318
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,970
If you can't solve a problem,
instead of running away from it,

319
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,440
try even harder to focus.

320
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,619
Mother.

321
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,660
How is Gang Ju?

322
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:28,359
He hasn't woken up yet.

323
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:30,089
I'd have told you...

324
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,730
before you asked if he had.

325
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,140
Bom found a tutor
whom she can't beat.

326
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,369
I can't believe I'm seeing her
actually sit down and study.

327
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,509
It'll last a few days at most.

328
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,049
Bom doesn't have
the brains to study.

329
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,450
Shin's a great teacher.

330
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,789
He's the best you could find.

331
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:58,390
Bom's glued to her chair.

332
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,160
She did better in her last exam.

333
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:06,029
Shin's so smart and mature.

334
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,829
He is. He's not like his mom.

335
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,240
You moved him out of the ICU
when he hasn't woken up.

336
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,339
Does this mean
you've given up on him?

337
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:20,140
The CT scan showed
no additional bleeding,

338
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,279
and his condition has stabilized.

339
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,680
I moved him
because he can breathe on his own.

340
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,720
But when will he wake up?

341
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,589
There's no way to tell that
at the moment.

342
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,460
The patient's will
is more crucial in these cases.

343
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:38,759
His will?

344
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:43,299
Gang Ju, you heard him.

345
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,440
You can wake up
if you put your mind to it.

346
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,869
You should wake up already.

347
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,539
Don't you want to see me?

348
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,779
Don't you?

349
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,650
I'm sorry, Gang Ju. Please wake up.

350
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,349
Wake up already.

351
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:00,019
I know you can hear me.

352
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,549
You can hear
everything I say, right?

353
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,490
Please wake up.

354
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,480
Where did she go
when he needs her care?

355
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,230
Gang Ju.

356
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,630
Everyone's worried about you.

357
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,259
So is Ms. Lee.

358
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You'll wake up, won't you?

359
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,539
You should wake up and be my son.

360
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,740
What a joke.

361
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,240
Gang Ju's my son.

362
00:23:58,779 --> 00:23:59,940
Isn't it too late
to claim otherwise?

363
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,279
As if you have the right
to be his mom.

364
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,019
To you, isn't money your child?

365
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Move.

366
00:24:10,819 --> 00:24:12,059
Get out.

367
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,559
You're nothing to him.

368
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,430
For 15 years, you had him
walk on eggshells around you.

369
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,900
You were harsh on him
like you're with your employee...

370
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
and then kicked him out
to have your biological son move in.

371
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,599
You didn't just have him move in.

372
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,140
You even gave him
Gang Ju's position at the company!

373
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,910
So how can you even
call Gang Ju your son?

374
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,109
Your son, you say?

375
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,309
How shameless can you be?

376
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:34,880
Who are you calling shameless?

377
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,880
How am I the shameless one
when you chose money...

378
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,180
over your son?

379
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,690
He'll be in harm's way
as long as he's with you.

380
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,720
I'll be protecting my son
from now on.

381
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,960
Have you lost it?

382
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,619
Are you insane?

383
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,829
You didn't even bat an eye
when he needed a father,

384
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,460
so what gives you the right?

385
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,700
Lower your voice.

386
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,430
Don't yell
in front of your sick son.

387
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,470
Why not?

388
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:58,869
I should raise my voice
for him to hear it.

389
00:24:58,869 --> 00:24:59,970
Gang Ju.

390
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,369
Mr. Ji Seung Don
now wants you as his son.

391
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,940
Even you must think
that's hilarious.

392
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,039
You're my son, so what a joke!

393
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,450
Don't you agree, Gang Ju?

394
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,119
Hey, Gang Ju!

395
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,390
Your mom abandoned you!

396
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:19,589
She left you to fend for yourself...

397
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:21,289
just to secure her money!

398
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,789
Doesn't that upset you?

399
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,759
Wake up already
and grab her by the collar!

400
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,000
Don't stay asleep like that...

401
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,740
and please wake up!

402
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:48,890
Why won't you wake up
with all this commotion around you?

403
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,259
Gang Ju, can't you hear us?

404
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,759
Gang Ju, please wake up
and say something.

405
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:02,930
My boy.

406
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,640
My son, Seo Gang Ju.

407
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,470
Do you hear me?

408
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,609
Son!

409
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,690
Ms. Lee.

410
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,430
Did something happen to Gang Ju?

411
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:41,339
Is he all right?

412
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,809
Ms. Lee.

413
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,410
Please go and talk to Gang Ju.

414
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,519
Tell him to stop sleeping
and wake up.

415
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,619
He won't listen to me.

416
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:56,220
He must hate me.

417
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,089
Ms. Lee.

418
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,859
I think he'll wake up
if you ask him to.

419
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,230
He listens to you.

420
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:09,299
Please, Ms. Lee.

421
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,829
I'm begging you.

422
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,970
Please come with me.

423
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,109
Please get him to wake up.

424
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,799
What can I do...

425
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,240
to win her over again?

426
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:49,670
What can I do...

427
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,880
to get on your good side again?

428
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:01,990
Gang Ju.

429
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,289
I'm here.

430
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,660
It's been so long.

431
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:13,200
Why are you asleep?

432
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,329
Open your eyes.

433
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,769
Didn't you miss me?

434
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,769
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:23,740
I'm sorry.

436
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm so sorry.

437
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,910
Gang Ju.

438
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,049
Gang Ju.

439
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:41,319
Please open your eyes.

440
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,140
(Eye Miracle:
Treatment for blindness)

441
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,279
Is this it?

442
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,640
The treatment Ms. Lee received?

443
00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:06,180
(Eye Miracle: 800,000 dollars)

444
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,150
Are you kidding me with this price?

445
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,089
Who could even afford this?

446
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,009
Seo Gang Ju.

447
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:35,349
Aren't you getting up?

448
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:42,519
You used to pinch my cheeks
and be cheeky around me.

449
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,819
If you don't wake up,
I'll get you back for it.

450
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,359
Gang Ju, wake up.

451
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,690
Gang Ju, please wake up.

452
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,160
Look at me.

453
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,960
Won't you wake up?

454
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,970
I'm right here.

455
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,339
Please wake up, Gang Ju.

456
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:04,109
Is that how he showed his affection?

457
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,849
I guess he liked you a lot.

458
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:12,519
That's a side of him
I never got to see.

459
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,789
Have you eaten?

460
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:17,289
It seemed like
you weren't eating well,

461
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:18,789
so I packed some food.

462
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,730
But I'm a picky eater.

463
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,470
What's this?

464
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,900
These...

465
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,339
Are these even edible?

466
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:35,339
They looked better earlier.

467
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,140
I guess they burst open on the way.
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,480
- I'll put it away.
- Wait.

469
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,109
I'll at least try one.

470
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,029
Well, it's not bad.

471
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,859
You should eat too.

472
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,000
I only packed
one pair of chopsticks.

473
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:08,869
Here.

474
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:10,569
Go on.

475
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:19,619
I'm not eating these
because they're tasty,

476
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,150
but because I'm hungry.

477
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,549
Don't get the wrong idea
just because I'm letting you...

478
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:27,789
in this hospital room
and eating your food.

479
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,390
I'm not giving you two
my approval to date.

480
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,660
I just want you
to help Gang Ju wake up.

481
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,160
I know.

482
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:39,339
He won't wake up
even though you're here.

483
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:43,170
Are you sure he loves you?

484
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,069
I still love him.

485
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,579
Maybe he's had a change of heart.

486
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,480
Could that be it?

487
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,710
Maybe.

488
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:54,549
I coldly turned him away
demanding a breakup.

489
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,019
Talking to him doesn't seem to work.

490
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,160
- Have you given him a kiss?
- Sorry?

491
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,289
Shouldn't we try everything
to get him to wake up?

492
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,299
Didn't you kiss him
when you two were alone?

493
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,960
I didn't.

494
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:10,900
Go ahead and do it.

495
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,569
Now?

496
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:13,869
What's wrong with that?

497
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:15,440
Kiss him on the forehead
and on the cheeks.

498
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,170
If he still doesn't wake up,

499
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,779
try kissing him on the lips.

500
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,319
Have you not done it
with him before?

501
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,220
You're being a prude, aren't you?

502
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,720
We even slept together. Oh, dear.

503
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,789
What?

504
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,119
My goodness.

505
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,559
Well... Okay.

506
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,789
I get that.

507
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,859
So do whatever you want...

508
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,430
except for the sleeping thing.

509
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,569
As long as it wakes him up,

510
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:45,000
I don't mind at all.

511
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:49,569
And I'm not forcing you to do this.

512
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
You like Gang Ju, don't you?

513
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
You love him, right?

514
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,480
Yes. Of course, I do.

515
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:57,150
Fine.

516
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,779
I'll be home then.

517
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,849
Do whatever you want to do with him.

518
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:01,849
Okay?

519
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,359
If he wakes up,

520
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,160
call me right away.

521
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,289
- Okay?
- Yes.

522
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,000
(50 dollars)

523
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,839
Didn't he wake up
even after the kiss?

524
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,680
It didn't work?

525
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,779
Maybe Gang Ju
doesn't like me anymore.

526
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,119
I'm sorry, Ms. Baek.

527
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,090
Okay.

528
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,019
Would you switch with me?

529
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:14,219
Do you want me to come over?

530
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,489
He doesn't like either me or you.

531
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,300
What does he like then?

532
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,199
He isn't so interested in money.

533
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,440
He wouldn't budge
even if I gave him all my money.

534
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
Hey.

535
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,610
I will give you
my ten million dollars now.

536
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,739
You can have it all.

537
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,309
It's all yours.

538
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,510
Does he respond to that?

539
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,110
Not at all.

540
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,349
Hey, I'll donate
my ten million dollars...

541
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:42,920
to people in need instead of you.

542
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,349
I mean, all my ten million dollars.

543
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,789
What was that? To people...

544
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:48,989
who need eye surgery
like Ms. Lee did.

545
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:50,389
I'll pay for their surgery.

546
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:52,329
I saw signs everywhere...

547
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,360
that ask for some donation
to the hospital.

548
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,130
See?

549
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,769
Hey. It's ten million dollars
I'm talking about.

550
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:03,670
The surgery Ms. Lee had
cost 800,000 dollars.

551
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,480
It's enough to cover the cost
of the surgery for 12 people.

552
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:14,519
Ms. Lee.

553
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,889
Yes, Ms. Baek.

554
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:18,650
Ms. Lee...

555
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,190
Why? What's wrong?

556
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,380
When I was talking earlier,

557
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,849
he showed some response.

558
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:48,019
What did you say?

559
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:49,019
What?

560
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,190
I said I'd donate
my ten million dollars...

561
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,920
for people who need eye surgery
like you did.

562
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:58,329
And his eyelids fluttered a little.

563
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,269
Ms. Baek!

564
00:36:11,409 --> 00:36:12,409
Gang Ju.

565
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,050
Gang Ju!

566
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,119
My son.

567
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,389
Gang Ju.

568
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:28,760
My son!

569
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:32,400
Gang Ju. Hang in there, Gang Ju!

570
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,570
Gang Ju.

571
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,280
Gang Ju.

572
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,050
Gang Ju.

573
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,920
Mom.

574
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:03,889
Yes! Your mom is here, Gang Ju!

575
00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:06,059
I'm right here!

576
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,329
I will use my money for good!

577
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,800
Gang Ju, stop sleeping. Okay?

578
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,840
- Ms. Baek.
- Yes?

579
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,239
You asked me to kiss him
on the forehead, right?

580
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
What?

581
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,780
Well... Yes.

582
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,210
But...

583
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,750
Did you tell her to do that?

584
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:31,920
What?

585
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,489
Yes.

586
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,429
And you told me
to kiss him on the cheek.

587
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,590
What?

588
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,099
Did you really say that?

589
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,670
Yes.

590
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,469
Am I dreaming? I must be dreaming.

591
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,440
No, this isn't a dream.

592
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,139
Stop sleeping! Don't fall asleep!

593
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,380
I love you.

594
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,750
I love you, Gang Ju.

595
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,320
What...

596
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,590
You...

597
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,030
don't love me anymore.

598
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:15,670
Go...

599
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,800
Okay. Go ahead
and do what you were doing.

600
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,940
I'll wait outside.

601
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,570
Do it as much as you want.

602
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,269
Okay? You should do it
when you are alive.

603
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:24,269
Mom.

604
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:25,269
What?

605
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,840
You have to keep your promise
about the donation.

606
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:29,550
Don't change your mind.

607
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,849
Okay.

608
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,550
I missed you.

609
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,559
Thank you.

610
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,079
What are you doing here?

611
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,119
Don't go in. Stay here.

612
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,280
I love you, Da Rim.

613
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:43,820
I love you too.

614
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,889
I said that more than a thousand times
while lying in bed.

615
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,420
Did you not hear that?

616
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,599
I didn't hear it even once.

617
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,360
Then I'll say it...

618
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,170
a thousand times
and then a thousand times more.

619
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,170
It's okay.

620
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,409
I will say it...

621
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:06,440
as many times as you did.

622
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,590
(10 months later)

623
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,929
My shoulders are stiff.

624
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,599
Mother, this is Soo Ji.

625
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,469
I'm ashamed to meet you,
so I'm writing a letter instead.

626
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,239
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:43,210
I go to the dry cleaner's
every day these days.

628
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,219
I didn't go there
even when you were there.

629
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,449
I don't have anything to wash,
but I go there.

630
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,829
Going there makes me angry,
but I still go.

631
00:40:57,429 --> 00:40:59,090
He doesn't tell me to stop coming.

632
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,099
I don't know
how things will turn out for us,

633
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,929
but I think...

634
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:08,369
we should keep seeing each other
until we find an answer.

635
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:18,449
(Police)

636
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,019
Inmate number 6835.
You have a visitor.

637
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:33,130
You didn't expect to see me,
did you?

638
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:38,369
I hear you're a model prisoner.

639
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,170
Have you been well?

640
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:48,039
I'm not doing well.

641
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:50,650
I'm human too.

642
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,579
How could I be well
after what happened?

643
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:56,920
We were in-laws at one time.

644
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,260
You did your job.

645
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,329
Staying here...

646
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,900
made me realize
what a grave crime I committed.

647
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,269
Thank you for arresting me.

648
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:18,039
I'm not sure if you heard,

649
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,039
but Soo Ji visits Mu Rim every day.

650
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,449
We're told...

651
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,179
to hate the crime...

652
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,480
but not the person.

653
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,889
It's really hard
to put into practice.

654
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,860
My Soo Ji
seems to be able to do that.

655
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:41,329
I thought about it as well.

656
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:44,670
Once you all pay the price,

657
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:49,070
I think the decision
is my daughter's to make.

658
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:54,139
- What?
- I plan to wait...

659
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,610
and watch for now.

660
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,809
Would that...

661
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:03,690
make you feel uncomfortable?

662
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:12,590
I don't have the right
to feel uncomfortable.

663
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,730
I'll take that to mean
we're on the same page.

664
00:43:19,469 --> 00:43:20,500
My gosh.

665
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,480
It's not easy being in prison.

666
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,010
Your time's almost up.

667
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,679
I wish you good health.

668
00:43:54,739 --> 00:43:57,440
(Keep Doors Locked)

669
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,480
- Can you get it for me?
- Yes.

670
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:03,110
Mother. The side dishes are spicy.

671
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,010
Don't eat much.
It's bad for your stomach.

672
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,650
Okay.

673
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,679
Thanks.

674
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:10,489
Be sure to take this
right after your meal.

675
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:11,920
- Don't forget it.
- Okay.

676
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:13,989
Will you please make sure...

677
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,530
my mother-in-law takes her medicine?

678
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,389
Don't you worry.

679
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,300
- You got us so many snacks.
- Right.

680
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,730
I'm in a good mood.

681
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,599
I'll treat you to lattes later.

682
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,099
- You will?
- Thank you.

683
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,369
- Take care.
- Enjoy your meal, Mother.

684
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,409
I will.

685
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:34,309
(Prison Assistant)

686
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:41,150
A year flashed by.

687
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,119
It didn't flash by.

688
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:48,389
I was so scared
my wife would die here.

689
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,289
She's 91 years old.

690
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:53,829
She's old.

691
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:56,130
The crybaby's about to cry again.

692
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:59,230
Don't talk about her.

693
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:01,969
Once you get out,

694
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:04,769
don't commit a crime again.

695
00:45:05,409 --> 00:45:07,280
Life flies by like an arrow.

696
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,079
I don't think I was born long ago,

697
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,750
but I'm 90 already.

698
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,289
Life...

699
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:20,920
is really short.

700
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:23,389
It's so short.

701
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,869
That suits you.

702
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:35,400
You want me to wear this forever?

703
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,269
No. I meant the color suited you.

704
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,010
- Go away.
- Wait.

705
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,250
Why did you come back?
Aren't you busy?

706
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,280
Are you ditching your duties...

707
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,750
while your two sons slave away?

708
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:52,449
I'll take a sabbatical.

709
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,389
I'm having a year-long break.

710
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:56,329
My gosh. You're too spoiled.

711
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,429
Is there anywhere you'd like to go?

712
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,059
Let's travel when you get out.

713
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,199
I promised to be your tour guide.

714
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:07,340
Are you insane? That's stupid.

715
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,940
I looked it up.

716
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:13,309
A cruise sounded nice,
but we'd be cooped up.

717
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,650
That would be suffocating
right after a year in prison.

718
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,920
Let's go where
we can enjoy open space...

719
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,519
in the wild outdoors.

720
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:26,159
You can do everything you want.

721
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,690
Where is that?

722
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:31,789
Let's walk the Way of St. James.

723
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,800
We can walk when we want,
rest when we want,

724
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,670
and eat when we want.

725
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,800
You can do everything you want.

726
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:42,539
We'll be completely free.

727
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,440
Let's walk to our heart's content
for a month or so.

728
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,409
And think as well.

729
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,210
Hey.

730
00:46:51,949 --> 00:46:54,619
Thinking is all I do in here.

731
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:56,690
What more should I think about
for a whole month?

732
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,250
You want us to walk for that long?

733
00:46:58,389 --> 00:46:59,920
Do you want to torture me?

734
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,960
You can do that on your own.

735
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,489
I thought you'd like the idea.
You don't like it?

736
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,130
I'll think of something else to do
and come back.

737
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:13,969
Don't come if you'll just be silly.

you can travel with?

741
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,349

- Okay.

My daughter-in-law...

767
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:45,690
had to look after us even in prison.
I'm sorry.

768
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:47,260
It was nothing at all.

769
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:51,489
Mother worried so much about you.

770
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:54,199
What? I did not.

771
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,400
The neighborhood felt empty,

772
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,400
and it was boring
without you around.

773
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,539
- Okay.
- I missed you.

774
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:04,539
Oh, well.

00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:06,480

- Thanks.

778
00:50:11,909 --> 00:50:13,780

- Okay.

This is yours, Mom.

784
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,599
This is no longer a thing,

785
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:28,159
but I insisted.

786
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,559
Take a bite.

787
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:30,900
Why did you...

788
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,269
bring three blocks of tofu?

789
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:36,710
We could've shared one block.

790
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,309
We didn't want you
to get into more trouble together.

791

It's not ideal
if you get on too well.

792
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:46,079
Okay, fine.

for each other forever.

- You bet.

Let's get going. Come on.

800
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,309
- Sure.
- Off we go.

801
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,920
- I know it was rough.
- Right.

802
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,329
Did you learn how to drive?

803
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,369
She got her driver's license
and studied merchandising.

804
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:38,969

806
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:44,110

807
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,539
She's studying to become
a fashion merchandiser.

what should be produced...

809
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,539
and thinks of...

810
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,679
better marketing strategies
with fashion designers.

811
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:56,219

After learning well
about the industry,

814
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,590
she'll work hard to make it
as a fashion merchandiser.

816
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,130

820
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Hold on.

821
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,510
Didn't you donate
all the money to the hospital?

822
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:21,909
What? I don't have any money.

823
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:24,780
Look at me. Look.

824
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,250
Was it for just one person?

825
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:29,550
You donated 800,000 dollars
for one person's eye surgery?

826
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,789
Hey. 800,000 dollars
is a large sum of money.

827
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:35,889
I should have money left to spend.

828
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:38,260
I expected no less, Mom.

829
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,960
You still value money
over your own son, right?

830
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,670
You easily go back on your word,

831
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,630
but I let it slip my mind.

832
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,300
Consider me defeated.

833
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,210
I regained consciousness
after hearing about your donation,

834
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,909
but you only helped one person.

835
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,309
I thought you'd help all 12 people.

836
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,519
That's lousy of you, Mom.

837
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,820
- Unbelievable.
- Gosh, that hurts.

849

00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,269
to survive prison, Man Deuk.

851

- Tell me about it.
- Goodness.

852
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:54,869
Tae Woong is the kind of man
every woman would want as a husband.

853
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,909
Does that mean
you'll accept me as your family?

854
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,710
- Of course!
- Of course!

855
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,579
Goodness. I'll be hot.

856
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,480
Make sure you're warm
under the covers.

857
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,690

in a cold room.

858

This is too warm for me.

859
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,389

860
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:21,460

I thought your grandmother
couldn't die in prison.

866

I kept my head on straight
to make sure she made it out.

867
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,460
She stayed in another cell,
but I still looked out for her.

and I didn't even catch a cold.

are also gone.

I know.

872
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,170
Even menopause must've found it
impossible to survive prison.

Do you want to sleep
next to me tonight?

gradually got absorbed

901
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,420
Is it because you didn't trust me?

902
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:02,059

Work with me here.

910
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,380
I'm not sure
I can just work with you here.

911
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,920
Okay then.

912
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,389
We can work together
and do other things.

913
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,030
Other things...

914
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,500
as in what?

915
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:21,599
As long as it doesn't involve theft,

916
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,539
it can be anything, okay?

917
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,039
Unbelievable.

918
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:31,380
Follow me.

919
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:33,280
Hold on. Wait!

920
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,050
(Sein General Hospital)

921
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:41,559
Is this it?

922
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,389
Come in.

923
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,429
- Hello.
- Welcome.

924
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:49,500
Please have a seat.

925
00:58:52,369 --> 00:58:53,670
I thought my work was done.

926
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:56,099
Well, I know...

927
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,940
you didn't want me to share
your contact information.

928
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:59,940
Right.

929
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:02,239
So I didn't tell anything
about you to the patient.

930
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,280
However...

931
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:05,309
Can I have it?

932
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,849
- Would you like to watch this?
- What is it?

933
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:11,250
The patient received the treatment
with the donation you made.

934
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,619
She really wanted to thank you,
so she filmed this...

935
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,519
when she came in for a follow-up.

936
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,860
Hello.

937
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,630
Thank you for helping me
see my parents.

938
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:27,199
This was my first time
seeing my parents' faces.

939
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:29,769
The same goes for my friends.

940
00:59:30,469 --> 00:59:32,269
Thank you, ma'am.

941
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,909
We will never forget about you
and remember you forever.

942
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,320
The child and her mom
really wanted to thank you.

943
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,159
We're all done here. You may leave.

944
00:59:54,699 --> 00:59:56,500
How many more children like her
are there?

945
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:57,599
Sorry?

946
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,469
The procedure
shouldn't be this pricey...

947
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,099
when a child's life depends on it.

948
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:04,469
Treat...

949
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,570
one more child.

950
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:16,719
I have a feeling
she'll continue to donate.

951
01:00:17,389 --> 01:00:19,820
Right. I sensed that too.

952
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:23,420
How wonderful.

953
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:26,760
Am I meeting with
your fiancee's family today?

954
01:00:27,929 --> 01:00:30,599
Yes, we can go together after work.

955
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:32,829
Rather than eating out,

956
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:34,570
she wanted to cook for us at home.

957
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:35,570
My gosh.

958
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,969
Bong Hee showers you with love,
doesn't she?

959
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,840
It must be a hassle
to cook all by herself.

960
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,480
I know.

961
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:44,880
Can I come too?

962
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,780
What? How so?

963
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,750
As Father's son.

964
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:52,090
I guess that makes us brothers.

965
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,019
I'm touched.

966
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,989
Anyway, it's up to you.

967
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,750
Gang Ju.
You're in charge of Seogang Apparel.

968
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,489
Tae Woong.
You're back at the fashion lab.

969
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:29,260
Who grows how much and how fast,

970
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,929
I'll wait and see.

971
01:01:30,929 --> 01:01:32,090
- Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.

972
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,320
I got to go on sabbatical
thanks to you two.

973
01:01:55,449 --> 01:01:56,550
If I didn't have you,

974
01:01:57,219 --> 01:01:59,489
I'd have to work
until the day I die.

975
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,130
Thanks, guys.

976
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:12,469
- Cha Rim.
- Yes?

977
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:14,900
Get me another plate
for the japchae.

978
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:16,400
- A big one?
- Yes.

979
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,480
- Just one?
- Yes.

980
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,840
Keep an eye on the fish.

981
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:24,110
- Do we need two plates for that?
- Yes, to go on each side.

982
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,280
My gosh.

983
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,320
They're here.

984
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,260
It must be them.

985
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,530
Mother, Father.
Tae Woong's here with his father.

986
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:45,369
Oh, welcome.

987
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:46,530
- Welcome.
- Hello, Chairman Ji.

988
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,070
- I wanted to meet you.
- Take a seat.

989
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,710
Cha Rim, get a tray.

990
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:52,309
- Serve the sujeonggwa first.
- Okay.

991
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:54,039
Bong Hee, will this plate do?

992
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:55,409
- This one?
- Where's the big tray, Mom?

993
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:57,280
- The tray...
- Too much is going on at once.

994
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,550
Mu Rim, get the table.

995
01:02:58,579 --> 01:03:01,579
Da Rim's family got together again
after a long time apart.

996
01:03:01,579 --> 01:03:03,849
(50 dollars)

997
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:08,519
Who put clothes in the machine
without checking the pockets?

998
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,659
Who washes clothes
without checking the pockets first?

999
01:03:12,659 --> 01:03:16,400
(50 dollars)

1000
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:18,699
Wait.

1001
01:03:24,969 --> 01:03:27,239
I'll be part of the family soon too,
right?

1002
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,750
(Thank you for watching
"Iron Family.")
