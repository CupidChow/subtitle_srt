Nian insisted on going out.

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,120
We couldn't stop her.
She went to West Street.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Go pick her up.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,120
Look.

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
- What a lunatic!
- I drew this.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,760
I drew this.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,600
Look at this.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,640
What a crazy woman!

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,000
I drew this.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,880
I drew this.

22
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,680
Isn't she the Zhous' adopted daughter

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
who caused that big scandal?

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,800
It really is her.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,960
How did she end up like this?

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,440
Naturally,

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,680
she must be kicked out

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,040
due to many evil deeds.

29
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,600
And she couldn't handle the shock.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,680
(Mom, where are you?)

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,720
(I want to go home.)

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,080
(I want to go home.)

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,760
(Mom.)

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,720
Look, these paintings are mine.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
These are mine.

37
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,120
Get away!

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,200
Look!

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,240
Get lost!

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,680
Is she okay?

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
She got hit by a car.

42
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,480
(Mom,)

43
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,440
(I finished the painting.)

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
(Can I keep being)

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,840
(your daughter?)

46
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,720
What should we do?

47
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,280
What's happening?

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,240
Let me through.

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,480
Probably beyond saving.

50
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,400
She's already dead, right?

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,120
She dashed out on her own.

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,280
I couldn't brake in time.

53
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,120
Just tell the truth

54
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
to the police.

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,720
She probably can't be saved.

56
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
What a pity.

57
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
She could've just backed off
and be the heiress.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,840
Karma's justice, I suppose.

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,640
Why bother with a madwoman?

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,080
But it's still a human life.

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,960
How tragic!

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,560
Disperse!

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,440
- Move!
- Step back!

64
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,320
Make way.

65
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Stay calm.

66
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,920
Step back.

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,800
- Lu.
- She's dead.

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,360
Take her back first.

69
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,640
Okay.

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,840
(They can't take Nian!)

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
I'll check over there.

72
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,080
Stay here and watch her.

73
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,920
Lu.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,080
Be careful.

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,200
You three.

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,240
Take the corpse back.

77
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,160
Tell Lu Ye, I'm waiting for him.

78
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
(Nian,)

79
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,360
(I will take you home.)

80
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,360
(Everyone who stands in our way)

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,160
(is destined to die.)

82
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,320
Nian, don't be afraid.

83

He Jiu.

84
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,960
You know me?

85
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,680
I live just to kill you.

86
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,920
I won't let you die so easily.

87
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,680
Zhao Qing! Zhao Qing!

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,560
What happened?

89
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,880
He Jiu.

90

91

Come on.

93
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,640
Bear with it.

94
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,560
Lu,

95
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
He Jiu

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
took Zhang Wange south.

97
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,880
Go quickly!

98
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,720
Wait here for me.

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,680
I'll save you.

100
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,760
Come on.

101
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,240

102
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,200

(You could have taken me back)

107
