12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,960
I oppose her?

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,600
It's her!

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,520
Why did her return

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,400
take everything that should be mine?

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,360
I've been your daughter
for over two decades!

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,520
Nian,

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
even when Siya came back home,

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
I never intended to drive you away.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,720
You repeatedly tried to harm Siya.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,880
That's why we couldn't keep you.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,600
I've ended up like this

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,680
all thanks to you.

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,440
As a part of the Zhou family,

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,360
since childhood,

26
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
I was taught

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
to excel in everything.

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,920
When I was slow at reading and writing,

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
Grandmother said I lacked talent.

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,480
So I practiced piano obsessively.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,520
But Grandfather

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,400
never once listened to my playing.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,320
You said

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,400
you wanted me to become

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,120
someone beyond others' reach.

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,280
But Mom,

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,480
all these years,

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,640
have you ever truly cared for me?

39
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,680
Do you know what I've been doing,

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,320
learning,

41
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,360
and painting?

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,520
By the way, Mom.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,120
Mom, look.

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,000
Mom,

45
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,520
this is the ocean

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,080
from that outing

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,680
we took together.

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,680
And this one.

49
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,280
This is the night sky we shared.

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,480
That night's sky

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,640
was beautiful,

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
but so cold.

53
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,840
There's another painting.

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,064
You...

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,000
Mom.

56
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Remember this one?

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,520
Since childhood,

58
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,720
you never noticed any of my artwork.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,680
Except for Zhang Wange's painting.

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,680
That was the first time

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,960
I saw approval in your eyes.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,080
That's why I claimed
this painting as mine.

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,680
But Mom,

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,960
why?

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,640
Why does everyone only see Zhang Wange?

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,440
Why?

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
Why? Why?

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Why? Why? Why?

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,880
Nian.

70
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Mom,

71
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,440
are you scared of me now?

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,400
Mom, don't be afraid.

73
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm your daughter.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,560
Mom,

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
it's just like you used to.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Discipline me,

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,000
and command me.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll behave, Mom.

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,600
Mom.

80
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,000
Lu, Mrs. Zhang just reported

81
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,760
Zhou Nian kidnapped Mrs. Zhou.

82
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,520
Miss Zhang went alone.

83
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,840
Zhou Nian!

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,280
Siya, stay back!

85
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
Zhou Nian, just come at me.

86
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,560
Release Mom.

87
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,920
Mom?

88
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,480
How sweet that sounds.

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,800
Zhang Wange.

90
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,240
Wait,

91
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,800
I should call you

92
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Zhou Siya.

93
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,760
You just got back,

94
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,520
and played the devoted daughter?

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,440
Blood truly runs thicker, doesn't it?

96
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Zhou Nian,

97
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,360
I know you hate me.

98
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,480
I'm right here.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,400
Do as you will.

100
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,760
No! No!

101
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,760
Do as I will?

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,880
- No!
- Fine!

103
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,600
No.

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll give you this chance.

105
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,440
Don't!

106
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,520
Pick it up!

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,208
No!

108
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800
Siya, don't!

109
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,320
No!

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,080
Use those hands of yours

111
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,240
to trade for your mother.

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
No. Siya.

113
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,600
No!

114
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Siya!

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,840
Mom.

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,680
What a touching moment!

117
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,200
See?

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
She'll never paint again, Mom.

119
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,680
From now on, I'll be your only daughter.

120
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
Okay?

121
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,800
Okay?

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,920
Zhou Nian!

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
You framed me first.

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,200
Now you're kidnapping Mom.

125
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,640
You're ruthless

126
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,800
and ungrateful!

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Every crime you've committed
deserves death!

128
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,440
Go ahead and shoot!

129
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,120
Do it!

130
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,560
Siya.

131
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,760
Siya, calm down!

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,360
Don't be reckless!

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,440
Siya!

134
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,520
Calm down!

135
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,680
Siya!

136
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Don't be reckless!

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,296
Kill me then!

138
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,416
Don't be reckless!

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,680
Siya!

140
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
Please don't shoot!

141
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,920
Siya!

142
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,360
Siya!

143
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,720
Siya, how's your hand?

144
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,880
Does it hurt?

145
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
It's fine, Mom.

146
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,280
I'm okay.

147
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
Let's go.

148
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,680
Okay.

149
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,400
Mom. Mom.

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
Mom, I was wrong! Mom!

151
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,640
Don't abandon me!

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,040
I was wrong!

153
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,000
Mom, don't abandon me!

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll paint properly, Mom!

155
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
Mom.

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,840
Zhang Wange.

157
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,200
Why did you act alone?

158
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,360
I'm fine.

159
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
But what about

160
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,880
next time?

161
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,400
Can you ensure your safety always?

162
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,840
Don't be angry.

163
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm not angry.

164
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,800

We do have some history.

167
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,800
But you can't interfere
with my decisions.

168
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,440
I don't need your protection

169
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,280
all the time.

170
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,760
Maybe I overreacted.

171
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,360
I didn't have time to think.

172
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,160
Many people were hurt because of me.

173
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,760
I can't drag Mrs. Zhou into this.

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,320
Now

197
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,600
they're even taking this surname away.

198
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,440
I have no name now.

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Just leave me be.

200
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,720
I can't help you either.

201
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
Surnames don't matter.

202
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,960
You'll always be what you are to me.

203
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,640
From now on, take my surname,

204
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,440
He.

205
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,360
Take your surname?

206
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,880
What?

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
Think I'm unwanted?

208
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,000
You can just take me in?

209
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,320
This is your true surname.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,160
You...

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,800
Who are you?

212
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
Who exactly are you?

213
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,440
Your mother

214
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,160
was my sister.

215
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,720
(He Lan, Zhou Nian's birth mother)
(She was everything to me.)

216
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,840
Doctor!

217
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,240
How's my sister?

218
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,760
(After giving birth to you, your mother)

219
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,600
(suddenly fell gravely ill beyond cure.)

220
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,000
You can't afford the medicine.

221
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,200
You should give up!

222
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,040
Doctor, please save my sister!

223
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,040
No matter how much

224
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,720
this costs,

225
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960
I'll find a way.

226
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,000
Come to me when you have money.

227
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,920
I'm begging you, I...

228
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,840
Jiu.

229
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,160
Jiu.

230
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,480
Lan.

231
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,840
No!

232
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,520
Don't make things difficult
for the doctor.

233
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,800
What a waste of time. Disgusting.

234
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,000
Lan.

235
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,280
Take care of the baby for me.

236
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,880
I will definitely save you.

237
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,200
Lan, wait for me.

238
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
Everyone says she can't be saved.

239
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,880
But I refuse to believe it.

240
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
Master Zhao! Master Zhao!

241
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Master Zhao,
I'm He Lan's younger brother!

242
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,000
How dare you cause trouble!

243
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
Lan bore you a daughter!

244
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
She's fallen ill.

245
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,280
She needs treatment.

246
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,240
Doctor said...

247
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,880
She was out of her mind that day.

248
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,320
A group of us had her.

249
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,640
Who knows who the father
of her child is?

250
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
Zhao Quan, you rat!

251
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,160
Darn you!

252
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,760
Here's your coffin fee. Keep it.

253
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,720
Lan.

254
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,760
We have money now.

255
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,048
Lan.

256
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,760
Lan.

257
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,320
Lan.

258
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
Wake up, Lan!

259
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Lan.

260
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,720
Lan, don't sleep anymore!

261
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm back!

262
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,080
I will take you for treatment, Lan.

263
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,520
(Then why)

264
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
(was I sent to the Zhou family?)

265
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,080
I wasn't capable at the time

266
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,520
to raise you properly.

267
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,600
Ma'am, the child has been
starving for so long.

268
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,448
Give us some food.

269
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,440
Don't come here again

270
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,600
or block the doorway!

271
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,840
Mr. Zhou and Mrs. Zhou
will be back soon.

272
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,160
I'll get scolded.

273
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,720
Go away!

274
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,360
I'm begging you.

275
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,760
You are back.

276
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,080
How is the young lady?

277
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,800
She's fine.

278
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,040
Don't take her away.

279
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,160
She treasures her dearly.

280
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Won't even let me hold her.

281
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Look at Siya, so well-behaved today.

282
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,160
Yes, our Siya is truly good.

283
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,120
(If their child were gone,)

284
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,880
(would they care for
Lan's child instead?)

285
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,960
What about their child?

286
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,240
An adopted child can never
replace a biological one.

287
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,520
I worried you'd face hardship.

288
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,440
So I found a chance
to take Zhou Siya away.

289
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,800
The Zhou family

290
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,600
could only have one heiress.

291
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,160
Therefore,

292
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,160
the child you stole

293
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,920
is Zhang Wange.

294
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Nian, leave these matters to me.

295
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
I will give you

296
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,400
whatever you desire.

297
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,440
Do you think

298
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,320
I should thank you

299
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,840
for sending me to the Zhou family

300
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,960
to enjoy luxury

301
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,920
and play Zhou family's heiress?

302
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,080
You thought you sent me to a castle,

303
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,080
but they're actually ruins.

304
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,400
A prison that's trapped me for life!

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,360
You could have taken me back

306
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,600
after I came of age.

307
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,000
At least

308
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,280
I could have had a real family.

309
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,320
- Why did you do this to me?
- Nian.

310
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,320
Don't touch me!

311
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,000
(Because back then,)

312
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,720
(I had to risk my life to settle debts.)

313
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,760
Poor yet seeking treatment?

314
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Just die poor!

315
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,240
You're all liars!

316
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,160
You're all liars!

317
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,120
Everything is fake.

318
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,520
No one in this world ever cares for me.

319
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,240
Get out!

320
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,200
Get out!

321
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,960
Get out!

322
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
Rest well.

323
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,120
Get out!
