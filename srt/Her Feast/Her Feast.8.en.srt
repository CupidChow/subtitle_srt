Given time,

14
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,280
if he realizes you know the truth,

Stay and keep playing his dutiful son.

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,200
I know what I'm doing.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
Stay out of this.

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,600
Xun,

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,600
here to visit your mom?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,840
Yeah.

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,920
Xun,

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
can't even dress properly?

32
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,160
The collar...

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,400
No need to trouble you.

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll handle it.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,240
(If I'd realized earlier,)

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,400
(would things have been different?)

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,520
(How did I end up here?)

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,240
What are you doing?

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
Why are you here?

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,040
Setting off fireworks.

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
In my hometown, there's a custom

42
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,120
that lighting fireworks on your birthday

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,360
makes your wishes come true.

44
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,120
(So it's her birthday.)

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,440
Nonsense.

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,920
If that's the case,

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
why not make a hundred wishes?

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,960
Greed is a human failing.

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,360
Make a wish.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,880
Or you'll miss your turn.

51

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,600

59
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:52,160
Here.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,640
Your turn.

61
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
I'll let you make my wish too.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,600
Why?

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,440
Because you've had
such a miserable year.

64
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Worse than me.

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040

What?

92
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,440
You're so busy.

93
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
I have to call you myself.

94
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
Got the invitation?

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Be punctual.

96
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,960
An invitation for a proposal.

97
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
Is it appropriate?

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,400
Perfectly appropriate.

99
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,800
Prepare the gift money.

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
bring Zhou Nian.

102
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:17,640

Nian,

105
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,280
share your most vivid memory.

106
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,040
Most vivid?

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,320
The month I accompanied Yanzhou

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,920
during the internship
at the planetarium.

109
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,520
So you spent a month together.

110
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,320
Anything happened?

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
No prying.

112
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,680
Miss Zhang, my question is for you.

113
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,000
Have you

114
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,200
stayed overnight at Pei Xun's?

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,440
Yes,

116
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:56,960
but...

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,880
That's enough.

118
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,600
We dare not hear more details.

119
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,960
(Though Pei Xun plays the field,)

120
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,560
(he never brought women home before.)

121
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,440
(Is he serious about Zhang Wange?)

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,360
(He's)

123
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,600
(upset?)

124
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,440
Yanzhou,

125
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,720
I'm so dizzy.

126
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
It's so hot.

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,480
Don't go.

128
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,200
I feel extremely hot all over.

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,440
Like I'm burning up.

130
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,200
I'll call the doctor for you.

131
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,600
You Rui just asked
how far we've progressed.

132
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,200
Yanzhou,

133
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,880
actually, nothing has happened
between us.

134
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,840
Yanzhou, I really like you.

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
(Yanzhou...)

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Get some rest.

137
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,160
Yanzhou.

138
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,720
Mr. Song,

139
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,360
you're drunk.

140
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,800
You don't look at me.

141
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
How do you know if I'm drunk?

142
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,960
Zhang Wange,

143
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,840
I need to talk to you.

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,040
Zhang Wange?

145
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,600
Don't go.

146
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,480
Are you asleep?

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,160
Mr. Song,

148
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,360
that night was a mistake.

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,120
You have a fiancée.

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,960
And I have Pei Xun.

151
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,040
True.

152
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,120
Forced love never lasts.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
Weina's design director position.

154
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,400
Are you interested?

155
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
Within one minute,

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,200
if you walk out of this room,

157
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,280
I'll let you go.

158
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,240
Or

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,656
stay.

160
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,880
And the director position will be yours.

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,520
Time's up.

162
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,920
You can't leave now.

163
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,280
I need to rest.

164
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,240
Then,

165
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,080
goodnight.

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,360
Congratulations.

168
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,440
Miss Zhang,

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,600
the director position
rightfully belongs to you.

170
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,000
We did emphasize to her

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,080
multiple times, right?

172
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,040
Yeah.

173
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,960
Why is it the same?

174
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,680
Yes. The entire design
is almost identical.

175
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,920
Miss Zhou Nian,

176
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,560
have the design drafts been revised?

177
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,160
Haven't I already given you
the design drafts?

178
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,480
Those were the revised versions.

179
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,840
Miss Zhou,

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,840
you haven't taken
our previous discussions

181
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,720
seriously.

182
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,040
I said

183
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,280
I retain final authority

184
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,360
over my own designs.

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,600
As for you bringing in
some second-rate person

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,360
as team director,

187
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,520
I have no objections.

188
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,560
But don't attempt to modify my designs.

189
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
Miss Zhou Nian,

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,120
I respect you greatly,

191
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,560
but if you still fail to submit

192
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,400
the revised designs
as required by next week,

193
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,960
the entire design will be transferred

194
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
to Zhang Wange.

195
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,720
On what grounds?

196
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,120
On the grounds
that I'm this project's leader.

197
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,200
Then I suggest you properly investigate

198
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,920
Miss Zhang here

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,200
next time.

200
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,360
After all,

201
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,720
she was involved in plagiarism scandals

202
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
that caused huge uproars.

203
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,480
Moreover,

204
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,600
whether her hands can still hold a pen

205
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,920
remains questionable.

206
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,640
You...

207
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,040
That's completely unreasonable!

208
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
(Jeff wouldn't make decisions himself.)

209
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,680
(Could Yanzhou have ordered this?)

210
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,040
Yanzhou,

211
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,560
Jeff's team wants to modify my designs.

212
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,240
Did I do something wrong?

213
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,200
It's okay.

214
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,880
Just minor adjustments.

215
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,400
Yanzhou.

216
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,480
Mr. Song,

217
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,240
bad news.

218
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
Hongying's making trouble.

219
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,640
Wange can't handle them.

220
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,160
(You again, Zhang Wange!)

221
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,160
Song! You ruined my plans!

222
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,080
Watch out!

223
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,680
Are you always so reckless?

224
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,960
I...

225
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,760
I didn't think that much.

226
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
Did I hurt you?

227
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,160
It's alright now.

228
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,640
You should get some rest.

229
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,520
Let Fang Cheng send you home.

230
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,840
Thank you, Mr. Song.

231
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
Zhang Wange,

232
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,840
such a meticulously crafted scheme.

233
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,880
I set a trap.

234
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,920
You taught me this.

235
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,200
(So the people from Hongying Capital)

236
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,320
(were brought here by you.)

237
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,440
(He's here.)

238
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,120
Stop!

239
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,800
Pei Xun?

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,360
Come with me.

241
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,192
You...

242
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,880
(Zhou Nian,)

243
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,120
(misaligned fate)

244
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,080
(will eventually return
to its rightful place.)

245
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
Pei Xun, what are you doing?

246
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,800
Zhou Nian,

247
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,880
since when did you

248
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,800
become so ruthless?

249
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,600
She just joined design department
and got her hand injured.

250
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Don't tell me

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,800
this is an accident.

252
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,000
Pei Xun,

253
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
get this straight.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,840
She's the one framing me!

255
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
Frame you?

256
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,640
Then tell me.

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,160
What has she gained?

258
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,560
And what have you lost?

259
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,400
Pei Xun,

260
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,320
what are you implying?

261
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,960
Three years ago,

262
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,760
I never actually destroyed her draft

263
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,600
of Gilded Butterfly Dream.

264
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:33,800
Pei Xun,

265
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,280
you brought me this painting
in the first place.

266
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,560
(Chenda Capital)
Have you investigated

267
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
the troublemakers?

268
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
They're from Hongying.

269
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,560
Wange leaked their internal documents

270
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,360
back then.

271
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,720
It's natural they're targeting her.

272
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,120
Could be.

273
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,640
Three years earlier,

274
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,560
I never actually destroyed her draft

275
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,640
of Gilded Butterfly Dream.

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
I set a trap.

277
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,320
You taught me this.

278
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,600
What are you afraid of?

279
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,360
Contact

280
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,800
the manager from Cuican Jewels.

281
00:15:35,923 --> 00:15:39,584
(Half A Month Later)

282
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,880
They'll be here soon.

283
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,880
Don't worry.

284
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,440
The concept sketches

285
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
Cuican Jewels releases this time

286
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,040
have 60% overlap

287
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,880
with your submitted designs.

288
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
I suspect some of you

289
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,520
leaked the concept sketches.

290
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,280
Due to this incident,

291
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,480
we've decided to

292
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,080
adopt Miss Zhou's concept.

293
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,200
Mr. Gao,

294
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,920
we've been working

295
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,440
day and night on this project.

296
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,320
No one understands it

297
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,560
better than we do.

298
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,040
Just give us a few more days,

299
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,560
and we can definitely

300
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,120
create a better proposal.

301
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,560
No way.

302
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,480
You've caused enough trouble

303
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,640
and still want this project?

304
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,680
That's pure delusion.

305
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,720
Even if you modify 80% of it,

306
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,520
how can you guarantee

307
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,840
it won't leak again?

308
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,680
After all, your team

309
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,680
already has untrustworthy members.

310
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
This decision came
after careful consideration.

311
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,560
The design leak

312
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,920
has impacted our future collaboration.

313
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,200
We want no further complications.

314
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,040
Mr. Song.

315
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,880
Good day, Mr. Song.

316
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,680
Yanzhou.

317
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,560
Mr. Song,

318
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,920
there are two design proposals now,

319
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,840
but since Jeff's team previously had

320
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,760
a serious concept sketch leak,

321
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,760
we've decided to

322
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,320
use Zhou Nian's work.

323
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,800
Mr. Song,

324
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,560
I hope you can grant us a few more days.

325
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,000
I believe compared to
our long-term partnership,

326
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,720
these few days will prove worthwhile.

327
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,840
You have ten minutes.

328
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,800
Ten minutes?

329
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,920
How is it possible to revise
in ten minutes?
