(Qin Mo, Captain Detective of Beizhou)
This guy is a real tough cookie.

When he was in his teens,

144

146
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,080

he stabbed her and her lover.

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,240
He pulled strings

149
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,000
and got his sentence

150
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,520

152
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,040
He recruited many lackeys in prison.

153
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,240
After release, he joined Master Jiu.

154
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,480

Tomorrow.

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,160

177
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,720
Count me in.

178

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,040
(This place matches my dream exactly.)

195
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,400
(Was Zhang Wange here too?)

196
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,920
Freeze! Police!

197
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,320
You... You're actually a cop?

198
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,160
We run a legitimate business!

199
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,520
Just singing, no other services!

200
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
Don't arrest me!

201
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,880
I had nothing to do with it!

202
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,680
Escort them to the station.

203
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,720
Captain Lu,

204
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,120
everyone's here.

205
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,440
But

206
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
Meng got away.

207
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,240
We've sent men.

208
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,520
What about the girls?
How to handle them next?

209
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
We've notified their families.

210
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,400
But there's one...

211
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,640
Stay away!

212
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Stay away!

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,880
(Zhang Wange,)

214
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,800
(that day, I seemed to enter your world)

215
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,920
(and witnessed your suffering.)

216
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't be afraid.

217
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm a policeman.

218
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,920
You're safe now.

219
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:49,728
(Taoyue, Missing Girl)

220
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,480
Boss.

221
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,520
Trouble!

222
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,200
Meng's establishment got raided.

223
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,200
And they took witnesses.

224
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,120
Where's Meng?

225
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,360
He has escaped.

226
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,760
Who's investigating this?

227
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,040
Investigation team.

228
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,640
Lu Ye.

229
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,120
Lu Ye?

230
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,080
Yeah.

231
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,120
Find me a group

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,520
of outlaws.

233
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,840
But Big Boss said not to touch him.

234
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,120
Whatever he says,

235
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,040
I don't care.

236
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,800
Even if the gods descend today,

237
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,840
I'll still kill him.

238
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,520
Go.

239
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,080
Yes.

240
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:33,440
(Rong City Station)

241
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,720
Zhao Qing,

242
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
regarding the disappearances
over these years,

243
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,960
what's the probability

244
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960
of finding parents?

245
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,680
Depends on their age
when they went missing.

246
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
Generally speaking,

247
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,440
older children

248
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,120
retain more memories.

249
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,080
What if they've been

250
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,360
missing since childhood?

251
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
That's more complicated.

252
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
The trail would be

253
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,280
too cold.

254
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,360
Let's go.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,480
Lu,

256
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
who is it?

257
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:09,880
Just

258
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,520
asking casually.

259
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:19,880
Move. Quickly.

260
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,440
This way.

261
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,720
Hurry! Get her out!

262
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:27,760
Lu!

263
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,240
Now!

264
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,440
Who sent you?

265
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,640
(Lu,)

266
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,680
what do you think of my girls?

267
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,328
Where'd you live?

268
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,200
Zhang Wange!

269
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,440
Lu,

270
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,200
you're awake.

271
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,200
Here.

272
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,320
Luckily, the wound wasn't fatal.

273
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,240
Here,

274
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,000
water.

275
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,400
What about those men?

276
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,600
Those

277
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,760
are desperate thugs.

278
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,160
They wouldn't talk.

279
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,360
And the girl?

280
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,280
She's at the hospital.

281
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,480
Family's been notified.

282
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,600
Though

283
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,120
she's too traumatized

284
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,400
to give useful leads.

285
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,600
Understandable.

286
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,200
(Why do these dreams
keep recurring lately?)

287
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
(What do they mean?)

288
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,040
(They're just dreams.)

289
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,600
(Why do they feel so real?)
