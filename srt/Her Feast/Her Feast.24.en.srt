Don't stay at your place.

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
I've told my former female colleague.

Ma'am,

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,680
the other day,

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,480
I met Siya's adoptive father
on the street.

64
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,360
But

65
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,960
I didn't dare bring him back
without consulting others.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,320
I'm afraid Siya still resents

67
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,880
what I did before

68
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,240
and won't accept my goodwill.

69
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,680
Good girl.

70
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,680
Your thoughtfulness is commendable.

71
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,520
How about this?

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,960
Let me handle this.

73
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,440
Madam,

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,840
where's Wange?

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,720
I haven't seen her in over a year.

76
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,000
Though she doesn't acknowledge me,

77
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,080
after raising her for over a decade,

78
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
I still care for her.

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,960
Don't worry,

80
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,560
I'll arrange a meeting soon.

81
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,440
Rest in the guest room first.

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,720
Thank you, Madam.

83
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,840
Thanks.

84
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,520
(That brat actually
become rich from rags?)

85
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,080
(I'm not letting you off the hook.)

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,920
Enjoy it.

87
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
Wait.

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,080
Any other requests, sir?

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come massage me.

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,600
We don't do that here.

91
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
Really?

92
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
Sir, what are you doing?

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Don't come closer!

94
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,880
I'll teach you properly.

95
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,080
Mom!

96
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,760
Mom,

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
Siya's return

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,600
is a blessing for us.

99
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
We should thank many people,

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,760
like Siya's adoptive parents.

101
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,320
What a coincidence.

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,640
Yesterday

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I happened to meet him.

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,120
After deeper conversation,

105
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
I realized he's Siya's adoptive father.

106
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,520
(So it was Zhou Nian
who bailed out Gao Jianping.)

107
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,360
He said he hadn't seen Siya in a year

108
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,280
and misses her dearly.

109
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,120
So I took the liberty to bring him back.

110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,840
Siya,

111
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,920
do you want to see him?

112
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
Mother just returned home.

113
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,400
Why did you bring outsiders here?

114
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,440
Yunru,

115
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,320
how could he be an outsider?

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
He raised Wange

117
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,400
through hardship.

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,320
Madam, ma'am,

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
someone just saw a disheveled maid

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,760
crying in the hallway.

121
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,960
When questioned,

122
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
she said the guest tried to...

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,040
What?

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
Tie him up!

125
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,960
The police already arrested him.

126
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
Let go! I'm Miss Zhou's guest!

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
Shut up!

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
M-Miss Zhou,

129
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,200
save... save me!

130
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
What nonsense!

131
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,200
M-Miss Zhou,

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,520
please put in a good word for me!

133
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,160
You asked me to expose Zhang Wange!

134
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,200
You can't abandon me now!

135
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,784
No.

136
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,760
No, I didn't!

137
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,040
N-No!

138
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,560
Seems you got played

139
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,080
and stabbed in the back.

140
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,040
They needed a pawn,

141
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,840
and you eagerly volunteered.

142
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
Perfectly manipulated.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,480
Right, Miss Zhou?

144
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,240
Take him away.

145
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,560
Yes!

146
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,480
Zhang Wange!

147
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,400
You wench.

148
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,040
This must be your doing!

149
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,200
You'll pay for this!

150
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,840
So you're her backer!

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
I should've known!

152
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,480
Your Rong City Police Department

153
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,760
serves decent meals.

154
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Mr. Lu, sorry to trouble you again.

155
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
No trouble at all.

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,600
Take him.

157
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Move!

158
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,920
Zhou Nian!

159
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,360
We have treated you well
all these years.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yet you keep stirring up trouble
repeatedly.

161
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,440
You had ill intentions
even when you were young.

162
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,560
Now after over a decade,

163
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,960
you show no remorse!

164
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
You think

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,920
Siya stole your position,

166
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,760
so you're jealous?

167
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,600
But don't you know

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you were never

169
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,880
a true Zhou by blood!

170
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,440
No.

171
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,520
Mom,

172
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,760
since Siya returned,

173
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,280
I moved out.

174
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,120
I got homesick

175
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,160
and could only call home.

176
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,200
I... I was just scared.

177
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,600
I was scared that...

178
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,360
I...

179
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,440
Scared?

180
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
What are you scared of?

181
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,920
During these years,

182
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
I've treated you

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,640
as my own child!

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,880
Even your marriage prospects

185
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,640
were carefully chosen.

186
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,600
Do you know how Siya
survived these decades?

187
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
While you enjoyed luxury,

188
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,840
she struggled to survive alone!

189
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,440
I believed

190
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,600
my kindness to you would extend to her.

191
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,520
But you?

192
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,240
You kept exploiting her!

193
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,440
Years ago, you plagiarized her work,

194
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,400
and then repeatedly sabotaged her.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,400
Living at Lanshui Mansion

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
was unfair to you?

197
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,520
Did it lack any comfort there?

198
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
I've forgiven you countless times.

199
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,400
I won't relent this time!

200
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,280
Mom.

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,640
Guys, I need you all to be
my witnesses today.

202
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
The adoptive relationship
between Zhou Nian and us

203
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,240
is hereby terminated.

204
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,560
No, Mom.

205
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,280
Mom, no! Please don't!

206
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,280
I know I was wrong!

207
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Please forgive me, Mom!

208
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
From now on,

209
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,880
you'll no longer bear the Zhou surname.

210
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,360
No, Mom.

211
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,000
Sometimes, the artist's name

212
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,760
matters less

213
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,720
than their status.

214
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
(Zhou Nian,)

215
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,680
(you've ultimately paid the price
for this status.)

216
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,400
Lu Ye,

217
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,520
thank you.

218
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,320
Wange,

219
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,800
you've

220
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,680
never shared stories
of your childhood with me.

221
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,560
It's been so long.

222
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,400
I don't even know where to begin.

223
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,120
Say what you have to say.

224
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,560
I want to hear.

225
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,040
Then let me tell you

226
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,320
about my adoptive mother.

227
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,320
Alright.

228
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,360
She was an exceptionally
wonderful woman,

229
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,280
gentle and kind-hearted.

230
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,760
(She told me)

231
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,080
(wherever life plants you,)

232
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,160
(sink roots downward)

233
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,800
(and bloom upward.)

234
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,600
(Never betray yourself.)

235
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
(I loved painting.)

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,280
(Though she had little money,)

237
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,200
(she exhausted herself supporting me)

238
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,360
(and nurtured my dreams.)

239
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,440
(Later she fell ill,)

240
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,840
(while Gao Jianping gambled away
all our family savings.)

241
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,720
(Without treatment,)

242
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,440
(she developed health issues.)

243
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
Gao Jianping, return our money!

244
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,040
Get lost!

245
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
You must have felt so lost then.

246
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,480
Right?

247
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,160
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

248
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,600
It's fine.

249
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm actually quite happy today.

250
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,360
Why?

251
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
Because for so many years,

252
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,840
I've handled everything alone.

253
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,560
Today all these people

254
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,640
standing up for me and seeking justice

255
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,240
is an entirely new experience.

256
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,760
As if

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,880
I find a family.

258
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,360
Zhang Wange,

259
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,120
come with me.

260
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,200
Where to?

261
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,720
You'll see.

262
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,840
Why is he here?

263
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,480
Wange,

264
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,000
watch it.

265
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,760
Personally,

266
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,080
I don't advocate violence.

267
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,280
But I'll accept violence
against violence.

268
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,040
Your turn.

269
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,152
Take it.

270
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,288
Aim carefully.

271
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,360
Wait!

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,840
Beg for mercy,

273
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,640
if you want to live.

274
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,200

You can't do this to me!

277
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,160
I was wrong before!

278
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,080
But I'll change!

279
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,120
I swear I'll change, Wange!

280
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,560
I'll change! From now on, I'll change!

281
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,640
Forgive me!

282
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,960

283

Did you help drive Zhou Nian

out of Zhou family?

363
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:17,572

00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:29,132
if someone in business

367
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:31,572
trips you up and leaves you reeling,

368
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:34,252
wouldn't you retaliate

369
00:18:34,772 --> 00:18:37,172
when you recover?

370
00:18:38,132 --> 00:18:39,332
Not just retaliate.

371
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,932
I'd make them pay a thousandfold.

372
00:19:01,332 --> 00:19:02,052
Mr. Song,

373
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:05,372
since you still care,

374
00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:07,332
why not ask Wange to come back?

375
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:13,052
I gave her up once.

376
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:14,932
But circumstances have changed now.

377
00:19:14,932 --> 00:19:16,132

378
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:17,212
That's not the point.

379
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,932
Love gives you one chance.

380
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:26,892
If you didn't help
when she needed it most,

381
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:30,492
why offer luxuries
now when she's thriving?

382
00:19:31,972 --> 00:19:34,692
