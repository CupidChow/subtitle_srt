Yanzhou,

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,000
Mr. Gao has already made his decision.

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,200
There's no need to waste any more time.

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,880
It's just ten more minutes.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,280
Does your team
lack even this little confidence?

I...

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,560
You can begin.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,160
Let's do it.

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,880

You're healed.

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,720

00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,560

00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,680

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
Okay.

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,680
No problem.

79
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,280
Yanzhou,

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,320
one word from you

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,760
changed my deal with Weina Jewels.

82
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,120
This is completely unfair to me!

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,520
Come with me.

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,160
May it go well.

85
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah, of course.

86
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,000
Yanzhou! Yanzhou!

87
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,680
Explain this.

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,720
This...

89
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
Yanzhou,

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
why are you showing me this?

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,960
What is it?

92
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,960
On the right is the manager from Cuican.

93
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,320
Your subordinate

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
meet with him

95
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,200
privately.

96
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,440
Are you saying she

97
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,920
betrayed Chenda?

98
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,080
I didn't know.

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,200
You didn't know?

100
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Then I'll let them

101
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,960
come in and ask.

102
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Yanzhou.

103
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,840
Yanzhou.

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
Yanzhou.

105
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,800
The representative of Cuican
is on the way.

106
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,520
They'll have a chance
to talk face-to-face

107
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,520
and ask your subordinate

108
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,200
who gave her the audacity to do this?

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
Regarding this,

110
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,080
someone must take responsibility

111
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,920
for Chenda's losses.

112
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,280
Later,

113
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,160
I'll see how tight-lipped she really is.

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,440
Of course.

115
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
I have numerous ways

116
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
to make her talk.

117
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,200
Yanzhou.

118
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
Yanzhou.

119
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,360
No, listen to me.

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,400
It's not what you think. I...

121
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,560
Still not ready to admit it?

122
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,000
Yanzhou,

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
I was wrong.

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,640
Can you forgive me?

126
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,320
I acted foolishly
in a moment of weakness.

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,920
I truly didn't mean to.

128
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,160
I can forgive you.

129
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,960
The company will hold
a press conference.

130
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
Your name

131
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,960
will be struck

132
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,800
from the list.

133
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,520
No, please!

134
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,360
Yanzhou,

135
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,840
being struck is a career-ending blow

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,080
in the design world.

137
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,680
Even if companies remain ambiguous,

138
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,240
the rumor mill runs wild.

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,360
My reputation
will be permanently tainted.

140
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,480
Zhou Nian,

141
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,360
mistakes require accountability.

142
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,720
No.

143
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,640
No, Yanzhou.

144
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,240
Give me another chance.

145
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,840
That painting was remarkable.

146
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,680
Indeed.

147
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,080
- It owes to Miss Zhang.
- Absolutely.

148
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,920
Jeff.

149
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,520
How did Mr. Song know

150
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,360
Zhou Nian was behind this?

151
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,840
Perhaps it's divine insight?

152
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,240
To divine insight.

153
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,360
Coffee?

154
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
No whiskey?

155
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,920
Is that unacceptable?

156
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,280
Fine.

157
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Cheers.

158
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,120
Come on.

159
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,080
Great work.

160
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,920
Mr. Song has arranged

161
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,680
these celebratory gifts for you all.

162
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
- Thank you!
- One for each person.

163
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,760
Here, Jeff.

164
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
I get one too?

165
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,800
Naturally.

166
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Thank you.

167
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,960
Fang Cheng, where's mine?

168
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,000
Mr. Song said
you should choose your own.

169
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,160
Just go.

170
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,560
Pick what you like.

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,440
Try this one.

172
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
They all seem quite good.

173
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,120
Perhaps consult your husband's opinion?

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,400
He

175
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
isn't...

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,280
The scent

177
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,120
is rather pleasant.

178
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,120
Wrap them all up.

179
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,960
Okay.

180
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,880
Thank you.

181
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,160
But greater thanks go to

182
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,120
those extra ten minutes you gave me.

183
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm also grateful you

184
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,640
stayed true to design.

185
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,200
It would've been
Chenda's loss otherwise.

186
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
Mr. Song, you do jest.

187
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,400
Zhang Wange,

188
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,000
do you love Pei Xun?

189
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
What?

190
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
Let me rephrase.

191
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
I'll break off my engagement.

192
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,360
You break up with Pei Xun.

193
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,120
Agreed?

194
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
Song Yanzhou,

195
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
you've got nerve.

196
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,960
With so many women to choose from,

197
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
why target her specifically?

198
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,080
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
You're asking for death.

200
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,240
You know my connection with Wange.

201
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,080
She's my woman.

202
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,160
Your woman?

203
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,560
How is she your woman in any sense?

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,560
You've had so many fleeting affairs.

205
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Lost count yet?

206
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Besides,

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
when you sent her to me initially,

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,440
I already knew your intentions.

209
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,920
Isn't this

210
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,640
just what you wanted?

211
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,280
(Yes.)

212
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,800
(I sent her to you.)

213
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,240
Pei Xun,

214
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,400
I owe you this time.

215
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,080
But as for Zhang Wange,

216
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,800
she's mine for sure.

217
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
Song Yanzhou,

218
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,560
Senior Song prioritizes power.

219
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,200
Do you think he'll indulge you

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,920
in bringing her into the Song family?

221
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,400
How utterly naive.

222
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,080
(I absolutely can't let him)

223
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,280
(notice Zhang Wange.)

224
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
(Otherwise...)

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,840
Mr. Song,

226
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,520
what brings you here?

227
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,120
I'm picking up my girlfriend.

228
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
Any problem?

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,040
There she is.

230
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
Pei Xun? What are you doing here?

231
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,560
Are you alright?

232
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
I know you care for your employees.

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,920
But protecting her

234
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,280
is overstepping, isn't it?

235
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,200
I'm still here.

236
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,360
Let's go.

237
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,400
We're leaving.

238
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,640
Never expected Song Yanzhou
to treat you so well.

239
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,120
I worried you might get bullied here.

240
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,200
When does that cold man

241
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,600
know how to play the gentleman?

242
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,480
Just a casual gesture of help.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,160
Mr. Song always maintains
professional boundaries.

244
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,520
Why did you come here today?

245
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,520
You're mine now.

246
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,760
Naturally I should be nearby
at all times.

247
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
An invitation to Karen Pieno's banquet.

248
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,360
I recall you admire him.

249
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,200
Let's attend tomorrow.

250
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,960
(You played executioner back then,)

251
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
(severing my path forward.)

252
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,400
(Now you're playing savior.)

253
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,000
(How utterly absurd.)

254
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,200
Lu,

255
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,960
more girls have gone missing.

256
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,480
All visited the same place.

257
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,360
Where?

258
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,200
Yuesheng Tower.

259
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,720
Sun Er's territory.

260
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,320
Sun Er?

261
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,360
Where is he now?

262
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,520
He went to Lanhai Bay.

263
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,680
Claimed to watch an opera.

264
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,040
Don't worry.

265
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,200
I sent some spies.

266
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,360
He won't escape.

267
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,920
Since when does Lanhai Bay

268
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,280
even have an opera show?

269
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,120
Let's go take a look.

270
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
Karen.

271
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
Today, I'll introduce you

272
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,680
the designer who solved

273
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,000
our collaboration crisis.

274
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,960
Hello.

275
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,280
Where is Master Sun?

276
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,464
(Mo Ran, Zhang Wange's old friend)
(Mo Ran?)

277
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,560
(Dress properly and eat your meal.)

278
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,400
(My life's already mired in filth.)

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,040
(But you're different.)

280
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,800
(You still have escape opportunities.)

281
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
Miss Zhang.

282
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,920
Miss Zhang, where are you going?

283
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,000
Mr. Song's waiting for you.

284
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,800
Ms. Mo.

285
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,520
What a jade-like beauty.

286
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,120
Shouldn't you be pampered and protected?

287
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,760
Why pursue improper endeavors?

288
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,000
What do you mean?

289
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,760
Ms. Mo,

290
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,520
you know perfectly well,

291
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,160
yet ask my intentions?

292
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,960
If I say

293
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,920
this is for self-defense,

294
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,600
would you believe me?

295
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,440
I could trust you,

296
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,560
but not Master Jiu.

297
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,000
He's been wanting me dead for ages.

298
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,920
Your distrust of Master Jiu.

299
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,680
What does it have to do with me?

300
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,480
No wonder you're a true performer.

301
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,720
You act on stage and off.

302
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,320
Once you

303
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,240
cross the bridge, drink the soup,
and descend below,

304
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,520
never do these things again.

305
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,040
You're truly far-sighted.

306
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,320
If I really used a gun on you,

307
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,520
the noise alone

308
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,840
would trap me here.

309
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,360
Lu, our informant says

310
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,920
Sun Er is upstairs.

311
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,560
(This scent is...)

312
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,920
(Let go.)

313
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,520
(Let me go!)

314
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,640
(Let me go!)

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,880
(Let me go!)

316
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
(Back off!)

317
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,960
Wange.
