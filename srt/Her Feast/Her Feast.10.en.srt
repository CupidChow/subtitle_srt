00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,200
Lu.

00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,600
Mr. Song,

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,520
Miss Zhang is here.

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,720

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,160
Zhang Wange.

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
(She's burning up.)

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Is that you?

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,880
Mr. Song.

52
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,240
No need to trouble you.

53
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,960
I'll take care of my woman.

54
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,560
Lu,

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,400
are you okay?

56
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,720
Why are you here?

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,632
Why not watching her?

58
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,770
I heard noises outside.

59
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,610
I worried about you.

60
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Miss Zhang's friend just picked her up.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Master Jiu.

62
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,480
I'm free today.

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
Here to get you.

64
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,360
Are you hurt?

65
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
No.

66
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
It's Sun Er's blood.

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,840
Just need to wash up.

68
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,960
(Master Jiu of Beizhou, He Jiu)
Drive.

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,200
(My girls here
are professionally trained.)

70
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,960
(Do whatever you want.)

71
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,560
(Shen,)

72
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,080
(this batch of Corn Poppy makes people
even more intoxicated.)

73
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,360
Zhang Wange...

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
(Why would I have such a dream?)

75
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:49,152
Lu,

76
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:50,360
all staff at Lanhai Bay

77
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,320
have been investigated.

78
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,120
None saw Sun Er's killer.

79
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,120
What about her?

80
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,720
Her?

81
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
Lu,

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
you suspect that woman

83
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,440
killed Sun Er?

84
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,600
Given her state that day,

85
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,720
how could she have murdered

86
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,080
Sun Er silently?

87
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,720
- Then...
- Go check.

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,560
Why was she at Lanhai Bay that night?

89
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,440
Okay.

90
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,280
Got it.

91
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Oh, right.

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,400
Look into someone else for me.

93
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,840
He's known

94
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,520
as Master Meng.

95
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,800
Master Meng?

96
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,160
He runs flesh trade.

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,720
Regular at clubs.

98
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,040
Lu,

99
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,360
any other identifiers?

100
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
That's too broad.

101
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,720
Like a needle in the haystack.

102
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,720
In his forties.

103
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,760
Here on this spot,

104
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,480
there's a tiger tattoo.

105
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,760
Okay.

106
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,440
(Could this person be real?)

107
00:07:48,576 --> 00:07:49,720
(Why would I be there)

108
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,800
(with Zhang Wange?)

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Get out now!

110
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,208
(Dying's easy.)

111
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,760
(Surviving abyss is hard.)

112
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,600
Mo Ran!

113
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,120
Mo Ran!

114
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,440
(It can't be.)

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
(Must've been mistaken.)

116
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,000
(Mo Ran wouldn't be here.)

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
What's Nian been up to lately?

118
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Haven't heard anything from her.

119
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,160
Miss Zhou has had some fiction

120
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
with Song Yanzhou's new assistant.

121
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,320
Apart from that,

122
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,160
Song Yanzhou overruled Miss Zhou.

123
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,200
Let his assistant meddle
with the jewelry design.

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,440
This upset Miss Zhou.

125
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,600
The new assistant, huh?

126
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,400
Background checked?

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
Confirmed. Just an ordinary background.

128
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,120
But she's rather close to Song Yanzhou.

129
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,440
That might be

130
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
the exact reason
for Miss Zhou's displeasure.

131
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,960
Since Nian dislikes her,

132
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,040
just make up a reason

133
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,760
to get rid of her at Chenda.

134
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
Understood.

135
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,000
Zhang Wange!

136
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
Who's this guy?

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,640
No idea.

138
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,520
Wange!

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,000
What terrible manners!

140
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
So it's really you.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
(Gao Jianping, Zhang Wange's adoptive father)
Never expected

142
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,520
you'd land a job here.

143
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,480
Look how successful you've become!

144
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
I brought you home

145
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,824
(Young Zhang Wange)
not to raise you for free.

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,560
You owe me something in return.

147
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,560
Now that you're doing so well.

148
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,120
Did you forget about me?

149
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,160
Lately,

150
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,360
I've been itching

151
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,320
to gamble a bit.

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
Don't you think you should help?

153
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,440
If it weren't for me

154
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,080
feeding and clothing you,

155
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,320
would you be here today?

156
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,680
What did you provide me?

157
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,560
If my mom and I

158
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,120
didn't pay your debts off,

159
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,000
you'd be dead.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,880
Cut the crap.

161
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,400
You have no money?

162
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,080
A shameless girl like you

163
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,760
is never the decent type.

164
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,120
Bet you've already

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,000
climbed into

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
your boss's bed.

167
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,880
Go beg him for money then!

168
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,880
I cut ties with you long ago.

169
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
Not a single penny from me.

170
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,280
- How dare you leave?
- What are you doing?

171
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,160
You're

172
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,600
such an ungrateful girl!

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,320
- Let me go!
- I worked so hard raising you.

174
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,440
I gave you fine food and clothes!

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,320
When your mom and I

176
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,720
went to the orphanage to adopt,

177
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,520
we originally wanted a son.

178
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
I took you home out of pity.

179
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,720
You've dragged your mother to her grave.

180
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,760
How can you watch me

181
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
rot away like this?

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,360
I don't mind dying alone,

183
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,480
but why don't you visit

184
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,280
your long-dead mom?

185
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Dad.

186
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,240
Dad, let's stop this, okay?

187
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,360
I'll find you a place to stay first.

188
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,600
Get settled in,

189
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
alright?

190
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,160
Gao Jianping,

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,360
do you want to go back to prison?

192
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
What do you mean?

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,720
Who sent you to prison

194
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,000
eight years ago?

195
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,520
It was you.

196
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,320
- You did it!
- Let go.

197
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,080
So it was you who ruined me!

198
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
Go die!

199
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,880
Take him out.

200
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
Let me go.

201
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
You did this to me!

202
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,120
You ruined me!

203
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,880
You just wait!

204
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,440
Are you okay?

205
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
You're smart enough

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,840
to protect yourself.

207
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,800
Earlier,

208
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,640
what happened?

209
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,160
It's fine.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
No need to talk

211
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
if you don't want to.

212
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,560
He's my adoptive father.

213
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
When I was five,

214
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,200
he took me from the orphanage.

215
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,280
Later he was sent to prison.

216
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,480
Our relationship ended

217
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,080
when I came of age.

218
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,960
After his release,

219
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
he somehow found out my whereabouts

220
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
and came looking for me.

221
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
(Is it Zhou Nian again?)

222
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,080
What did he go to prison for?

223
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
Behave yourself.

224
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Shameless woman!

225
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,240
Zhang Wange!

226
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
You shameless woman!

227
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,800
Wait!

228
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
Who is Zhang Wange to you?

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,120
This shameless woman

230
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,400
is my daughter.

231
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,440
I fed and clothed her

232
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
for all these years.

233
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,280
Now she's turning against me!

234
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,840
- Stop the noise!
- Shameless woman.

235
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,480
- Let's go!
- Shameless woman!

236
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,000
Gao Jianping is a gambler.

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,200
Eight years in prison.

238
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,840
He walked out yesterday.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,680
He's still acting up.

240
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,680
What was his crime?

241
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,400
Attempted rape

242
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,600
of adopted daughter.

243
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,000
Such a fool.

244
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,480
Lu.

245
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't worry.

246
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,320
He won't trouble you again.

247
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
At the very least,

248
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,080
he'll never step foot in Chenda.

249
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,680
Mr. Song,

250
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,920
sometimes I really envy you.

251
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,840
You've got

252
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,800
everything

253
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
under control.

254
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,120
Nothing shakes you.

255
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,160
Not exactly.

256
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,880
For ordinary families,

257
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,800
family bonds mean love and legacy.

258
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,840
But for families

259
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,440
which use marriages
to secure wealth and status,

260
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,480
one child is enough.

261
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,960
More children

262
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,280
are just burdens.

263
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,720
You hate her for stealing your designs.

264
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,080
I hate her for stealing my freedom.

265
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,160
(So he kept me close)

266
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
(to use me against Zhou Nian.)

267
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
We'll both win next,

268
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,920
if you dare to gamble.

269
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
Fang Cheng'll send you home.

270
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,520
Get some rest.

271
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,800
Thank you, Mr. Song.

272
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,840
(But I never believed)

273
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,520
(in princes saving princesses.)

274
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,440
Let me go!

275
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,680
(I save myself.)

276
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,040
Miss Zhou, Gao Jianping's been arrested.

277
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,880
What?

278
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,720
That useless fool!

279
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
(Zhang Wange,)

280
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,600
