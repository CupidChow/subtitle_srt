12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,520
Breaking news!

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,480
(Chenda Capital)
Lady Meng Lixian of the Pei family died.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,600
Back then, the Meng family
was prestigious in Rong City.

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,760
Anything can happen

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,560
before tomorrow.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,640
(Why would it be their matriarch?)

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,440
(Recalling my past life,)

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,280
(it was after the death)

20
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,240
(The past life)
(of other two sons)

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,320
(that Pei Xun controlled the Pei family)

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,760
(and sold off the jade business.)

23
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,640
(Meng Lixian, wife of Pei Qishan, died)
(Why would the matriarch die first?)

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,720
(Could I have altered the outcome?)

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,720
(Will Pei Xun's fate remain unchanged?)

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
The case isn't clear,

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,360
yet you let the papers report it?

28
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
Died of illness?

29
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,480
Meng Lixian's death is suspicious.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,464
What now?

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,040
You claim she was murdered,

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,760
so she was?

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,760
Where's your proof?

34
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,560
Based on Pei Qishan and Meng Lixian's

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
family disputes,

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
you want to make an arrest?

37
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,160
Do you know who Pei Qishan is?

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,440
Who is he?

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,760
Master,

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,720
we can find evidence together.

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,240
Lu Ye, listen to me.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
Focus on your own duty.

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,080
Fine.

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,000
Then tell me, Mr. Lin,

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,040
what are my duties?

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,880
You...

47
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm doing this for your own good!

48
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,640
Thank you for coming, Mr. Zheng.

49
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,920
(Zheng Bangye)
You think with Lixian childless,

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,480
the Meng family's assets will be yours?

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
I don't know what you're implying.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,680
I know Lixian's death
has devastated you.

53
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,240
Stop pretending to be righteous!

54
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,040
Mr. Zheng,

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,280
respect the deceased.

56
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,960
Surely the matriarch

57
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,880
wouldn't want to see you like this.

58
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
(Three months have passed,)

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,600
(now that things have settled,
I want to share this.)

60
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,200
(Remember our Oxford days)

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,920
(when I preached independence,)

62
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,480
(vowing to live for myself,)

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
(never wanting children.)

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,760
(I never imagined)

65
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,600
(I'd become a mother.)

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,360
(It's miraculous.)

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,800
(Watching him grow inside me,)

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,160
(I've rediscovered the meaning
of motherhood.)

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,280
(I want to give him so much)

70
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,600
(and let him stand on my shoulders)

71
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,480
(to see the world.)

72
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,200
(I want to tell him)

73
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,160
(that the business
his grandfather and I built)

74
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,200
(is vast enough.)

75
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,320
(He can pursue his passions)

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,520
(and follow his dreams.)

77
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,600
(As for my divorce from Pei Qishan,)

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,640
(I'll postpone it.)

79
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,520
(At least during his childhood,)

80
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
(he should have a father.)

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,880
(I should've returned earlier.)

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
Excuse me, are you Mr. Zheng?

83
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,320
Someone asked me to give you this.

84
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,040
Xun,

85
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,400
remember me?

86
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm Lixian's friend.

87
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,120
Mr. Zheng.

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,680
There are some things about her

89
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,760
I want to show you.

90
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,840
Mr. Zheng,

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
let's stop beating around the bush.

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,720
Youth lack patience today.

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,120
These are letters she sent

94
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,880
to friends during pregnancy.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,880
At that time,

96
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,200
she planned to sue Pei Qishan
for divorce,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,200
but the pregnancy changed everything.

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,000
(Meng Lixian's letter)
She risked her life

99
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,960
carrying her child.

100
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,240
Yet the child didn't survive.

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,600
We thought it was fate.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,160
Until today, I discovered

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,240
that child is actually alive.

104
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,400
Are you joking?

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
If the child truly lived,

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,400
would he be gone all these years?

107
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,760
Look at this first.

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,320
That's me?

109
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,960
Isn't the switched-at-birth trope

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
too cliche?

111
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
I respect you for age.

112
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,400
But if you're messing with me,

113
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
then it's not fun.

114
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Your so-called mother

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,040
had lost her fertility

116
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,640
before you were even conceived.

117
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,960
This is Tang Ting's medical report

118
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,040
from sixteen years ago.

119
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
Do you think I'll believe

120
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
your fabricated stories?

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,800
I might fabricate lies,

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,640
but evidence doesn't.

123
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,640
I don't believe it.

124
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,840
Go investigate yourself.

125
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,560
The evidence won't lie.

126
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
But kid,

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,480
I hope you'll always stay vigilant

128
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,240
towards everyone, no matter when.

129
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Look.

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,280
What has Pei Qishan done to you?

131
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,840
Every single one of countless projects

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
you've initiated was sabotaged

133
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
by Pei Qishan,

134
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,840
and reduced to worthless plans.

135
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,600
He gave you money,

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
inflating your ambitions,

137
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,160
and then made you realize

138
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,600
you're nothing but a useless one.

139
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you think he truly cares for you?

140
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,880
He's spent a lot of money on you.

141
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,520
But do you know

142
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,400
since last century,

143
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,320
the wealth

144
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,720
of the Meng family exceeded
the entire assets of Rong City?

145
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,720
Now it's all been

146
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,880
seized and squandered by him.

147
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,040
Even

148
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,720
your birth mother's death

149
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,400
was arranged by him.

150
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,712
(Tang Ting's medical report)

151
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:01,792
(Treatment method: Hysterectomy)

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,800
Every grievance finds its source.

153
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,360
Move on to your next life.

154
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,080
Don't misjudge people again.

155
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,920
Amitabha.

156
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Move on.

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't misjudge people again.

158
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,360
You scared me to death.

159
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,120
Where have you been?

160
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
Your father asked about you.

161
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:31,720
Mom,

162
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,040
do you have my childhood photos?

163
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,760
Why?

164
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,480
I just want to see.

165
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,040
You were too mischievous as a child

166
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,840
to sit still for photos.

167
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,840
Was it me refusing?

168
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,920
Or were there never any taken?

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,120
By the way, why didn't you
have more children?

170
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,400
Why ask this suddenly?

171
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,840
Dad's third wife has several children.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Quite enviable.

173
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,640
That is not easy.

174
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,360
It's fate.

175
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,640
Ms. Meng's child

176
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,400
was about my age.

177
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,040
What?

178
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,280
Just curious.

179
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,200
Why wasn't he born?

180
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,200
He was born.

181
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,520
A few days older than you.

182
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,240
He wasn't blessed.

183
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,880
Born without breath.

184
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,000
The matriarch took it very hard.

185
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,640
Don't mention this to your father.

186
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,120
Understood.

187
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,640
Whether one is blessed or not...

188
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,560
Does heaven decide that?

189
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,160
Or oneself?

190
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
It's late.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
Go get some rest.

192
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,040
(Why the brakes fail?)

193
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,960
It crashed so badly?

194
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,080
Horrifying.

195
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,200
Terrible collision.

196
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
I wonder if anyone survived.

197
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,920
(Pei Xun.)

198
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,880
(Pei Xun.)

199
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
(Pei Xun.)

200
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,960
(Pei Xun.)

201
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,920
(Pei Xun, are you okay?)

202
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,440
(Pei Xun.)

203
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,200
(Renji Hospital)

204
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Don't move.

205
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,080
What happened?

206
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,080
Car accident.

207
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,520
Don't remember?

208
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,080
Car accident?

209
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,960
(Even your mother's death)

210
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,560
(was arranged by him.)

211
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,240
(I hope you'll always stay vigilant)

212
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,440
(towards everyone.)

213
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,360
Why can't I see?

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,880
The doctor said

215
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,840
your optic nerve was severely damaged.

216
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,920
And you shattered your right calf.

217
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,360
No... Impossible. It can't be.

218
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,400
Pei Xun.

219
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,880
Pei Xun, calm down.

220
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Stay calm.

221
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Get out.

222
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Sir.

223
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,920
- Sir.
- Pei Xun.

224
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,720
Sir.

225
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,840
Let go of me.

226
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
Sir.

227
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,440
Let go of me.

228
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,280
- Sir.
- Sir.

229
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,800
Let go...

230
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,080
Sir, mind your wound.

231
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,880
Kill me.

232
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,800
I beg you to kill me.

233
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,840
Sir, don't do this.

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,160
Let me die.

235
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
Kill me.

236
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,240
Watch your wound.

237
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,800
Please kill me.

238
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,520
Sir.

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,080
Drink some water.

240
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,320
Zhang Wange,

241
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,040
go somewhere else.

242
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,800
Don't clutter my sight.

243
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,680
Clutter?

244
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,160
Can you even see?

245
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
No, I can't.

246
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,440
Then why keep hovering around me?

247
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,760
Don't you think you can

248
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,880
profit from me like this?

249
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
Profit from you?

250
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,480
What can you

251
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,200
possibly offer me now?

252
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
Then why follow me?

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,800
If it's about our relationship,

254
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,160
I can break up with you now.

255
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,680
Don't think I actually like you.

256
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,840
It's true.

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,560
Your initial aloof act

258
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,640
piqued my interest.

259
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,280
But someone as

260
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,640
mediocre and ordinary as you

261
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,600
who only relies on looks...

262
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,960
How could you call me ordinary?

263
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
I earn my life through hard work.

264
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,200
And you?

265
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,080
Leaning on family inheritance,

266
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
yet achieving nothing.

267
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,160
Wasting days on trivial pursuits.

268
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,680
You're proud of that?

269
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,520
Besides,

270
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,400
you look down on those

271
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
who cling to you for money.

272
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,800
Don't you think

273
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,800
they're after your charm?

274
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,040
It's always about your wealth.

275
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Is there a single cent that

276
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
truly belongs to you?

277
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,480
Frankly,

278
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,840
you're worse than those gold-diggers.

279
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,200
At least they

280
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,720
put effort into their schemes.

281
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,720
You...

282
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,160
From now on, live or die,

283
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,840
suit yourself.

284
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,960
But Pei Xun,

285
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
from now on,

286
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,560
I will thrive.

287
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,760
As for you,

288
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,200
just rot here.

289
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,160
When I occasionally remember you,

290
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,720
I'll visit your grave.

291
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,840
Zhang Wange.

292
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,920
Zhang Wange,

293
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,640
come back.

294
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,480

(no one truly understands
another's pain.)

296
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
(Only by wading through the same mire)

297
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
(will you realize)

298
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,280
