What to drink?

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,080
I have some liquor.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,360
No need.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,520
Congratulations to you

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
on breaking off the engagement.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,640
Exactly.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
My heart is so small

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,160
that it can only hold one.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,400
But you are different.

21
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,680
Didn't you like Zhou Nian before?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
Why

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,240
start to have your eye on her?

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Because of foolishness.

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,520
Everyone has moments of foolishness.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,280
But you

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,880
have always been clever.

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
Insufficient ability

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,440
means one can't even protect
the person he loves.

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
This was what you taught me.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,880
However,

32
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,720
you're still much like before,

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,560
always putting importance on

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,040
people who are not

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,440
interested in you.

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,840
Maybe this

37
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,520
is your unique quirk.

38
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
One thing puzzles me.

39
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,960
Didn't you always clash

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
with the matriarch?

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,240
Why play the dutiful son now?

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
You are still the same as before.

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,320
When hit on a sore spot,

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
you turn hostile.

45
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,480
You never

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,280
have empathy.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,720
You slapped me.

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,920
No farewells.

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Song Yanzhou,

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,720
do you think

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,520
you could end up with her?

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,680
It doesn't matter.

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,560
But if she had even
any affection for you,

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
she'd have been with you.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,520
You sent her to Chenda,

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
and wanted her to become

57
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,200
a thorn in Zhou Nian's side.

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,280
But in my memory,

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,680
Zhang Wange is driven

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,640
and never admits defeat.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,880
I admire her.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,360
So I knowingly

63
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,560
let her use tactics

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
and indulged her.

65
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,280
Until one day,

66
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,320
I saw her adoptive father

67
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,680
harassing her.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,960
Dare to leave?

69
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,480
Let go!

70
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,960
I realized she wasn't ordinary.

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,400
She made her way out of hellfire.

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
When I was ten, I caught chickenpox.

73
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,440
The fever wouldn't break.

74
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,200
(My adoptive father left me
to fend for myself.)

75
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,080
(Poor families adopt girls)

76
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,720
(just for extra labor)

77
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
(and bride price when grown).

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,960
(Her destitution showed everywhere).

79
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,280
(You ignored it)

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,440
(and found it amusing).

81
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,760
(My point is)

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,400
(if you care for her at all),

83
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,360
(stay away from her.)

84
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,360
(You saved me twice from harassment,)

85
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,360
(and got me a job).

86
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,440
(Pei Xun,)

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,480
(thank you).

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,000
(I'll let you have my wish too.)

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,840
(May all your future wishes)

90
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
(come true.)

91
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,760
(That fake nobility act of yours)

92
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,240
(piqued my interest.)

93
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,760
(I never seek justice)

94
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,360
(for her).

95
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,680
(Pathetic.)

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,600
(My regrets are few,)

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,720
(yet half of them involve her.)

98
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,640
Lu.

99
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,640
From our informant
planted in the Pei family.

100
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,008
(Pei Xun discovers his identity.)

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,280
Lu. A letter.

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,560
A letter?

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,240
A little beggar delivered it.

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,160
(Missing person's trail)
The missing person's trail shows leads.

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,200
(This handwriting...)

106
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,400
Lu,

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
what's in the letter?

108
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,496
Nothing.

109
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,240
The villain is dead.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,800
I will

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,880
eliminate the rest

112
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
one by one.

113
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,640
It's dirty.

114
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,040
You sent tip
to the police office earlier,

115
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,920
right?

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,680
Kid.

117
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,000
I put a servant

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,480
in the Pei family as my informant

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,440
when Meng Lixian died.

120
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,000
I never expected he got

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
the secret letter
you sent to Pei Qishan.

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,480
(When I knew Pei Qishan)

123
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,440
(was the perpetrator,)

124
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,800
(I swore)

125
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,360
(to make him pay for
that endless suffering.)

126
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Are you Mr. Zheng?

127
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,600
(I told Zheng Bangye)

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,520
(about Pei Xun's true identity.)

129
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,400
(And then I told Pei Qishan)

130
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,520
(his son had discovered the truth.)

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,320
(Originally Pei Xun might be hesitated,)

132
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,440
(but Pei Qishan struck first,)

133
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,920
(enraging him completely.)

134
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,000
(How ironic!)

135
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,720
(He died of)

136
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,320
(his most elaborate scheme,)

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,200
(dragging down two innocent sons)

138
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,640
(as sacrifices in this game.)

139
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,720
Mr. Lu,

140
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
will you arrest me?

141
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
Wange,

142
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,360
was I part of your plan too?

143
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,920
You could say meeting me
was an accident.

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,800
Your feelings for me were real.

145
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,400
Approaching me was genuine.

146
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Tell me!

147
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,440
Since you already know,

148
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,080
you should stay away from me.

149
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,400
What I'm doing now

150
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,960
won't stop because of you.

151
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,080
And I am

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,240
no longer

153
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,160

168
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,960
Mr. Lu,

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,880
long time no see.

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,800
Lu,

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,760
come visit me sometime.

172
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,480
Meng,

173
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,760
If you dare touch her,

174
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,560
you'll be dead.

175
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Mr. Lu,

176
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
as you know,

177
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,280
this isn't something

178
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,280
I can decide alone.

179
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,920
Miss Zhang,

180
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
did I hurt you?

181
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,560
Go now!

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,880
Don't!

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,800
Stop! Mo Ran!

184
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,520
Open the door! Mo Ran!

185
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,240
No!

186
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,960
Open up, Mo Ran!

187
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
Mo Ran!

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,120
So it's you.

189
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,080
Do you know me?

190
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,840
Seems I got the right person.

191
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,560
(In this lifetime,)

192
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
(I've never crossed paths with Meng.)

193
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,280
(Why is he here?)

194
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,160
Why did you kidnap me?

195
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,400
The policeman from Rong City

196
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,280
destroyed everything I built in Beizhou.

197
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,120
Therefore,

198
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,120
I'll make him taste

199
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,280
the bitterness of loss.

200
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,840
What?

201
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,680
What are you saying?

202
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,760
Lu Ye ruined me.

203
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,080
I won't spare him.

204
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,520
It's not enough for him to just die.

205
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,040
I'll subject him

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,960
to endless torment.

207
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,280
Don't worry.

208
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm merciful.

209
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
When he arrives,

210
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,840
I'll send you doomed lovers

211
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,880
both off together.

212
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,920
In your dreams!

213
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,400
You're not dead yet,

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,200
how could I die?

215
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,680
I'll outlive you!

216
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,360
Quite stubborn.

217
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,400
Unluckily,

218
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,640
we met at the wrong time.

219
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,440
Otherwise,

220
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,800
how could I bear to treat

221
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,360
such a stunning beauty this way?

222
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Don't worry.

223
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,440
When he arrives,

224
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,640
I'll send you both off together.

225
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
What will you do?

226
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,320
Wange!

227
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,040
Your rescuer is here.

228
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,032
Wange!

229
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,440
Lu Ye!

230
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,360
Meng,

231
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,680
let her go.

232
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,520
Mr. Lu,

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,240
you finally showed up.

234
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,640
If you lay a finger on her,

235
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,480
I swear

236
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
you'll die for sure.

237
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
You arrested so many of my men

238
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,560
and destroyed my Beizhou operations.

239
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,440
Shouldn't we settle this score

240
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
before anything else?

241
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,496
Attack!

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,400
You're so tough, huh?

243
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,120
If you fight back again...

244
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,560
Lu Ye, watch out!

245
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
Fight back, Lu Ye!

246
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,040
You have already been protective?

247
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,360
Meng,

248
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,440
is that all you've got?

249
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,000
Too scared to face me yourself?

250
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,040
I don't want to dirty my hands.

251
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,480
Get out of here!

252
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm fine.

253
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,520
Hand over your gun!

254
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,720
No! Leave now!

255
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,080
No!

256
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,520
Fine.

257
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,080
No!

258
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,040
Lu Ye, no!

259
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,320
You killed my right-hand men.

260
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll pay.

261
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,200
I'll pay!

262
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
Don't worry about me.

263
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,680
Don't worry about me.

264
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,680
No!

265
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,400
No!

266
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,960
Lu Ye!

267
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,520
Master Meng.

268
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,160
Have you decided?

269
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
- Master Meng!
- No tricks!

270
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,400
- Lu Ye!
- Master Meng!

271
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,320
No.

272
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
Enough?

273
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,080
Good.

274
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,120
You've got guts.

275
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,280
Toss your gun over.

276
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,960
Lu Ye,

277
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,120
are you hurt?

278
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm okay.

279
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,160
It's over now.

280
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,760
Did he hurt you?

281
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,600
Look out!

282
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,600
Lu Ye!

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Lu Ye!

284
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,240
(Why?)

285
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,160
(I've been given another chance.)

286
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,360
(Everything should have changed.)

287
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,440
(Why can't I protect anyone?)

288
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,040
(Why?)

289
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,640
Lu Ye is dead.

290
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,000
Now I'll send you to join him.

291
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,080
Just die!

292
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,040
You're the one who deserves to die!

293
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,800
Just die!

294
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,480
