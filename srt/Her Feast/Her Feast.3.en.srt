Go. Do as I say.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,000
Tell newspaper offices

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,720
to publish the news,

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,680
so those with ulterior motives

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
won't have any chance.

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,200
Okay.

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,640
Got it.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
The newspaper offices

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,720
refused to publish.

20
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,040
They said

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,560
the families of the victims

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
told them the victims

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
were all unmarried girls,

24
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,560
publishing this would
ruin their reputations.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,440
They're missing now. Why bother?

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,960
What should we do now?

27
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,440
If they refused, we'll do it.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,120
Please check out

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,000
these missing girls.

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
Their families

31
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,960
are suffering.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,440
Please stay vigilant

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,640
and protect your families.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
No.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,640
No need.

=Episode 3=

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,800
Wange, you will take care

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,320
of Mr. Song's daily schedule.

39
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,040
By the way,

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,160
Mr. Song dislikes instant coffee.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,160
He is quite picky
about the way to brew coffee.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,000
To preserve the coffee's aroma,

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,840
keep the water above 90 degrees.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
90 degrees...

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,920
There.

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,600
Take this to Mr. Song,

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
and get

48
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,040
to know him.

49
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,280
Thanks, Fang Cheng.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,160
Mr. Song, here's your coffee.

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,320
I'm Zhang Wange,

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,400
your new assistant.

53
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,400
Too weak.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
I'll make it better.

55
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:37,664
(Next Day)

56
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:38,944
(Chenda Capital)

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,080
Mr. Song,

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,600
this document requires your signature.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Also,

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Mr. Zhang from Xinhua Pharma

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,080
invited you to dinner.

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,520
You'll go with me tonight.

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,360
Yes.

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,400
Fang Cheng,

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,320
I developed a new way to brew coffee.

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Try it.

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,360
Okay.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,320
I'll try it.

69
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:24,160
(Chenda Capital)

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,240
(Wange.)

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,600
(Please take Mr. Song)

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
(to the dinner.)

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,120
(I-I suddenly have a stomachache.)

74
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,720
At 9:00 PM,

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,640
make up an excuse

76
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,600
to ask me to leave.

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,920
How about a jewelry project?

78
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,760
(Keen-witted.)

79
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,240
(But I wonder)

80
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,120
(if she's a usable pawn.)

81
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Up to you.

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,880
Who's she?

83
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,160
You two are whispering.

84
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,440
Don't want us to hear it?

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,680
Gentlemen,

86
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I have things to do,

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,640
so have to go.

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
My treat

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,680
next time.

90
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,840
Mr. Song.

91
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,560
Mr. Song.

92
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
Are you alright?

93
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
(Once she starts to suspect,)

94
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,680
(the suspicion will only grow)

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,760
(in every way.)

96
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,560
(A hangover soup.)

97
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
(A bottle of lemon water.)

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,480
(Mr. Song,)

99
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,120
(drinking them in the morning)

100
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
(helps relieve headaches.)

101
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,520
(Heaven grants my wish.)

102
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,920
(Since she took the bait,)

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,920
(then I'll go with it.)

104
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,888
(Chenda Capital)

105
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
(Where's Mr. Song?)

106
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,520
Mr. Song.

107
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
People from Xinhua Pharmaceuticals

108
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,200
have agreed

109
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,040
to meet for negotiations.

110
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,520
They're waiting
in the conference room now.

111
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
We should go there

112
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,000
to show our respect and sincerity.

113
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,840
No rush.

114
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,320
What you're reading now are

115
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,520
Hongying Capital's activities

116
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
in Rong City these past two years.

117
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Do you want to risk

118
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,520
working with them?

119
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
But Hongying Capital

120
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,440
quoted us a price

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
that's 15 percent lower

122
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
than Mr. Song's offer.

123
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,320
People say,

124
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,560
you get what you pay for.

125
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,520
Value corresponds to price.

126
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,520
Expensive items are impeccable,

127
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,400
except the price.

128
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,520
But, cheap items are flawed,

129
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,160
except the price.

130
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
Mr. Song.

131
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,280
If you accept the price

132
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,200
we quoted,

133
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,520
we'd adjust our

134
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,840
payment terms.

135
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,960
Like, shortening the payment cycle.

136
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
This benefits us all.

137
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,520
Mr. Song.

138
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,960
Miss Zhang

139
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
is exceptional.

140
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,320
Hope our collaboration

141
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,160
would be pleasant.

142
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,440
Sure.

143
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,200
I can tell

144
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,400
you have

145
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,960
a clear plan in your mind.

146
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,040
While, I was

147
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,320
worrying in vain.

148
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,160
Mr. Yang.

149
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,200
Don't

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,320
belittle yourself.

151
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,120
Gold will always shine.

152
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,400
However,

153
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,000
a piece of broken glass like you

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,040
doesn't fit Chenda.

155
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,720
Come with me.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,920
Mr. Song! Mr. Song!

157
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,120
You did a good job.

158
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,120
You've wanted

159
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,840
to get rid of Mr. Yang all along.

160
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
And in this game,

161
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,640
I merely served as

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,040
your bait.

163
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,680
(Yes,)

164
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
(my bait.)

165
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,640
Yanzhou.

166
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,400
What is it?

167
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,720
You didn't answer my call last night.

168
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,760
Busy lately?

169
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
I can handle it.

170
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,520
Let's have dinner together.

171
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,960
Hmm.

172
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,000
You said you wanted

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
to have French food last time.

174
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,240
Glad you remembered it.

175
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,800
See you soon.

176
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,920
Okay.

177
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,640
(Zhang Wange,)

178
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,040
(are you here to be a pawn)

179
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,360
(or the chess player?)

180
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,000
Hello.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Is Pei Xun here?

182
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,080
Bad timing.

183
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,640
Mr. Pei went to the ancestral house.

184
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,920
I'll wait here then.

185
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,360
Since Xun's back,

186
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,320
let's eat first.

187
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
Let's eat.

188
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,000
Xun.

189
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,080
I hear you're managing
the club business.

190
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,280
Yes.

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,320
(Meng Lixian,
First Madam of the Pei Family)

192
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,880
If you need any help,

193
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,200
just tell me.

194
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Not for now.

195
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Thank you.

196
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,920
(Third Madam of the Pei Family)
He doesn't need it.

197
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
With abundant funds,

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,520
what help he needs?

199
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Father's funds

200
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,720
keep flowing into Xun's club.

201
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,520
(Third Young Master, Pei Shicheng)
I heard the club's not open yet,

202
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,400
but the funds are already gone.

203
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,200
Shicheng,

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,520
I can tell you're jealous.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,120
Because

206
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
I don't have

207
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,840
a silver-tongued society mother.

208
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:40,992
(Tang Ting,
Second Madam of the Pei Family)

209
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
I'll visit the Baile Club

210
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,800
to learn some tricks.

211
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,400
Pei Xun! What are you doing?

212
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,320
What a delightful meal.

213
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,520
Let's meet again soon.

214
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,760
Xun.

215
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,840
Xun.

216
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,200
Xun.

217
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,920
Xun, you shouldn't do so.

218
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,960
How could you
embarrass Pei Shicheng like that?

219
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
Mom.

220
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,880
He humiliated you.

221
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,840
Aren't you angry?

222
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,400
He's just kidding.

223
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,000
You should move out,

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,840
and not come back.

225
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,840
I'll stay.

226
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,680
It's nice here.

227
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
Fine. Up to you.

228
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,240
(Zhang's Pastries)
Zhang Wange.

229
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,560
What brings you here?

230
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,080
You're back.

231
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,920
I got accepted by Chenda.

232
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,040
To thank you,

233
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm treating you to dinner.

234
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,400
Dinner?

235
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,120
Yes.

236
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,160
Like the one last time?

237
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,000
After eating,

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,160
I had to carry you back.

239
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,240
That won't happen.

240
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,840
Let's go.

241
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,840
This place is good.

242
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,040
Miss, your dishes.

243
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Sir, your dishes.

244
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
Hello, Mr. Song.

245
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:09,960
I've booked.

246
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,040
This way, Mr. Song.

247
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,520
Try this.

248
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,400
What a coincidence.

249
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
You're here too?

250
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,600
How's the club going?

251
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,720
What? Interested in investing?

252
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,000
Hand me over the proposal,

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,920
and I'll review it.

254
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
No problem.

255
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,520
Since we're all here,

256
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,600
let's share a table.

257
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,640
Probably not.

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,640
They might want to be alone.

259
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,320
Right, Pei Xun?

260
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's share a table.

261
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,960
We're all acquainted anyway.

262
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
To celebrate Wange's

263
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,160
official appointment
as Mr. Song's assistant.

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,360
Miss Zhou.

265
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
The new assistant
picked up Mr. Song tonight.

266
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,920
(Assistant?)

267
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
(Last night,)

268
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
(Yanzhou was with her?)

269
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Let's go.

270
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,360
Are you investing in jewelry again?

271
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:22,920
Yes.

272
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,320
But

273
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,920
most jewelry designs in Rong City

274
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,760
are too outdated.

275
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,360
I need more planning.

276
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,040
So you need a design team?

277
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,760
Wange studied jewelry design.

278
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,440
She might help you.

279
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,480
When is your

280
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
design debut?

281
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,440
Next month, I guess.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,520
I haven't received the invitation.

283
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,640
They aren't ready yet.

284
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,800
I'll send you one

285
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
when they're ready.

286
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,320
Fine.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,360
Save me an extra one then.

288
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,080
I'll bring my girlfriend

289
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,320
along.

290
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,320
Pei Xun!

291
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,480
You deliberately put Zhang Wange

292
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,440
by his side

293
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
as his assistant, right?

294
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,720
Yes.

295
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
Zhang Wange is like a ticking time bomb.

296
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
Just seeing her

297
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,960
makes me scared.

298
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
You know

299
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm struggling in the Zhou family.

300
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,400
My mom doesn't allow
any slightest mistake.

301
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,880
If she finds out

302
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
about my plagiarism,

303
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I'll lose my standing
in the Zhou family.

304
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
Again?

305
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I can help you

306
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:13,760
if you cancel the engagement
with Song Yanzhou.

307
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,160
You said it.

308
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,200
We're the same kind.

309
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,120
Pei Xun,

310
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,000
I truly love Yanzhou.

311
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,240
Not the make-believe

312
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,240
kind.

313
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,280
I truly want to marry him.

314
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,080
I know

315
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,800
you've helped me a lot,

316
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,040
and I'm really grateful.

317
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,280
But

318
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
I can't cancel the engagement.

319
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Pei Xun!

320
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,920
Zhang Wange.

321
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Are you single?

322
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,720
Yes. So what?

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,040
Me too.

324
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,760
How about

325
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,160
we give it a try?

326
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Alright.

327
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,320
(Pei Xun thinks he's a hunter)

328
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,760
(who controls everything.)

329
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,720
(While from this moment,)

330
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,400
