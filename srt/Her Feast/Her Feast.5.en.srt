00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,032
(Chenda Capital)
Then I'll ask Mr. Song.

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Mr. Song.

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,800
I've attended
Karen Pieno's lecture before.

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,560
So,

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,480
I prepared a detailed report

17
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,520
about Karen Pieno.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,200
Okay, got it.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,800
Anything else?

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,440
Could you

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,560
put me in contact

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,720
with Karen Pieno?

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,560
I'll do my best.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Why would I?

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
Zhou Nian is a renowned designer
in Rong City,

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,160
with exceptional professional skills.

27
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,680
Because I understand Karen Pieno

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,400
better than Zhou Nian does.

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,200
I've read all his books.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,080
As a liaison,

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,800
I believe it requires
more than experience.

32
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,280
What matters is

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,600
communication and mutual understanding.

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
Give it a try then.

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,480
Thank you, Mr. Song.

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,280
Yanzhou.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,280
Yanzhou.

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,480
Where were you last night?

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,440
I drank too much last night,

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,400
so I went back early.

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,920
Fine, I'll let it slide this time.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,920
I booked a private room
at Luersi tonight.

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,480
You must come.

44
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,720
Luersi?

45
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,080
Better not go.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
It is not safe.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,920
Someone died there.

48
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
When did that happen?

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
This morning.

50
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,600
The one was named Tang Qi.

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,520
Do you know him?

52
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,200
No.

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,960
I don't know.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,920
You use our engagement as a chip,

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,480
while I see it as mere pretense.

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,240
If you ruin it,

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
it'll embarrass us all.

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,200
I'll have Fang Cheng send you home.

59
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,880
(With Yanzhou's attitude,)

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,600
(I need to expedite our marriage plan,)

61
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,400
(to avoid further trouble.)

62
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:26,964
(A week later,
on the day of the art exhibition)

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,400
Yanzhou.

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,480
Help me pick a gift to Zhou Nian

65
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,200
for her art exhibition.

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,120
Yes, Grandpa.

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,760
Visit me more often when you're free.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,800
Mr. Song.

69
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,880
It seems Senior Pei

70
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,520
cares about you and Miss Zhou.

71
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:55,712
- Look at this.
- Beautiful.

72
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:57,056
- Look at this.
- Indeed.

73
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,016
Well-designed.

74
00:03:58,163 --> 00:03:59,264
This designer...

75
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,056
It's absolutely stunning.

76
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:02,597
- Miss Zhou designed it well.
- Yes.

77
00:04:03,155 --> 00:04:04,768
(Zhou Nian's First Design Exhibition)
I wonder when I...

78
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Let's check that out.

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
- Let's go.
- Stunning.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,760
That one is beautiful too.

81
00:04:12,384 --> 00:04:13,544
I want to check that out.

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,600
Miss Zhou, you're here.

83
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,432
Miss Zhou.

84
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,040
Mr. He is busy in Beizhou

85
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,360
and asked me to give you this.

86
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,120
Thank you.

87
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,880
Zhou Nian.

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,800
This is Karen Pieno.

89
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,520
Karen Pieno,

90
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,560
I've always admired your designs.

91
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,680
I'd love to join your team.

92
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,560
(Karen Pieno)
My dear,

93
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
I've seen your award-winning works.

94
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,480
They have a unique style.

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,440
Let's create
something extraordinary together.

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
Zhou Nian is really lucky to be adopted

97
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,840
by the Zhou family.

98
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,560
I heard Mrs. Zhou's biological daughter

99
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,320
was stolen by a maid right after birth.

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,280
Mrs. Zhou was so heartbroken,

101
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
so she adopted Zhou Nian.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,040
Congratulations.

103
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
Zhang Wange.

104
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
I should thank you.

105
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,200
After all,

106
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,840
your works

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,480
helped me secure collaboration
with Karen Pieno.

108
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,960
You should thank me.

109
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,160
Mr. Song is here.

110
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,560
Yanzhou, you're late.

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,960
The exhibition is nice.

112
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,520
(Is that a ring?)

113
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,640
It's for you.

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,840
Thank you.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,800
Miss Zhou,

116
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,760
we heard your wedding date
with Mr. Song is set.

117
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,320
When is it?

118
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,840
Miss Zhou.

119
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,440
Mr. Song.

120
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,920
The award-winning Gilded Butterfly Dream
is really remarkable,

121
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,080
but it's a pity that it was stained

122
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,960
with tea.

123
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,840
I believe you can
create even better works.

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,280
I spilled the tea stain accidentally.

125
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,480
Principal Zhang Yuanzhe
even scolded me back then.

126
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
- You!
- Keep smiling.

127
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,960
Reporters are here.

128
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,040
Miss Zhou.

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,960
Since you won awards,

130
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,000
your design style
has completely changed.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,960
Is this a new attempt?

132
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,120
You haven't created
any nice works recently.

133
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,000
How about returning
to your previous style?

134
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,760
No way.

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Also, regarding

136
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
the alleged plagiarism,

137
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
any comments?

138
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
It's completely groundless.

139
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
If you bother me
with such trivial questions,

140
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,800
you should revise your draft.

141
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,840
(Zhou Nian, this is just the beginning.)

142
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,640
(Zhang Wange, just wait.)

143
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Mr. Pei.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
(According to the timeline,)

145
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,320
(is the Pei family in trouble?)

146
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,440
Can you even drive?

147
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,280
Zhang Wange.

148
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,000
My art exhibition hasn't concluded yet.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why are you leaving?

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,360
I wanted to see you off.

151
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
No need.

152
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
If I hadn't reacted quickly,

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,800
I'd be a dead one

154
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
lying on the ground.

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,920
My driver wasn't paying attention.

157
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,120
How about this?

158
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,480
I'll take you

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,400
to the hospital or give you some money.

160
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,240
This money

161
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,480
should be enough for you
to leave Chenda.

162
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,680
If you refuse,

163
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,520
maybe next time,

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,000
my car will

165
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,040
hit you again.

166
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,760
I bet

167
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,040
you know it well.

168
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,536
Bang!

169
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
Threatening me?

170
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
What?

171
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,760
I am not.

172
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
I always

173
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
try peaceful ways
before resorting to force.

174
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,080
After all,

175
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,560
if I want an orphan girl

176
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,440
to vanish in Rong City

177
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,120
quietly,

178
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,400
it's quite simple.

179
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,560
(True.)

180
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,440
(In my past life, I vanished)

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
(without a trace in Rong City.)

182
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
Fine. Deal.

183
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,760
That's right.

184
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,520
If you need more money,

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,880
just tell me.

186
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,160
Bye.

All is well.

207
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,960
But

208
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,520
I miss you.

209
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
(I'll make them pay)

210
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,600
(what they owe us!)

211
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,280
I told you

212
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,880
not to touch the crime scene.

213
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,280
I ordered them to do so.

214
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,160
Senior Pei.

215
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,320
My wife had been ill.

216
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,400
And her condition worsened.

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,720
(Pei Qishan, Pei Xun's father)
No one was by her side,

218
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,760
leading to her death.

219
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,720
The servants called the police

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,400
out of panic.

221
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Sorry for troubling you.

222
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
It's fine.

223
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,000
My wife always

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,120
valued cleanliness
and propriety in life.

225
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,920
I don't want others

226
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,240
to see her in disarray

227
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,720
after she was dead.

228
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,160
Hence, the hasty arrangements.

229
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,760
Your love to your deceased wife

230
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,520
quite surprised me.

231
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,320
Mr. Lu, what do you mean?

232
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,840
I heard you rose from poverty,

233
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,800
using talent and courage to win

234
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
the heart of Meng Lixian,

235
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,120
the Meng family's heiress
during Rong City's golden age.

236
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,440
After Meng Lixian married you,

237
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,800
she devoted everything she had

238
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,320
to help you climb the ranks
in the Chamber of Commerce.

239
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,000
What a pity.

240
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,520
After the Pei family rose to power,

241
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,280
the Meng family gradually declined.

242
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,080
If I'm right,

243
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,560
half of the Pei family's current asset

244
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,320
was built on
the Meng family's foundation, right?

245
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,760
Senior Pei.

246
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
The person who reported the case

247
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
said the matriarch was
strangled to death,

248
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,960
with strangulation marks on her neck.

249
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,720
If...

250
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,120
If it were a murder,

251
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
who would be the prime suspect?

252
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,360
Could it be you?

253
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,600
Mr. Lu.

254
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
It's an outrageous joke.

255
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,080
It's late at night.

256
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,720
The servants mistook
the necklace around her neck

257
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
for strangulation marks.

258
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,880
I am curious

259
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,440
about the source of the story

260
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,760
you just told.

261
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm just kidding.

262
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm someone

263
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
born with a nosy nature.

264
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,720
I enjoy digging into the scandals

265
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,400
of celebrities.

266
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,720
You're quite interesting, Mr. Lu.

267
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,360
True.

268
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,400
I'm too curious.

269
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,120
Senior Pei, you know

270
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
we police officers

271
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,840
have procedures to follow.

272
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,520
May I go in to investigate?

273
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,800
As you wish.

274
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,640
Thank you.

275
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,800
Let's go.

276
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,640
Dad.

277
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,920
Ms. Meng...

278
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,120
What?

279
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,440
Before she died,

280
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,800
she called me.

281
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,160
Hello.

282
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,920
Xun.

283
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,600
Ms. Meng.

284
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,720
Where are you now?

285
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,800
I have something to tell you.

286
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,920
What did she say?

287
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,640
The call got cut off.

288
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,120
She watched you grow up.

289
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,000
It's natural she'd want
to give you final instructions.

290
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,840
Now only your mother remains in here.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,520
Come visit her more often.

292
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm tired.

293
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,080
You may leave now.

294
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,360
Fine.

295
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,920
You are dodging the trouble.

296

Lu.
