Hello.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Hello. May I ask who you are?

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,360
I've seen you.

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,880

Oh.

I'm Lu Ye's fiancée.

18
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,920
He was just too busy that day

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,400
to introduce me.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,120
You two...

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,880
are engaged?

Yes.

23

Lu Ye.

Wange.

Why are you here?

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,680

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,040
born into wealth
yet completely unspoiled.

Lu Ye,

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,520
you had a difficult childhood.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
You need her to brighten your life.

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,960
I wish you both a lifetime together.

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,440
Zhang Wange!

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,320
You lied to her

that we're engaged?

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,560

I did!

Nian.

Nian, do you know Wange?

to a place beyond your station?

84
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,640
Or perhaps

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,680
you think having a published work

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,520
and becoming a designer makes you climb

87
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,560

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,840

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,560
You love stealing what's not yours!

92
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440

93
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,440

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,880
I heard you're just adopted.

95
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Don't tell me

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,280
you think even a nobody
can become a somebody?

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,480
Mrs. Zhou,

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,760
Jing is very bright.

104
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,240
Without my teaching,

105
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,000
she'd learn everything well.

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,520
I must decline this tutoring position.

107
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,240
I must go.

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Wange!

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Mom!

110
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,720
Why did you defend her?

111
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,840
You were about to hit her?

112
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
I... I didn't!

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Still lying!

114
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,800
Would I mistake that?

115
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,320
I...

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,160
Zhou Nian!

117
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,800
More than twenty years in this family

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
taught you to assault others?

119
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,760
If you can't show basic respect,

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,920
we

121
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,280
have wasted years raising you!

122
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,360
That's not true, Mom!

123
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,680
It was her...

124
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,760
I... I don't like her.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,200
Why not?

126
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,560
When there's dislike,
there must be a reason behind it.

127
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,640
Is it that you owe her?

128
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,240
Or does she owe you?

129
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Mom, that's not it.

130
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,160
Why are you taking her side?

131
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm your daughter!

132
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,280
Mom,

133
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,520
my behavior today was inappropriate.

134
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,120
But didn't you teach me

135
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,240
that I shouldn't

136
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,160
tolerate disrespect outside?

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,480
Yet today you scolded me
over an outsider!

138
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,520
Not tolerating disrespect

139
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,800
doesn't mean bullying others at will.

140
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,320
As a member of Zhou family,

141
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,720
you must show respect,

142
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,840
especially towards Zhang Wange...

143
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,680
A girl like her!

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,120
Understand?

145
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
(I must treat Zhang Wange well?)

146
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,800
(Why should I?)

147
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,760
Hello?

148
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,280
Wange,

149
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,360
about Zhou Nian's rudeness today,

150
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
I want to apologize.

151
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,480
Come visit us tomorrow.

152
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,040
There are things
I've long wanted to share

153
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,520
but never found the right time.

154
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,720
Okay.

155
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,760
If I hadn't personally
called to inquire,

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,920
(Zhou Nian's Grandpa)
would you keep this from me forever?

157
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,600
Of course not, Dad.

158
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,880
We needed multiple confirmations

159
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,360
before daring to trouble you.

160
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
What are you saying?

161
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,520
Where's my mom?

162
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
She's picking someone up.

163
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,160
Will be back soon.

164
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Is it confirmed?

165
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Yes.

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,320
Thanks to the Gu family.

167
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
They've been

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
a huge help in finding Siya.

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,400
Dad.

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,600
Is it really Siya?

171
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,240
So good!

172
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
After being lost for long,

173
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,000
she's finally coming home.

174
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,040
She's here.

175
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
Zhang Wange?

176
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Why are you here?

177
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,320
Wange, come sit.

178
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Mrs. Zhou, you have guests.

179
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,920
I'd visit next time.

180
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,120
Child,

181
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:49,840
come sit.

182
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,680
Wange,

183
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,400
he's your grandpa.

184
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,240
Mom,

185
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,040
why did you bring her here?

186
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,560
I should leave.

187
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Ms. Gao?

188
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,080
I asked her to come.

189
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,520
I had a daughter

190
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,080
who went missing at 100 days old.

191
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
All these years,

192
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,640
I've searched countless cities

193
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,800
with no success.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,400
When you tutored at the Gu's,

195
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,080
Mrs. Gu accidentally noticed

196
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,320
your matching birthmark.

197
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,000
That got my hopes up again.

198
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,440
Mrs. Zhou, is this some joke?

199
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,760
Twenty years ago,

200
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,680
I was transferred
to Rong City Orphanage.

201
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,400
Wange was already over six then.

202
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,280
Orphanage children's ages

203
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,000
were often uncertain.

204
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
Most were abandoned infants

205
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,760
or unidentified orphans.

206
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,480
The previous director told me

207
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
Wange got caught

208
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,400
stealing snacks from stores,

209
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,680
ending up at the police station.

210
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,560
After investigations,

211
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
they found her orphaned

212
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,000
and sent her to the orphanage.

213
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,280
Back then,

214
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,960
she was tiny,

215
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,760
her true age unverifiable.

216
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,920
Those years, she was homeless

217
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,800
and scavenged garbage

218
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,120
when hungry.

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
She couldn't even speak.

220
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
No one ever taught her anything.

221
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,760
Ms. Gao, that's enough.

222
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,000
How did the previous director

223
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,000
determine Wange's age?

224
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,520
Back then,

225
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,600
Wange appeared

226
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
to be only two or three years old.

227
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,960
Kids at the orphanage

228
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
would enter adoption procedures

229
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,440
once they turned three.

230
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,560
But Wange at that time

231
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,200
couldn't even communicate properly.

232
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,320
The former director
registered her age as two

233
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
to buy extra time.

234
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,400
We spent that year teaching her basics.

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,720
What about

236
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,960
that crimson plum blossom birthmark?

237
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
Was it there since childhood?

238
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,080
(I witnessed Zhang Wange being abused)

239
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
(by her foster father,)

240
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,760
(but I didn't intervene.)

241
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,000
(Now,)

242
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,400
(whether she's their daughter or not,)

243
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,520
(helping her this time)

244
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,480
(counts as my atonement.)

245
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,480
I came to Rong City later.

246
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,000
When helping Wange change clothes,

247
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,680
I did notice.

248
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,760
Escort the director out.

249
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Just glad you're home.

250
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,400
Siya, you've suffered
so much all these years.

251
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,240
Come here.

252
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,280
Let me see you properly.

253
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
It's really you!

254
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,240
You've finally returned!

255
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,400
Imposters kept coming all these years,

256
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,760
but this must be genuine now.

257
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,080
I've been longing

258
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,520
for your return too.

259
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,160
Siya, you've endured so much out there.

260
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,680
I will make it up to you from now on.

261
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Mrs. Zhou,

262
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,560
calling me to tutor Jing

263
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,000
was just pretense?

264
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,360
Yes,

265
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
we wanted gradual bonding

266
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,680
to avoid shocking you
with sudden revelations.

267
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,280
Siya, where are you going?

268
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,560
We're your family now.

269
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,560
Mrs. Zhou,

270
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
I don't know about family ties

271
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,640
and I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

272
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,400
Should I weep gratefully?

273
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,360
Or thank you profusely

274
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
for securing my future?

275
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,800
Maybe

276
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,440
I craved that years ago.

277
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,160
But I'm not a child anymore.

278
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,960
I don't have to accept everything

279
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,680
you offered.

280
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,320
We know

281
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,400
we've failed you terribly.

282
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,640
Your knowledge comes from reports.

283
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,360
You see a girl

284
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,400
who endured hardships

285
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
and want to compensate her.

286
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,080
But do you know

287
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,160
her gambler foster father

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
made her work instead of

289
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,240
study and play during childhood?

290
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,080
Your daughter

291
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,720
could gain fame and fortune

292
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,240
effortlessly,

293
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,840
while I struggled
a thousand times harder.

294
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,520
Mr. Zhou,

295
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,840
do you still remember

296
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,480
you asked me

297
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,640
if I'd switch careers

298
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,440
during design industry's decline?

299
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,200
Well, your daughter plagiarized
my designs

300
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,240
and framed me instead!

301
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,200
I've been shunned for three years!

302
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
That's not true!

303
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Zhang Wange,

304
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,200
stop spouting nonsense!

305
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,800
Do you have any evidence

306
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,600
to prove that?

307
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,600
I published first!

308
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,880
Maybe

309
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,880
we shared ideas,

310
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,280
but priority matters!

311
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,000
How dare you play victim

312
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,160
after climbing over me!

313
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
Think your tears

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,240
make you right?

315
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,800
You know

316
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,800
exactly what you did.

317
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,720
I was just a poor student

318
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,200
without connections,

319
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,240
while you had

320
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,840
the Zhou family's power.

321
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,560
The principal died mysteriously,

322
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,320
and my drafts vanished,

323
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,960
all your doing, right?

324
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
These are just your one-sided claims.

325
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,960
Zhang Wange,

326
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,640
don't think you can rely on

327
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,480
your supposed status

328
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,280
to spout nonsense.

329
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,360
Mrs. Zhou,

330
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,640
I used to believe

331
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,200
finding my real parents

332
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,760
and reclaiming my family
would bring closure.

333
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,080
For twenty years I clung to

334
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,320
this belief like a religion.

335
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,400
But today I finally understand

336
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,640
how absurd my blood ties truly are.

337
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,240
I can't become part of the Zhou family,

338
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,440
nor can I accept

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
that the person who ruined my life

340
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,680
is actually my own family.

341
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm sorry, my child.

342
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,080
Siya! Siya!

343
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,480
Mom!

344
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,160
Don't chase her.

345
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,720
Mom!

346
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,680
Let Siya have some space.

347
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,840
I never imagined

348
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,640
she suffered so much all these years.

349
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,200
For now,

350
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,320
don't disturb her.

351
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,560
Until then,

352
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,480
Nian,

353
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,800
explain this plagiarism accusation
Siya mentioned.

354
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,560
It's not true, Grandfather.

355
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,280
We don't know

356
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,440
whether she's even the real Siya.

357
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,040
But the moment she returns,

358
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,640
she stages this pitiful act

359
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,680
to turn you all against me

360
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,920
and distrust me.

361
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,080
I genuinely looked forward
to her return.

362
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,320
But now,

363
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,240
you're all

364
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,600
siding with this mysterious woman

365
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,320
and suspecting me.

366
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,560
The truth will come out

367
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,560
through my investigation.

368
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,120
If Siya's claims are verified,

369
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,440
the guilty party

370
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,440
will be punished.

371
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,320
Mo Ran, I visited the Zhou family today.

372
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
My plan is progressing smoothly.

373
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,920
They never stopped searching for you,

374
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,840
especially your mother.

375
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,200
All these years,

376
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
she's been drowning in guilt.

377
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,760
Losing you

378
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,600
has been her greatest torment.

379
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,640
You must wake up

380
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
and give them a chance to make amends.

381
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,640
Mo Ran.

382
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,720
Until then,

383
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,800
I'll remove every obstacle for you.

384
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,240
When you wake up,

385
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,880
