Sun Er's remnants after her,

what's her condition?

72
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,880
She was injected with

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,960
a significant amount of medicine.

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,200
Her body functions are impaired

75
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,320
with severe neural trauma.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,080
Moreover, the skin on her back

77
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,920
was peeled off

78
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,520
while she was conscious.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,240

00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040

00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,440
if she'll ever wake up.

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
If you hadn't met me,

83
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,800
you wouldn't have

endure all this.

85
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,320
Okay,

86
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,120
I'll suppress the lab incident.

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,280
No information will be published.

88
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,440

89
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
will be handled properly.

90
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,600
They won't cause any trouble.

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,200

92
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,840

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,040
No problem.

94
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,480
You disregard protocol.

95
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,640
You suppressed the lab information.

96
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,720
What?

97
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,920
Do you know how many people

98
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,560
they've killed?

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,720
You're an accomplice.

100
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,320
What exactly have I done?

101
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,880
Do you have proof?

102
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,160
Don't forget your position.

103
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,480
As a police officer,

104
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
how could you act

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
without authorization?

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,640
You disregard protocol.

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
From now on,

108
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm no longer Rong City's officer.

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,280
You're on your own now.

110
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:45,720

111
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
Get back here!

112
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,600
I heard about your situation.

113
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,440
Leaving the force might be better.

114
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,560
You can have peace of mind.

115
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,800
How much do you know about He Jiu?

116
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
Lu Ye,

117
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,640
listen to me,

118
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,680
stop investigating.

119
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,640
Even if you dig to the core,

120
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,720
you can't handle him.

121
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,520
He'll find a scapegoat

122
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,160
and vanish completely,

123
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,200
leaving no trace to follow.

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,920
The case will close.
Your efforts will be in vain.

125
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,600
It is none of your business.

126
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,080
If you want to help,

127
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,160
answer my questions.

128
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,680
In your heart,

129
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
as your father,

130
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,800
am I truly that unworthy?

131
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Answer me!

132
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,360
How much

133
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,040
was my grandfather involved?

134
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,960
For a father,

135
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,240
every decision he makes

136
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,480
must be weighed carefully.

137
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,280
Because

138
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,840
he can't bear to lose

139
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
another one of his children.

140
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,200
That's why years ago,

141
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,840
I made a choice

142
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,840
to send you and your mother away.

143
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,200
Do you know how many families

144
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,640
He Jiu has destroyed?

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
I swear

146
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll personally capture He Jiu.

147
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,440
You better stay out of this.

148
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,800
Otherwise...

149
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,120
At least tell me

150
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,160
if you will come back alive.

151
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Don't make me

152
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
handle your funeral arrangements.

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
Even if

154
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
you refuse to explain it to me,

155
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,680
you're not alone anymore.

156
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,600
If you keep recklessly

157
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,560
taking bullets,

158
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
you'd better

159
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,440
be single forever

160
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,360
and stop dragging others down.

161
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,560
Lu Ye.

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Lu Ye!

163
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,440
What's her condition?

164
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,000
The skin on her back

165
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,160
was peeled off

166
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
while she was conscious.

167
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,760
(Why did He Jiu do this?)

168
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,720

169
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,080
(His men)

170
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
(have been secretly helping Zhou Nian.)

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,680
(Why not cozy up to the Zhou family,)

172
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,920
(but care so much about
an adopted daughter?)

They've searched Siya for over a decade.

174
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,680
Haven't they given up?

175
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,960
With just a plum blossom mark as a clue,

176
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,640
it's like finding
a needle in a haystack.

177
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
Exactly.

178
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,160
(Plum blossom birthmark?)

179
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
I've had it since childhood.

180
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,720
Though on my back,

181
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,800
it doesn't bother me.

182
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,120
(Could it be...)

183
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,832
(Rongjie News Agency
Zhou family lost daughter Zhou Siya)

184
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,640

194
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,160
(to join the Zhou family,)

195
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
(Zhang Wange will cease to exist.)

196
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,880
(All memories and emotions tied to her)

197
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
(must be severed.)

198
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,000
(That includes you.)

199
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
At least tell me

200
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,840
if you will come back alive.

201
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
Even if you refuse to explain it to me,

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,240
you're not alone anymore.

203
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,160
Zhang Wange,

204
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
I have something to say.

205
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,920
I also have something to say.

206
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,720
You go first.

207
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,400
Lu Ye,

208
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
our relationship of mutual exploitation

209
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,520
is over.

210
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,280
Zhang Wange,

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,040
what are you saying?

212
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,520
You're truly foolish.

213
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,920
Since I knew

214
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,120
your identity,

215
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,080
I've been resentful.

216
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Why has a former punk

217
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,360
become so accomplished,

218
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,240
while I

219
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,880
have taken a completely different path

220
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,520
and kept sinking deeper into darkness?

221
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,360
I knew those forces
couldn't be controlled,

222
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,080
but I can have

223
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,440
them under my control, right?

224
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,040
So,

225
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I approached you.

226
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,480
Those forces might overwhelm me,

227
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
but you

228
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,520
and your father can control them.

229
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Because I'm his father.

230
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,480
All my fears

231
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,280
of threats and retaliation

232
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
can be shielded by you.

233
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,880
After all,

234
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,200
you were willing to kneel

235
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,000
and take bullets for me.

236
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,080
A fool like you

237
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,720
must be one of a kind in this world.

238
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,040
So now,

239
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,720
I'm not a policeman

240
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,240
and can't protect you anymore,

241
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,280
so you want to end

242
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,080
this relationship?

243
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,200
