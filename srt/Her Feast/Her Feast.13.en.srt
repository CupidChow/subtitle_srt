is Director He's illegitimate son.

But isn't he Director He's nephew?

Director He's wife only has one brother,

someone like me

89
00:07:22,115 --> 00:07:23,731

96
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:02,577
Yes.

97
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:04,077
Didn't expect you to know

98
00:08:04,077 --> 00:08:05,154
so much about perfumes.

99
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:10,000
This perfume suits banquets
and social occasions,

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,038
but

101
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:13,385
Yanzhou dislikes
such strong feminine perfumes.

102
00:08:13,615 --> 00:08:15,000
As his assistant,

103
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:16,077
don't you know it?

What's wrong?

112
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,385
Are you

113
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:46,115
available for dinner with me?

115
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,654

118
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,885
Actually, I could drink for you.

119
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:05,231
No need.

120
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:13,423
Ladies shouldn't drink much.

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,654
It's not safe.

122
00:09:18,038 --> 00:09:18,769
Alright.

123
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:36,308
Why are you blushing?

124
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:38,240

125
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:39,808
No.

126
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:41,462
No.

127
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:43,615
You may leave now.

128
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:04,846
Get the car washed tomorrow.

129
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:05,923
Understood.

131

132
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:24,538
Mr. Jiu.

133
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:26,923
Why are you crying?

134
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:29,000
I suspect that Yanzhou

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,500
is dating another woman.

136
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:33,769
Calm down.

137
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,385
I will handle this for you.

(Rongjie News Agency,

162
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:52,231
you went to He Jiu for help?

163

You know he's ruthless.

164
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,808
If this gets exposed,

165
00:11:57,077 --> 00:11:59,077
you won't even be recognized as a Zhou!

166
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:00,385
No, Mom.

Well,

171
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:11,577
what about my engagement to Yanzhou?

172
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:13,500
After this blows over,

173
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,231
you don't

174
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,923
have to marry into the Song family.

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,808
Mr. Pei.

176
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:27,346
The prospective daughter-in-law

177
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,731
caused such a huge scandal.

178
00:12:29,462 --> 00:12:31,731
The Song families are all laughing.

179
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:33,615
The Zhou family is spoiling her.

180
00:12:33,808 --> 00:12:35,038
Before,

181
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:37,885
she kept hurting women
around Song Yanzhou.

182
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:39,923
And the Zhou family
always cleaned up her messes.

183
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:41,692
Let's hope
this doesn't cause more trouble.

184
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,577
Can't tell.

185
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:46,346
But I'm afraid she can't

186
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:47,808
marry into the Song family.

187
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:50,500
(Song Yanzhou, you are really cunning.)

188
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:52,923
(To cancel an engagement,)

189
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:55,308
(you even come up with)

190
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:56,416
(such a destructive trick?)

191
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,615
Just for fun.

192
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,923
Don't cross your line.

193
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:07,385
Leaving now?

194
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,346
Pei Xun.

195
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:28,654
Why are you here?

196
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:41,500
I'll have the driver take you home.

197
00:13:43,385 --> 00:13:46,000
I-I don't need your pity!

198
00:13:51,846 --> 00:13:52,577
Put it on.

199
00:13:55,846 --> 00:13:57,692
Do you think

200
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:00,923
I'm really foolish?

201
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,192
Don't say that.

202
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,423
You like Song Yanzhou.

203
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,808
Eliminating obstacles

204
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:09,115
is natural.

205
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:10,769
But by acting so,

206
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:13,231
you should anticipate the backlash.

207
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:29,577
(Before, Pei Xun)

208
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,038
(has never spoken like this.)

209
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:34,308
(Why?)

210
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,308
Chenda Capital
is really in a mess lately.

211
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:40,692
After Song Yanzhou's fiancée,

212
00:14:41,308 --> 00:14:42,500
designer Zhou Nian,

213
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,692
got expelled from Chenda,

214
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,308
his assistant died tragically at home.

215
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:46,731
(So,)

216
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:48,769
(the reason Yanzhou gave me leave)

217
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,923
(is related to these matters?)

218
00:14:51,731 --> 00:14:53,154
(Whether or not,)

219
00:14:54,038 --> 00:14:55,923
(it's time for me to leave Chenda.)

220
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:02,752
(Chenda Capital)

221
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,269
This is Weina Jewels's
Phoenix Rose ring collection.

222
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:19,731
Wange has submitted her resignation.

223
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:26,423
Got it.

224
00:15:31,154 --> 00:15:32,692
(Grandpa will hurt her anyway.)

225
00:15:33,577 --> 00:15:34,308
(Letting her go)

226
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:36,346
(could keep her safe.)

227
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:40,346

00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:43,077
