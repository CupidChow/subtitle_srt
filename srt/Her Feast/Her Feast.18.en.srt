Yes.

An apology gift.

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,080
Mr. Song, you don't need to apologize.

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,000
You did nothing wrong.

19
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,240
I understand.

I'm curious.

53
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,240
Mr. Lu,

54
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,080
when did you start being with her?

55
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,880
Why are you curious?

56
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,480
Before being with me,

57
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,040
she was playful and headstrong.

58
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,680
Unaware of her own charm,

59
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,280
she made people develop

60
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,800
Illusions of romance.

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,360
It's natural.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
Illusions of romance?

63
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
Mr. Song,

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,640
let the past

65
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,960
stay buried.

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,440
People should

67
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,720
always focus on the future.

68
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,200
Lu Ye.

69
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,880
Zhao Qing.

70
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,480
Miss Zhang.

71
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,560
Why are you here?

72
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,120
Is Lu Ye around?

73
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,000
Lu is on a mission.

74
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,680
He probably won't return until late.

75
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160
I'll wait here.

76
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,400
He's been busy lately.

77
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,600
Besides, at police office,

78
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
it's inappropriate for you to stay.

79
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
Miss Zhang,

80
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,760
you should wait for Lu at home.

81
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Thank you.

82
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
Lu,

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
avoiding her constantly

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,640
cannot solve anything.

85
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,160
We've received
intelligence from Beizhou.

86
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,400
There'll be an operation soon.

87
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,640
Get ready.

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,640
Yes.

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,240
Before this matter is resolved,

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,640
hide it from her.

91
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,680
Let's go.

92
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,880
Don't take any more risks this time.

93
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,280
The forces behind them

94
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,600
are too complicated.

95
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,440
It's too dangerous.

96
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,000
If He Jiu retaliates later,

97
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,320
he will have to

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,560
face it alone,

99
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
risking his life.

100
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,400
(As for Lu Ye,)

101
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,800
(he'll investigate it thoroughly.)

102
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,200
(Is he avoiding me)

103
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,640
(to hide something from me?)

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,960
(Beizhou)
Beizhou Scouts raided West Street.

105
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,440
Our people got arrested.

106
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
I've severed several connections

107
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
to cut ties completely.

108
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,600
Those West Street locations

109
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,080
are unsalvageable.

110
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,680
Idiot.

111
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,960
I told you to lay low!

112
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,280
Now the Scouts are onto us!

113
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,560
Calm down.

114
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,720
I've greased every palm.

115
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,160
I didn't expect it

116
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,440
to turn out this way.

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,040
If I find out

118
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,680
who's really pulling the strings,

119
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
I'll kill him.

120
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,400
Kill whom?

121
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,160
Meng's fate serves as your warning.

122
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,400
Consider this a lesson.

123
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,880
Who

124
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,160
deserves such grand treatment from us?

125
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,840
He's backed by He family of the capital.

126
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,520
You mean

127
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
that illegitimate child?

128
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
No wonder he's acting so arrogantly.

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,960
Take our men and leave tonight.

130
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,720
Don't return until the fuss dies down.

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,800
We've invested so much time and effort

132
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,040
in building foothold over five years.

133
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,120
If we abandon it now,

134
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
I can't accept this defeat.

135
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Listen,

136
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,400
don't jeopardize Master Jiu's plan.

137
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,880
But his operations
are always perfectly timed.

138
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,800
Now he even knows our escape routes

139
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,880
down to the last detail.

140
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,120
Maybe Lu Ye has

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,960
other supporters.

142
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,480
Master Jiu,

143
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,080
Lu Ye has reached Beizhou.

144
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
He'll make move soon.

145
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,880
Let them investigate.

146
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,520
Send Lu Ye a few pawns as well.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,560
But Master Jiu...

148
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,240
We need to sacrifice pawns.

149
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,200
What about Mo Ran?

150
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,640
She'll understand.

151
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,560
Yes.

152
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,120
(From Beizhou to Rong City)

153
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,760
Freeze!

154
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,960
Mo Ran!

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Let's go!

156
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Take him to the office.

157
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
Got it.

158
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,360
(Wange.)

159
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,720
Let's go.

160
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,880
My place is just ahead.

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,000
You're bringing a stranger home?

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,160
What if I'm a villain?

163
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I know you're not.

164
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,120
Did you know me before?

165
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,440
You resemble
an old acquaintance of mine.

166
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,520
Miss,

167
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,440
that's the lamest excuse
I've ever heard.

168
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,280
Wange!

169
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,880
Who are you?

170
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,440
(Lu Ye.)

171
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,280
(Wange.)

172
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,480
(Is she)

173
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,360
(the lady Lu Ye carried away)

174
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,680
(that day?)

175
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm this lady's

176
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,400
old acquaintance.

177
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,920
Old acquaintance?

178
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,400
Lu Ye,

179
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,560
she's my friend.

180
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,240
Wange,

181
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
why haven't you mentioned her before?

182
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,960
We lost contact years ago.

183
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,800
I thought

184
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,080
I'd never see her again.

185
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,720
Wange,

186
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,720
shouldn't we head home?

187
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,720
Let's go.

188
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,360
She is staying with you?

189
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
Yes.

190
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,240
Fine.

191
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll take you back.

192
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,280
Zhao Qing!

193
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
Zhao Qing!

194
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,200
What's up, Lu?

195
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,240
I need you to send someone

196
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,800
to surveil Terrace House recently.

197
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,880
Miss Zhang's place?

198
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,960
Yes.

199
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,240
Wange has brought someone home recently.

200
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,120
I suspect she's shady.

201
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,640
Lu,

202
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,000
aren't you being paranoid?

203
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,080
If Miss Zhang took her in,

204
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,280
she must be trustworthy.

205
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,360
Lu,

206
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,760
you're suspecting Miss Zhang...

207
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,960
Nonsense. Just follow orders!

208
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,600
Got it, on it right away.

209
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,720
Hold on.

210
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,880
Dig deeper into her background.

211
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,440
Got it.

212
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,704
Mo Ran, are you going out?

213
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,960
I left my suitcase at the train station.

214
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,120
I need clean clothes,

215
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,160
and there's something important.

216
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,000
I must get it back.

217
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,200
I'll go get it for you.

218
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,952
Wear my clothes first.

219
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,440
Notify Master Jiu.

220
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,240
Jiang Ming might not hold on
much longer.

221
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,080
Tell him to leave.

222
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,560
Master Jiu let me relay a message.

223
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,960
What did he say?

224
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,320
He said,

225
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,400
"Rest in peace, Mo Ran."

226
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,600
I don't believe it.

227
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
I'll ask him.

228
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,880
Mo Ran,

229
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
don't blame us for being harsh.

230
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,520
Who's there?

231
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,800
You brought helpers, huh?

232
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,920
Then we'll get rid of

233
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,680
both of you.

234
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,880
You killed him desperately as you fear
I'll discover your true identity?

235
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,520
Mr. Lu,

236
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,480
I saw that he was about to attack you.

237
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,200
In the heat of the moment...

238
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,320
You know my identity?

239
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,600
You...

240
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,520
Lu Ye!

241
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,680
What are you doing?

242
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
Let me go!

243
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,400
Now you don't call me

244
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,480
"Mr. Lu" anymore?
