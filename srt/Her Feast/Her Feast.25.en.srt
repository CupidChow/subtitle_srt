Zhou Siya.

16

Doesn't sound as nice as
the previous one.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,480
Xun, let it go.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,280
The Pei family was in such turmoil.

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,560
She never even cared for you.

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,880
Besides,

21
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,080
if she truly cared for you
even a little,

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,280
you two had countless chances before

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,120
to be together.

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,080
What should I let go of?

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,600
Who needs me to let go anyway?

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,320
Isn't this how relationships work?

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,600
Mr. Zheng,

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,720
you don't think I'm some
hopeless romantic, do you?

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,720
I just couldn't be bothered.

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,000
Mr. Zheng.

31
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
Why are you here?

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,000
I heard Mr. Pei

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,400
has taken over all Pei family
and Meng family businesses.

34
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm here to congratulate him.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,760
Lixian rejected
your partnership years ago.

36
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,760
Therefore,

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,560
don't try scheming against her son now.

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
You jest, Mr. Zheng.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't you want to know

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
how Pei Qishan knew Pei Xun
wanted him dead?

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,400
She helped you during your car accident,

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
and stood by you in hard times.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,400
But have you considered

44
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,880
she orchestrated everything
behind the scenes?

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,920
I have confirmed

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,680
she anonymously sent me your mom's

47
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,520
investigative materials.

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Because she knew you weren't
Second Madam's son.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
It was her

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,080
who tipped Pei Qishan off
when you planned

51
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,200
to act against him.

52
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,800
She wanted you dead!

53
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,400
Now it's clear

54
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
her Zhou family heiress identity

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
was an elaborate scheme.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,800
Pei Xun?

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
Why are you here?

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,600
Pei Xun, you...

59
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,640
What's... what's wrong with you?

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,960
Pei Xun?

61
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,920
I need answers.

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,840
Lu,

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,440
those people you had me send

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,920
to watch Pei Xun reported

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,560
he rushed back last night.

66
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,480
Lu.

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,160
Zhang Wange.

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,880
Zhang Wange!

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,680
Pei Xun!

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,800
What are you doing?

71
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,360
You knew all along

72
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,080
Meng Lixian was my biological mother.

73
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,840
The one who warned Mr. Zheng

74
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,840
was you too.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,120
I don't understand what you're saying!

76
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,840
Let me go!

77
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,600
Three months ago,

78
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,440
when I tried to kill Pei Qishan,

79
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
you leaked the plan too.

80
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,440
Tell me.

81
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,640
Why?

82
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,440
Why...

83
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Why?

84
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,280
You showed me kindness

85
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,040
while plotting against me.

86
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,560
Was it all lies from the start,

87
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
such as your kindness

88
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,400
and reconciliation?

89
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,800
Because

90
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
from the very beginning,

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,040
I wanted you dead.

92
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,760
But now I realize

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,160
living is your true punishment.

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,200
The father you revered for decades

95
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
actually killed your mother.

96
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Before you could learn the truth,

97
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,320
your mother died.

98
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,080
She died right after you discovered it.

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,560
You never even got

100
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,280
to call her "Mom".

101
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,160
You'll spend your life

102
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,160
tortured by this knowledge.

103
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
Everyone who cared for you is gone.

104
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,800
And those you care about

105
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,480
want you dead.

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,000
Shut up!

107
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,240
I had a very, very long dream.

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,080
(In the dream...)

109
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,840
Let go!

110
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Let go!

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,880
(Just like when we first met,)

112
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,520
(you saved me,)

113
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
(took me to the banquet,)

114
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,160
(and gave me beautiful dresses.)

115
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,440
(I kept thinking)

116
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,480
you actually cared for me all along.

117
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,800
My life wasn't complete chaos after all.

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,920
Later, you introduced your friend,

119
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,760
(Zhou Nian.)

120
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,640
If your fiancé knew your talent

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,360
were nothing but plagiarism...

122
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,200
(I endured it for two years)

123
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,160
and finally got the chance
to confront her.

124
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,320
That's when I realized

125
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,320
(you kept me by your side)

126
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,880
(just to make me her ghost artist.)

127
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,000
(Then Zhou Nian destroyed my hand)

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,440
(to stop me from painting.)

129
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Give my original artwork back to me!

130
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,560
(Your heartless expression that day)

131
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,800
will forever haunt me.

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,040
Later, she framed me
and got me imprisoned.

133
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,920
I kept harming myself in prison,

134
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
begging the guards to let me see you.

135
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,480
I need to see Pei Xun.

136
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,920
Help me find Pei Xun.

137
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,440
Who?

138
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,320
Pei Xun.

139
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,480
Mr. Pei,

140
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,400
do you remember

141
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,160
a girl named Zhang Wange?

142
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
She wants to meet you.

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,280
I won't see her.

144
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
How is it?

145
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,480
You played me?

146
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,120
He doesn't know any Zhang Wange.

147
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,880
I just wanted to ask you directly.

148
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,400
Why?

149
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,520
Why do this to me?

150
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,320
Why did you push me into the abyss

151
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,400
knowing full well what would happen?

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,960
The only thing keeping me alive then

153
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,760
was imagining
how to kill you and Zhou Nian.

154
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,520
I pictured every possible way
you two might die.

155
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,200
I plotted how to kill you

156
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,320
after my release.

157
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
So,

158
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
in your dreams,

159
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,520
how did you kill me?

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,480
Never succeeded.

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Your world was beyond my reach.

162
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,120
I couldn't touch it.

163
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,080
Then in that horrible place,

164
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
(they said if I confess,)

165
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,240
(I'd be released.)

166
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,400
(But another nightmare awaited.)

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,840
(Every day I was a test subject,)

168
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,400
(violated by countless people.)

169
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,440
(Finally, I cowardly ended it all.)

170
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,320
Till my last breath,

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,760
you both thrived unscathed.

172
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,200
(I got a second chance at life.)

173
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,480
(But that girl)

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,760
(remained lying in a pool of blood.)

175
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,480
Pei Xun,

176
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,120
from that moment on,

177
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,800
it's either you kill me

178
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,040
or I kill you.

179
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,680
Lu Ye! Wait.

180
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,640
I want to go home.

181
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,440
Scoundrel!

182
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,920
Sorry, I'm late.

183
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,040
Were you hurt?

184
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,320
No.

185
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,400
Let's go.

186
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,240
If you want me dead so badly,

187
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,280
why sent Mr. Zheng to save me?

188
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:41,271
♪After all, we can only go this far♪

189
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,468
♪Our story can no longer continue♪

190
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,714
♪All the regrets and tears♪

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,880
Why do I always find you

Lu Ye,

209
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,560
don't misunderstand
my relationship with Pei Xun.

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,720
Wange,

211
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,120
if this is your wound,

212
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,120
don't tear it open again.

213
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
I believe you.

214
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
Thank you.

215
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,720
Mrs. Zhou.

216
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,000
Lu Ye,

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,440
perhaps you should go back.

218
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,680
I'm perfectly

219
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,480
safe here.

220
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,120
No need to watch over me constantly.

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,560
Alright then, rest well.

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,040
Mrs. Zhou,

223
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,920
today's incident was unexpected.

224
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,040
It was presumptuous
to bring her back so abruptly.

225
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,360
Thank you.

226
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,720
You're welcome.

227
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,080
I'll leave her in your care then.

228
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,440
Okay.

229
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,200
Siya, you've found someone you like?

230
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,920
Him?

231
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,680
When choosing a partner,

232
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,440
besides excellence and good character,

233
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,720
the most crucial thing

234
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,800
is whether he

235
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,880
can accept you at your worst.

236
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,680
At my worst.

237
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,960
As a part of the Zhou family now,

238
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,680
whatever you say or do,

239
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,120
people will praise your grace

240
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,280
and impeccable manners.

241
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,840
But people aren't always composed.

242
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,640
If the Zhou family falls from grace

243
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,800
and you lose your status,

244
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,960
or if your personality changes,

245
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
they might withdraw their acceptance.

246
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,800
I actually think

247
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
this young man truly accepts you.

248
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,400
He can walk life's path with you.

249
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,960
Siya, ask yourself

250
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,680
if you feel truly at ease with him.

251
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,600
Are you wearing a mask with him around?

252
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,040
Got it.

253
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,320
It's late. Get some rest.

254
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,240
I'll take my leave now.

255
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,520
Yes.

256
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,760
(Lao Fengxiang Jewels)
This time, Mrs. Zhou

257
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,600
wants sapphires and topazes

258
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,760
rather than the rubies
that she usually wanted.

259
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,440
Why?

260
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,640
She's changed her preference.

261
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,480
Her adopted daughter loved rubies.

262
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,760
But giving those to her daughter

263
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,080
would feel inappropriate.

264
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,560
New gems are necessary.

265
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,720
Lin, go to Weina Jewels.

266
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,800
Siya.

267
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,360
Mom.

268
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,160
Mom.

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,200
Why do you keep mistaking me for her?

270
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,920
You...

271
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,840
What are you doing?

272
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
What am I doing?

273
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,760
Mom,

274
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,400
I've always tried to
be your perfect daughter!

275
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,640
Zhou Nian,

276
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,600
you've lived in luxury since childhood.

277
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,760
I funded your education,

278
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,080
hired top tutors

279
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,080
to teach you art,

280
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,960
and paved your designer career path.

281
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,240
I arranged your marriage
to Song Yanzhou,

282
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,400
the heir of the Songs!

283
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
I've treated you no differently

284
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,280
than I treat my own daughter.

285
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,480
No differently?

286
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,240
No differently!

287
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,680
Do you truly see me as her equal?

288
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,080
You've never looked at me

289
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,240
with such care.

290
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,640
How... how did you become like this?

291
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,520
Were you lying about welcoming Siya

292
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,400
back home?

293
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,720
I've kept you in luxury
for over twenty years!

294
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,520
While Siya suffered

295
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,600
through hardships all this time!

296
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,200
Why must you oppose her?

297
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,960
I oppose her?

298
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,320
It's her!

299
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,080
Why did her return

300
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,120
take everything that should be mine?

301
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,840
I've been your daughter
