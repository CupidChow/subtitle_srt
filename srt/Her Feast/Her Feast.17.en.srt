77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,960
when you started

78
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,920
exploiting Lu Ye.

00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,520
he's a policeman

81
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,560
that you thought

82
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,760
he could share your risks?

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,840
Or perhaps

84
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,760
when you learned his other identity,

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,360
you felt he could be more useful?

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,120
I'm not sure what you mean.

87
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,360
How much do you know

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,040
about He Jiu from Beizhou?

89
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,320

90
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,960
Your schemes

91
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,920
are clear to me.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
You want Lu Ye

93
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,760
to be your shield,

94
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,160
to protect you completely.

95
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,200
But don't forget

96
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,880
his current situation.

97
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,520
A mere policeman in Rong City

98
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,800
has no real power.

99
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
When danger comes,

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,440
what resources can he mobilize?

101
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,160
If He Jiu retaliates later,

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,640
he will have to face it alone,

103
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,920
risking his life.

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,920
You don't care for him,

105
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,120
but I do.

106
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,520
Because I'm his father.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,680
We both know

108
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,840
he survived by luck this time.

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
But

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,560
he won't be

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,800
so lucky every time.

112
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,320
What's wrong?

113
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,080
Nothing.

114
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,920
Look!

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,760
Does it still hurt?

116
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
No.

117
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,480
How could it not?

118
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
(In the past life,)

119
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,840
(I knew exactly it hurt a lot).

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Look,

121
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,320
I can still hold you.

122
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
It means it doesn't hurt.

123
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,160
If you still doubt it,

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll lift you up to prove it.

125
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,840
Still joking around?

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,160
Lu.

127
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,440
Well...

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
Meng's men confessed.

129
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,960
Wait for me a moment.

130
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Okay.

131
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
What did they confess?

132
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
Lu,

133
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,880
don't take any more risks this time.

134
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,480
The forces behind them

135
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,880
are too complicated.

136
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,800
It's too dangerous.

137
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Just follow the Chief.

138
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Stop investigating.

139
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,200
Lu,

140
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,320
isn't what you have done

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,280
for Zhang Wange, is it?

142
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,680
(Meng is He Jiu's man.)

143
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
(If Lu Ye keeps investigating,)

144
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,600
(He Jiu won't let him off.)

145
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,760
Here.

146
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,600
Miss Zhang,

147
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,960
how did you and Lu meet?

148
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,400
We were sort of classmates.

149
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Classmates?

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,960
Yeah.

151
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,240
So you knew each other long ago.

152
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,920
Why weren't you together before?

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,400
Why?

154
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,160
You didn't like Lu back then?

155
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,000
Zhao Qing,

156
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,520
you've been working hard.

157
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,360
Have some more.

158
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,760
I didn't know him well before.

159
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,760
In my opinion,

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
whether you know someone well

161
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
is just empty talk.

162
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,320
As you disliked him,

163
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,760
you might don't like him now.

164
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
Zhao Qing,

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,480
let's discuss the Meng case again.

166
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,240
What's up?

167
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,200
Zhao Qing,

168
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,360
why did you provoke her earlier?

169
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Huh?

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Did I?

171
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,760
Zhao Qing,

172
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,880
haven't I offended you?

173
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,120
I just think

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,160
she doesn't like you.

175
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,760
Can't you feel it?

176
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,240
Lu,

177
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,560
here's my advice to you.

178
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,640
Don't get yourself trapped.

179
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,680
Listen,

180
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,160
in relationships,

181
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,280
you can't calculate.

182
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,760
Having two people like each other

183
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,720
at the right moment

184
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,680
is rare.

185
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,280
Stop being so picky.

186
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,280
All I need to do now

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,960
is staying by her side

188
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,800
when she realizes

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
she falls for me.

190
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,280
Besides, when you came in,

191
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,240
didn't you see

192
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,480
the two of us...

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,120
You saw everything.

194
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
I must take responsibility.

195
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,640
Why aren't you eating?

196
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm waiting for you.

197
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,480
Want some of this?

198
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,360
Don't worry.

199
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,600
Meng's case

200
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,080
is mostly resolved.

201
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,760
Okay.

202
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
Come on.

203
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,840
The latest issue of Fashion Weekly.

204
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,320
The latest issue of Fashion Weekly.

205
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:19,530
(Fashion Weekly,
Chenda Jewelry's Rising Star Designers)

206
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,864
(with Rose in the Fire Gaining Acclaim)

207
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,000
Take it.

208
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,760
What's up, Lu?

209
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,520
You just sent Miss Zhang home.

210
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,000
What are you scheming now?

211
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,280
You're too nosy.

212
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,160
Go back to office.
I have unfinished business.

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,880
Alright.

214
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,160
Sir,

215
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,560
this is Rose in the Fire,

216
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,080
from new designer,

217
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
Zhang Wange.

218
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,760
This necklace
is currently one-of-a-kind.

219
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
I'll take it.

220
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,960
Very well, I'll prepare the invoice.

221
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,560
Mr. Lu.

222
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,640
Mr. Song,

223
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,040
what a coincidence.

224
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,480
- Buying a gift for your girlfriend?
- You too?

225
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,560
Yes.

226
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,384
Mr. Song,

227
00:12:20,384 --> 00:12:21,240
here is new product

228
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
designed by Karen Pieno
that you ordered.

229
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,440
Thank you.

230
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,680
Please wrap it up.

231
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,520
Alright.

232
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,400
See you, Mr. Lu.

233
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Wange,

234
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,000
sorry for what happened
at the train station.

235
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,000
Mr. Song has returned.

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
He wants to talk to you.

237
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,240
Zhang Wange.

238
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,760
I thought you'd never return.

239
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,960
Earlier, Fang Cheng
tried to send me away.

240
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
Was that your idea?

241
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,720
Is there something?

242
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,760
Zhang Wange.

243
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Don't hate me.

244
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,160
I don't hate you.

245
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,880
Then do you like me?

246
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,920
I could like anyone,

247
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,720
except you.

248
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,920
Our previous separation

249
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,000
made me realize

250
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,400
I'd be the first one you'd abandon.

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,200
But how could you know

252
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,120
temporary abandonment

253
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,120
just means insufficient affection?

254
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,720
Because I'm certain

255
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,480
that the one I love

256
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,720
would never abandon me

257
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,080
under any circumstances.

258
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
So, when I left before,

259
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,080
you didn't care at all.

260
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,800
Nor were you upset.

261
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,480
Maybe because I used to be an orphan,

262
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,760
I've gotten used to it.

263
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
What's all this?

264
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,560
Buying a gift for your girlfriend?

265
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,640
You too?

266
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,680
Yes.
