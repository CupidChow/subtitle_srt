00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,370
No one can be a shoo-in in performance I guess.

797
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,140
Because I am confident that we are not inferior to anyone.

Yeah.

If they were a shoo-in,

800
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,280
then it's about the fan base.

Which is Copper and Ta.

I'm a bit worried because our fan base is not as big as that of others'.

00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,610
But I try not to think about it too much

From what you've seen many times,

809
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,440
have you decide which scene to choose?

810
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,580
I have one in mind.

811
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,280
There was one scene that was interesting.

[Fuaiz Thanawat Shinawat]
[IG:fuaiz_thanawat]

813
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:15,860
The scene I chose is when Kinn and Porsche falling off a cliff.

814
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,070
But I'm a little afraid

815
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,320
that it might be too simple.

816
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,650
It's not very impactful. So what scene did you choose?

817
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,480
I chose the cafe date scene.

Hey!

This scene is my favorite one in the series.

821
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,180
Well, it's lovely

822
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,950
and worth trying, because…

823
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,420
You mentioned you wanted to play this scene?

824
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,160
Since EP. 7, you wanted to try this scene.

825
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,110
I think it's OK.

826
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:55,130
It's lovely.

827
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,720
But let's see. Because this scene involves other people.

828
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,030
I don't know if it's possible.

829
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,540
Because they want us to choose a scene with only 2 people.

830
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,420
About these two, we better start explaining to Pom

831
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,020
how each one is like in our opinion.

832
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,600
This junior is JJ,

833
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,980
and what's interesting about him is that he is quite natural.

834
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,910
He knows who he is.

835
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,430
He know what he likes.

836
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,640
And the most important thing

837
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,850
is he's a good listener.

838
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,120
From day one, he had a little family problem.

839
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,630
It made him very sad.

840
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,730
Now he's changed and loved himself.

841
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,180
And it shows in everything he does.

842
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,800
JJ is doing great now.

843
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,610
I'm just worried he might get carried away,

844
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,490
because he always has had high scores.

845
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,780
Always be at No.1. This is something to watch out for.

846
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,880
Because I think I started to see something.

I think he's shown a little.

Would you rather be Kinn or Porsche?

849
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,260
I think I'm better fit to being Porsche.

850
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,940
OK.

851

It fits you well.

854

Okay, I'm Kinn again.

855
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,090
I've always been telling him that he is not fit to be Porsche.

So there's no need to change roles.

859
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,900
Should we change their characters?

860

Is it necessary?

If we're really going to change,

862
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,820
make it like Kinn was disappointed with Porsche.

Another junior is Fuaiz.

872

He's been in the industry for a long time.

873
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:19,190
He has his own character.

874

And he thinks he knows how to present himself.

This is how I will talk. This is how I will be.

So I'm not really touched to

Fuaiz's performance.

He couldn't find himself.

So he couldn't find the character.

I think this is his problem.

Fuaiz, just like Po said, can be seen from the beginning,

883

that he's a kid in the industry.
Everybody knows him since he was young.

He then opened himself up.

we start pulling out our potential.

This is the problem.

976

Shall we ask the seniors?

978
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,240
Sure.

979
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,890
Let's ask them how we should approach this scene.

980
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,590
Right.

981
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,450
Mio.

982
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,140
He is very natural.

983
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,220
He is indifferent towards everything.

984
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,140
So when he performs,

985
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,330
he is also indiffent.

986
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,360
He probably felt like, "Hey! I just wanted to ask"

987
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,480
So I asked.

988
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,950
And he attentively listened.

989
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,260
He is a good listener.

990
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,850
As for Mio,

991
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,260
when he was there, he let it flow.

992
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:54,080
He chose to be there, and believed in it.

993
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,180
And he had never studied acting before.

994
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,600
There aren't any frameworks

00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,310
it made him well-balanced even more.

Let's start with Copper

1074

The most obvious problem is that

Copper is very compressed.

1076
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,080

Doing this, for this, to get this.

1082
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,460
He focused more on the competition, rather than having fun or enjoyment.

1083
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,070
But from my opinion, I feel like...

We can have discipline, but if we focus too much,

-Makes full use of the stage. -Indeed.

1113

However, the problem with action is that we don't know if we'll have enough time for rehearsal.

Throughout the past,

1135
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,630
I've seen that Ta has

1136
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,050
a natural blend of being himself.

1137
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,520
But being himself.. slightly putting on airs.

1138

Getting feedbacks when he portrayed certain personalities

1141
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,880
So he started to believe

1142

that this is who he is.

1143

Ta has been with us since he was 21.

He goes beyond his age. The fact that I got him in THC.

1153

My point is to let him know that.. Ta, don't lose being young.

00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,240
-Hello. -Hello.

1279
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,190
How's it going?  Preparing.

1280
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,900
Can you tell us about it?

1281
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,160
Well, the scene we chose is

1282
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,730
when Kinn and Porsche secretly went on a date at a café.

1283
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,700
Why did you choose it?

1284
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,690
I like it, I think it's cute.

1285
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:12,810
What about you?

1286
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:17,540
I feel like it was a moment when Kinn and Porsche dared to do something.

1287
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,920
Because they didn't in the past.

1288
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,670
What do you mean by daring?

1289
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,510
I mean dare to...

1290
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,070
Being true to themselves

1291
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,500
It's like both of them

1292
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:31,320
are expressing their feelings for each other. Like being real lovers.

1293
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,520
Didn't they show that kind of feeling before?

1294
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,740
And this is not the first.

1295
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,910
It's the first time they went on a date.

1296
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,270
Showing another side of themselves out.

1297
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,110
It doesn't really matter.

1298
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:47,790
It's just that Porsche, has never taken someone like Kinn out on a date before.

1299
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,100
But Kinn showed that

1300
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,250
he didn't care about anything.

1301
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,380
They are already in love,

1302
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:54,750
and they act like lovers wherever they are.

1303
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,030
This is just about going out into the real world.

1304
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,050
What I am trying to convey is...

1305
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,070
it's like stepping outside of the norm for the first time.

I feel like I didn't arrange my words properly.

1308
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,030
Why did you choose this scene?

1309
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:10,380
From what I've seen so far, this is my most favorite moment.

1310
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,210
What makes this scene interesting?

1311
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,240
It's cute.

1312
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,860
What I want you to focus and answer,

1313
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,280
are to answer in terms of needs and feelings.

1314
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,980
I only wanted

1315
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:25,080
him to feel good,

1316
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:27,050
and he also wanted me to feel good.

1317
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,480
So the scene turned out cute.

1318
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,420
We didn't even have to try make it cute.

1319
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:31,670
Do you understand?

1320
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,380
If not answering in terms of feelings.

1321
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,480
This means you'll just try to act like how it is.

1322
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,310
I'm worried.

1323
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,060
Choosing this scene. I'm quite worried.

1324
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,070
Because it is a cute one.

1325
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,390
When you go and play it out.

1326
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,890
There won't be much.

1327
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,210
But that doesn't mean it's wrong. I think it's risky,

1328
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,290
because every scenes they played, were just cute.

1329
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,850
They understand what they like,

1330
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,240
and they chose this scene.

1331
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,540
If you take a risk, and fall out of the safe zone, then flip. If it worked out, then it worked out.

1332
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,570
If it didn't, or just break even.

1333
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,090
You will be swallowed up.

1334
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,020
From my viewpoint, I like to take risks.

1335
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,240
I like taking risks. I want to see.

1336
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,400
Do you have any questions or anything you wanna ask us?

1337
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,610
Can we add something more to the script?

1338
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,710
For example,

1339
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,440
a little add-on to the scripts.

1340
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,270
I suggest you to believe in the script first.

1341
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,200
Try to find the reason why did you say that.

1342
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,870
Otherwise, you'll just end up playing yourselves all the time.

1343
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:36,780
Just interpreting it in you own way, telling it from your own perspective, it still wouldn't be the same.

1344
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,460
the end, if you keep changing the scripts, and not being who you are.

1345
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,660
How can you play with anyone?

1346
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:43,790
You have to play with many people who memorized their scripts.

1347
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:45,910
You should have some respect. I'll leave this to you.

1348
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,880
I'm not entirely sure about this.

1349
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,330
If you're hypothetically changing it. I'm okay.

1350
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,770
Or just use this one. I'm still okay. My only concern is.. it's too safe.

1351
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,070
I'm quite into this scene.

1352
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,330
I know it's risky, but it's worth a try.

How is it? What have you prepared to present to us?

1357
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,220
Well, we started with

1358
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,750
brainstorming ideas, gathering various ideas together.

1359
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,750
The idea I suggested was

1360
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,370
a Wasabi scene.

1361
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,610
But today, during the brainstorming idea with Ta.

1362
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,700
There was a change in plans regarding which scene to play.

1363
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,720
Ta.

1364
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:25,820
Well,

1365
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,780
personally. I like action.

1366
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,570
My initial thought was to incorporate action.

1367
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,460
In conclusion, assuming it's an action,

1368
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,560
and we add some comedy.

1369
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,440
And a bit of romance. It should work.

1370
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,150
Action is interesting.

1371
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,750
But action is not easy.

1372
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,750
Especially for those who don't like confrontation.

1373
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,660
Copper doesn't like physical confrontation.

1374
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,840
It might take a lot of practice.

1375
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,730
Then to mix with comedy.

1376
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,920
-Actually, there is already some comedy in the scene. -Ah, yes yes.

1377
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:56,490
But the romance.

1378
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,480
How would you add it? This should be difficult to make it smooth.

1379
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:01,610
It's considered

1380
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,060
bold thinking.

1381
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,090
But you also have to work hard.

1382
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,940
If there is a chance, I want you to try to choose another scene.

1383
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,340
Because..

1384
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,980
As someone with ten years of experience in action.

1385
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,780
It's very, very, very difficult.

1386
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:18,810
Yes.

1387
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,500
I don't like closing opportunities for people.

1388
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,550
I want to know. Copper, do you have any basic action?

1389
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,460
A little bit.

1390
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,800
Or you can show it to us now.

1391
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,470
But it's been a long time.

1392
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:35,510
Give it a try.

1393

Well, I have experience in Muay Thai.

1394
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,500
Okay, let's try something rough.

1395
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,360
Just a few strikes to show.

1396
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,320
Try it in slow motion.

1397
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,450
Take it slow.

1398
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,280
No need for real fighting.

1399
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,270
Just some acting.

1400
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:00,590
Okay.

1401
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:01,850
Let me choose for you.

1402
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,170
Let's change the scene.

But it might not be the right time yet.

I honestly think, you can try to explore and find the right scene.

Doesn't mean you presented this scene today, you must only use this scene.

There's another scene that Copper came up with. Going to the graveyard.

Oh, I personally like this scene.

That Kinn and Porsche went to the graveyard.

00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:39,040
But I'm concerned that it's a scene where they just stand still.

1417
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,550
Will it make use of the stage we have? The grand one.

If it was a scene you just mentioned.

It is less but can be more.

It's less but

1421

it can have a greater impact.

What you might get,

the emotions from an audience,

1424
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:00,110
-the screams of approval. -If you can't

handle what in front of you.

00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,910
nd I think the dynamic between me and the Copper would work well in our style.

1436
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:26,150
-Oh, this scene is great. -It's intriguing.

1437
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,320
-Wait, who's playing who? -Uh yeah, who plays who?

1438
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:30,710
I think it would be better if I am Porsche.

1439
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,720
It's funny because

1440
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,150
it looks well-fitted.

1441
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,110
Because Porsche has that goofiness that you have.

1442
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,520
I'm rooting for this BBQ scene.

1443
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,180
OK.

1444
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,110
I personally like this scene.

1445
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:46,380
It's a scene of happiness, goofiness, and craziness.

1446
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:49,530
And I believe this scene will definitely make many people smile.

Don't think about winning or losing.

Especially you, Copper.

1451

on't think at all, just have fun with it.

Get ready and let it go.

But when coming down to Chapter 3.

1455
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,980

This Episode has a clear goal.

1459

I can see the destination now and how it will be.

I think this scene is great for us.

It's like we were born for this.

Very good.

Hello, teacher.

1477
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:52,400
Hello.

1478
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,980
Okay, today we will present.

1479
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,150
Our scene.

1480
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Yes, about how we planned it.

1481
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,320
We chose the same scene from our previous performance.

1482
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,720
The same one at the practice room.

1483
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:09,130
And Porchay came for music revision.

1484
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,400
We chose this scene because both of us

1485
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,290
have something in common,

1486
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,180
which is

1487
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:16,250
-music.  -Music and singing.

1488
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,670
It's obvious that it's music, so we're okay.

[Athens Werapatanakul]  
[IG:athenswerapat]

1490
00:52:18,910 --> 00:52:23,500
This scene will bring out my musical ability very well.

1491
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:27,770
Actually, there was a composed song in the scene.

1492
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,790
But we're going beyond that.

1493
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,690
I'll compose our own song.

1494
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,790
Changing from "Just you" to a newly composed song?

1495
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,470
Or there's more?

1496
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,140
Yes, there's more.

1497
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,970
Oh, Okay. Let's hear it!

1498
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,290
In the scene,

1499
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,630
it seems like Kim

1500
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,970
didn't get to show his full potential.

1501
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:46,800
Ah, yes yes.

1502
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,440
I think what if Mio can get a guitar solo.

1503
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:50,940
The whole world would scream.

1504
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,820
-Hey, no daydreaming. -Really.

1505
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,340
Do you know we have you here to perform?

1506
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:57,640
Not to play music.

1507
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:00,710
Yes we know, but..

1508
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,720
I just wanted to add

1509
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,870
-what I want to do on stage. -Yes.

1510
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,940
And the script,

1511
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,990
we will change to our own way.

1512
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,290
I don't think

1513
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,750
it would work.

1514
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,710
You're playing the same scene.

1515
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,190
I feel you're playing it safe.

1516
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,250
And of course that scene has a song.

1517
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,930
ou'll just compose a new song and have a guitar solo.

1518
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,610
It looks like you're just using the scene to support your song.

1519
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:28,030
That hurts.

1520
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,850
Hurts?

1521
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:29,330
Really hurts.

1522
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,190
-It hurts. -Yes.

1523
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,970
It's not about showing music.

1524
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:34,460
Showing music can be added on to every scene.

1525
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:34,920
Yes.

1526
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,010
To another Porchay's scene, or whoever. But not the same one.

[IG:bump_pawat]

1528
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,040
Yes, we might play safe.

1529
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,470
But we listened to them... like which one is not working, which one should be fixed.

1530
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:46,550
Suppose you said you like songs and music.

1531
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,160
Songs and music can be inserted in any scene.

1532
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,300
You don't have to be Kim and Porchay.

1533
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,220
Even if you have composed an incredible song.

1534
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,340
I still don't want it to be used in this scene.

1535
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,240
"Just you" is the best already.

1536
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,290
Carrying a guitar, can play guitar, doesn't mean you're cool.

1537
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,210
But it has to come with the right context and timing.

1538
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,590
The singing of both of you

1539
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,510
is not that good yet.

1540
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:10,340
So don't make this the main focus.

1541
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,440
You're here right now, is what next in the series. About the performance.

1542
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,220
That skill can be used to enhance it.

1543
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,430
But making it the main point right away.

1544
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,180
You will lock yourselves in completely.

1545
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,570
It's not wrong carrying a guitar. Looking handsome?

1546
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:23,050
Yes. Everyone screams? Yes. But be careful. What Pond mentioned are all correct.

1547
00:54:23,410 --> 00:54:25,640
Now, that moment, in that scene,

1548
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,800
what would win over "Just you"?

1549
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,220
Don't have to win, but something close is not even easy at all.

1550
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:34,520
Not arguing, but the song is really popular.

1552
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,190
That was a little harsh.

1553
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,080
I don't want to make a song like "Just you".

1554
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,280
I think you got it wrong from the beginning.

1555
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,260
I'm thinking...

1556
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,100
you're overconfident!

1557
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,440
You think what you have is naturalness.

1558
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:51,430
You think you can rely on your friend.

1559
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:52,970
Naturalness

1560
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,740
requires preparation.

1561
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,990
And don't think what you're doing is something you're good at,

1562
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
and that people will like it.

1563
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:07,140
The two of you, have a lot of acting skills and compatibility.

1564
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,480
Use them to find the right scene.

1565
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,550
Adding music and songs would be even better.

1566
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,300
Well, every scene can have music.

1567
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,650
It's just how you imagine it, how you execute it, how you create it.

KinnPorsche is a work that we all here are proud of.

1571

Do your homework well. How do you feel with which scene.

1572
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,470
Picture yourself performing with your friend,

1573
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,800
and others will follow.

1574
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,000
Then you will be happy to perform.

Those 4-5 minutes can change your lives.

1576

Make it more worthwhile than this.

The scene I chose is when

Kinn and Porsche were having conversation at the minor family.

When they were giving a gun.

1588

Giving a gun, and holding a gun. -Interesting.

1589

Thanks.

1593
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,220
It's nothing.

1594
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,350
It's considered good.

1595
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,140
This is an unexpected chosen scene,

1596
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,760
which I think is a good choice.

1597
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,000
-We accidentally chose the same scene. - Yes.

1598
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,370
-Really? -Yeah.

1599
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:24,300
The same scene.

1600
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:25,760
Very interesting.

1601
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,570
Why did you choose this scene?

1602
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:30,910
It's a scene when Kinn wanted to give something important to Porsche.

1603
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,390
And it is very important.

1604
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,100
How much trust he has to give it to someone.

1605
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,100
It's a scene that leads to many other scenes.

1606
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,050
What about you? Why did you choose it?

1607
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,740
They started opening up and

1608
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,130
had a talk in the previous scene.

1609
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,900
Then came to this scene. Kinn wanted to surprise Porsche.

1610
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,490
This scene, I'm very satisfied watching it.

1611
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:51,670
There are a lot of emotions in this scene.

1612
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:52,210
Yes.

1613
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:54,310
It seems easy, but it's difficult.

1614
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,420
It includes longing, right?

1615
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:57,280
And what else?

1616
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,390
It also...

1617
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,270
includes a love scene.

1618
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:01,750
OK.

1619
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,530
Before we get to the love scene. How were they feeling then?

1620
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:05,810
-They cared about each other. -They cared.

1621
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,420
Wanting to see, to give encouragement.

1622
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:11,700
And while they were talking,

1623
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,440
desires got involved.

1624
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,660
Well, this is a problem.

1625
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,110
The fact that you're talking about this scene, shows that you're focusing on it.

1626
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,770
That's completely missing the point.

1627
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,140
You need to go through all their emotions.

1628
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,910
Not just to focus on what makes you satisfied.

1629
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,890
Satisfying can be seen anywhere.

1630
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:31,310
The relationship, the details, the emotions are more important.

1631
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,380
Don't think that love scenes are the most important.

1632
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,040
If KinnPorshe only had love scenes, people in this world wouldn't like it.

1633
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:37,520
They would rather just watch porn.

1634
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,840
Giving too much importance to love scenes.

1635
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:42,260
Missing out on the significance of other aspects.

Who plays who?

1638
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,310
I was thinking I could be Porsche,

1639
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:48,750
and Jett would be Kinn.

1640
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,500
Because I have many female and LGBTQ friends.

1641
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,970
And I think I got that from them.

1642
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,660
Do you mean the personality or something else?

1643
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:57,190
Yes, personality.

1644
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,940
Because friends and many people have mentioned.

1645
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,870
And I think

1646
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:05,040
there is a little femininity in me.

1647
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:06,550
I can bring it out.

1648
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:08,250
So I would rather be Porsche than Kinn.

1649
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,190
That's wrong.

1650
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:10,960
It's not relevant at all.

1651
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,010
This way of thinking is very wrong.

1652
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,010
We don't need to compare Porsche to anyone.

1653
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,950
Or define what Porsche should be. Porsche is always Porsche.

1654
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:21,750
If you said because you have friends

1655
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:22,990
of diverse genders.

1656
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:25,330
And using that to criticize the character of Porsche.

1657
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,760
You're misunderstanding.

1658
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:30,000
It's wrong that you're trying to be someone else.

1659
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:33,350
Because I was Porsche, I never felt like I was someone else.

1660
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:34,630
I was just Porsche.

1661
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,410
Acting is not about showing off.

1662
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,950
It's a belief.

1663
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,040
We don't need to compare Porsche to anyone.

1664
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,140
New, you don't understand the character. Just like Vegas.

1665
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,660
You also think he is a psychopath.

1666
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,220
Because you're trying to find words to define the characters,

1667
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,750
which is not.

1668
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:52,290
It's also written here,

1669
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,420
a character you wanted to be

1670
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:56,190
not being yourself.

1671
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,930
This reflects his problem,

1672
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,850
-as exactly as we discussed earlier. -Yes.

1673
00:59:01,110 --> 00:59:02,810
New, you lacks being yourself.

1674
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:06,490
You're really adorable without a camera.

1675
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:10,020
But when the camera is there, you would turn into a character.

1676
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,630
It's quite obvious.

1677
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,230
It's a pity.

1678
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,340
Honestly, New, you look very handsome.

1679
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,300
And when speaking normally and less stiff. New is really adorable.

1680
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:22,420
know the reason why I'm like this,

1681
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:25,520
it's like... not being myself sometimes or something because..

1682
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,440
During my high school years,

1683
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,100
I was judged that I had to be in a certain way.

1684
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:32,410
What kind of way?

1685
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,630
New has to be bad,

1686
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,650
I actually didn't wanna be like that.

1687
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,140
Yes.

1688
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,240
That's it! You found it.

1689
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,020
I didn't wanna be like that at all, I just wanted to be adorable.

1690
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,530
I just wanted to smile.

1691
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,480
Yes, exactly.

1692
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,790
Sometimes I wanted to smile, how come I couldn't smile?

1693
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:48,210
Why did I have to be bad?

1694
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,620
If you really feel that, try to overcome it.

1695
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:54,300
Don't worry about how others see it. Being adorable, and so what?

1696
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,990
What if being adorable and getting criticized for being too feminine?

1697
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:59,210
Don't pay attention to them. Just give them the clap

1698
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,640
We can be anything that makes you happy.

And it unlocked something in me.

1705
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:15,660
No, I think we have to be fair to them. They didn't have much time.

1706
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,640
They can think this much is quite impressive.

Yes. But asking about the production aspect for the stage,

1712
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,190
do you think it's appropriate?

1713
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,690
It could be appropriate.
