and the one you want the least.

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,850
Now,

381
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,910
it's all in my hands.

382
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,630
I have to say that

383
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,860
Copper is

384
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,890
the person who was picked in the 9th rank, the same with Lotte.

385
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,330
That's too much!

386
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,340
But there is one person writing here

"I like him so much that I put 300,000 asterisks on the sentence."

Copper seems like an easy-going guy,

393
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,260
but sometimes, I don't know whether it's real or not.

I am cheerful and energetic all the time.

I also always think positive.

399

And what JJ said

400
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,680
is something that I have always faced.

401
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,160
People think that I'm faking it

402
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,090
to get attention or to get other people to like me.

403
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,090
Make other people care about me.

404
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,780
It makes me a bit sad.

405
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,680
I'm sad because I thought he was my close friend,

406
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,530
but he thought like that.

407
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,840
But now that I thought I was close to him,

408
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,520
I'll just pretend that we are close.

409
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,780
Until he tell me that we are not close,

410

or whatnot.

411
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,430
At first, I cannot choose,

412
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,960
so I just write the name.

413
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,710
I remember Lotte is the 1st,

414
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,970
Fuaiz is the 2nd…

415

Yep.

417
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,330
Because I didn't think,

418
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,430
and I just wrote randomly

419
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,170
in order.

420
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,550
And then Copper was in the middle, so I skip to the others.

no matter how positive he is,

427
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:15,920
would wonder,

428

if he really thought like that.

He said "don't worry."

he was close to JJ,

433
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,680
but JJ said that.

He didn't think much. But he's a bit sad.

435

For the pairing up today,

436
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,550
the first person who will pick his buddy is the one who got

440
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,340
You guys will have the right to pick your buddy.

441

Apart from those three people,

442

there are two more people who has the same amount of coins.

444

and JJ.

445
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,670
Both of you have the same amount of coins,

446
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,380
so we use the votes from your friends as a reference.

447
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,140
So Jet will pick first.

448

JJ is the fifth to pick.

449
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,760
And since Ta is new here today,

450
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,070
I would have to ask you to wait

458
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,100
Choose carefully.

459
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,060
Do I have to say it?

460
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,990
You'd better, or I will say it for you.

461

It's not that I don't want to say, but…

462

I chose Max, because…

It's not like that.

maybe,

468
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,480
at that time, Max was very cunning

469

and very hard to understand.

I want to pair up with Ta.

480

and I believe in fortune telling.

Then

488
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,910
I didn't choose Jet.

489
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,180
Because it seems

490
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,599
Jet's poinst

491
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,020
are between

the 1st and the 5th places.

493
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,740
So I thought

494
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,420
I'll just pick Ta and I also wanted to know him.

495

It is his first day here,

The team that is drawn will choose the second team to play in the same game,

The person riding the horse

00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,710
and I'm still shocked now.

1645
00:56:54,030 --> 00:56:55,180
It's great.

1646
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,280
Will I have the opportunity to take the catamaran trip

1647
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,010
stay in a luxury suite, and enjoy a fancy meal?

1648
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,240
That will be fantastic.

1649
00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:20,250
[Woody
Nuttawut Chaibooranapankul IG:t_wuddy]

1650
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,280
The boat was drifting on the sea, and the weather was pleasantly cool.

1651
00:58:11,670 --> 00:58:14,060
The boat kept sailing, and we were there enjoying the sea breeze,

1652
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,160
sipping drinks and watching the sunset.

1653
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:18,130
It's fantastic.

1654
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,620
To those who lost in the competition,

1655
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,060
go have your packed meals first.

1656
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,180
But the two of us enjoyed

1657
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:29,250
lobster, delicious beef, scallops,

1658
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,460
and salmon.

1659
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,080
All the dishes were exquisite and carefully prepared.

1660
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:34,890
They're terrific.

1661
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,150
How's Copper doing right now?

1662
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,250
How's Woody doing?

1663
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:45,410
Where's Copper?

1664
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:47,940
Would he be naked on the boat and start dancing?

1665
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:48,610
Keep staring.

1666
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,450
We're keep staring.

1667
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,840
What do we do now? Shall we vote?

1668
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,860
Shall we vote now, or...

1669
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,820
should we wait for them?

1670
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:58,750
Let's just vote.

1671
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,980
Do we need to eat first?

1672
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,470
How are you feeling this afternoon?

1673
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:10,010
It's a lot of fun.

1674
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,230
Right? It's very relaxing.

1675
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,070
I feel that

1676
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,170
you and I made a great team.

1677
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,100
We're a good team, right?

1678
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,840
At first, I didn't expect that we're gonna win.

1679
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:22,100
Me too.

1680
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:25,000
But, well, we won. Like we are good. And each of us got 3 coins.

1681
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:27,260
We won both games.

1682
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,700
-We got coins from both games. -Yes.

1683
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,720
But it's a bit of a pity that we didn't come in first place in both games.

1684
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,520
But I don't think there's anything to regret about it.

1685
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,000
-We all got the coins. -We have already done very well.

1686
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:36,180
We have already done very well.

1687
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:39,470
If we don't end up on the same team tomorrow, it's okay.

1688
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:42,530
We still can help each other.

1689
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:42,990
I will try my best.

1690
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,950
-Right, try your best. Good luck! -Have a good time with the game!

1691
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,930
Both of us have put in a lot of effort,

1692
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,830
whether it was the first game or the second game.

1693
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,180
We were both very serious and committed.

1694
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:52,650
I really really want to get the coins.

1695
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,310
I know you're not the hidden character.

1696
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,200
I was very serious in the first game.

1697
00:59:59,320 --> 00:59:59,900
Yeah.

1698
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:00,940
I was also very serious in the second game.

1699
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,640
But I feel like I was even more serious in the second game.

1700
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,120
It was so close. It's okay.

1701
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:07,580
Do you know why?

1702
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,290
Because,

1703
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:11,100
in the first game,

1704
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:13,790
I was trying my best to lose.

1705
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,660
What? You're kidding.

1706
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,140
I am...

1707
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,090
the hidden character.

1708
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:24,090
I mean it.

1709
01:00:24,850 --> 01:00:25,270
I'm not lying.

1710
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:26,770
But,

1711
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,920
I called you over to talk

1712
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,550
because I just wanted to let you know

1713
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,910
that I would feel really upset

1714
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,790
if I didn't tell you.

1715
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,600
I feel that I have been playing games with you as your buddy since morning

1716
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,310
and I can see your determination...

1717
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,920
Seriously?

1718
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,350
I am serious.

1719
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:48,980
Really?

1720
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:49,560
Yeah.

1721
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:51,780
If I don't tell you, I feel...

1722
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,070
Do you understand?

1723
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,300
Yeah.

1724
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:55,760
So I've decided to tell you,

1725
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,190
I haven't told anyone else, just you.

1726
01:00:58,370 --> 01:00:59,300
I don't believe you.

1727
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:00,550
I mean it.

1728
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,810
Do I look like a liar to you?

1729
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:04,970
I'm serious.

1730
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:05,780
Well,

1731
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,490
-so the first game, you... -How about this?

1732
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,590
I assure you that if I lie to you,

1733
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,580
you can completely ignore me in the future.

1734
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:12,740
I'm being serious.

1735
01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:14,250
I mean it.

1736
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,050
-But I... -Vote for me.

1737
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:18,660
-You said you're the hidden character right? -Yeah.

1738
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,110
But can I not vote for you?

1739
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:21,350
No, you have to vote for me.

1740
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,320
Well, why do you want me to vote for you?

1741
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,570
Because I'm getting my coin now. I lost.

1742
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,790
I don't have anything now.

1743
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,330
Oh, I'm not going to pick you.

1744
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:32,230
I'm not an idiot.

1745
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:34,940
OK. It's up to you.

1746
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,500
I have to follow my heart.

1747
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,210
OK.

1748
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,990
And my heart says, I have to pick Max.

1749
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:39,840
OK.

1750
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,570
Max's on my mind right now.

01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:42,890
OK.

1752
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:44,530
I already told you.

1753
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:45,240
OK.

1754
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:46,420
Let's shake hands.

1755

Thank you for being so serious in the game today.

Thank you. You're great.

Now we have reached the most important moment of the day.

1762
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,110
It's the voting time,

1763
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,420
where we have to decide who the hidden character of the day is.

1764
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,580
Now many people already have some candidates in mind.

1765
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,680
OK, without further ado, let's get started.

1766
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:24,930
It's time to vote.

1767
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:26,070

Let's not waste any more time.
I'm sure everyone is eager to know who the hidden character is today.

1775
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,150
I'm about to reveal the answer now.

1776
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,320
OK.

1777
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:29,860
The first card.

1778
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:36,270
Welcome our freshman,

1779
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:37,280
Ta.

1780
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,780
The second card.

1781
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:48,240
Max.

1782
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,190
He already knew. We all already knew.

1783
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:52,020
This one is suspicious.

1784
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:54,880
The third card.

1785
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:58,590
I think everybody has a problem with the rookie.

1786
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,370
It's Ta again.

1787

Here we go.

It's weird.

1789

The fourth card.

1790
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:09,750
It's a tie.

1791
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:10,660
Max.

1792
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:11,430
OK. Very good.

1793
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,230
The fifth card.

1794
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:20,470
Max.

1795
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:22,440
OK.

1796
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,360
The sixth one,

1797
01:04:29,150 --> 01:04:29,930
this one is quite different.

1798

I want to be on camera, I want the camera to capture me.

1803
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:42,800
He wants to get some screen time.

1804
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,380
Card 7.

1805
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,320

We're almost there.

1809
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,430
Card no.9.

1810
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:17,200
Max.

1811
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,950
The last card.

1812
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:28,980
Who do you think it will be?

1813
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,710
Max.

1814
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:31,490
Max!

1815
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,870
Alright, now we have, 3 Ta's cards,

1816
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:43,010
5 Max's cards and 2 Lotte's cards.

1817
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,030
Let's start with the least number of votes.

1818
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:49,610
Please raise your hand if you think Lotte is the hidden character.

1819
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,200
JJ and Fuaiz.

1820
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,440
If Lotte is the hidden character

1821
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,430
these two people will each receive 2 coins.

1822
01:05:57,930 --> 01:05:59,920
Lotte, are you the hidden character?

1823
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:01,780
Nope.

1824
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:02,830
Nope.

1825
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:05,510
Oh no!

1826
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,060
What about Max?

1827
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:11,220
Well,

1828
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,570
there are 5 people who voted for you,

1829
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:14,850
quite a lot.

1830
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,860
If these 5 people answered correctly,

1831
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,720
each of them will receive 2 coins.

1832
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:20,200
Who voted for Max?

1833
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:21,760
Sorry, Max.

1834
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:23,040
I love you.

1835
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,630
Love you. Love you.

1836
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:25,450
Love you.

1837
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:26,630
OK.

1838
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:29,210
Max.

1839
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,610
Are you the hidden character?

1840
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,090
Nope.

1841
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:38,980
Nope.

1842
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,080
It's not Max.

1843
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,470
The last one.

1844
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,940
Ta, here we go!

1845
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:51,090
I believe it's the one everyone has been eagerly waiting for.

1846
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,980
Because it's his first day on the show,

1847
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:55,570
and he performed exceptionally well on his debut.

1848
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,230
There are 3 people who voted for Ta.

1849
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:00,110
Who voted for Ta? Please raise your hand.

1850
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,880
Woody, Mio and Max.

1851
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:03,970
Alright.

1852
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,100
Here comes the exciting moment.

1853
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:06,420
Ta,

1854
01:07:06,730 --> 01:07:09,000
are you today's hidden character?

1855
01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:16,560
Nope.

1856
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:20,930
Who is it?

1857
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:21,630
OK.

1858
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:25,420
So no one guessed correctly today.

1859
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,220
Who?

1860
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,010
Oh! No one guessed correctly today!

1861
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,090
Bump, it must be you.

1862
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:29,560
Bump!

1863
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,720
Who's today's hidden character?

1864
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:32,500
Please raise your hand.

1865
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:40,470
Oh.

1866
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,450
Oh.

1867
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:42,540
It's me.

1868
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:07,220
This is today's hidden character!

1869
01:08:08,490 --> 01:08:10,230
I knew it.

1870
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:14,040
When the hidden character was revealed, everyone was surprised.

1871
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:21,930
[Bump
Pawat Akkradetsakul IG:bump_pawat]

1872
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,660
How could it be me?

1873
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,550
Because at the beginning, it seemed like no one chose me.

1874
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,090
And nobody paid attention to me.

1875
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:22,300
From morning till afternoon,

[Bump

1877
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:25,660
nobody paid attention to me at all.

1878
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:28,130
They all went and chose Max instead.

1879
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,060
They didn't observe carefully enough themselves.

1880
01:08:31,260 --> 01:08:32,130
I felt extremely satisfied.

1881
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:33,569
I got ya!

1882
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:37,460
Hmm, I always get deceived, and I also want to deceive others for a change.

1883
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:39,600
Well, how does it feel, guys? Being deceived, how does it feel?

1884
01:08:41,779 --> 01:08:43,359
No one noticed anything wrong with him.

1885
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,779
Did he pretend too well or something?

1886
01:08:44,779 --> 01:08:46,290
Why didn't anyone suspect him?

1887
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,779
Let me say it.

1888
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,939
I doubted him from the first game.

1889
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:50,890
Why didn't you choose me?

1890
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,500
I changed my mind. Because of Max...

1891
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,450
I knew it.

1892
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:56,069
He had a conversation with me by the seaside.

1893
01:08:56,069 --> 01:08:58,830
He said he was the hidden character, but I didn't believe him.

1894
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:00,970
I told him already. I don't know what else to say to him.

1895
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,830
You thought it was a trap, but he came to confess to you honestly.

1896
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,770
But you thought he was playing tricks.

1897
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:08,300
I told you and I made a promise to you.

1898
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,300
I meant it.

1899
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:10,819
So today,

1900
01:09:11,470 --> 01:09:12,750
on the card table,

1901
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:14,000
there was no Bump's cards.

1902
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,859
Actually, Bump should have received 6 coins,

1903
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:19,310
[The hidden character is not allowed to help themselves or their teammates earn coins. If they do, all their gold coins will be confiscated]

1904
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,399
but he already received 3 during the morning mini game.

1906
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,340
So,

1907

please return the coins.

1908
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:26,350

Oh! That's why his coins are confiscated.

Yeah.

1918
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:40,460
In the end, I didn't have any coins left.

You're so unfortunate. You won the first game.

He was standing next to me, and we even had our arms around each other's shoulders.

01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:43,140
I was surprised, but indeed he disguise himself very well.

1974
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:47,440
[Mio
Athens Werapatanakul  IG:athenswerapat]

1975
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,500
Then, he announced the answer.

1976
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,520
And Bump came out and said,

1977
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,920
"It's me!" Hey, he's a big liar.

1978
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,940
But the reason why none of us chose Bump

1979
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:54,570
was because Bump won coins during the mini game.

1980
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:57,180
He won coins in the shooting game that I played against him.

1981
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,440
So I didn't pick him.

1982
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,140
Because he won and received coins.

1983
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:04,040
But the rules said, if the hidden character wins mini game,

1984
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:05,880
his coins will be confiscated.

1985
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,410
In the end, his coins were confiscated indeed.

1986
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:32,440
OK. Come on!

1987
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:51,450
It's so beautiful.

1988
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:18,450
Chapter Two allows everyone to get to know each other better,

1989
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,630
not just by knowing each other's pasts.

1990
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,840
Chapter Two includes activities that everyone participates in together.

1991
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,240
Who do you think is the most absurd

1992
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:28,140
and disorganized among the THC members?

1993
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:29,960
Let's ask Mio.

1994
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:33,760
Based on what you've seen, who do you think is the most undisciplined in THC right now?

1995
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,400
The most obvious one would be me, right? Back in the past, I mean.

1996
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:40,670
What about now?

1997
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:42,430
Now I'm trying to get better.

1998
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:44,030
New, do you feel that you have made progress?

1999
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,450
My little brother is making progress.

2000
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:47,930
You're very supportive of him.

2001
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:49,110
My good brother.

2002
01:13:50,150 --> 01:13:51,120
Today, you and your younger brother are gathered together,

2003
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:53,100
and I hope you can communicate with them and share your experiences with everyone,

2004
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:56,630
especially the juniors.

2005
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,000
You can tell them how did you get through all of that, and the juniors can also ask questions to the seniors.

2006
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,410
They all went to your concert.

2007
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:05,130
I think that was an incredible experience for all of you and the audience.

2008
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:10,700
For me, we all come from a BL drama as everyone has mentioned,

2009
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,800
right? Tong, come on.

2010
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,760
You're the biggest senior,

2011
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,540
can you share with everyone your feelings about it?

2012
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,670
From the first day I arrived at this company until today...

2013
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:22,770
I...

2014
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:26,080
At that time, we were all rookies,

2015
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,860
whether actors or crew members, including Pond.

2016
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,440
But we are all striving to do everything well,

2017
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:31,860
within our capabilities.

2018
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:36,130
Everyone strives to be focused and serious in everything they do.

2019
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:37,970
Because... there was a sentence that Pong said which I thought was particularly good.

2020
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,570
If we don't put in the effort,

2021
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,820
it's not just ourselves who will suffer losses,

2022
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:43,000
but we will also drag down the entire team.

2023
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:43,820
Yes.

2024
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:46,150
Its impact is very significant.

2025
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:50,970
Moreover, it's impossible for all the staff to wait for us alone,

2026
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,130
regardless of whether we are doing an activity or anything else.

2027
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:57,470
They... anyway, we are not that important.

2028
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:58,360
Right.

2029
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:00,270
They can do it well without us.

2030
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,040
Yes.

2031
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:04,510
Besides, Perth is also a good example.

2032
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,360
If you had stayed true to yourself from the beginning,

2033
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,750
you might still be showcasing your abilities as a guest today.

2034
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:15,000
But now it's too late.

2035
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,200
It's too late for him to stay true to himself,

2036
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,360
and ended up being eliminated.

2037
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,030
But he's capable,

2038
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,210
it's great for him to be able to return as a host today.

2039
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,160
He's a good example.

2040
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:25,720
Who hasn't shown their true selves yet should hurry up and be themselves.

2041
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:30,120
There is a question I need to ask today.

2042
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,020
Dear all THC members,

2043
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:32,670
how are you doing?

2044
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,310
Woody,

2045
01:15:34,650 --> 01:15:36,410
I heard you and your partner are having problems.

2046
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:37,600
Yes.

2047
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,290
Why?

2048
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:39,600
Because,

2049
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,520
I forgot to tell him this morning that I

2050
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:42,770
need to go shoot the program first.

2051
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:46,690
What?

2052
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:47,670
Huh?

2053
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:48,370
What?

2054
01:15:48,370 --> 01:15:49,340
Forgot to tell his partner that he has to go film a program first.

2055
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,440
I forgot to tell my partner I was filming.

2056
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,270
Forgot to tell his partner that he has to go film a program first.

2057
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,740
Do you have a pact or something? Like something must be done in a specific way?

2058
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:55,510
It's just...

2059
01:15:56,110 --> 01:15:58,260
during the shooting, I just have to let him know.

2060
01:15:58,710 --> 01:15:59,360
But if it's a regular day,

2061
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,660
I have to take photos every half an hour and send them to him.

2062
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:03,890
Oh, I see.

2063
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:09,590
I have a question. Let's chat about it casually.

2064
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:12,820
Will constantly checking up on each other

2065
01:16:13,450 --> 01:16:14,920
during a relationship make it last longer?

2066
01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,020
Copper, what do you think?

2067
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,220
For me,

2068
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:19,730
I think,

2069
01:16:20,210 --> 01:16:22,150
trust and peace of mind are the keys to love for me.

2070
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:25,640
I don't think it's necessary to report your whereabouts all the time.

2071
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,240
For example, my parents. After working all day,

2072
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,870
as long as my dad says "I'm going to bed now,

2073
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:31,390
today's work is exhausting."

2074
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,960
My mom will reply with "Love you, keep it up!"

2075
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,660
And they both feel very happy.

2076
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,760
And they're like this every day.

2077
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,750
My dad works and sometimes he can't come home on weekends either.

2078
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:42,310
He stays in the apartment

2079
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:43,880
and we only see him once in a long while.

2080
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,670
To be honest, reporting one's whereabouts every 30 minutes,

2081
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:52,480
[Copper
Phuriwat Chotiratanasak IG:copper_phrt16]

2082
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:48,510
I think it's too much.

2083
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:50,960
if it's

2084
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,750
reported once in the morning and once in the evening within a day,

2085
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:56,230
or three times a day, I think it's okay.

2086
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,450
But I don't know either. It's their own business.

2087
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:00,520
But no matter what,

2088
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,330
if Woody needs encouragement,

2089
01:17:02,330 --> 01:17:03,820
he can come to me

2090
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,680
and I will give him 100% positive energy.

2091
01:17:07,830 --> 01:17:09,850
Let's talk about relationships today.

2092
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,110
Woody's situation today is actually

2093
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:15,610
very similar to our game, both are about trust.

2094
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:17,740
When we are with someone,

2095
01:17:17,740 --> 01:17:20,680
even if they are not our romantic partner but just a life companion or friend,

2096
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,330
trust is very important.

2097
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,430
I think the rules between two people should not be too strict,

2098
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:25,830
right?

2099
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:27,780
Even among the people in our company,

2100
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:31,230
we don't have so many rules.

2101
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:33,480
We communicate well

2102
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,460
and then turn the page.

2103
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:36,610
If someone makes a mistake,

2104
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:38,670
we can understand each other.

2105
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:39,310
So I think that

2106
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,410
all these things are interconnected.

2107
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:44,850
If we start with mutual distrust, the atmosphere will become like this,

2108
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:46,350
right?

2109
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,420
Afterwards, no matter what kind of activities involving pairs there are,

2110
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:50,970
you can tell that

2111
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,630
who you trust the most

2112
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:54,220
and what kind of trust it is.

2113
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:56,980
How two people interact with each other is crucial for one to feel comfortable and free from oppression.

2114
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,080
It's very similar to the question I asked before, "What is love?"

2115
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:00,150
Right?

2116
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:02,420
And suddenly we have an example to show you all.

2117
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:06,450
Let me hear Bible say

2118
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,990
"Stay in Bangkok Vegas",

2119
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:10,840
something like that?

2120
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,980
OK.

2121
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,290
Give me a slogan.

2122
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:15,520
Hey guys,

2123
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:19,400
I'm Bible, and what happen in Pang-nga stays with Vegas.

2124
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:24,550
I know everyone is tired today,

2125
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,530
but how often do we have the chance

2126
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:28,870
to be at the beach with so many good friends at this age?

2127
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:33,740
And with so many seniors cheering us on,

2128
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:36,180
I think this is a very valuable experience.

2129
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:37,930
You can ask me anything.

2130
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,240
Thank you.

2131
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,180
Tomorrow,

2132
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:42,920
tomorrow, the seniors will take care of you. I won't be here anymore.

2133
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:44,610
OK,party time! Bring it on!

2134
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:45,420
Come on, everyone!

2135
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:45,890
Applause!

2136
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,630
Party time!

2137
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,600
Wow.

2138
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:02,760
Our room.

2139
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,550
Hold it.

2140
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:05,350
Let's go, let's go.

2141
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:07,010
-I'll check downstairs. -I'll go up first to have a look.

2142
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:08,830
I'm telling you...

2143
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:09,960
Hey!

2144
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:15,600
Bro, we really got a pool here!

2145
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,390
-Really? -There is a private jet!

2146
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:18,630
That's mine.

2147
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:19,550
But,

2148
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,430
here's a problem.

2149
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:22,360
What's wrong?

2150
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,970
We have a problem here, come up now.

2151
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:24,750
Come up?

2152
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:25,110
Yes.

2153
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:26,860
I just want to ask, how could there be any problems with this type of room?

2154
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:27,830
It has some problems.

2155
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,790
What could be the problem with such a good room?

2156
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:32,140
At first, I also thought there shouldn't be any problem.

2157
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,000
-Come on, let me see what the problem is. -Now, it has a problem.

2158
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,760
What is it? Bro.

2159
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:36,580
Look, look at the bathroom.

2160
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:37,700
The bathroom.

2161
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:38,650
Yes?

2162
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:40,190
There is a showerhead.

2163
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:41,400
Yes, but,

2164
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:42,760
where's the door?

2165
01:19:43,310 --> 01:19:44,260
Where are the curtains?

2166
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:45,150
It has nothing.

2167
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,030
Nothing at all.

2168
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:46,850
What should we do, bro?

2169
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:47,440
I mean,

2170
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,050
the bed is right there.

2171
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:49,700
Right.

2172
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:51,030
The living room is here.

2173
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,520
Yep.

2174

[Copper
Phuriwat Chotiratanasak IG:copper_phrt16]

2175
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,200
It's alright. At the beginning, I discussed with Woody

2176
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,450
about how we should handle bathing,

2177
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,530
'cuz the bathroom is completely open,

2178
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:01,550
but he just lay face down and didn't respond.

2179
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,490
Then I went to take a shower,

2180
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:06,070
but I was worried that he might have trouble breathing and something could happen. So I told him we needed to change our plans.

2181
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:08,830
I said, "Woody, you should go out a minute." And I kicked him out of the room.

2182
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,840
It's time to have a rest now.

2183
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,180
-Look at this. -Wow.

2184
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:15,560
Wow!

2185
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:16,690
Bro, take a look at this.

2186
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,070
Kingsize!

2187
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:20,310
-Oh! -it's Kingsize.

2188
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:21,480
-Wonderful. -We have a TV here.

2189
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,640
Bro, look, it's a TV.

2190
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:23,360
TV.

2191
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,130
Remote controller?

2192
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:25,410
I don't care about that.

2193
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:28,000
I'm only interested in the one in front of me.

2194
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,310
-We are so tired today, bro. -Yeah, too exhausted.

2195
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,990
I can't stand it anymore.

2196
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,860
Nah.

2197
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:32,860
Did we both come up with the idea of going together?

2198
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:33,400
The same idea.

2199
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,330
One, two, three.

2200
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:41,300
Better go to sleep.

2201
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:43,300
I can't go on like this anymore.

2202
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:51,080
Today's game is a measure of how well you know your teammates.

Go!

2206
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:58,500
This is the first person who once broke up after dating for only 7 days.

2207
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:02,270
Do you trust your partner?

2208
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:05,090
Come on!

2209
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:07,130
I may not be able to say much here,

2210
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,730
but I believe everyone should understand.

2211
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:11,570
I have never seen Bump like this,

2212
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,540
so I feel it's unfair to Bump.
