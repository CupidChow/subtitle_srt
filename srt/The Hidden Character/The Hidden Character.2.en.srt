1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,520
This one, he said, he used to be bullied from being questioned by a teacher in front of all his classmates.

2
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,910
The teacher asked him, "Are you gay? You must be gay, right?"

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:34,740
And it made him feel like he was homophobic to the point that he hated gay people.

4
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:40,650
He posted on Facebook asking when will gays and trans would all disappear from this earth.

5
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:50,000
And the mission for each of you is to lie to your cast mates and also make a guess about the real owner of this story.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,020
Forget about the song. Let's guess who is lying.

7
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,310
Come on, who do you think it is? Who is it?

8
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,190
So, you're just gonna dive straight into it like this?

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,320
Just say it, I want 3 names with reasons, too. That's it.

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,120
- Shall we say the name at the same time?
- Ok, let's do it.

11
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,920
1, 2, 3

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,370
I think this game is like a lie challenge and detection game. Every morning we wake up, they tell us one hidden story.

13
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:24,180
And we must investigate the matter with whatever technique we've got until we find out the real owner of the story.

14
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,600
Meanwhile, we must also make others believe this hidden story is ours, but only when this is not your story.

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,610
Simultaneously, you have to be both prey and predator.

16
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,090
Oh, man

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,509
- See, I did answer that it's Max.
- flawless disguise

18
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,450
- Damn, what a smooth liar.
- For real?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Good morning, all the THC folks. The second day has now begun.

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,600
Please hurry up and take a shower, then get ready with the outfits that the show has prepared for you.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,840
Then, report to the meeting point at the stairway hall as soon as possible.

22
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,520
Good morning, all the THC folks. The second day has now begun.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,410
Please hurry up and take a shower, then get ready with the outfits that the show has prepared for you.

24
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,400
Then, immediately report to the meeting point at the stairway hall as soon as possible.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,550
You see this tuxedo, how do I look? Handsome, right?

26
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,550
Just a sec! Young, hot, and handsome, ain't I?

27
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,280
Today's theme is very formal, with a tuxedo.

28
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,790
I feel like a filthy rich man entering a casino, and I will make a fortune from today's gamble.

29
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,000
JJ is so charming and handsome. He is so attractive, like someone who is so hot and busy all the time.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
His handsomeness is extra striking, like today there must be some special occasion or important event for him to attend.

31
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
I was like, "Bro, you look stunningly suave today."

32
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,870
- Hi, everyone.
- Hello

33
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,210
How are you on this bright and shiny morning.?

34
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,380
- Yeah, really bright and shine
- Very bright

35
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,640
- You guys have a good sleep, right?
- We have.

36
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,120
At first, I was watching the movie.

37
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,440
But after the movie began for like 2 minutes...

38
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,440
we talked and agreed that we would watch a horror movie together

39
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,200
We all were really focused on watching the movie, but after around 2 minutes, I started to hear some noise that didn't seem like a sound from the film.

40
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,180
It was loud and sounded like this (snoring sound).

41
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,910
Then, I turned and saw Lotte on the far left had already fallen asleep.

42
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,030
I was on the far right, and he was on the far left.

43
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,740
And I had to bear with it.

44
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,990
What about you, our winner? What was the smell of victory from yesterday like?

45
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,190
- It smelled so good and sweet
- Woahhh

46
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,910
Why don't you give your friends a little bluff?

47
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,490
I don't know what today's hidden story is, but I'm telling you that it's not me.

48
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,710
- How can you be so sure from the start, man?
- Look at him, he still doesn't know the story, but he is so ready to manipulate you all.

49
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm just seizing the first-move advantage of the game.

50
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,460
What about you, JJ? Yesterday, you also got 1 coin, right?

51
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,560
Well, I couldn't sleep that tight as I only bagged just 1 coin.

52
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,630
- Oh, man
- I still want more.

53
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,830
- You want to be more at ease while sleeping, right?
- Right.

54
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:56,350
Ok, so, today I have you all fully dressed up in formal attire, so neat, because I will serve you with an even more intense game.

55
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,240
- Are you guys ready?
- We're ready.

56
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,160
-  Ready?
-  Ready!

57
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
-  READY?
-  READY!

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
Ok, if you all are ready, now let's pick the story.

59
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
And the mission for each of you is...

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The show will pick one hidden story, which is a true story from each of you.

61
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,260
Your mission is to lie to your friends.

62
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,710
The person who receives the most votes and the best liar among their peers, that person will earn 3 coins.

63
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,580
And the owner of the story will also get 3 coins if he can trick others into voting for him the least.

64
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,980
Anyone that is the most talented in debunking others and making the correct guess about the owner of the story will be given 2 coins.

65
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,800
I also prepared a deck of cards just like yesterday.

66
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,920
Ok, let's make our pick now.

67
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,710
Here they are.

68
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,510
Does anyone want to be today's representative and pick the card for us?

69
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,860
-  Shall we have the winner take the honor?
-  Right, let the winner do it.

70
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,770
We were going to select the card randomly.

71
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,880
But instead of Mile picking for us, this time, we specifically let the last round's winner pick out the story for us, which is New.

72
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,340
Just pick one card.

73
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,410
Ok, then. Please return to your position.

74
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,160
Umm

75
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,240
What is that kind of smile supposed to mean, bro?

76
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,120
Interesting, I think this person is fascinating.

77
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,080
Wow, here is today's hidden story...

78
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,090
This guy used to have a secret crush on one of his friends who lost their teeth.

79
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,590
So, he decided to pull out his own tooth to match that person.

80
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,560
- It's so brutal and yet so cute too
- A romantic guy

81
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,710
So that he has something in common with him or her.

82
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,980
I really don't know who to pick because it could be anyone.

83
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,250
For me, I think this story is a lot harder than the previous one.

84
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,690
It's a bit too broad and makes this hard to guess.

85
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:13,970
I was shocked as...you know, it's a bizarre story that I can't believe someone would actually do that for real.

86
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,440
Who do you think it is? Does anyone want to make a rough guess?

87
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,440
I'll be right back, guys. I'll need to take out my denture first. I've got a missing tooth.

88
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,230
- Guys, you see, I have some gap between my teeth here.
- I'm not gonna believe you anymore, dude. You're a liar.

89
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,240
Bro, a gap is just a gap, not missing.

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,970
Hey, Lotte, what are you trying to say again?

91
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,630
- Ahhh
- hahaha

92
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,570
I'm going to be cunning toward everyone now.

93
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,809
I just opened my mouth and showed them that I had pulled out...I mean, I've got this one tooth here.

94
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,640
I don't want to talk. I'm too afraid that others will see my missing tooth. I'm scared of talking now.

95
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,200
Ok, let me see your teeth, Perth. Open your mouth a bit so that I can see.

96
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,950
- It's on this side.
- Man, I only saw a dog* in there. (In Thailand, we regard a foul-mouthed person as dog-mouthed)

97
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,200
- hahaha
- That's bullying. Mom, help!!

98
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,690
Savage!

99
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,520
Does anyone wanna say anything? I still wanna listen more.

100
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,930
I think it's Woody.

101
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,670
His eyes look anxious.

102
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,870
Dude, he's nervous every day.

103
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,340
The reason why I have this beautiful smile may be because I removed my teeth for the person to see.

104
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,260
It may be because I pulled out my teeth for that girl to see... Ah, forget it.

105
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,750
...just forget it.

106
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,480
Jet?

107
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,590
Ok. Well, ahhhhhh

108
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,560
The black spot inside is a missing tooth.

109
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,510
- Just wait and see.
- Bro, isn't it a cavity?
- It's not a cavity, dude. It's a missing tooth.

110
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,690
- How could that be because you always brush your teeth, right?
- You made it sounds tingly.

111
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,030
At first, I didn't think of Fuaiz at all.

112
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:45,260
Because he told me that he was a child actor and filmed for dramas, and has been working in the entertainment industry since.

113
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,760
So, I think tooth extraction sounds impractical for him as he has to work in the entertainment industry. He probably won't pull out his own tooth.

114
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,410
Ok, let's continue with you, Mio.

115
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,550
I'll let you see this spot here. But it's normal; nothing but a diamond here, nothing extra at all.

116
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,500
- Ok, diamond teeth, right?
- Yep, diamond teeth.

117
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,550
I have golden teeth. But that's because I forgot to brush my teeth.

118
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,990
I want to say one thing here.

119
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,160
The reason why I had a missing tooth is because I wanted her to fill my missing part with love.

120
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,860
Wowww

121
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,120
Which tooth is missing? Where?

122
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,520
It had already grown back because it was just a milk tooth.

123
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,850
Aha, I see.

124
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,240
Wow, this sounds convincing, though. Dude, I'll probably have to choose you.

125
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,680
Milk tooth? So that means you were very young, like a little kid, and you have had a crush on her since that age?

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,130
- It was during elementary school.
- Wow, a womanizer kid

127
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,320
This is true, and I'm not lying, bro.

128
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Dude, now I really don't wanna trust or believe you at all.

129
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,580
This is for real, man, and I'm telling you the truth.

130
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,130
[New - Suspect no. 1]

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,520
- Welcome to the Chamber of Truth... here, have this to relax a bit.
- Ok, another one is here. This one is another little troublemaker.

132
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,190
- Hello/ Hi
- I've already prepared this for you.

133
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,330
- What is the topic that you want to know today?
- About love, I'm really curious about this.

134
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,900
Our homeboy from Udon Thani*, how is your love life from then till now. (Udon Thani is a province in the North Eastern region of Thailand.)

135
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,560
My past love stories? I used to be a real womanizer and flirt around a lot, like "A LOT."

136
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,960
Back then, I didn't take love or relationship that seriously.

137
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,820
I was flirting around, and if I lost interest in the person, I would just hop to another person.

138
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,650
But now, I think that is not ok anymore. If I continue to live like this, nothing is getting any better.

139
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:18,850
- Hahaha
- Bro, you looked at me like you were preaching that to me.

140
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,140
You ain't getting any better!

141
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,000
After he said that, then looked at me and took another sip.

142
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,640
And I'm someone that if I had no one by my side, I would become a bigger mess.

143
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,910
I need someone to stay beside me and keep me grounded.

144
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,120
Otherwise, I can't really discipline myself. I would be messing around, not being responsible for work, skipping my classes, etc.

145
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,120
So, it means that you rely on someone else.

146
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,540
I'm not like that dependent per se. Mostly, if I'm not in a relationship, I would be more attached to my friends.

147
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,590
Aha, and your friends will...

148
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,870
They will always invite me to go to the pub. Right, they will ask me to meet and drink somewhere.

149
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:55,690
- But a friend who invites you to the pub or drink doesn't mean he is a bad person or friend.
- Right.

150
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,510
- Agree, right?
- Yes, I agree.

151
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,700
It's just one factor, and I'm not saying this to blame my friends, though. I'm blaming myself.

152
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,240
They are just one factor for my night out and drinking. And then, I ended up unable to wake up on time for class, something like that.

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,400
And that became a factor why I want to have someone beside me.

154
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,460
- Well, he is just a boy, you know.
- Right, it's just a phase in life.

155
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,690
He probably thought that was a cool thing to do. And so he fully rolled that way during that time.

156
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,310
- Now, I had enough of it. It's too exhausting.
- Did you feel guilty during that time?

157
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm guilty. I feel so bad for my mom.

158
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,500
There were so many times that my parents caught me behaving like that.

159
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,790
It was to the point that my dad installed a surveillance camera in the stairway.

160
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,370
They hoped that it would prevent me from going out at night.

161
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:29,550
Sometimes, I felt so bad and really sorry for my mom.

162
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,940
I feel genuinely sorry for my mom and sincerely want to apologize for this.

163
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:39,010
What about today? If you're in a relationship now, will you be someone who devotes to love?

164
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,600
Now, if I could choose the kind of love I want, I want to have a mature love.

165
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:54,710
Since I have many duties from work to study, etc., I want someone who is not too demanding that we have to stay together all the time.

166
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,070
Not someone who needs me to always talk to or call her all the time,

167
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,750
or always talk or text her about everything, or report my whereabouts all the time.

168
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,790
I want the kind of love that we understand what our partner will do, and we only need to inform each other about that and acknowledge it.

169
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,290
Then, we can go on with our duty. Once that is done, we come back to be together.

170
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,380
- You mean you want to find someone who understands you, right?
- Right, I want to meet someone who understands me.

171
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,180
I just want someone who understands me. That's all I'm looking for in terms of love right now.

172
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,710
- Umm
- I think this kid is a real rascal. But there is so much more that we don't know about him.

173
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,440
- Umm
- Agree, right?
- I'm a pain in the neck than you might have thought.

174
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,800
- Hahaha
- Right, but when you said "pain," you looked at me again.

175
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,650
That was during elementary school...I'm revealing my story now. Back then, it was around grade 4th.

176
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,560
There was a girl named Maam. I really liked her, for real, guys.

177
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,320
Mam*? The name is Mam, for real? You got that from the Card, right? (In Thailand, we also refer to the card with a queen as Mam)

178
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,270
- No, no, listen...
- Dude, the made-up name has already outed you.

179
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,640
It's not Mam with the up tone. It's M-A-A-M. Her name is Maam.

180
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,670
- You mean Maam like Mom-Maam* (Mom-Maam is an endearing way to call someone or something when covered in dirt or dirty.)
- Right, like Mom-Maam

181
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,000
But that means dirty, though.

182
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,550
Right, her name is Maam. We were in grade 4th, and she was a petite girl.

183
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,650
Since we were still a kid, you know, so of course, she had some missing teeth.

184
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,550
It was around the time that our permanent teeth would grow.

185
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,940
And I saw her, and I really liked her.

186
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,000
But your lips are shaking, bro.

187
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,800
- And so you did what...
- Ok, guys, you don't have to believe me. It's fine.

188
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,330
Since I knew that I liked her, so I told him. I mean, I asked my dad.

189
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,830
Dude, you're so good at spontaneously making up such a long story. You know, you can wait till you finish constructing it before telling us.

190
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,470
- You could go on nonstop with it.
- Bro, you just keep babbling and lying.

191
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,530
No, I'm not. And so, I asked my dad, "Daddy, I want to get my tooth extracted."

192
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,030
- Woah, "Daddy"
- You sound so polite.

193
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,510
- What a drama king
- I said, "Daddy, I want to get my tooth extracted."

194
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,060
And so my dad took me to the dentist for tooth extraction because I also lied to him that I got a cavity.

195
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,340
But the truth is there was nothing wrong with it at all. I just want to have a missing tooth just like her.

196
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,220
That's a real story, and it's true. I still remember her today.

197
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:38,540
Since I was born, she is probably the first person I liked romantically, the first person I ever had a real crush on.

198
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,020
I have specifically prepared our mini-game today for all 11 of you.

199
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,960
And it is called Indian Poker.

200
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,180
The rule is I will give each of you 1 card.

201
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:01,240
However, you can't see your own card, but your friends can.

202
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,140
And the card with the highest score is the Ace of Spades.

203
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,580
Well, they would give us one card each, and we all have that card on our heads.

204
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,250
We couldn't see our own cards, but others could. However, we saw other people's cards too.

205
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,050
And we must try our best to trick them into surrendering.

206
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,740
I will divide the teams based on the score of your card from highest to lowest.

207
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,660
And the person with the highest-score card, which is the Ace of Spades...

208
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,570
That person will entitle to the right of solo play.

209
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,770
And he can earn 2 coins.

210
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,790
Then, the 5 following ranks can choose their own partners.

211
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,350
They can earn 1 coin if they win the game.

212
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,570
Each person in the winning pair will receive 1 coin.

213
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,840
Alright, then. Let's start!

214
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,320
- feeling impatient already?
- the heat of competition

215
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,570
King

216
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,290
- Woahhhh
- Excuse me for going to take 2 coins from today's game.

217
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,310
Wowww

218
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,300
And who is the second one?

219
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,230
So, who do you want on your team?

220
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,380
That sugar daddy

221
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,800
- So, little sugar daddy, come stay with me, ok?
- My choice was taken already

222
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,040
Next, who is our third place?

223
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,620
Ok, JJ, who do you wanna pick?

224
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,820
That dude

225
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,380
Ok, bro, I'll lead you on hunting down the coins.

226
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,980
Picking me is your right decision. You definitely won't be disappointed.

227
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,560
- Next is Max.
- I'll go with....Bump.

228
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,960
Ok, Bump, then.

229
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,770
Bump, THC is here!

230
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,450
What about our fifth place?

231
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,280
- It's Jet, right?
- Yes, it's me.

232
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,080
Lotte is fine with me.

233
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,690
I heard that Lotte is really into manifesting and religious stuff.

234
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:51,240
Since he worships many things, so I thought if I got him on my team and he could do some sort of mojo, maybe his luck could help us win.

235
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,630
- Only Perth and Woody are left.
- Ok, so our last pair would be Perth and Woody.

236
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,040
- Ok, then, let's begin our game.
- Alright, bring it on now!

237
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,370
The uniqueness of this game is that we have to pair up and play the game as a pair. And I was paired with Woody.

238
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,089
You all are ready for this, right? Do you feel lonely sitting there alone?

239
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,069
- No, bro, I'm chill. It's 2 coins, so I'm cool with it.
- Ok, it's chill, right?

240
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,270
- But you're alone, so you better watch out.
- We'll see how it goes.

241
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:15,010
You be careful, mate. Remember that 2 brains are better than 1.

242
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,000
Yeah!!

243
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,780
But there is really nothing on our brains, dude.

244
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,640
But he has no backup to help him if everyone is targeting him.

245
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,869
It's ok, don't worry, I can handle everything by myself.

246
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,890
Well, if I'm alone, I can get all 2 coins.

247
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,530
It isn't just 1 coin. Everything will be ours. So, that means it all belongs to me.

248
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,870
- And for even more thrilling and entertaining play, I have prepared these shots for every team.
- Woah, hahaha

249
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,920
Oh, my, the shots

250
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,420
The losing team has to drink the freshly squeezed and pure lime juice. I wanna emphasize that it was purely 100% lime juice.

251
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,880
If you drink too many of these shots, you might get diarrhea.

252
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,830
Alright, right? Good, then.

253
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,230
- Ok.
- Can I cut the deck, please?

254
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,850
Yes, you're welcome to do that. Go ahead.

255
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,120
- Can I please do another cut on top of that?
- Go head

256
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,130
- So, this could cancel out his luck.
- If you're so worried about that, let Mile be the only one who can do this process.

257
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,720
I remember that you're into manifesting.

258
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,340
- Manifesting what?
- Bro, I don't even go to the temple lately.

259
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,550
- Say your prayer.
- Om Namo Buddhaya* (Om Namo Buddhaya means I made my homage to the supreme Buddha, it is similar to praying to show that you are grateful to the God or deity of your beliefs)

260
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,700
What a nice move you all have got.

261
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,170
- We just sit and chill, and today we'll receive our coins.
- Right.

262
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,110
Just open it.

263
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,240
Ok, open!

264
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,080
- Bro, your team should just fold. I feel bad for your team. I mean it.
- It's our business, New, just shut it, dude.

265
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,080
Copper, just fold. I'm so sorry for you.

266
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,390
I'm sorry for you, too; why don't you fold?

267
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,430
I bluffed him back. I wasn't just gonna back down on anything.

268
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,950
But right now, I feel really bad for Bump and Max. Please trust me, mates.

269
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,780
Is it that bad?

270
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:01,060
I was so confident that my team had the highest score, and they just tried to pressure me to surrender.

271
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,990
Alright, let's start!

272
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,220
Let this team make the first bet.

273
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,940
I'll take the bet.

274
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,790
- Ok, one bet.
- Right, just look at their cards. Why would we ever fold?

275
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,380
- Are you guys sure about that?
- It's fine, I like the drink.

276
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,630
- What about your team Max? Are you gonna call?
- Max, will you make the call?

277
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,230
- Call, please
- Ok, then.

278
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,410
- We can really make the call, right?
- Yes, yes, call, call

279
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,060
Right, don't be discouraged.

280
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,350
Definitely call. No need to think about it.

281
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,650
I could drink the whole farm.

282
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,610
- hahaha
- Surely, you will get to drink that.

283
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,710
- Call, too.
- Just one; he is a solo, not two like us. Don't get mixed up.

284
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,870
Well, since all your cards are so bad, there is nothing to be feared.

285
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,110
Ok, thank you. I'm so honored.

286
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,310
- But why didn't anyone say anything much yet?
- Right, man,...if the score is high, then people would bluff more, isn't it?

287
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,000
- However, if the score is low, people would remain calm and silent, right?
- Well, we just go with the flow.

288
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,990
- Well, it could be high, and people try to act like they don't care.
- Middle range, I think it's the middle range.

289
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,750
Right, it's the middle range, not high, not low.

290
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,230
Yeah, just a little bit higher than 2, right?

291
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,760
Hey, don't tell them.

292
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,920
- Just nod
- Shall we call?

293
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,300
- Call
- Call, right? Fine, then.

294
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,070
- Damn, why did none of you fold at all.
- I'm gonna friggin fold, bro!

295
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,540
Why did low-ranking teams with only 2 or 3 points have been talking way too much?

296
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,000
- Call
- Yep, we call.

297
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,780
Ok, call.

298
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,080
The real deal is on Max's hand.

299
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,920
- We'll win.
- Max's card is the highest one.
- Good, you better remember your words, bro.

300
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:13,100
- The real deal that gonna win?...or gonna lose, though
- You have to trust me. Your card is the biggest one.

301
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,440
Shall we reveal the card now? You should go first, the little sugar daddy.

302
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,100
- Alright
- Just flip it, Daddy.

303
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,730
Ok, one punch!

304
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,550
- It's still so far from ours.
- Damn, it.

305
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,660
So confident, right? Then, it's your turn, Woody.

306
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,030
Hey, that's not bad.

307
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,760
Too bad, we only lost by the very slightest point. Our team and Jet's team both got the King cards.

308
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,460
It's just a different symbol, and ours is a lower score compared to theirs.

309
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,040
So we lost to them, it's such a shame.

310
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,680
We looked promising but turned out...sigh˜˜

311
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,720
What about you, Copper? Are you confident with your card?

312
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,410
- I'm 100% confident.
- Yeah, it's 100% that you are doomed.

313
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,450
- Woahhh, man, and he is alone too.
- Brace yourself, dude.

314
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,530
Just go, bro, trust me...What!!!

315
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,190
Argg... but it's not that much.

316
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,470
Bro, can I please be the last one to flip the card?

317
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,810
- Ok.
- I'm so sure that our card is top-notch.

318
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,350
- Alright, Jet, flip it.
- We should do this together.

319
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,360
- hahaha
- Well, so we could win these 2 coins together, man.

320
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,650
Ok, 1, 2, 3, go!

321
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,170
- Shittt
- Woahhh

322
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:23,410
Woohoo. Ouch, ouch, we have been talking too much; I felt like my teeth might all fall off.

323
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,370
- You two will get it from me!
- hahaha

324
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,580
We won!!

325
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,860
The camera might not catch this and won't be able to insert it, so you should clearly show this to the camera.

326
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,640
- That's right, good!
- Don't talk too much, it's embarrassing, please trust me.

327
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,620
so cringe, man

328
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,480
We need to trouble the cameraperson to film their footage when they need to go number 2 in the toilet.

329
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,160
Go ahead, just see it for yourself, dude.

330
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,030
- 1, 2, 3, go!
- The smell of the winner, let's go!

331
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,300
hahahaha

332
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,400
- Shitttt
- OMG

333
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,640
The camera might not catch this and won't be able to insert it, so you should clearly show this to the camera.

334
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,580
- That's right, good!
- it's embarrassing. Please trust me.

335
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,990
Bro, can I please be the last one to flip the card?

336
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,840
- Ok.
- I'm so sure that our card is top-notch.

337
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,220
Damn it, only 4 points.

338
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,560
Not gonna say much, but pfft.

339
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,170
hahahaha

340
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,060
Do we have some water to wash my eyes?

341
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,520
So who is the winner of this game?

342
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,360
I was secretly in glee. My prayer did work.

343
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,600
Thank you so much. May all of my spells and prayers turn out well.

344
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,550
Ok, we've already got the winners of our mini-game today. So, congratulations!

345
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:22,360
Thank you very much

346
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,690
Here, take this...one coin each.

347
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,660
Woah, thank you, bro.

348
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,180
And for the losers, it's time to honor your promise now.

349
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,600
- sigh˜
- Who wanna chug it first?

350
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,090
Dang, I'm dead.

351
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,530
Ewww

352
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,910
Ok, let's do it.

353
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,980
Hmm, this is a cacao drink.

354
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,850
hahaha, cacao, right?

355
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,350
- What are you waiting for?
- Cheers, bro!

356
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,310
It's wild honey from May's harvest.

357
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,350
Ok, sweet, like wild honey, right? But your whole body is shaking, bro.

358
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,570
- Your turn, right, Jet?
- He'll helps the loser?

359
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,750
- Shouldn't we make the toast?
- toast? Ok, fine.

360
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,790
We were overconfident, mate.

361
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,310
- hahaha
- See, I told you that you gonna regret it, so embarrassing.

362
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,800
- Hmm
- Ok, I like sour things.

363
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,920
- Bring it on!
- Ok, our last pair

364
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,930
It's ok. If we believe it's a syrup, it is a syrup.

365
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:25,010
- Imagine it, right?
- Damn, bro***

366
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,090
Ahhh, sweet like a candy

367
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,480
Dude, ask your bro first. Look at his face now.

368
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,170
- Your bro looks like this.
- How was it? Sweet like sugar, right?

369
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:42,090
Mile, I've got a proposal. I think the winners should also drink to celebrate their victory.

370
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,700
- Well, you have the coins now, so you should drink with us too.
- Right, right, celebrate it, cheers!

371
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,850
- Just a second, I'm the winner, ain't I?
- Come on, just one little shot each.

372
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,360
Just one shot each, that's it. Come on.

373
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,320
It's ok, man, for our winner's pride.

374
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,150
- Fine
- Ok, I'll pour you the shots.

375
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:59,350
- To our winners!
- Woohoo!

376
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,940
- Everyone, together
- To our friendship in THC

377
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,290
Woohoo

378
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:14,400
In the end, I got to drink it too. And right after the shot, like just a few minutes, I had to run to the bathroom.

379
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,570
Well, I think our judge and host should feel a little thirsty by now. Maybe he should take a sip of the shot for us to see a bit.

380
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:22,890
- Really?
- Right, bro.

381
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:29,240
Chug it, chug it, chug it, chug it.

382
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,850
I'm not the type that loves to bluff too.

383
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:37,260
Oh my god, woahhh

384
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,170
Oh, man, then who gonna be our host for this afternoon, though?

385
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,830
Alright, congratulations to the two. They are now leading with...ah, give me a second.

386
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,880
hahaha

387
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,230
Damn, you!

388
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,410
- You like it, right?
- Man, it was friggin bitter too.

389
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:03,680
I congratulate you on this, but everyone, don't forget that the real mission is to make your friends vote for you as the owner of today's hidden story.

390
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,850
Don't ever forget that. It's 3 coins, man.

391
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,590
That one is 3 coins, and this one is only 1 coin.

392
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,490
- Ok, understand?
- Noted!

393
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,410
- Ready to dive further, right?
- Ready

394
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,140
Ok, let's continue.

395
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,600
Woohoo

396
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,450
I'm happy for the two of them.

397
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,270
Their fighting spirit was so high. Lotte even prayed for the win.

398
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:24,180
He was doing his mojo, well, I'm not sure what to call it, a superpower or what, but it's something special.

399
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,060
Right, Lotte was praying, and while he was doing that, I felt a bit warm. Don't even know if I'm ok with it or not.

400
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,510
It's sort of a little warm, hahaha; just joking.

401
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,000
- Does anyone want a napkin?
- No, bro.

402
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,390
- Just continue, bro
- Ok, continue, right?

403
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,990
- Well, I was such a crybaby when I was a kid.
- Hey, I wanna hear that too.

404
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,130
- Ok, fine, I will tell all of you.
- When I was little, I was a crybaby. My body was really small, too, probably the smallest in the room, like all the time.

405
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,510
And always the youngest too

406
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,750
And I was also the one that always pleased and spoiled the girls.

407
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,200
- Hmm, aha
- He just cut to the chase.

408
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,320
- Spoiled the girls?
- I liked all the girls

409
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,210
- But it wasn't that kind of like...no, I
- Yeah, I believe that.

410
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,210
Argg, tongue twisted.

411
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,750
It's not that I was a womanizer. It's puppy love, you know.

412
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,280
Well, I was just a kid, you know. A little boy always falls for a girl all the time. Isn't it normal, right?

413
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,070
- Well, you seem to have the potential.
- Umm...you can choose me.

414
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,560
I'm telling you all the truth. Again, I didn't lie here. I always tell you all my story.

415
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,440
And are you the owner of the story?

416
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,600
Yes, I am.

417
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,410
- See, I told you now.
- How much it costs to pull out a tooth there?

418
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,620
Expensive! For example, if it costs 100 THB in Thailand, over there, you have to times 10. It's like 10 times the cost.

419
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,260
Well, if the tooth extraction cost was so expensive, then why did you do that, Copper?

420
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,600
- That's right.
- For love, bro.

421
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,490
- If it's for love, we could endure that, you know.
- Hang on, Copper, didn't you go to the US during secondary school?

422
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,340
- hahaha
- I'm about to ask the same.

423
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,140
I'm someone who doesn't really know how to lie. So, I have to try and put things in the same range.

424
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,880
I tried to keep it on the same ground as much as possible.

425
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,600
So that I won't get caught; otherwise, I can get debunked really easily.

426
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,570
Everyone, please check our group chat on your phone now.

427
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,980
When was it sent, man?

428
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,420
- Come here, let's look at this together, Bump.
- Ok

429
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,910
All you guys have done is talk, but none of you have any proof at all.

430
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:59,160
- Show this to the camera.
- Can you show me that too? I wanna see it.
- Here, he had a missing tooth.

431
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,860
- Hahaha
- See, he did have a missing tooth.
- What about you folks? Do you have any pictures to prove it?

432
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,870
You got that because you chewed on a stone, didn't you?

433
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,450
Come on, let me see it.

434
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,650
Well, this person might be Mio.

435
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,020
- Nope, not him
- Oh, man.

436
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,250
Well, because it's my story.

437
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,390
And the rest could only talk.

438
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,810
- Hi
- Hi

439
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,260
Welcome to the Chamber of Truth; come on in.

440
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,110
We chose you to join our discussion today because you're probably quite devoted to love.

441
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,180
- Ok
- Wow.

442
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,870
Tell us one story, then.

443
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,200
If we talk about the past, we could say that I was pretty devoted to love.

444
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,330
And because I was really devoted when it came to love. Whenever I was in love, I always gave 100% of myself.

445
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:46,010
And because I gave 100% back then, I also expected to get a 100% in return.

446
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:51,840
When my expectation was that way, and it wasn't reciprocated on the same level as what I had given, I felt so disappointed immediately.

447
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,240
Now, in terms of love, I gradually add on based on my feelings and intuition. I don't rush to give my full 100% from the start.

448
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,970
This is to protect my own feeling.

449
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,150
So, right now, I'm not so desperate about love. If love meant to come to you, it would.

450
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,770
I think we shouldn't be searching for it like a quest.

451
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:12,210
I've heard one saying that we need to stop chasing the butterflies and instead nurture our garden beautifully; then, the butterflies will come.

452
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,000
- What I grabbed from your talk just now is that you're such an extreme kid. Am I right?
- Right.

453
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,590
So, when it comes to love, you probably have done quite extreme things for someone you love, too, right?

454
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:29,830
Right, if we talk about my past relationships, I could do anything for love.

455
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,910
I had done everything in all my might that I could possibly do.

456
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,790
Because I gave my full 100%, whatever I had, I gave it all.

457
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,430
How was it with the pure lime juice?

458
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,330
Damn, bro, I just bombed the toilet a minute ago.

459
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,540
You shouldn't be complaining, man. We won and yet still had to drink it.

460
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,200
When you saw our card that it was a high-score card, why didn't you say anything or try to bluff us at all?

461
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,570
I felt that it was better for others to take the strike, as I was alone too.

462
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,340
They might think that I was...ahh, I was confused.

463
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,520
- But you did your best in the game, though.
- He seems like a person that hates to lie to others.

464
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,570
He was the first that I cut out from the list. Because, for me, Copper is such a nice and innocent kid who can't really do anyone harm, you know.

465
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,370
He probably doesn't know how to lie to others.

466
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,490
Since you were born, have you ever lied to anyone at all?

467
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,670
Frankly speaking, I'm such a bad liar.

468
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,470
Tell us a story, then.

469
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,440
Ok, when I was in grade 7th, there was a girl that I liked. Her name is Jane.

470
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,930
But when we were downstairs, you said that you had gone to the US since you were young. What was that supposed to mean?

471
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,430
- Duh, gotcha!
- If you try to manipulate too much...
- Why would I do that?

472
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,650
When we were downstairs, he said one thing, and now he say the other thing.

473
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,500
Wait, it was a different one, different case, different story, bro.

474
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,180
- It was a different story.
- Let's just say that I don't believe you.

475
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,360
I was like; this is not matched up now. That was lying. And he is probably terrible at lying to others too.

476
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,690
- What about the yellow?
- It's just yellow, bro.

477
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,080
What are you trying to say here?

478
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,610
What do you want to ask me? Why are you looking at me that way, bro?

479
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,050
I think Perth is probably the least likely person to be the owner of the story.

480
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,610
Because he was looking at me with eyes full of questions about whether I was the one or not,

481
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,010
and so I thought, if he looked at me that way, then probably not him for sure.

482
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,050
You said that this round is not your story, right?

483
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:12,200
- Obviously, it's not. How could that be? It's impossible.
- Right, because it was just him yesterday.

484
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,170
- Again, please?
- It was just him yesterday.
- Right.

485
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,100
But definitely not Copper

486
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,390
Let's say that I know who it is. Like, I really know who it is.

487
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,660
Some kind of sense or intuition told me that it must be Mio.

488
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,360
And when we were having lunch together, Mio sent us his picture in our group chat.

489
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,340
The picture of him with a missing tooth

490
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,220
Do you think that counts?

491
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,500
But I think he did that to get into our head. Mio loves to cause a stir.

492
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,170
Do you really believe that?

493
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,520
Mio is one of the choices that I really got persuaded by him.

494
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,330
Because this hidden story could potentially belong to anyone

495
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,680
And when someone could come up with a piece of evidence, like here, I got a picture of myself with missing teeth,

496
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,120
It made his words seem more solid and have a greater weight against others.

497
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,440
[Mio - Suspect no. 2]

498
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,210
Mr. Woody, who do you think it is?

499
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,370
Right now, I'm still unsure. However, there seem to be quite a few people that look suspicious.

500
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,390
But I'll keep that to myself first. I don't wanna say yet. I don't want anyone to copy my answer.

501
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:10,740
I also have my own secret too for my first love.

502
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,920
Well, I'm such a devoted person.

503
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:17,060
But in a deeper meaningful way, not like directly or the obvious kind.

504
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,290
But if I point blank confess to her, it would be a bit embarrassing and awkward, so there must be some sort of story around it.

505
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,830
Like, hey, you have a broken tooth just like me, and it's the same one too.

506
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,200
See, just by telling her that we got the same broken tooth at the same spot, now we have something in common to talk about.

507
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,370
- Right
- Imagine that you're a little girl, and a boy just comes up to you and confesses to you right away that he likes you. As a kid, the girl would probably think of him as a creep.

508
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:37,590
But for you to go to the extent of pulling out your tooth to match her, you are a creep already, bro.

509
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,840
It was puppy love, bro.

510
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,600
- Right, childhood crush.
- Ok, a kid might not know better yet... but what if it's you, Mr. Woody.

511
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,510
You talked to divert the attention to the others, but maybe you were just trying to hide your own secret, right?

512
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,170
Actually, I found you suspicious, Mr. Mio.

513
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,130
Don't pretend to be my alliance because I know that I can't trust you.

514
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,990
I'm your comrade. Don't lose your trust in me, bro.

515
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,860
- Not a single word of you both is trustable.
- Haha

516
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:06,660
- We were a kid, and we all probably had that experience of our parents tying our milk teeth with things like a fridge door, etc.
- Right, tied with a thread, and then pulled.

517
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,860
My milk tooth extraction was like that.

518
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,320
After making the tooth fall out, then I could brag about it with someone that I like that our teeth look the same.

519
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,790
He is trying to make us believe that it is him. But the truth is it isn't him.

520
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,960
See, he tries to brush off his embarrassment from getting caught by looking at his nails.

521
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,540
He is embarrassed and nervous now.

522
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,400
Max, why don't you go out and fight with me outside? How many times already? You really want it, right?

523
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,050
- Come out, just come
- Sorry, bro. I'm sorry.

524
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:34,860
There was a split second that I thought it might be Copper because this story seemed possible to be him.

525
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,950
How about you tell me your story, then?

526
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,450
Just like I said before that I don't want to talk about it much,

527
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,170
Because if I share my story, I'm afraid others might pick me.

528
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:45,710
Since it's my story, right? If others vote for me, then I will get nothing.

529
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,240
- Aha
- Wouldn't it be better for me to lay low, then observe and listen to others do their talks?

530
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,730
Sly! This guy is so cunning, Lotte. Bro, don't you listen to him, trust me.

531
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:59,030
My teeth are just like what you guys have already seen, and I've told you before that my teeth got some problems too.

532
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,720
That's why I showed this to you all before.

533
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,490
- Here, see.
- Oh, that's a metal crown tooth.

534
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,720
- So you have your tooth crowned like that
- It's a false tooth, bro.

535
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,080
It used to be an empty space there.

536
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,090
- I doubted, though. Is that true?
- Hey, man, did you just sneakily get that crowned this early morning?

537
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:15,250
When did that happen? When was it when your tooth was missing?

538
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,790
This goes way back to when I still had braces on my teeth.

539
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:21,330
Who do you think it is if it isn't someone in this room?

540
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,460
Or maybe you can keep observing for yourself because it's my story anyway.

541
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:28,430
- Wow, you just draw the attention back to yourself just like that?
- Hey, you just copied my move, bro.

542
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,960
Ok, I might be a little deviated from others' opinions. I think it could be that guy named Fuaiz.

543
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,080
Honestly, I think this kind of story could be anyone.

544
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,620
Right, I still don't have a particular target in mind. I can't really figure out who this could be.

545
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,490
And I don't have any name in mind because this is my story, so of course, I can't think of anyone else at all.

546
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,130
Dude, you're so smooth with that move.

547
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,480
He received his new brief, and now he changed to be a totally different person from yesterday, man.

548
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,170
I think this one is tough. Today's story is a lot harder than yesterday's.

549
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,040
Right, because yesterday you could still eliminate some choices, but today's hidden story, it seems possible to happen to anyone.

550
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,780
Agree. Today it could be anyone, especially when it could go way back to our childhood.

551
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,900
Well, JJ's look is like a model type, with 190 cm height and broad shoulders.

552
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,810
But in reality, he is a very shy person.

553
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,380
- Right, I'm very shy.
- What you see now is him being a lot more talkative already.

554
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,760
- At first, he wouldn't utter a word because he was too shy.
- Right, I'm more of a shy type, not really that confident.

555
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,139
- What are you unconfident about?
- I'm not confident about the way I look.

556
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:21,030
I feel that I'm still not good enough.

557
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,440
You know, I'm like someone who always strives for more self-improvement.

558
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,159
What do you dislike the most about yourself?

559
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,590
Or is it just you imagining things that it is not good?

560
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,389
Or was it because someone had said that to you before?

561
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,900
I think it is more like me imagining it for myself.

562
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:35,190
I don't have any particular thing that I don't like about myself.

563
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,219
Do you think your height is an advantage or disadvantage?

564
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,650
For me, I actually feel a little embarrassed that I'm this tall.

565
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:46,270
But frankly, I think each personality, each character has its own charm, you know.

566
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,840
For a smaller person, that person would look more adorable, cute, etc.

567
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:55,010
But when you are taller, your advantage is the smart look that comes with it. Whenever you walk in, people can spot you easier and sort of more attractive to the eyes.

568
00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,390
You know, it's like a more visible aura. So, I think you should be using your personality and appearance as wisely as possible.

569
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:03,480
- I think being tall is a great thing too.
- Thank you.

570
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,710
I think everyone can look good in all sizes, you know. You just need to be confident, and that's it.

571
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,540
There is always a path for your own way and style.

572
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,380
Dude, you are this handsome what is there for you to be unconfident about?

573
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,860
- You need to believe in yourself and be confident already.
- Ok, I'll try.

574
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,730
Shall we play "Truth or Dare"? Maybe it could help, as someone might spill the beans about this hidden story.

575
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,130
And how should we play this?

576
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,590
Each person got to spin the bottle, and we rotated counterclockwise.

577
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:41,300
And if it points at whoever, that person can choose whether to answer the question truthfully or accept the challenge.

578
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,130
But you cannot ask about today's topic.

579
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,420
- Wouldn't it be better to just freely ask any question?
- Ok, then, we can ask anything.

580
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,000
Lotte, bro, it's you.

581
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:58,860
- Go hard, bro!
- Have you ever jerked off with your friend's picture?

582
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:09,220
- Oh my god!
- No!
- And I dare you to give our little sugar daddy a peck on the cheek.

583
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,540
Even though it got nothing to do with me, I was just sitting there doing nothing,

584
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,450
but fine, I'll carry.

585
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:19,850
A picture of my own friend, right? Ok, I'd rather answer the question.

586
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,080
- Yes, I have.
- Woahhh

587
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,740
I think it's normal.

588
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,790
But it is a bit embarrassing, though

589
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,940
I tried to cause a stir with some 18+ topics. Since I've seen others play it this way, I wanted to try it too.

590
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:42,540
Wowww, it's you, sugar daddy.

591
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,500
Usually, when you're in bed and doing stuff with someone, are you the calm and silent type or the hardcore/sadistic type?

592
00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:00,030
- What type are you?
- My dare is not that hard. Let's say I dare you to lick Fuaiz's cheek.

593
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,460
Ewww

594
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,100
I'll answer.

595
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,920
- hahaha
- He is too disgusted by that challenge.

596
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,780
Well, I'm just the calm and normal type.

597
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,570
Just like how typical people would do it

598
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,060
- So, you're the normal type, right?
- Right.

599
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,730
At first, I thought he might be into some role-plays like "Call me master."

600
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,000
- Go, go, sugar daddy, let's heat this up.***
- See that.

601
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,240
Woohoo.... oh, man!

602
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,810
I'm more like the talk-and-explain type.***

603
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:30,730
Have you ever had sex in any public places?

604
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,870
And I dare you to skip dinner; you cannot eat this evening.

605
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,660
Alright, then...

606
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,290
- (Nodding his head)
- Where? Bro, please specify the place.

607
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,540
That's the end of the question. Just this is enough.

608
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,380
Well, that is how the question was asked, so I couldn't answer more than what was originally asked.

609
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,710
Otherwise, that would go against the rule. So, I can't, right?

610
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,640
Woody, you could just pick the person. Go ahead.

611
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,670
Max

612
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:14,160
My question is, how many people that you have slept with?

613
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,030
Please also specify how many when you were in the US and when in Thailand.

614
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,880
Woah, bro, he even put zoning in the question.

615
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,490
What a deep and detailed question

616
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:27,230
And I dare you to lick this table from that corner all the way to this and back.

617
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,490
When I was in the US, I didn't have sex with anyone.

618
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,490
But in Thailand...

619
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,930
Probably a lot, right? You're taking a lot of time thinking.

620
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:48,650
Just sec, he's thinking.
- Seriously, I couldn't remember. I really can't remember.

621
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,980
-  Duhhh, come on, man.
- Ok, if you can't remember, then give us a rough estimate.

622
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,000
- Is it ranging from 1-10 or 10-20?
- Right, this sounds great.

623
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,920
- Say it.
- 10-20. It's 10-20.

624
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,140
Woahhhh

625
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,680
Mom, if you're watching this, I'm sorry, though.

626
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,590
Max, you're like the superhero now.

627
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,380
Copper!

628
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,000
I know that you're a kind-hearted one, Max.

629
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,520
Copper...

630
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,240
Are you still a virgin?

631
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,430
- Oh, everyone looks so damn anticipated about this
- What about the dare part?

632
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,870
- So, what's the answer?
- What about the challenge? What is your dare?

633
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:38,180
- What is your dare?
- Can we just remove that dare part?

634
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,150
- No, you have to tell him your challenge.
- Alright

635
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,640
Dare? Well...lick the table, then.

636
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,840
Again? Fine, then.

637
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,770
Ok, I'll answer. But did you mean Sing* as in "single," right? (Sing in Thai is a slang meaning a virgin)

638
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,520
- No, dude. That's not what it means.
- Oh, I know, I'm just kidding. Just forget it

639
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,800
We mean virgin.

640
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,010
No, I'm not.

641
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,240
I'm not a virgin.

642
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,830
This time the bottle is picking the one who can ask the question.

643
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:14,120
- pick the juiciest one
- Hey, watch out!

644
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,070
- Is it JJ or Max?
- Max

645
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,420
Max, you should ask Perth.

646
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,840
Ah... when was your first time having sex?

647
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,430
And when is the latest one too?

648
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:31,390
- Ok, I'll be wiping the table for you now.
- If you're not answering. I dare you to dance on this table with your most scandalous moves.

649
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,990
But will the table be able to stand that? What if it's broken?

650
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,660
The first time, I couldn't recall that. But the latest one was just before I came to THC's house.

651
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,930
It was before yesterday.

652
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,520
- Yesterday? So it means 1 night before you come here, right?
- Right

653
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,600
- But I don't really buy that you guys don't remember your first.
- Seriously, I couldn't remember that.

654
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,210
- I don't know exactly when it was.
- How old are you? At what age was it?

655
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,110
I was an adult already, like a full grown-up, when it happened. I was pretty late about this stuff.

656
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:01,720
- Approximately when?
- If I recall it correctly... I was probably around 19.

657
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,660
- So, you were in the Uni already, then.
- Right, during my Uni days, I think it was my second year.

658
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,510
I was the last one on this game that got asked. You see, Max was trying to trap me.

659
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,040
See, I told you, he really is having a problem with me.

660
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,080
He deliberately did that to get on my nerve.

661
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,290
- Perth, it's your turn to spin. Spin it.
- But all of us have already been questioned, haven't we?

662
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,550
- Yeah, all of us have been asked already.
- What about me? Why am I the only one who didn't get to ask at all?

663
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,440
- Yeah!!
- I'm mad and sulky now. I don't wanna play with you guys anymore.

664
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,630
I think this game is sort of...well, all of them asked only 18+ questions.

665
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,650
It was like a roasting session where we took turns jabbing and pranking each other with funny questions. It was fun.

666
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,570
I was the first to spark the conversation, and then others just tagged along on this topic.

667
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,230
All we've talked about is this topic. And I'm sort of feeling great to be the initiator of this subject.

668
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,730
Alright, guys.

669
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,410
Ok, now is the time for the most crucial activity of today.

670
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:13,160
- Ok
- In just a bit, we'll vote for the owner of today's hidden story.

671
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,280
- So, you have your answer in mind already, right?
- Right

672
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,950
Are you confident of what you have thought?

673
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:20,810
Not confident at all

674
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:26,670
Ok, I'll repeat this story again. The owner of this hidden story used to have a secret crush on one person.

675
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,620
And that person happened to have some missing teeth.

676
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,210
Then, he decided to pull out his own tooth,

677
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,850
so that he could be relatable or have something in common with someone that he liked

678
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:40,590
I'll give each of you another chance to talk and bluff against your friends.

679
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,870
When we were about to cast our votes, I seriously didn't know who this could be.

680
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,420
Honestly, I really don't know who is the origin of this story, you know.

681
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,570
We did try to analyze to find that person. However, everyone looked so normal and lived like an ordinary day.

682
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,300
Yet everyone tried to dodge the questions, too, so I have no idea.

683
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:01,900
- You go first.
- Nope, definitely not me.

684
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:06,810
- Are you sure?
- I copied this from you, New.

685
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:16,160
Definitely not me. Imagine that we randomly picked the card, and there were 11 cards, so the chance that it would be me...again?

686
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,320
Well, who knows, today could also be you, Max.

687
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,250
It's around a 9% chance. That ain't slim, though.

688
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,390
- I think it's you, Max.
- But it could be someone else too.

689
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:29,860
Before the vote, I actually had my mind set that if I used my brain to decide this, I would have to pick either Mio or Bump.

690
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,600
But if I use my heart, it definitely must be Max.

691
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,500
He really needs to get it from me.

692
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,560
I don't know what to say since this is not my story. However, I will tell you one fact.

693
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,890
- Around grade 4th or 5th, I actually liked one girl named Bow.
- The name is Bow, now?

694
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,630
Hahaha, bro, you've changed your crush now.

695
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,580
- You just keep on lying, bro.
- What was the first person's name again? Maam or Angie?

696
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,350
Well, prior to this, I might be trying to trick you guys. But this time, I'm saying it for real.

697
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,910
- You can observe the way I talk.
- Last time, you also talk this way.

698
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:01,520
Right, the real one is Bow. About Maam, etc., don't trust me on that. It wasn't real.

699
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,610
The person doesn't exist, and I don't even know who that is. I was just talking nonsense.

700
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:10,330
You see, he once said he liked Bow, and before that, he said Maam. He changed his words all the time.

701
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:14,240
This guy is really not trustable. And this was clear since our last round that I had voted for him too.

702
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,260
My turn now? Ok, just l like I said before that this is my story.

703
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,790
And she was the one who actually made the first move.

704
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:27,180
Right, she was hitting on me first. I was hot during my elementary years.

705
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:32,130
She would give me flowers every morning because I went to a boarding school and stayed in a dorm.

706
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,290
Every morning, she would place the flowers in front of my shoes.

707
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,640
But I didn't realize it at all because my dorm teacher always kept that away.

708
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,380
Until I finally found out, when things got quite heavy already, and my teacher had to tell me about it.

709
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,320
So I knew who she was.

710
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,490
I was like, if it's this person, I'm also interested in her.

711
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,430
Because she was cute, but I had never talked to her before.

712
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,710
So I started to grow fond of her and feel for her in return.

713
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:58,970
And she already had some missing teeth, whereas I had a metal crown tooth.

714
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:03,900
I used to have that metal crown tooth, so... I asked my mom if I could do that.

715
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:12,140
Ok, for me, it was a childhood love story.

716
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:18,420
At the time, there was one song, which was a very beautiful song.

717
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,940
And the lyrics were meaningful, too, so I sent that to her.

718
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:24,670
- I liked her
- In what way?

719
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,980
And the meaning of that song is...

720
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,970
It's also related to... to this story

721
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,990
The name of the song is...

722
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:39,030
- Jung Si Mun Tong Thorn* (It's a name of a popular Thai folk song about drinking and overcoming hang-over)
- hahaha

723
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,160
Dude, you're talking nonsense.

724
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,920
- Well, you know, the girl liked the song, though, when I sent her Jung Si Mun Tong Thorn.
- Ok, and so?

725
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,920
Thorn is like Thorn Fun* (Thorn Fun in Thai means tooth extraction)

726
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,420
- Right, I sent it to someone I like.
- It sounds even more like you were bullying her, bro.

727
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,730
You see here; the scar is still visible here.

728
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,970
- Where? Let me see.
- And look at this, my tooth is chipped here.

729
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:04,010
- Dude, tooth extraction is taking it out from your mouth. But that tooth, isn't it a new tooth, then?
- That's why it's broken.

730
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:11,390
At first, I thought of voting for Bump, but after we gathered and talked, I changed my mind. It can't be him, so I crossed him out.

731
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,330
I think I've told you this story since this morning, but now I have already rearranged it.

732
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:19,410
It has already been rearranged, so it means it makes sense now this time.

733
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,760
I studied in Thailand and then went to high school in the US.

734
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,640
Which means I was there from grade 9th onward. However, before that, I also went to study there during the summer.

735
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,970
During the summer, I would go there and then come back. Each time, it was around 2 months.

736
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,830
And this story is about Jane. She was such a pretty girl that I met in 7th grade.

737
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,230
And her teeth were falling off. She was someone with a rather slow pace in losing her milk teeth.

738
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,100
And I was also experiencing the same thing as her. So, I thought that was destiny.

739
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,750
Then I went to see the dentist to pull it out for me.

740
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:47,290
Frankly, Copper is someone that I really can't read through him.

741
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,280
The story that he told could be a lie?

742
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:55,780
So I was thinking over and over about whether he was lying or it could really be him.

743
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,820
I'm baffled today.

744
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,000
- This one
- Go on.

745
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,520
Well, I believe puppy love or childhood love story is innocent and heartwarming, far greater than today.

746
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,060
Because I didn't want her to be the only target of teasing and making fun of

747
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,380
If anyone had to be the only person in the class with missing teeth, that would feel pretty awful, right?

748
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,470
And so I thought if I had done that and it could take away the burden from her, then I was willing to endure that.

749
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,610
Yeah, that's it.

750
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:21,970
- Ok, your turn, Woody.
- When I was in kindergarten, I kinda had a crush on one person.

751
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:27,310
And when I entered elementary school, I couldn't see her at all since I moved to an all-boys school instead.

752
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:31,340
After growing up to around the last few years of elementary school just before junior high,

753
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,460
She studied in the school next to me. Our schools were St. Francis and Saint Gabriel's Schools.

754
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,480
And my younger female cousin studied at St. Francis.

755
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,960
So, I got her contact from my cousin, and we had our lovely little exchange again.

756
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,340
At the time, I was so dedicated to our relationship, and I would walk to meet her at her school every day.

757
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,760
Yep, that's it.

758
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,380
Ok, you go ahead now.

759
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,590
You all have already seen this particular tooth of mine, right?

760
00:47:52,590 --> 00:48:01,250
The reason why it is in silver color is because I got a cavity and I had to undergo root canal treatment.

761
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:07,690
Since it was around the same time, I brought up this story and told you guys here in THC, as I want you all to believe me.

762
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:14,350
I used this excuse and lied to one girl that I got my tooth extracted for her to be just like her.

763
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,660
But well, she... I said that because I wanted her to like me back, but she didn't like me.

764
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,600
Eh?

765
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,560
After I listened to all the talks that Mile had allowed us to say before casting a vote,

766
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,910
I have Lotte come up in mind.

767
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:28,350
I think Lotte's story is really adding up well.

768
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,260
It sounds compelling like it's a real story. He has to get that silver crown tooth, which we can clearly see that it is there.

769
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:36,720
I still stand by my words earlier that I don't wanna say much.

770
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,550
Don't vote for me because if many of you vote for me, then I get nothing.

771
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,330
***

772
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:49,760
Actually, I said this before when I was playing the cards with JJ, Fuaiz, and Bump.

773
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,830
I'm telling you, I'm someone who really worships love.

774
00:48:54,830 --> 00:49:02,860
To be devoted and dedicated to love and doing crazy things is actually a way of managing and filling up that gap from some of my insecurities when I was a kid.

775
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,960
And pulling out my tooth was part of that too.

776
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,460
I kinda feel like maybe Perth was acting it out.

777
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,800
Because he said himself that sometimes he tried so hard too

778
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,960
And so I thought maybe when he asked around for us to vote for him so that he could have a chance to score some coins,

779
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,640
Maybe he was just playing the same game so that someone would vote for him, and he could get the coins.

780
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,120
Ok, now it's time for you to vote.

781
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,840
Ok, you guys are ready, right? Our first one, JJ, you go ahead.

782
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,520
Can I please be the first to vote?

783
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,930
Ok, you can go.

784
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,860
- Go on.... Lotte is the first to go.
- You go first, bro.

785
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:43,800
- Vote wisely, otherwise it would be an embarrassment, bro.
- Go on.

786
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,670
We are here at the most critical moment of the day.

787
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:42,200
- Alright
- And I'm going to announce the result about who has the most votes.

788
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,140
- Are you exciting?
- Of course, we are exciting.

789
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,210
Wow, our first one is JJ.

790
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,960
- Hey
- Where is that from?

791
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,160
Our second one is Perth.

792
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:58,670
And our third one is Mio.

793
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,250
It's like one after the other.

794
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:01,920
Max

795
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,640
4 persons now

796
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,610
- Why voted for me?
- What if it's all 11 of us?

797
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:07,150
Perth, again. So, Perth, you are on the lead now.

798
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,660
- Woah
- Yep, Perth is leading now.

799
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:11,770
Jet

800
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,010
- Hey, it's like everyone.
- Is it gonna be all of us popping up?

801
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,450
- Lotte
- Hey, wow.

802
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:19,460
- Yep, it's Lotte.
- Have you voted for the wrong one?
- See, I told you.

803
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,810
- New
- Hey! What?!
- Woah. This are quite a lot of choices here, almost everyone of you now.

804
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,750
Max

805
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,680
Wow, this is so close.

806
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,530
- So, who do you think get the most votes?
- We still have one left, right?

807
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,010
2 more cards

808
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,230
Max?

809
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:39,430
I think there might actually be some kind of a twist that people didn't expect that at all.

810
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:43,420
And today, Max is kinda nervous.

811
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:47,380
- Our 10th card is Lotte.
- Wow

812
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,580
What? Are you for real? This is crazy.

813
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,150
Ok, then let's see our last one.

814
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,140
And the last one is...Oh, man

815
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,690
The last one is Lotte!

816
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,040
Damn!

817
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,700
- Oh my god
- I hope we voted right.

818
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Why would anyone pick him? He didn't look suspicious or anything fishy at all.

819
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,540
I think people got tricked and carried away by his metal crown tooth.

820
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,890
And so they fell for that trap and believe that it was Lotte.

821
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:21,230
Maybe, he was using his mojo like sending people the secret spirit to whisper his name to their ears.

822
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,460
I don't it's because of acting or lying more like his mojo and manifesting.

823
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,530
- Wow
- Eh? It's the same person.

824
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:28,130
- Eh? It's the same person.
- Yeah, right.
- Let's shake our hands.

825
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,200
But hang on, hang on, I haven't reveal the real owner of this hidden story yet.

826
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,380
If Lotte is actually the real owner of this story, that means he get noting and nobody get anything today too.

827
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,760
OMG, Lotte, bro, I didn't thought of you at all.

828
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,390
Ok, let's just cut to the moment of truth. Who is the real owner of this story?

829
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,490
- I'm sorry guys.
- Raise your hand
- What? Copper, it's you?

830
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,600
Why are you doing this me, bro?

831
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,990
See

832
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:17,360
- Eh?
- Why are you doing this to me, man?

833
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,680
- so unexpected
- I was so sad and disappointed like I got my heartbroken.

834
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,070
It was like all my hope and expectation just crumbling down.

835
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,690
Well, you know, it could be anyone, and it has be you. And why I didn't know that it was you.

836
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,810
He was flawless today. Everybody was bewildered how come it was him.

837
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:38,390
At that time I might not react much but inside my heart I feel so delighted and satisfied like running in the lavender field.

838
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:43,020
And I was shocked too that I could act it out so perfectly or may be I was so crappy that they couldn't believe that it could be me,

839
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,190
or whatever, I'm not sure too

840
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,700
Ok, I will recap our score now. Yesterday, New got 3 coins. It's 3 coins, right?

841
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,340
And JJ also got 1.

842
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,290
But today, someone is taking the lead and by quite a big leap too.

843
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,660
That is Lotte. He got 3 coins for the most votes, and 1 from our mini-game, so that rounded up as 4 coins.

844
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,010
Woohoo!

845
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:11,910
And Jet is another one who also got 1 coin from our mini-game.

846
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:13,570
Yeah!

847
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,010
And our owner of the story today, wow, you're such a romantic guy.

848
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,390
It from your childhood, right? I'm not sure how young you were.

849
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:29,030
But I still find that it's so romantic for you to get your tooth extracted out just to match up and be relatable with someone that you like.

850
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:34,100
So, congratulations to Copper. I call this a great acting and role well-played.

851
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,810
He could make others disregard him as a potential choice that nobody pick him at all.

852
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,030
And he got 3 coins in total. Here you go.

853
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,000
Woohoo!

854
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,790
Ok, here.

855
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:47,910
I'm so proud of this and I'm really pleased too that could earn these coins.

856
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,670
It is a shock. I'm still shocked and stunned by the result.

857
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:54,170
And another winner, here you go, 3 coins for you Lotte.

858
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:04,110
And again this is our THC's ritual that every evening we will have our little party. Then, we will be discussing about our childhood today.

859
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:05,280
- Ok, right?
- Yep

860
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,040
- Are you guys ready for our party yet?
- We're ready!

861
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,230
Let's go. Let's go. Woohoo.

862
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:14,940
Not only that I didn't get any coin, but I also made the wrong choice too. It's such a shame and embarrassing.

863
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:19,570
But you know, this time the mistake was already done, so next time I won't be repeating it again.

864
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:24,950
Lotte, bro, you might have won today but tomorrow the possibility is still unknown.

865
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,380
I will definitely avenge you on this.

866
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,900
What were guys chatting about a while ago?

867
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,310
- Did you quarrel? What is it about?
- What were you guys brickering about?

868
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,850
- It's really nothing much.
- You love hitting on someone else butt, didn't you?

869
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,630
Well, Fuaiz said that I kept hitting on his butt.

870
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,210
That because it was you. You love doing that.

871
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,140
You did that to both my butt and my dick too.

872
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:08,540
- No, man.
- I was just walking and you just attacked me like that all the time.

873
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:13,300
- He is a thug behind the camera. When the camera is not on, he always wanna fight with me, bro.
- No, I'm not like that. I'm not that kind of person.

874
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:16,920
He isn't respect me anymore. I'm 1 year older than him, bro.

875
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,580
- Well, I've to him before to cut it.
- Have you considered about that at all, he is 1 year older than you?

876
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,830
Not really, I didn't think much about it.

877
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:22,860
Damn, you, we're 1 year apart, dude.

878
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:26,620
I have already told him that I will no longer regarded him as a senior. Well, you see, he didn't live up to the title to earn my respect, bro.

879
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,670
- Just look a him, bro
- But you guys have to respect this person, though.

880
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,660
Have you say hi to Apo yet? Turn and greet him properly.

881
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,870
Hi, Apo.

882
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,840
Apo is here to cheer you guys up for this project.

883
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:38,340
He also said that he will tell me which one of you good and which one is not.

884
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,950
Apo, get us water, please? We're out of water.

885
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:43,030
It's almost empty now.

886
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,100
Good, good, he is so hand on.

887
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,400
Please give ways to our new waiter.

888
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,990
Are you trying to flaunt your watch or what?

889
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,510
Oh, it's nothing much.

890
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,740
Well, today's story is about love which I find it's very romantic.

891
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,660
Copper was someone that I crossed out the list very early on.

892
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,300
I thought it doesn't seem like him. Would ever go to the extent of pulling out his own teeth for a girl?

893
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,780
I viewed him as a cute and adorable guy.

894
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:15,600
But then when I listened his story and his reason why he go the extra mile and remove his tooth, I just thought, wow, this guy is really romantic.

895
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,310
I felt so guilty about this. Look at his life and then mine,... he is so noble.

896
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:22,630
You felt like you are tainting his life, right?

897
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,310
Woah, "noble", hahaha

898
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,850
Does anyone have a similar story to this?

899
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,050
- None, nothing at all
- Woah, really, is it that bad?
- Not a single one?

900
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,570
Then, let Mile shares his story first.

901
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,310
Seriously, for me, everyday is a special day.

902
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:43,510
I think special day like birthday or anniversary, etc, it equally worth the same as everyday.

903
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:50,470
All days are equally worthwhile. Therefore, I think in every day I should be doing things that I believe it would make that person happy.

904
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,290
Or whenever that we were given something or receiving that we're thankful for and wanting them to know, we should let them know.

905
00:57:54,290 --> 00:58:05,640
But if you were to ask when or how much I enjoy and devote myself to love and relaionship the most, I would say that it's probably around high school.

906
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,910
Because I had my first girlfriend when I was 14. Just like that song of Sek, Loso - 14 again.

907
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,760
It was right from when I turned 14 for the first day, she asked me out to be her boyfriend.

908
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:16,820
And she is my girlfriend that I love the most when I was young.

909
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,890
Until I was in grade 10th and I moved to study in Bangkok.

910
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:26,220
Around 1-2 weeks, I'd secretly take the public bus, back then I have to the bus, to go back to my hometown and meet up with her.

911
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:31,520
I didn't tell anyone. And I did all that just to be with her for like... well, just to watch one movie together, that's it. And then I have to leave.

912
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,680
Umm, I think this story is really cute. Because, you know, his hometown is very far away. He had to take the bus upto Kalasin*. (Kalasin is a province in Northeastern region of Thailand)

913
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,880
I think it's 9 hours. It's around 8-9 hours, If I remember this correctly because it been such a long time already.

914
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,950
Well, I took the bus on Friday's evening and then come back on Monday's morning.

915
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,660
But when you were on that bus, were you smiling?

916
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,810
Of course man, it was like my heart full of hope. When you were young, love is something that keep our hope alive.

917
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:58,290
Because for me to be able to go back there and meet her just a couple hours, only that is enough. I was so happy and content.

918
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,370
And there were times that I went back but I didn't get a chance to see her too.

919
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,210
And I'm not really sure why she didn't come to meet me during that time. Because at that moment we were so in love.

920
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,410
But when we broke up, then of course,  it's normal. When we broke up there were also kinda weird reasons to it too.

921
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:12,230
But no matter what, in the end I still believe in love. I just feel that love gives us some kind of power.

922
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:18,840
It gives us some goals that we want to achieve. But whether it is good for us or not, that I might not be so sure of, but I know that it gives us hope.

923
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,380
Now, let's listen to some love experience of our younger fellows. Let's start from the youngest one, that is Fuaiz, right?

924
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:38,320
- Right
- Right, I will let you briefly share with us what love is to you. So that we know that when you are 17, how do you feel about love and what it means to you.

925
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,310
I think it means someone that we're happy to be with them and trust them too.

926
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:45,370
I think it is someone who we're comfortable to talk to and live with them.

927
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,160
- Have you felt love before?
- The feeling? Yes, I have.

928
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,780
- Was it a good one?
- No..not really that good

929
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,450
But what about when you were in the moment of feeling the love, was it good or bad? Forget about the result of today, just that moment alone, was it good or not?

930
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:57,980
Good, I felt really good about it.

931
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:04,370
Well, it was one time of love that happened during my younger days... but it's not the end of my life.

932
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:06,430
And so it is normal for people to part.

933
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,090
That's a good wrap-up.

934
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,150
Ok, you turn now, before you dozed off.

935
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:16,460
Love, well, for me love is like a magic.

936
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:21,840
It could make everything on this planet... hahaha

937
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,470
Ok, it has the power to turn everything pink.

938
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,210
Have you guys ever heard that saying "someone who is in love, will become a bit younger"

939
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,240
- That is true.
- Right, right.

940
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,720
So when you are in love, you also love everything else, and love yourself too.

941
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:39,390
- And that is the magic of love.
- Yeah!!

942
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,880
Oh, this one, he is probably the most crazy in love kinda guy.

943
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,230
You're probably the most devoted to love. Max, go ahead.

944
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:53,470
I think love is about giving with sincerity.

945
01:00:55,590 --> 01:01:00,520
Right now, I feel that love is about giving, probably.

946
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:07,400
It's not just about the person, though. But it includes everything and all the stuff around us.

947
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:13,430
When we love something we always give something to it.

948
01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:15,580
- Like priority?
- Right, priority

949
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:23,550
It was quite surprising to me too that when we first met, you seemed to see right through me.

950
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:34,150
For example, when I was drunk, you told me that I drink to get drunk in order to drown all those stress away, so I could forget about things that worried or sadden me..

951
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:40,860
Like I was just tried to be drunk to forget about all my sadness. And sometimes, I didn't even realize that why I love to drink or get drunk so much.

952
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:48,160
I didn't understand why I enjoy that kind of thing. But when you told me that, I came back and pondered to myself, that I was like that.

953
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,220
Well, you have to understand that me and Mile, we're like the expert on this spectrum.

954
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,910
- In terms of making people happy, man
- Right, in terms of making both ourselves and others happy

955
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:02,040
That's why it is so easy for us to spot people who are really happy when they're drunk.

956
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,060
And who are actually sad while they're drunk. That day I saw you drunk and I could see that you're not happy, but suffering.

957
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,250
- If you're drunk and suffer, that's the time that you should stop.
- Right, that's a no-no.

958
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:09,400
- You remembered that time that we told him about this, right?
- Right.

959
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:15,100
But after that day, you has never went back that route again. I think is one plus side of this project, it allowed us to crack open something.

960
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:19,350
Otherwise, he would always be drowning down and crying all the time while telling others that he is fine.

961
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:25,680
Ok, for me, let's say that I have listened to a lot of stories and at this age, I've seen plenty of things too.

962
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,540
I've known people who had married and then divorced and parted way.

963
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,670
I think real love is peacefulness. It's not something so striking or astounding,.

964
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:33,400
If it is too intense that is passion.

965
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:40,900
That heartthrob or tingling butterflies when it gone, well...it could be gone from either them or us, because it is impossible to always remain exciting all the time.

966
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,260
- (bird chirping sound)
- See, even the bird agree with me.
- It said "right"

967
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,570
You know, when I go aboard I would always meet the foreigner couples who are very old now, but they're still together. They're still giving each other a peck or kiss or hug.

968
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:53,250
You have to understand for people in that age, they no longer have anything like sexual activity.

969
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:57,690
But it is more about the feeling that they still adore this particular person so much.

970
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,320
I think it's like when they're with their person they are at peace. They don't need to feel anxious or anticipating all the time.

971
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,740
They don't have to be so stressed out. It's more like a happiness that is calm and tranquil, so it could last longer.

972
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:07,710
I don't know but this is just my view about love. May be one they you would find out your answer by yourself.

973
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:12,550
But from my experience, I could tell you that it is so rare to find. If you ever come across one, you also need to be that peace of mind and safe zone for them too.

974
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:16,190
Please cut this part out, we don't want this.

975
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:20,530
But everything is always involving with the the time. Someday we might be happy, but tomorrow we could be sad too.

976
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,950
Even though you love each other, but your love one could also pass away. That's why we are going to talk about "Tomorrow."

977
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:40,070
Oh, man, Tomorrow, right? But sometimes, in life, we really do have to part, just like you've said.

978
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:47,600
Tomorrow, there will be many of you. Well, because, it's like 11 of you, if we only take eliminate one out that would be weird.

979
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,120
And that's just my personal opinion. Therefore, there will be some of you who have to leave early. But I think there will be quite a few.

980
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,750
It sort of giving that bad vibe that why I'm feeling down.

981
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:04,060
It almost like a flash. Because you know, we are here with THC for quite some time.

982
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:07,430
Just heard about it and pictured, I feel bad already.

983
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:14,600
I think today I started to get my energy up. Like, I kinda just get the hang of it and know which direction I should adjust myself to.

984
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,700
But when I heard about this thing, I...

985
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,250
I didn't expect that it will be this soon.

986
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:24,510
And if anyone of us has to leave, I would probably.....

987
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,630
I'll feel sad about it and if it was me, I would be even... ahh..sigh˜

988
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,410
like dying

989
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:41,600
- Apo, can you just walk around one more time.
- Apo since you're still here, do another walk, say something nice to them, comfort them that this is just a game.

990
01:04:43,010 --> 01:04:45,860
- Speak loudly too. Speak louder
- He doesn't have a mic with him, though.

991
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:52,530
Well, it's life, we meet and we part. And the reason why I am here is because I want to see all of you here.

992
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:58,240
I can see that you all are very determined. When I look back to my younger self around your age,

993
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,230
I couldn't do as great as you all have done today.

994
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:03,080
You all are way better with your talk than me on that day.

995
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,570
You all are so dope. So, no matter what please remain true to yourself as much as possible.

996
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,090
Whatever that it's gonna happen is not the last day of you, so just keep on going.

997
01:05:11,090 --> 01:05:13,730
- ok, bye
- thanks for coming

998
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:32,850
This person had used violence against his dad, because he comes from a family with domestic violence background.

999
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:38,950
There will be one of you here who won't be able to go on this journey with us.

1000
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:42,750
They will eliminate a person out.

1001
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:45,960
I don't know whether I will get to meet you today or not, mom.

1002
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,010
Mom, please don't ever say that you will take your own life again.
