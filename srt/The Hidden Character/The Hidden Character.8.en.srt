Last week, the eight members of the THC

Mio was almost halted at that moment.

He was late

11
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:26,900
and didn't practice.

Now, to be honest, I don't want to work with him anymore.

I've been late all along, and I was really anxious.

I'm sorry to Pond and everyone else.

I've received feedback from Apo and Pond, said that

So we redesigned the props.
