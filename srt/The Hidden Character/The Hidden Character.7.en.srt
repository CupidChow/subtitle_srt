It's thick, bro.

500

It's in the woods.

It's going back and forth in a lot of places.

502

The scene I got was getting lost in the woods.

Yes, with Ping.

I know that Ta had played the role of Kinn before

on the Kinn Porsche World Tour.

520
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,940
So I suggested to him that

521
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,579
if he tried playing Porsche

522
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,050
and I was playing Kinn,

523
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,369

We both tried Kinn and Porsche characters.

Ta is more suitable for Porsche.

542
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,270
Because when he gets annoyed,

543
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,390
he's more natural than I am.

544

I think it's okay, so I agreed.

If so,

we'll decide with the bodyguard rules.

It's hard because…

560

The most likely thing is to strum the guitar, singing, bro.

Why?

There's a little problem.

Now we remember the lines,

but when we played them,

it's more like we're reciting them.

be good, because I have no experience at all.

Yes,

00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,370
but he did it.

1480

Others may not have seen it, but

1481
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,540
I was with him and I saw it.

1482
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:27,200
I know. Thank you very much.

1483

Thank you, Bump, for explaining.

Mio is a great kid, but

I don't need great kid. I need a nice one.

1486
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,890

1488
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,060
I saw the other side of him when he worked hard.

1489
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,090
Being late,

1490
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:43,040
skipping the practice, ask anyone,

1491
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,940
I'm

1492
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,820
really strict about it.

1493
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:49,520
Now, I'll be absolutely frank, I don't want to work with Mio.

1494
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,460
What do you want to say now?

1495
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,940
Now I think I'm really wrong.

1496
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:57,510
It's all my personal conduct.

1497
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:58,800
I was irresponsible.

1498
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:02,040
I didn't put 100% of effort in it.

1499
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,840
I think I want to go on.

1502
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,850
I know it's useless to say it.

1503
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:14,780
It's like an excuse.

1504
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,900
We've seen the performance of the four team.

1505
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:21,370

Let's swap partners.

1508
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,680
But not to that point.

1509
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,030
But inside I don't want to work with Mio.

1510

Oh my.

1511

1512
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,000
Just like that? So sudden.

1513
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,180
I want to

1514
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:39,500

1515
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,600

Okay.

1519

Acting

1520
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,130
is an occupation.

1521

There are cameras and all the stuff.

1522

If we spend an hour to rehearse it,

1523
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:56,780
and I forget my lines

1524
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,340
or I don't act seriously,

1525

it will be a loss.

1526

It's like I didn't respect the time of others.

give you another chance,

1642
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,300
but I need to see he's going to change.

1643
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,400
Because,

1644
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,380
for Be On Cloud,

1645
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,760
to train an artist,

1646
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,280
we pay a lot of attention to details.

1647
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,630
I actually really want to give him a chance,

1648
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:29,110
but he should do some introspection.

1649
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,920
Now is the turning point.

1650
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,960
I think it's the last chance.

1651
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,030
I believe

1652
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,020
what our show needs is to be natural.

1653
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Looking all the way back,

1654
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,350
he has been very natural.

1655
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,800
It's not easy to find such a person.

1656
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,660
If he loses this chance,

1657
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,790
it'll be his complex in his life.

1658
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,650
It's like, "I know I was wrong, but I don't have a chance to make it right."

1659
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,690
But if he gets the chance today, he'll know he can still make it right.

1660
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,250
Then make it a stimulating point.

1661
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,140
OK, you all agreed

1662
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,210
to let him stay.

1663
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,880
Thank you very much, Gift.

1664
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,900
Okay.

1665

1666

OK, give him another chance.

-Thank you, bye.
-Bye.

1668

Gift is out. I'm really excited.

1669

Are you done thinking? Who's get how many points?

1670
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,620
Mio and Bump.

1671
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,960
I'll give Mio 5 points.

1672
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,930
I like his naturalness.

1673
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:22,680
It's really rare.

1674
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,120
But I won't give him,

1675
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,560
because I still mind

1676
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:28,350
him being irresponsible. I'll give Bump

1677
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:30,790
2 points.

1678
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,210
2.

1679
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:34,820
JJ did very well,

1680
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:35,990
but

1681
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,970
Fuaiz did a great job too, in that scene.

1682
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,670
So JJ gets 3 points and Fuaiz, 2.

1683
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,770
Jet and New.

1684
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,380

1685
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,060
-Both of them? No points for them?
-No.

1686
00:55:48,550 --> 00:55:50,070
But I see their effort.

1687
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:52,820
So I'll give 1 point each.

1688

I'll give it all to Ta.

1692
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:01,400
OK.

1693

How many coins?

7 coins.

1698

but I don't know how to judge his acting skills.

1699

I really can't give him.

1700

There are 3 points left. I want to give them out for acting skills.

1701

who will get how many points.

1712
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:50,660
I've talked with Pond.

1713

So at that time,

1714

Pond and Mio have talked, right?

Yes.

Whether you're given a chance

if you keep doing that,

1726
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,420
I believe,

1727
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:22,820
even in other places,

1728
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,990
you'll be eliminated, too.

1729

You're not creating fun just for yourself,

1730

but there's also audiences and colleagues.

1731
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,270
So if you're not responsible, there will be impact,

huge impact.

1733
