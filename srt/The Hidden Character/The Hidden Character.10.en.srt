Hello, I'm JJ Patiphan Fueangfunuwat.
Back when I was in school,

57
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,450
almost every afternoon for 2 to 3 years,
I always put up with one person

58
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:07,570
I loved studying. I went to ask the lady in the restaurant, ”Auntie, do you have crispy pork?“

59
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,710
-She said no. It's sold out.
-You're exaggerating it!

60
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,079
OK. Go on, go on.
-You know I'd been waiting this dish for 2 years!

61
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,470
Everyday she said it's sold out.
I waited everyday. And there was none.

62
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,750
When I used my crispy pork joke,

63
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,230
[JJ Patiphan Fueangfunuwat IG:jjaypf]

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,530
I actually saw other people lie too.
So I was like…

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,280
OK, I had to say something too.

66
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,060
And I suddenly felt hungry.
So I said it out

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,150
quite seriously.

68
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,670
This person used physical violence with his dad.

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,720
His own father.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,000
Because he comes from a home with domestic violence.

71
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,320
I honestly had no interest in this field.

72
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,590
Because I kinda had a family problem.

73
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,420
My family has their own business.
But I don't wanna get involved.

74
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,340
So I was trying to find a way to get myself out as soon as possible.

75
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,920
And some people recommended me to try this

76
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,430
and I consulted with some friends.
Everyone said I should try it.

But under the circumstances, I had to protect myself.

91
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,940
So I went emotional on many things.

92

A lot of things.

93
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,090

that I could talk to anyone.

158
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,580
We should make the audience blush
like when we saw Apo and Mile.

159
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:43,340
It's not easy.
When I was watching this scene, I felt shy and it made me blush.

to make the audience blush too.

-And Apo will be like…

-Okay. That's how Apo sees it.
-Yes.
-Okay.

[Apo Nattawin Wattanagitiphat]

166

I think it makes them too proud
or too confident

167

It made them think that they could do it whatever they choose.

168

171

I talked with JJ
that we wanna try it.

174
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,920
So we have to redesign it all over.
The stage, the lighting, the props,

175

the blocking, everything. It's very challenging.

the dialogue depends on who you will be, Kinn or Porsche.

Porsche in Fuaiz’s way…
is actually not different from the original.

Being a mafia’s son,
from a rich family.

What if I want you to try

to find the way back to the same dialogue.
From beginning until the end.

244
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:41,150
You might need to guess
what happened to the kid of the main family.

245
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,100
I think what is different is the background of the characters.

what the characters want is exactly the same.

248
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,840
Kinn still wants a lover and still wants to take care of someone.

249
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,940
Because his dad is sick and he is an only child.

And his mom passed away when he was young.

he doesn't wanna be a mafia, but to be independent.

I don't have any excuses. I was really wrong in the past.

458
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,370

But the only thing I lack is discipline. 
He said it since then.

464
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,090
I felt very guilty after talking to him.

465
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,710
He has constantly reminded me.
Yet I still managed to disappoint him.

If we go back and watch the tapes,

467

Yes.

He didn't talk to anyone. He said he didn't want to.

474
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,600
He was afraid people wouldn't like him. It was his flaw.

475
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,980
Now, he's talkative and he is very protective of his friend.

476

They are really protective of each another.

Well, yesterday at the workshop
It was just like what Pond said.

482
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,760
That Mio seemed uninterested in acting.

483
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,120
When the teacher was talking,

484
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,120
I could see that he made an effort and improved rapidly.

485

nothing and couldn't remember the scripts,

486
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,840
or didn’t bother at all,
he could actually do it.

-Annoying as usual.
-Oh.

Let's start from a recap before getting to the scene you picked.

Since the first day you met until now, how's it been?

00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,860
I got used to the show and things like this.

[Audition Day]

501
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,650
It feels like it has become a routine.

502
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,750
Back then, it was

503
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,700
Copper’s story about the missing tooth.

504
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,500
This person got his tooth pulled out just to get attention from the one he liked.

505
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,060
And I was like, 
Hey, I used to have a missing tooth photo.

506
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,540
So I went through it and, Hey, check this out, a missing tooth.

507
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,240
I thought everyone would be fooled.
Because I had this proofed others didn't.

508
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,360
Back then, I wasn't really good at playing the game. So it didn't go smoothly.

509
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,980
If I was smooth and my picture was very clear,
I would have scored a lot of points.

510
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes.

511
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:17,520
It was a crush when we were young.

512
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,500
At that time,

513
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:23,560
there was a good song

514
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,660
with a good meaning.

515
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,770
So I sent it to her.

516
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,350
The song was Jung-See-Man-Tong-Torn.

517
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,450
I just talked nonsense.

518
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,140
I thought it should be related to pulling teeth.

What should I talk about? 
“Jung See is going to pull. Pull the teeth.

521
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,880
I was like, Hey, I'm gonna send this song to the person I liked.

522
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,600
To have a tooth pulled out. I have no idea.
 It was so random.

523
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,020
When I worked with Mio for the first time,
he seemed uninterested.

524
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,130
And he wasn't really committed to it.

525
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,070
Um. To be frank, I don’t feel like working with you, Mio.

526
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,860
I told him to study the scripts, but he didn't.

527
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,290
Being late. Not doing homework.

528
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,690
Ask anybody here.

529
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,620
How serious I am about this.

530
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,340
Mio didn't seem to care about anything.

531
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,360
And we saw his progress.

Until he got better. He started to improve.

534
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,940
As for Bump, 
he is on and off.

535
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,990
Sometimes he's natural, and other times he's not.

536
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:33,370
It seems like he can sometimes control his focus.
And the other times he can't.

537
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,370
So it becomes somewhat unstable.
But if he's with Mio, they might make a good pair.

 [Acting coach of the movie ManSuang]

541
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,990
At first, Bump and I picked the scene that

542
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,000
was really about music 
and we believed we could do it.

543

-They said they didn't buy it.

-He should have known that we understood those characters.
-Yes.

-A great shot. 
-This is a highlight.

-In this series, Kinn is the mafia. Porsche is the bodyguard.
-Right.

553
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,810
But I saw in their positions, what we really wanted.

554
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:43,930
It...

555
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,590
could transform into high school students.

559
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,410
I like something from the 90's,

I thin it's very attractive.

561

We need to express emotions through words.

to create a struggle between them. Then a scene is created.

Because I imagined my best friend was about to jump off the bridge. At first I tossed and turned.

I was imagining myself walking on Rama 8 Bridge, with cars passing by as I stroll along the bridge.

00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:31,180
Then I see my friend about to jump off the bridge and I say, "Come here."

630
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:37,550
Don't jump. My mouth says "come over", but my heart screams "don't jump, come over".

Let’s have a short break for 5 minutes, and we'll do another exercise.

636
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:04,590
The most important thing is that we must truly believe that we are there, doing that thing.

648

Their advantage lies in their strong chemistry,

which means they can choose any scene and do whatever they want.

I think we need to confirm

00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,710
whether they can fall in love with each other,

661

It becomes even more challenging to speak the words in the drawn content.

This makes it easier to get into the scenario.

Regarding this scene, I would like to remind you

739

Although the age has been reduced to student years,

740
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:44,060
the dramatic conflicts of the characters cannot be diminished.

749
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:11,460
It's quite challenging. Ask us to use a new perspective to understand the character,

750
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,360
as everyone has already understood it in that way.
 I have also...I have already redesigned the characters.

I can see another kind of chemical reaction between them. One is able to convey emotions, he will listen and be submissive to the other.

754

The other one is even more aggressive,

A... little nervous.

What's going on? How nervous are you?

It's like, wow, quite a big show. Kinda stressed out, stressed but enjoyed.

Oh, let's recap what has happened until today

776
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,860
how has it been? What have you learned? What have you discovered about yourself?

777
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,080
Well, since the beginning, from the first episode until today.

778
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:55,160
I feel like I've gotten to know myself better. I've learned what I like and what I don't like.

779
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,180
And I'm constantly working on improving myself, hoping that one day it will be better than this.

780
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,900
Since I started this recap of myself.

781
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,160
I went back and looked at my story to see who I used to be.

[Audition Day]

783
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:13,770
Then I go back to watch old shows, sitting and having a conversation with myself. I tried reviewing and writing down the traits I don't like about myself.

784
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,360
After writing down the traits I dislike, I talked to myself,

785
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:22,020
questioning why sometimes I became someone I'm not.

786
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:28,380
In the first episode, I was too focused on winning, to the point where my brain commanded me, what it's called? It's like...

00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:31,620
I did something to let the others know I was panicking.

789
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:34,790
Hoping they would pay attention to me and maybe choose me.

790
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,990
Hey, listen to me! Listen to me!

791
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,830
What do we gain from playing by ourselves? If we give the wrong answers, we don't score any points.

792
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,930
It's better we tell the truth.

795
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,780
I think they would probably be able to advise or teach the audience.

796
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Because I believe that many audience

797
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,740
have this personality as well.

798
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:58,240
It's like, we read something from social media and start craving for success,

799
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,520
and think "I must succeed, I must succeed."

800
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,560
To the point where humans believe they must be successful.

Waking up just to sell vegetables for 5 or 10 baht, and that's enough.

808
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,200
That is success.

809

The most serious encounter I've had was

831

when camping,

ah! So refreshing!

First of all, I would like to know which play you have chosen and how you interpreted it.

854
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,300
We chose the scene where Kinn delivers gun to Porsche.

855

I have something to give you.

856

I will bring it with me.

and yourself.

862
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:07,910
We have to admit that the scene they have chosen is very challenging.

[Apo]

864
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,230
However, from the beginning until now, I have hardly seen any progress from them.

865
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,300
You can tell that they are serious, but that kind of seriousness

866
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,050
is like an unaligned knob. They are trying hard to find it,

867

but

haven't found it yet.

871
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,200
-Personally, I think this scene has a lot of complex emotions and is a very important one, right, bro? -Yes.

872
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,400
It's an important scene of the series "KinnPorsche".

873
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,840
Kinn must have a great deal of trust in Porsche to entrust such an important gun to him. It seems that Kinn really loves Porsche.

874
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,610
Similarly, this scene will also have some moments of genuine expression that burst forth.

[Mile]

876
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:58,590
The dialogue between Kinn and Porsche in this scene

877
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:08,850
involves some teasing behavior that is typical of people who have feelings for each other.

-Right.
-Yes.

And which role do you each of you choose to play?

880
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,430
-I play Kinn.
-You're Kinn. -New will play Porsche.

881
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:18,700
We will change the location of this scene from the secondary family house

882
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,010
to somewhere else you know? A safe house or a vacation home.

883
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:30,760
At an out-of-town location by the seaside, this scene is very important. So if it could take place at a spot we like,

884
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,860
it's supposed to feel good.

For their specific needs,

891
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,830
this is a talisman used to bless

oneself. After all, they are part of the Thai mafia.

893
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:57,490
OK, from this perspective, you think Kinn would believe in these things.

00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,200
Yes.

895
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:04,040
Then let them establish a character with their own style.

896
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:09,730
As for their appearance, try to see how they can blend in with the characters.

897
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:14,040
When the characters are integrated into their appearance,

898
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,580
temperament and gaze, perhaps some thought patterns or

899
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,430
perspectives can be found that allow them

900
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,610
to break away from the images they saw in the original play.

901

OK, good.

Is it okay for others if I dance like this?

When I was in elementary school,

1225
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,220
it was the worst time of my life.

1226
01:07:32,220 --> 01:07:34,320
It was when I was bullied every day.

1227
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:37,680
At that time, I was small in stature and shy.

1228

I also used to love to cry back then.

1229
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:42,530
Does "love to cry" mean crying often at that time?

1230
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:49,670
Back then, I cried every day. Perhaps it was also because I had difficulty expressing my emotions.

1231
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:55,800
Because my parents have high expectations of me every day. They wanted make me say that

a man should be strong and resilient,
never cry, and be a leader.

Especially male actors, because sometimes

they are taught to be strong

1239

They have been telling themselves this for many years, which resulted in

them being unable to connect with their inner feelings after becoming an actor.
