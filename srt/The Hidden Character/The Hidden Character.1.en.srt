So, that teacher said something like "why don't you try to do it better and make it as good as your pretty face", right? And that made you feel bad, right?

215
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:48,230

226

As a kid, I loved and enjoyed singing so much.

227
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:43,640
Whenever I got in the car with my dad, he would always turn on some music. And I grew fond of music, just like how my dad loves to listen to music.

228

So, I wanted to take a singing class, which was the starting point of taking on singing as my career.

229
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:52,630
Someone asked me whether I am certain about singing or if I am really pursuing this career path.

230
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,690
He told me that people are gay if they work as singers.

231
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,170
And back then, these kinds of words were openly spoken or thrown at others like normal things.

But is it really normal? How did you feel about it?

But the truth is, there is nothing close to that at all.

Right, there is nothing wrong with being gay, and it all depends on each person.

241
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,260

855
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,350
But in the end, it was like... it really wasn't who I am.

856
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:18,670
And it was all so awkward and pretentious. Turned out that I also disliked myself for trying to be that way.

857
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:22,450
-Have you ever been bullied? -I've never been bullied.

858
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:27,360
Let's be real here. All the things that you have said mean that you've been bullied this whole time.

859
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:30,860
But you were just trying to convince yourself that, "No, I've never been bullied. I'm not hurt at all. I'm fine."

860
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,070
-Aha. -But really, be honest. Did it not hurt you at all?

861
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:39,120
You were right. There were times when it did hurt. I was trying to be strong, just as you said, trying to be fierce and confident.

862
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,530
Actually, you don't have to pretend. Everyone has their tough times.

863
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:49,320
If it were me, I would try to do whatever makes me happy and is true to who I am, but without violating or harming others.

864
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:55,300
Because there are other people around you, too. Anyway, it all comes down to always respecting other people.

865
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:02,630
-Exactly. -If you are unsure or unable to determine whether an action is good or not, go with the classic approach of empathizing with others and trying to put yourself in their shoes.

866
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,650
-Right. -There's a saying, "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others."

867
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,850
And regarding this issue, I would also like Woody to join us and share his thoughts. Woody, could you please bring your chair and sit next to Max?

868
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:14,920
-I'm getting excited now. -Don't spill your own tea.

869
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,940
So, Woody, how did you get through it?

870
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,910
I started to have feelings for men when I was in 9th grade.

871
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,980
There was a friend of mine who sat next to me. He approached me and I just reciprocated his feelings.

872
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,910
But at that time, I still didn't understand what it was.

873
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:33,990
And later on, at one point, other friends started to sense it. So, I just backed away from him.

874
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,230
After that, I only talked to girls and played sports with other friends.

875
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,050
Until I was eventually in a relationship with him.

876
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:44,130
-So, you went back to date with that guy who used to have a feeling for you when you were in grade 9? -Right.

877
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,740
-So, you went back together again. -Right, we did.

878
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,060
However, at that time, I didn't come out. We hid everything.

879
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,920
-We didn't tell anyone. -Was it because you've been bullied before?

880
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:00,940
Yes, some friends in the group have made fun of me. We used to play soccer together.

881
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,320
That experience made me shut myself off and hide who I really was during that time.

882
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,810
I didn't admit or accept who I am, regardless of what that may be.

883
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:20,670
So, it means that you're one of those people who faced this kind of judgment and had been bullied when you were younger.

884
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,020
Am I right?

885
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:32,870
-But today, you've embraced it now. -Yes, I have.

886
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:35,130
-And do you feel happy about it? -I do.

887
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,060
I'm really content with it.

888
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,690
And in the end, how is it now with your parents?

889
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:53,990
They're okay with it and support me as long as it does not harm my life, take a toll on me, or affect my physical or mental health.

890
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,050
They are always willing to support me as long as I'm happy.

891
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:01,050
But I do have a bit of concern, though.

892
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:07,020
Because I am the kind of person who really values and prioritizes my family.

893
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,280
I try to take care of all the elders in my family.

894
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,730
And that has put pressure on me and raised my elders' expectations of me.

895
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:21,340
They gave me a ring and told me that it was for my future girlfriend.

896
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:26,450
They would ask when I was going to get married or introduce a girlfriend to the family.

897
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:30,770
-It's the big family's expectation. -Yeah, it's the family's expectation to keep the legacy. I think anyone with Chinese ethnicity and an extended family would understand.

898
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:31,920
Who has Chinese background here? Agree, right?

899
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,840
Right, it's the expectation from the whole family's lineage.

900
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:39,470
OK, then today, I'd like to give you this space to tell them something that you want to let them know.

901
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:44,730
Just tell them what you want to express to both your beloved immediate family and relatives too.

902
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:55,650
For my mom and dad, there is nothing much to say as we always understand each other really well.

903
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:59,170
-Are you going to cry? -No, I'm not. I won't cry.

904
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,810
We never have any conflict.

905
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:14,980
And to all the elders and relatives at home, including my aunties, uncles, in-laws, elder cousins, every one of you.

906
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:20,960
I'm trying my best to be the relative that you all expect me to be.

907
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,330
Even though there are things like...

908
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,910
when I got admitted to Chulalongkorn University

909
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:36,650
but couldn't finish the degree.

910
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:43,590
It was one of the things that I've let them down.

911
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:53,010
And there is also the issue that I'm attracted to men, not women.

912
00:59:54,370 --> 01:00:04,150
I just want them to know that no matter who I am or what I am, I still love them just the same.

913
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:15,600
-Hey, it's okay. -There, there, don't cry, bro.

914
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,220
Woody, I think you're so brave.

915
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,240
Woody, you are becoming an inspiration for many people on this planet.

916
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:27,500
Especially those in Asian cultures, we have a lot of fans who come from Asian cultures too, and it is very difficult for us Asians.

917
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,150
I think you're so brave about this. And the luckiest thing for you is you have such a lovely and supportive family.

918
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,350
Agree, right, Mile? Mile is about to cry now.

919
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,860
Mile is so immersed in your story.

920
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,330
This one has already cried.

921
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:44,540
I really found your story an inspirational one.

922
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:49,030
I admire you for being so authentically brave, Woody. The things that you've shared today are not wrong at all.

923
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,650
Woody, you're someone who I regard as a cool and interesting person.

924
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,850
So be proud of yourself. Right, Mile?

925
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,730
You're so dope, bro!

926
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,690
I'm also someone who is really sensitive when it comes to the topic of family. When I heard his story... I just couldn't hold back my emotions.

927
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,270
I just got all teared up and cried with him.

928
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:12,630
I felt that what he did was so meaningful.

934

Agree, right? The two of you who got the right answer, but too bad that no one voted for you. That's such a waste, isn't it?

935
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,940
- Who has the right answer? -JJ and I.

936

So unfortunate of you guys that you got the correct answer, but you couldn't trick your friends into voting for you.

937
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,290
But I still believe that you guys could do even better. It's just a game. Remember that it's a game.

This guy used to have a secret crush on one of his friends who lost their teeth.

947
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:26,430
So, he decided to pull out his own teeth to match that person.
