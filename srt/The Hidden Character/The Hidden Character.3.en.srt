991
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,150

993

994

997
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,520
I think everyone,

998
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,620
just like our first voter said.

999
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,190
Because our love

1000
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,840
to our parents

1001
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,040
is unconditional.

1007
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,920
-OK, JJ. -Because I sat next to him.

1008

I'll vote for Fuaiz.

1011
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,860
Fuaiz.

1012
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,730
Since he is so immersed in everyone's story.

1013
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,430
It didn't have to be his own call with his mom,

1014
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,310
but how he felt relatable with other people's stories.

1015
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,840
I think he don't even need words

1016
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,170
to express his feelings.

1017
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,400
when everyone

1018
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,330
called their mom, each of us has

1019
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,510
differently showed our love.

1020
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,750
But I think the person

1021
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,740
that is probably the most concerned

1022
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,100
about his mom

1023
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,120

1024
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,300
I think everyone here has

1025
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,990
their own way to express their love and affection.

1026
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:49,750
But if I have to pick one person,

1027
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,150
I must go with Max.

1028
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,530
Since Max was the first one to go,

1029
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,570
I gave it to him.

1030
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:55,990
Max?

1031
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:56,920
Because, you know,

1032
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,520
for people from different parts of the world

1033
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,370
to have a chance to express their love,

1034
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,490

1035

1038

1040

OK, I'll keep this in mind.

1052

the bond between my dad and me doesn't really exist at all.

1072

I had never had a father in my life.

Until...

1077
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,200
it became like a trauma in my heart

1078
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,460
that I wanted to have a dad too.

1079

1080

1081
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,440
Like I said, I never treat him as my family,

1082
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,690
and I rebel against him

1083
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,080
in many ways.

1084

1085

I observed his personal traits during our conversations over meals.

1469

I also asked him many questions,

1470
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,420
and he answered

1471
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,460
without hesitation.

1472
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,970
He has so little worry.

1473

From the beginning,

1476
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,540
he had a very strong personality, and that's why we chose him.

1477
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,570
However, there's always been a concern about him, which is his discipline.

1478
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:32,900
It's hard to say

1479

if he has met the 100% standard.

But what we know is, he has improved a lot.

there are so many more things about him,

1503
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,670
What caught my attention the most is that this kid used to lack confidence,

1504
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,120
and would shut himself from socializing with others. But now, he started to change.

00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:31,860
Yes.

1506

He improved so quickly and he's very sincere.

1507
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:37,280

Woody may seem like a simple character.

1516
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,470
He's like an audience.

1517

He is the listener among his friends.

1518

But this is also one type of characters.

1519
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,590
Whenever Woody talks about something,

1520
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,070
if you look into his eyes,

1521
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,490
you can see that he's so authentic with his words

1522
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,460
And what he has gone through

At first, I thought Perth was such a confident person.

1532
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,320
I remember that time we went to the concert together,

1533
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:39,020
I thought this guy was so cool.

1534
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:41,320
I thought that he was confident in himself like he love himself so much.

1535
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,360
People can't see anything from him apart from the fact he wants to win.

1536
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,620
The question I wanted to ask him earlier was, for example, when he was talking with his mom,

1537
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,310
he started feeling sad, and tried to

1538
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,410
hide his vulnerability and not to show it to others,

1539
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,770
which doesn't match our show's style.

1540
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,870
The problem is

1541
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,370
he didn't allow himself to sometimes be vulnerable,

1545
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:06,620
and didn't look around to enjoy the moment.

1546
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,480
Or he didn't focus on the friends around him at the moment,

1547
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,930
like he didn't enjoy living in the moment.

1548
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:11,180
So I think...

1549
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,280
it's such a shame for him.

Just do your best on behalf of me.

1630

Make sure you all can win this game.

1631

Of course you can nail it, right?

So I have to change my goal.

It may look a bit difficult.

1652

Because I don't know what the viewers are thinking.

if I have to be the one to leave,

And tell us why he did that and what his thoughts are today on his past.

1668
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,180
Well, I was born

1669
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,600

And I

used to be

1674

the participant of that kind of violence.

1675

did happen.

1677
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:31,920
One day, I lost control and let that emotion take control of me.

1678
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,570
And I want to tell

1679
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:34,700
all the adults

1680
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:36,170

And they will remember it till the day that they die.

It will become more and more violent.

But you know what?

1692
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:10,050
You can't use violence to fight against violence.

Yes.

whether they were true or made up.

01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,550
So, I would like to ask those

1728
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:45,480
who shared their stories today

1729
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:46,990
to clarify which parts are true

and which parts are made up.

1731

Then you should say sorry to your dad,

-for using him as a bait source. -I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, dad, I just wanted to win.

So, does that mean what you have said is true, right, Fuaiz?

1741
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,390
Is that true?

1742
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:12,930
Some parts of it are true,

1743
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,500
but some parts are fabricated.

1744

OK.

1745

Some are true and some are made up.

Who else here has made up their stories?

1749

but most of it is made-up.

1753

my dad is a soldier.

1755

my parents parted away since I was a child.

1757

So I had to go to

my dad's place during school break, that part is true.

1759

And the violence part

1760
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:49,680
is fake.

1761

I said I was slapped in the face, pushed my dad away, and ran into my room.

1762
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:53,920
This part was totally made up.

1763
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,300
I need to say sorry to my dad.

1764
01:05:55,930 --> 01:05:58,260
Anything that you made-up and may affect others' feelings,

1765
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,410
you should quickly apologize about it.

Now, I want to talk to Perth.

But when you're actually in the show,

During the training, I even used harsh words towards him.

1776
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:26,930
I told him that he shouldn't pretend to be confident.

1777
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:28,830
Because Perth has a lot of potential.

1778

When the show officially began,

I can see that he's been worrying too much.

1780
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:37,580
And you didn't want to express your vulnerability.

1781
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:40,260
It may be a good thing for some other shows.

1782

Hey, you gotta stay strong.

1783

in our company,

1785

Be On Cloud, what we look for

is someone who know that they can be sad.

1787
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,970
You can feel everything. If you love something you could also let us know as well.

1788
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:52,520
You can even cry, too

1789
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,620
And then just wipe your tears and get your spirit up again.

1790
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,600
For example, when all the friends want to comfort you with their hugs, you refused and said you don't want to cry.

1791
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:58,780
But you know, it's okay to cry.

1792
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,560
And I didn't say that crying is right or wrong.

1793
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:02,980
It's just that you haven't revealed

1794
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:06,170
your true hidden character

1795
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:07,690
that we believe is in you.

1796
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,750
For me,

1797
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,860
I'm so confident that if we're being ourselves

1798
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,100
without violating others,

1799
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:17,330
in the end, when we look back, even if we couldn't succeed in the entertainment industry,

1800
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:19,680
if it were me, I wouldn't regret a thing.

1801
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,590
I've never regretted for being myself.

1802
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,610
I've always been like this.

1803
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:26,780
Until I was like almost 29 or 30, I finally got the rol in Kinn ＆ Porsche.

1804
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:29,940
I'm happy about it, but if I didn't get the role, it wouldn't have been a big deal.

1805
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,960
I've never regretted anything, and I won't regret the moments I was turned down either.

1806
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,460
It goes the same with my real life.

1807
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,820
Perth, do you wanna say anything?

1808
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,870
Well, I want to talk about 2 of my friends first.

1809
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,240
OK.

1810
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,580
First of all, I always say that my only opponent in this show,

1811
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:42,510
the one I must overthrow is...

1812
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,230
Copper.

1813
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:44,770
When I look at him,

1814
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,960
well, like what I said that day,

1815
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,760
I said he has everything that I own, but better.

1816
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:52,420
[Copper]

1817
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:50,430
Whether it's the look, figure,

1818
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,310
talent, fanbase, etc.

1819
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,150
I used to think of Copper as

1820
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,400
my "Wall" that I had to break down.

1821
01:07:58,680 --> 01:07:59,970
Even when I actually moved in, and lived here,

1822
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,070
I still think of him as my "Wall".

1823
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:04,670
But I no longer viewed him as the "Wall"

1824
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:05,970
that I must overcome anymore.

1825
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,430
Now, I think he's more like the "Wall" that's been supporting me and taking care of me.

1826
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:10,810
That's what I want to say.

1827
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,010
As for the other one,

1828
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:15,600
when I said something like that, he then asked me who was my opponent now.

1829
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:16,870
And I said it's Max.

1830
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:18,970
Because I think, Max is someone with

1831
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:20,600
a lot of inner beauty in him.

1832
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,189
His passion.

1833
01:08:23,290 --> 01:08:26,880
His determination is no less than anyone else here.

1834
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,500
So I viewed him as my opponent.

1835
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,050
Like I said earlier, everything is just a game.

1836
01:08:34,029 --> 01:08:35,760
It's just a game.

1837
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:37,160
But, listen, bro, I love you.

1838
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,609
OK.

1839
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,050
Yep.

1840
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,420
But I want to say something to

1841
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,939
Mr. Perth from THC,

1842
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:46,430
that the person who voted for you to stay was Max.

1843
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:47,370
Really?

1844
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:49,810
Why did you vote for me?

1845
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,910
Because he's determined.

1846
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:52,180
[Max Chanachai Sawangnin 
IG:juxtmax]

1847
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,880
I don't want to see him

1848
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:55,430
to be disappointed, I guess.

1849
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:57,630
When I saw him

1850
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:01,410
I knew that he had high expectation for himself,

1851
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,080
and hoped to be among the TOP 5.

1852
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:05,609
So I didn't want him

1853
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:09,510
to leave so soon.

1854
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,109
Well, it doesn't have to be No.1,

1855
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:14,740
[Max]

1856
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,680
but at least, I want him to be able to

1857
01:09:16,210 --> 01:09:18,729
reach the point that he could feel satisfied to some extent.

1858
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:19,689
That's all.

1859
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:23,710
But I think it's good that we get to see his determination here.

1860
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:25,810
I believe from now on,

1861
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:28,040
Perth can surely be determined and use his power and talent in the right way.

1862
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,790
-Keep going! -Keep going!

1863
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,529
Our next episode...

1864
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,470
It will be Chapter 2.

1865
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:43,569
In Chapter 2, with ten of you,

1866
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,100
we'll go to the sea together.

1867
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:47,970
We'll go to the sea

1868
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,240
at Phang Nga.
(Phang Nga is a Southern province of Thailand, known for its beautiful sea)

1869
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,090
He's leaving.

1870
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:07,300
Are you gonna drink or not today?

1871
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:07,910
Yeah.

1872
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:09,370
If you want to drink, I will give you a toast.

1873
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,230
Do you really get what I mean?

1874
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,310
Understood. I got it.

1875
01:10:12,550 --> 01:10:13,770
I'm sad yet I understood it.

1876
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:19,080
I'm sorry that you gotta go.

1877
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:21,530
-Me too, I feel sorry as well. -Did you get my words?

1878
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:22,850
Whenever you get to see the show by yourself,

1879
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:24,010
you'll understand it.

1880
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,380
Pardon?

1881
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:29,610
Just wait and see the show then.

1882
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,060
You won't leave me deserted right?

1883
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:33,590
It depends on what you will be doing next.

1884
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,500
If you can do as I said,

1885
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,870
I will definitely not gonna abandon you.

1886
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,230
Let's say today is a turning point,

1887
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,370
and Perth will become a completely different kind of person.

1888
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,920
It's gonna be a revolution.

1889
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,430
Do you get it?

1890
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:47,160
Let me give you a super tight hug.

1891
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:47,870
Hey.

1892
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:48,990
See?

1893
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:49,930
This is hugging.

1894
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:51,510
If you wanna hug, then go for it!

1895
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:54,040
Apo taught me about that.

1896
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,890
If you want to hug, then fully embrace it.

1897
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:55,990
Don't feel shy or embarrassed.

1898
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:58,870
Just say what you wanna say, do what you wanna do.
If it's not good, I'll let you know.

1899
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:01,040
But if I want you to say something about me, what will you say?

1900
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,180
Well, I think people will love you so much.

1901
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:04,980
But first,

1902
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:06,810
you should learn to love yourself.

our new host of THC.

1907
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:24,310
Wow, it's a big surprise.

1908
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:25,740
The spy is our hidden character this time,

1909
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,330
he must do anything to not win this game.

1910
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:30,450
We don't need to know at all
what kind of game we're here for?

1911
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:31,250
Hide and seek?

1912
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,780
Nope, it's the freeze tag.

1913
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:34,480
We should be thinking about those who got no coins.

1914
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,270
You're right.

1915
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:37,400
-And that's Max.
-I think he seemed to be telling the truth when he's in that room.
