<i>[Special Interview with the Cat Taming Squad]</i>
<i>[What are the criteria for his secretary?]</i>

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,504
Actually, education and experience
are not the key points.

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,474
The important thing is

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:11,544
knowing how to pet a cat.

5
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,721
Excuse me, where should I sit?

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,391
Right here? Thank you.

7
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:27,927
<i>[Can you share some interview skills?]</i>

8
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:30,764
The Vice President is very nice.

9
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:35,335
To be honest, I wasn't very confident
during the interview,

10
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:37,170
but he kept encouraging me.

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,407
I originally thought I came here

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,674
to be his secretary.

13
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:43,777
<i>[Are you dissatisfied with your current job?]</i>

14
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,579
Dissatisfied? How could I be?

15
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,150
The General Manager is also very, very…

16
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,352
Excuse me, I have to take a call.

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,128
General Manager.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,260
Okay, yes.

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,728
I'll be right there.

20
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,530
Excuse me, I have to go.

I'm sorry, General Manager.

52
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:39,866
Usually, only when I have an interview,

53
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:42,702
do I cram for how to tie a tie online.

54
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:44,907
So…

55
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,171
Untie it.

56
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,367
Consider it as employee training.

57
00:07:57,367 --> 00:08:00,019
Watch closely. I will only do this once.

58
00:08:41,427 --> 00:08:42,729
What's the schedule for the afternoon?

59
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:44,931
Nothing, sir.

Let's go on a business trip.

61
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:52,005
A business trip? Where to?

62
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:54,540
Accompanying me for a meal. I'm hungry.

63
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,521
Hello, Boss.

64
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,557
Boss, where are we going next?

65
00:09:11,557 --> 00:09:12,925
Answer.

66
00:09:12,925 --> 00:09:14,560
Me?

67
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,695
What did you expect?

68
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:17,397
Finding a restaurant is the secretary's job.

69
00:09:18,564 --> 00:09:20,967
Then, General Manager,
what would you like to eat?

70
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:22,769
Anything is fine.

71
00:09:31,744 --> 00:09:34,914
Mister, please take me to this place.

72
00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:37,150
- Just call me Yang.
- Okay, Mr. Yang.

73
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,718
- Please.
- Thank you.

74
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:53,499
General Manager, sit.

75
00:09:57,704 --> 00:10:00,306
General Manager, I've ordered
two bowls of seafood porridge.

76
00:10:00,306 --> 00:10:01,874
Do you want any other side dishes?

77
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:05,178
Let's go. I don't dine in such places.

78
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:07,080
Such places?

79
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,815
Didn't you say anything was fine?

80
00:10:11,951 --> 00:10:13,920
Hot! Don't block the way.

81
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,563
Sorry.

82
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,794
General Manager, please have a seat.

83
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,336
General Manager,

84
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:33,606
the signature seafood porridge here
is really delicious.

85
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:34,907
I have checked online

86
00:10:34,907 --> 00:10:36,843
that an increased intake of seafood,

87
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,811
especially fish and shellfish
can help with insomnia.

88
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:41,781
Try it.

89
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:44,183
I don't know if it suits your taste.

90
00:11:21,788 --> 00:11:22,855
I…

91
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,092
I'm sorry, General Manager.

92
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,262
I didn't realize that this place
was too noisy and crowded,

93
00:11:29,262 --> 00:11:30,696
and you'd be uncomfortable.

94
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,498
Everything you said

95
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,901
in the office this morning was correct.

96
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,770
I didn't take down what you said,

97
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,006
nor did I find out about your
preferences in advance.

98
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:42,475
I'm very sorry for the inconvenience
and trouble I caused.

99
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:44,577
For rookies like you,

100
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:45,945
I didn't hold any hope.

101
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,815
I will work hard and learn from the ladies
in the Secretary's Office.

102
00:11:48,815 --> 00:11:51,684
I will strive to become
a capable assistant by your side.

103
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:57,690
Don't talk while eating. Sit down.

104
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:00,811
Yes.

105
00:12:03,296 --> 00:12:05,264
<i>But don't scare him away all at once.</i>

106
00:12:05,264 --> 00:12:06,966
<i>Maybe you will find out</i>

107
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:09,035
<i>he has other merits.</i>

108
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,171
Yao Shunyu,

109
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:19,979
your massage today

110
00:12:19,979 --> 00:12:21,113
was not bad.

111
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:25,451
Tell me, what else are you good at?

112
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:28,521
What else am I good at?

113
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,691
What am I good at?

114
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:35,061
I am very good at saving money.

115
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,596
Saving money?

116
00:12:36,596 --> 00:12:38,030
When I lived in a dormitory in college,

117
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,166
to save money, I set a rule for myself
that my daily food expenses

118
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,934
could not exceed a hundred bucks.

119
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:43,169
Only a hundred bucks?

120
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:45,872
Yes, a hundred for three meals.

121
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,306
At that time, our school cafeteria's buffet

122
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:49,642
offered a bowl of rice for ten bucks,
and you could eat as much as you wanted.

123
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:50,643
So every time I would pile up a super lot,

124
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:53,246
and then take it home and turn it
into fried rice or porridge the next day.

125
00:12:53,246 --> 00:12:55,147
At that time, the owner of the buffet

126
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:56,349
got to know me.

127
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,120
Thanks to that time,

128
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,923
I learned a lot of money-saving recipes.

129
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,092
Not only did I have to eat enough,
but I also had to eat healthily.

130
00:13:06,092 --> 00:13:07,460
I absolutely wouldn't ruin my body

131
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,028
just to save money.

132
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:12,331
My mom always said that health
is the greatest wealth.

133
00:13:12,331 --> 00:13:14,400
As long as we are healthy and happy every day,

134
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,202
we are rich.

135
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:18,471
Sorry.

136
00:13:18,471 --> 00:13:20,740
It's okay, go on.

137
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,342
Alright, let me tell you,

138
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:24,477
when I was in college,

139
00:13:24,477 --> 00:13:27,914
I really tried to eat only
white toast for a whole week.

140
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:29,115
Although it was very painful,

141
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:30,383
I didn't have money at that time.

142
00:13:36,689 --> 00:13:38,658
Here. Just here is fine.

143
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,160
General Manager, this is my home.

144
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,495
Just let me off here.

145
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:43,963
You should go home and rest early.

146
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:45,998
Here?

147
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,036
It's raining. Let me take you to the door.

148
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,071
Boss, there is construction at the alley.

149
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,272
I don't think the car can go in.

150
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:56,042
It's okay. I can walk in by myself.

151
00:13:56,042 --> 00:13:57,243
There's an umbrella at your feet.

152
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:58,377
Okay, thank you.

153
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:07,086
Thank you, Mr. Yang. Goodbye, General Manager.

154
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:14,961
- You go back first.
- Yes.

155
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,360
Do you want it?

156
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:51,831
General Manager, what are you doing here?

157
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:54,600
You didn't go straight home, just for this?

158
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:56,669
No.

159
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:58,571
You didn't have enough just now?

160
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,548
It's not yet off-duty time.

161
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:11,534
It is still considered a business trip now.

162
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:13,753
The meal is on me.

163
00:15:14,353 --> 00:15:16,589
It's okay. There's no need.

164
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,291
You kept staring at it. Don't you want it?

165
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,899
Thank you.

166
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,501
This is enough for me.

167
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:33,539
This is my secret base.

168
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:40,246
Let me tell you, the owner
of this bakery is super nice.

169
00:15:40,246 --> 00:15:42,314
She would always leave the unsold toast for me.

170
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,886
There was also a bakery

171
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:48,554
next to our school before.

172
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:49,889
Their owner was also very nice.

173
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,023
They would also leave the unsold toast

174
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:52,725
or the edges of the toast for me.

175
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:58,297
Alright, here's another tip.

176
00:15:58,297 --> 00:15:59,932
As long as the toast is frozen,

177
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:02,101
you can take it out and toast it when you want,

178
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:04,203
and it will be very soft.

179
00:16:04,203 --> 00:16:05,337
For the edges of the toast,

180
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,242
don't underestimate them, with a little work,

181
00:16:10,242 --> 00:16:12,478
they can turn into delicious snacks.

182
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,350
Prepare my breakfast tomorrow.

183
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:22,388
General Manager, do you want
to eat the breakfast I make?

184
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:25,858
Didn't we agree to start
with what you are good at?

185
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:28,694
Today's massage, passed.

186
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:32,431
I look forward to tomorrow's toast.

187
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:36,252
Thank you, General Manager.
I will definitely work hard.

188
00:16:36,252 --> 00:16:37,670
Goodbye, General Manager.

189
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:56,021
General Manager, where are you going?

190
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,325
I happen to have a friend nearby,

191
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:00,793
so I will go and say hello.

192
00:17:00,793 --> 00:17:02,795
It's the same road. Boring.

193
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,180
It seems a bit difficult for you
to keep up with me with those short legs.

194
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,516
I can jog.

195
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:33,826
General Manager, my home is nearby.

196
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:35,761
I will go now.

197
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,597
General Manager, hold on.

198
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:40,683
You dislike me?

199
00:17:40,683 --> 00:17:42,301
How dare I?

200
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:46,238
General Manager,

201
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,040
I think you must be lost.

202
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:50,709
Your old friend shouldn't be living there.

203
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,044
<i>Old friend?</i>

204
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:53,078
Do you want to give him a call

205
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:54,547
and ask for the correct address?

206
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:55,781
<i>What correct address?</i>

207
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,818
Or you can give me his number
and I will call for you.

208
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,387
<i>Huh? A call?</i>

209
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:06,725
I just had a full meal
and wanted to take a walk, that's all.

210
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,162
Goodbye, General Manager.

211
00:18:15,134 --> 00:18:18,237
Directly saying the General Manager got lost,

212
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:20,506
he must have felt embarrassed.

213
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:23,826
Yao Shunyu,

214
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:26,812
next time, remember to be subtle.

215
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:31,684
Be subtle.

216
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,766
<i>Next time if you can't sleep,
don't take medicine.</i>

217
00:19:53,766 --> 00:19:55,968
Give it to me.

218
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:57,269
Just once.

219
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,607
<i>Try some exercise,</i>

220
00:20:04,877 --> 00:20:07,079
<i>and drink some hot milk with sugar.</i>

221
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,285
<i>Who is he? Why should I listen to him?</i>

222
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:16,622
<i>What I do and how I do things</i>

223
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:17,823
<i>have nothing to do with him.</i>

224
00:20:33,372 --> 00:20:35,307
<i>How was work today?</i>

225
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:37,993
<i>Are you tired, Shunyu?</i>

226
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:39,912
I'm not, Mom.

227
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:42,715
But to be honest,

228
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:45,117
I was really scared of the General Manager
at the beginning.

229
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:48,587
But I believe it will get better and better.

230
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:51,557
<i>Is the General Manager
difficult to get along with?</i>

231
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,827
At the beginning,

232
00:20:54,827 --> 00:20:56,628
he was really terrifying.

233
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,599
But after getting along for a while,
I found out

234
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,370
the General Manager actually had a soft side.

235
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,340
Maybe no one has discovered it yet.

236
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,848
What are these? Are they for children?

237
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:52,256
I will take them to the Secretary's Office.

238
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,824
Where are you now?

239
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:55,012
If you don't come, I will be swallowed.

240
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:58,240
We have to undertake
the task of ruining blind dates.

241
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,424
I'm a man.

242
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,657
I really can't do it.

243
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,017
Wait.

244
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:08,472
Don't go, you are mine.

245
00:22:08,472 --> 00:22:15,260
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

246
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:23,197
<i>♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫</i>

247
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:30,386
<i>♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫</i>

248
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:37,675
<i>♫ When will I ever learn ♫</i>

249
00:22:37,675 --> 00:22:41,860
<i>♫ A future that's further than forever ♫</i>

250
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,411
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

251
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:49,086
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

252
00:22:49,086 --> 00:22:53,011
<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>

253
00:22:53,011 --> 00:22:56,637
<i>♫ Crossing mountains and rivers in memories ♫</i>

254
00:22:56,637 --> 00:23:02,610
<i>♫ All my longings for you ♫</i>

255
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:08,527
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>
<i>♫ And that childish face ♫</i>
