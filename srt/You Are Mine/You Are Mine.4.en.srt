1
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,374
Sorry.

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,009
These are all from the ladies.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,678
They're all very nice to me
and give me things to eat every day.

4
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:13,880
Right, what was the question for today?

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,615
As a secretary to the General Manager,

6
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:17,384
of course, I have to shield the boss.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,686
Wait a moment.

8
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,954
is there a risk?

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,390
Is it a life-threatening risk?

10
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,557
No,

11
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,992
my mom will worry.

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:31,231
Does the company provide
insurance for employees?

13
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,632
It should, right?

14
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,267
How much is insured? What is the content of it?

15
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,736
How much is the compensation amount?
How do we compensate?

16
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,440
Do you think my secretary

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,908
would risk his life to protect me?

18
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,743
What kind of assumption is this?

19
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:45,378
Who came up with these questions?

20
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,347
Who wrote these questions exactly?

21
00:00:48,576 --> 00:00:50,829
<i>[ROUND 4]</i>
<i>[When I'm most scared, that person appears]</i>

22
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>♫ I like you, and I sing for you ♫</i>

23
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>♫ Guess which line holds the pass code ♫</i>

00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:04,988

00:01:07,456 --> 00:01:14,592

00:01:18,755 --> 00:01:24,710
<i>♫ You're my destined angel ♫</i>

28
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:28,614
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>

29
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,458
Now is a critical time for the General Manager.

30
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,992
As his secretaries, we should be

31
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,427
a good support team for the boss.

32
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,997
- Shunyu.
- Yes.

33
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,666
When you're with the General Manager,

34
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,534
try to share his burdens.

35
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,104
Yes, I will.

36
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,744
Why are you waiting for me
down here when it's so hot?

37
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,480
You haven't been sleeping much

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,981
for the company's platform anniversary,

39
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,050
yet you still find time
to come down and exercise.

40
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,652
How can I comfortably stay in the office
with the AC on all by myself?

41
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,023
Isn't that the pair of pants you wanted?

42
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,825
- Go ask about it.
- I don't want to, you go.

43
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,227
Excuse me…

44
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,129
Sorry, do you need anything?

45
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,431
Sorry, I wanted to ask
about the pants he's wearing,

46
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,999
because my boyfriend he…

47
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,868
- Do you want to buy it for your boyfriend?
- Yes.

48
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,703
Here, take a look.

49
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,739
For our company's platform anniversary,

50
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,075
this pair is the hottest item,
shaping and aerodynamic pants.

51
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,510
I happen to have two DMs here.

52
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,678
You can take a look.

53
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,014
Thank you.

54
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,084
How about it? Shows a great figure, right?

55
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,619
It's really nice.

56
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,355
It uses German imported
seamless machine design,

57
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,389
one piece formation.

58
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,391
In terms of stretchability,

59
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,592
shaping power, fitness, or comfort,

60
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,561
it all far surpasses other brands.

61
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:45,365
The new intelligent aerodynamic yarn

62
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,133
automatically senses body temperature,

63
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,302
opens air holes, and releases heat.

64
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,570
Most importantly,

65
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,640
it has both men's and women's styles.

66
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,375
Look at this modern two-piece cut.

67
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,478
It looks good in any color combination.

68
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,646
More importantly,

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,448
it's sold in both online and offline stores.

70
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,084
Baby, let's go buy them now.

71
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,252
Okay, let's go.

72
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,023
How was that?

73
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,157
I remembered it very well, right?

74
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,959
Do you want to switch
to the Promotion Department?

75
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,060
You remembered it so clearly.

76
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,996
No, I happened to glance at the DM.

77
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,299
Oh, my DM.

78
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,468
As long as you've checked it.

79
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,471
To reward you for being so diligent,

80
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,040
tonight,

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,141
OT with extra dishes.

82
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,848
<i>[One Week Later]</i>

83
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,052
General Manager,

84
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,688
here are the documents you wanted.

85
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,123
Go home now.

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,527
I don't want to be accused
of abusing employees,

87
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,263
so please go home now.

88
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,565
Don't worry, General Manager,

89
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm in great health. No need to worry.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,434
Who told you I'm worried?

91
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,971
Have you ever thought about how much damage
it would cause the company

92
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,806
if by any chance the germs were to infect me?

93
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,709
I'm sorry, General Manager.

94
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,044
I didn't think it through.

95
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,312
So please, right now, immediately…

96
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,413
That's right.

97
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,649
I'll put on the mask right now.

98
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,433
Don't worry, General Manager.

99
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,038
I definitely won't infect you.

100
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,008
So considerate.

101
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,084
What's next on the schedule?

102
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,321
Next, we're going to a meeting
at Director Chen's company.

103
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,428
You said you wanted to share the workload,

104
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,729
but you can't stand
working overtime for a week.

105
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,968
General Manager,

106
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,770
I'm fine.

107
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,540
First, put on the mask.

108
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,510
You're not going to a meeting.

109
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,713
You're dragging everyone down to catch a cold.

110
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,314
Forget it, just go home.

111
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,817
General Manager, it's just a minor cold.

112
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,151
It was an order.

113
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,054
I will have the General Secretary accompany me
to Director Chen's meeting.

114
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,792
Get in.

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,468
Get in.

116
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,714
Take him home directly.

117
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,816
Yes.

118
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,785
Remember to buy him a bowl
of hot porridge on the way.

119
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,848
Yes.

120
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,389
Call me when you get home.

121
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,060
Okay, I'll leave first.

122
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,576
Where is he?

123
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,647
He didn't even close the door.

124
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,640
<i>[Where are you?
I told you to rest, not ignore me.]</i>

125
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,946
Unread and no reply.

126
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,548
Getting bolder, huh?

127
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,026
- General Manager.
- Lisa.

128
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,828
Is Yao in the Secretary's Office now?

129
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,162
I don't see him.

130
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,564
He's not working in there?

131
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,201
Did he take a leave today?

132
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,403
General Manager,
Yao Shunyu didn't take leave today.

133
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,104
Shall we call and check on him?

134
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:56,476
No need, he's been working hard these days.

135
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,710
Let him rest well.

136
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,581
He had a bit of a cold yesterday.

137
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,983
Handle his work for him.

138
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,200
Yang, where are you?

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,302
Hi, Boss, I'm eating out.

140
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:24,804
How was Yao's condition

141
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,005
when he got home yesterday?

142
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,541
As the car couldn't get into the alley,

143
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,076
I only took Mr. Yao to the alley entrance.

144
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,777
I told you to take him home.

145
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:33,212
But you only took him to the alley.

146
00:08:34,176 --> 00:08:35,283
I'm sorry, General Manager.

147
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,817
Yesterday, when I got back to the car
after buying the porridge, Mr. Yao...

148
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,600
Call Yao Shunyu.

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,335
Call him until he picks up.

150
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:58,571
Send me his home address

151
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,139
- and his family's phone number.
- Yes.

152
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,688
Hello.

153
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,744
General Manager.

154
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,579
Do you want to take this call?

155
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,654
I warn you.

156
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,322
The General Manager of Xia Shi Group,

157
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,824
Xia Shangzhou is now in my hands.

158
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,126
If you dare to call the police, it's over.

159
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,429
I demand a ransom of a hundred million.

160
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,599
Otherwise, wait to collect the body.

161
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,733
You've got it wrong.

162
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,101
I'm really not Xia Shang...

163
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,704
I'm warning you, don't hurt him.

164
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,206
That voice…

165
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,575
It was Shunyu.

166
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
He's been kidnapped.

167
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,411
Quickly, call the police.

168
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,313
We can't call the police. If we do, it's over.

169
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,715
If the kidnappers find out
they got the wrong person,

170
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,717
- will they kill him?
- Shut up.

171
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,953
Calm down first.

172
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,021
- Lisa.
- Yes.

173
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,557
Is Yao Shunyu's phone company issued?

174
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,559
Yes.

175
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,228
Right, we can track his phone's location.

176
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,366
I know where he is now.

177
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,467
I'm heading over there right now.

178
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,604
- Call the police.
- Wait, it's dangerous for you to go alone.

179
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,641
Hurry up and call the police.

180
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,915
Don't.

181
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,136
What are you doing?

182
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,389
What are you doing, young man?

183
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,105
No, you've got it all wrong, sir.

184
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,740
I'm not General Manager Xia Shangzhou.

185
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,742
I'm his secretary, Yao Shunyu.

186
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,977
Listen, people like you,

187
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,312
all of them

188
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,847
say they're not the one who's been kidnapped.

189
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,782
You even want to drag your employees into this.

190
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,451
How shameless.

191
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,553
No, sir, I'm telling the truth.

192
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,389
Really, I can prove it.

193
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,192
Take a look in my pocket.

194
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,761
There's my work ID.

195
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,763
It has my name and photo on it.

196
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,031
My name is Yao Shunyu.

197
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,403
Sorry.

198
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,871
Oh, it tickles.

199
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,006
Sorry.

200
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,976
I'm telling you, don't try any tricks.

201
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,414
Yao Shunyu.

202
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,352
You're not Xia Shangzhou?

203
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,021
I'm really not Xia Shangzhou.

204
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,190
Really, sir, if you don't believe me,

205
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,992
you can look it up.

206
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,783
How did I grab the wrong person?

207
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,951
I…

208
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,890
Why am I so unlucky?

209
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,933
Sir.

210
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,267
Are you okay?

211
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,139
Just two days ago, I received this urgent job.

212
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:24,043
My boss just gave me your company's address,
license plate number,

213
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,345
and a photo, that's all.

214
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,680
And how much did he give me?

215
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,249
100,000. I did all this for 100,000.

216
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,283
I'm really...

217
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,487
Lele, Daddy is useless.

218
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,224
Daddy doesn't have a job.

219
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,660
I can't make money
to take you to the doctor, Lele.

220
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,762
Hey, wait a minute.

221
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,463
Sir, go back, that's the photo.

222
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:46,098
Yes, look, that's me.

223
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,768
The one in the black suit next to me is him.

224
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,771
- It's you!
- No, it's not.

225
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,741
Why on earth would a General Manager
send a secretary into the car?

226
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,976
You made me misunderstand.

227
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,210
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,212
Why am I so unlucky?

229
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,652
Alright, since it's a misunderstanding,

230
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,653
Sir…

231
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,501
Since your General Manager values you,

232
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,270
his little secretary,

233
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:26,739
well,

234
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,242
would he be willing to pay a little more money?

235
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,513
Value?

236
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,584
Sir, this is a big misunderstanding.

237
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,087
Our General Manager despises me.

238
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,391
He always calls me clumsy.

239
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,926
If I get one thing wrong,

240
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,894
he tells me to stand
next to the plant in the office.

241
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:49,929
Just stand there.

242
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,199
He says all I need to do is breathe.

243
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:59,171
He absolutely wouldn't pay a penny for me.

244
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,377
He might even hope that you would

245
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,480
kill me on the spot.

246
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,784
I'm done for.

247
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,525
Sir.

248
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,493
Before you end my life,

249
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,029
could you give me something to eat first?

250
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,564
I'm so hungry.

251
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,137
Listen, in our line of work,

252
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,540
it's long hours and high risk.

253
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,841
The job is unstable,

254
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,277
and we have to pay for gas and lunch money.

255
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,678
There are no benefits at all.

256
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,887
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,991
Here.

258
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,103
I don't know what it's stained with.

259
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:05,571
The more I scrub, the dirtier it gets.

260
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,624
Sorry.

261
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,511
Maybe all bosses are like that.

262
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,051
Actually, it's also tough for delivery staff.

263
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,552
Once he glances over,

264
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,887
I have to stand at attention

265
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:23,222
and wait to be struck by lightning.

266
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,190
This week I've been tormented

267
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,026
into sleeping only three hours a day.

268
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,260
I caught a cold,

269
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,428
and I also…

270
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:31,897
have a fever.

271
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:33,065
Right,

272
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,366
It's tough to work in a big company.

273
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,601
I know.

274
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,937
Yeah. I'm doing this so that my parents
can retire early.

275
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,271
I wouldn't put it up with this otherwise.

276
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:44,476
If it wasn't for my Lele,

277
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,812
I wouldn't be doing this.

278
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,548
Lele,

279
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,650
Dad is really useless.

280
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,859
Anyway, since it's a misunderstanding,

281
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,896
please let me go.

282
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,134
Anyway, the General Manager wasn't caught,
and the company might think

283
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,936
you were just making a prank call.

284
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,908
I promise…

285
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,376
Be careful.

286
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,078
I absolutely won't
call the police after I go back,

287
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,946
and I won't mention it to anyone.

288
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:26,919
You see, we met because of fate.

289
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,688
Why don't we become friends?

290
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,257
I'll treat you and Lele
to a big meal another day.

291
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,312
How about it?

292
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,300
I'll order the most expensive.

293
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,071
Can we really be friends?

294
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,941
Of course, we both value our families.

295
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,242
We'll definitely get along.

296
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,524
Come a little closer.

297
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,730
General Manager.

298
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,865
Stop hitting him.

299
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,952
General Manager.

300
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,268
Are you alright?

301
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,936
I'm fine.

302
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,944
What happened?

303
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,507
It's just a stain by accident.

304
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,108
- Are you hurt anywhere else?
- No.

305
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,146
- What's wrong?
- I sprained my foot.

306
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,149
I'm glad you're okay.

307
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,392
That's good.

308
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,492
<i>He came to rescue me.</i>

309
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,962
<i>He rushed here to save me.</i>

310
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:46,965
<i>Why?</i>

311
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,005
General Manager,

312
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,807
can you please let this go?

313
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,442
Ask the police to let Mr. Han go.

314
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,676
I'm really okay.

315
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,378
You call him Mister?

316
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,913
He did this to you and you call him a Mister?

317
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:01,952
<i>[Taipei City Public Security Bureau
Criminal Investigation Vehicle]</i>

318
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,950
Anyone who dares to hurt you

319
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,618
must pay the price.

320
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,388
General Manager.

321
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:14,927
Get in the car.

322
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,395
General Manager, I'm really fine.

323
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,429
Get in.

324
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:23,469
Your feet.

325
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,389
No.

326
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,527
Let go of me.

327
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,168
It's okay now.

328
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:05,771
Don't be afraid.

329
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,939
I'm here.

330
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,632
Don't be afraid.

331
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,160
You're okay now.

332
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,624
I'm here.

333
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,088
Don't be afraid.

334
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,264
I'm here.

335
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,496
Don't be afraid.

336
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,896
I'm here.

337
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,192
Don't be afraid.

338
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,296
It's okay now.

339
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,398
You're awake.

340
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,168
Good, your fever is gone.

341
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,040
General Manager.

342
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,209
Where am I?

343
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:18,510
Don't worry.

344
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,778
You're in my home.

345
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,581
I'm sorry, General Manager.

346
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,750
I've caused you trouble again.

347
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,419
- I'll leave right now.
- It's two o'clock at midnight.

348
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,455
I can't possibly let you take a cab home alone.

349
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,094
Or…

350
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,434
<i>I made it so obvious.</i>

351
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,802
<i>Would he be so dumb not to see it?</i>

352
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:18,670
Am I heavy?

353
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,839
Do you ever feel like our distance

354
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,307
is too close?

355
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,775
Here we go. Get ready, everyone.

356
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,110
Look at each other.

357
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,545
<i>So this is how it feels</i>

358
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,946
<i>for a mouse to be stared by a cat.</i>

359
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,614
It's better to keep a distance
from your employees.

360
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,949
What if…

361
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,050
I think it's okay?

362
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:40,379
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

363
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:48,316
<i>♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫</i>

364
00:22:48,316 --> 00:22:55,505
<i>♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫</i>

365
00:22:55,505 --> 00:23:02,794
<i>♫ When will I ever learn ♫</i>

366
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:06,979
<i>♫ A future that's further than forever ♫</i>

367
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:10,530
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

368
00:23:10,533 --> 00:23:14,205
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

369
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:18,130
<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>

370
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:21,756
<i>♫ Crossing mountains and rivers in memories ♫</i>

371
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:27,729
<i>♫ All my longings for you ♫</i>

372
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:33,646
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>
<i>♫ And that childish face ♫</i>
