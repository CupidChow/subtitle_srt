Hello everyone, my name is Yao Shunyu.

I look forward to working with you.

00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,809
Welcome.

14
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:28,348
You were initially interviewed
by Vice President Li from the Sales Department,

15
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,517
but I'm in charge of the Secretary's Office.

16
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,851
You can call me Lisa.

17
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,021
Okay, hello Miss Lisa. Hello everyone.

18
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,457
Yes, I'm finally not the newbie anymore.

19
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,262
From today, you will be closely
working with the General Manager.

20
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,364
Closely?

21
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,533
I'm still inexperienced.

22
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,469
Can I really handle such an important position?

23
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,172
Don't worry.

24
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,974
Later, you will find that experienced or not,

25
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,910
the General Manager treats everyone

26
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,646
equally.

27

I'm sorry, General Manager.

Wait, but I just arrived
and I don't know anything yet.

44
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,533
Just write down
what the General Manager says later.

00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,701
Remember them well, understand?

46
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:55,735
- That's it. Go.
- But…

47
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,503
Listen to me, practice makes perfect.

00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,806
It's going to happen anyway.
Just get it over with.

I mean, build your trust.

50
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,976
The General Manager doesn't like to wait.
Hurry up and get in.

51
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,611
- Hurry.
- But I don't know anything.

52
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,113
Take care. I'll wait for you here.

53
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,949

Don't give me a mournful face.

00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,488
Get out.

00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,801
Are you okay, baby?

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:29,969
What did the General Manager just say?

59
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:34,407
I can't stand it anymore.

60
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,277
What on earth did he say?

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,311
Why are you crying like this?

62
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,946
What's wrong? Don't cry.

63
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,816
What's the matter?

64
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,219
The General Manager said I didn't
put the documents at the right angle,

65
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:49,055
and it interfered with his
office layout and efficiency.

66
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:53,693
He wants me to bring a protractor
the next time I deliver documents.

67
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,298
Last week the General Manager asked us both

68
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,166
for the phone number of Manager Chen
from the Sales Department,

69
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,968
and we didn't memorize it within ten seconds.

70
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,236
He went angry and yelled at us,

71
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,104
"Why didn't you memorize it?"

72
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,840
Since then, the General Manager
doesn't call me by my name.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,742
He calls me Goldfish number one.

74
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,644
And I'm Goldfish number two.

75
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,748
The General Manager calls me Maria.
Is it better?

76
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,017
It sounds terrible.

77
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:23,022
We're miserable. What can we do?

78
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,424
Why did you call me over?

79
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,727
Why does everyone look so down?

80
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:30,930
Vice President, I have a question.

81
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,299
Does the General Manager hate women?

82
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:37,470
Or does he just hate us?

83
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:39,706
No matter what we do,

84
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,107
the General Manager is always unsatisfied.

85
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:43,409
I've been scolded so much that I want to quit.

86
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,845
Can I transfer to your department?

87
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,080
Vice President, you're the best.

88
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,015
No, if anyone transfers, it should be me first.

89
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,050
The General Manager
has no compassion for women.

90
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,053
You see, I'm nearly bald from stress.

91
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,723
Same here, I'm almost depressed.

92
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,658
Vice President, I've lost weight.

93
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,477
Look at my head.

94
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:03,663
Alright.

95
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,664
Go back to the office.

96
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,832
Don't you have work to do?

97
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:10,837
Even Miss Lisa scolds us.

98
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,910
Dear Vice President,

99
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:21,013
could you talk to
our General Manager again, please?

100
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,182
I know he doesn't mean any harm.

101
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,450
But girls, you know,

102
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,286
we are more sensitive.

103
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,553
I don't want to spend more time

104
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,889
convincing those who want to quit.

105
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,224
It's exhausting.

106
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:37,263
And what if I can't hold on much longer?

107
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,966
You couldn't talk to him, so you came to me.

108
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,734
Is this a threat?

109
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,636
How dare I?

110
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,638
I'm asking for help.

111
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,542
We should hire a male secretary.

112
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,444
Boys, you know, we are tougher.

113
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,748
Just choose someone obedient,
who can stand the criticism and hard work.

114
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,252
But the President insists that only women
can be secretaries.

115
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,787
And she must interview them personally.

116
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,323
It makes it seem like my office

117
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:06,959
is the General Manager's harem.

118
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,462
The harem? I think it's
more like a storage room.

119
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,165
Seriously.

120
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,267
How can we hide this from the President?

121
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,802
What if she finds out?

122
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,904
You called me over
to figure this out, didn't you?

123
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,342
Let's recruit a secretary assistant
under the guise of the Secretary's Office.

124
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,478
If the President asks,

125
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:27,380
just say the assistant is for me.

126
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,465
How's that?

127
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:30,166
I've got your back, right?

128
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,852
You're truly one of the best in this company.

129
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:33,886
I'll leave it to you.

130
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,822
Alright, I'll handle it.

131
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,400

I'm sorry, General Manager, I…

156
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,350

157
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,591
I'm so sorry.

158
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,926
I'm really sorry

00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,795
I'll wash this shirt

The E-commerce Expo on Thursday.

Which company were you in as a secretary?

178

I've never been a secretary before.

Before I graduated from university,
I helped out at my family's breakfast shop.

When did this place become a kindergarten?

181
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,520
Do you need me to start teaching you
from phonetic symbols?

182
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,205
No.

183
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,123
What is my schedule today?

184
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,194
I'll ask right now.

185
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,792
Stop. Did I tell you to leave?

186
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:39,165
No.

187
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,833
Am I so scary?

188
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,401
Everyone who walks into my office

189
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,769
looks like they've descended into hell.

190
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,172
I didn't let you leave.

191
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,807
You're not going anywhere.

192
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,280
Do you have a minute?

193
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,936
Get out.

194
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,493
- Hello, Vice President.
- Hello.

195
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,363
Tell Lisa

196
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,332
to not let this person into my office again.

197
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,967
No can do.

198
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,936
I hired him.

199
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:18,237
What do you mean?

200
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,573
Your group of secretaries came to me in tears,

201
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,841
saying they didn't know what to do

202
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,743
to stop our General Manager

203
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,945
from acting like he's swallowed
dynamite every day.

204
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,614
So, I suggested bringing in a male secretary.

205
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,216
I don't mind if it's a man. What I mind is…

206
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,650
He's new.

207
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,152
The Secretary's Office will train him.

208
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,787
Young people learn fast.

209
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,022
Besides, we've signed a contract,

210
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,791
so you have to at least give him

211
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,609
a three-month probation period.

212
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:41,660
Three months.

213
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,563
Just use the new secretary for now.

214
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,632
At least I found you a man

215
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,368
who can stand up to your scolding and pressure.

216
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:51,303
And I know,

217
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,539
every time you scold those secretaries,

218
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,274
you feel quite guilty.

219
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,344
But don't scare him away all at once.

220
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:00,079
Maybe you'll find out

221
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,214
he has other merits.

222
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,585
- If he causes…
- If he causes the company any loss,

223
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,855
I'll just fire him, right?

224
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,924
It's lunchtime. Let's eat.

225
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,027
I'm not hungry.

226
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,632
What's the matter? Headache again?

227
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,336
Do you want me to find you a new doctor?

228
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,436
No.

229
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,805
I'll be fine after some rest.

230
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,209
Remember to eat.

231
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,841
<i>Why did you say you could do it?</i>

232
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,444
What are your professional skills?

233
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,415
I'm good at organizing and money management.
I have strong planning skills.

234
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,550
I'm familiar with the usage
of various pipes and tools.

235
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,918
How so?

236
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,788
I learned these skills to save money.

237
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,291
If your boss is difficult and annoying,

238
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,492
how would you handle it?

239
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,963
I will try to meet the boss's demands
under the right circumstances.

240
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,964
What if it's unreasonable?

241
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,565
I'll speak up bravely and try to persuade them.

242
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,400
You have no secretarial experience.
Why should I hire you?

243
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,436
I've been helping out in my family's
breakfast shop since junior high.

244
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,037
Dealing with miscellaneous tasks
and picky customers there

245
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,106
would be an excellent rehearsal
for being a secretary.

246
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,409
Great. I like your confidence.

247
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,911
I believe you can do it.

248
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,145
I believe I can.

249
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,981
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

250
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,115
You can do it.

251
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,151
I can do it.

252
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,854
<i>He clearly can't.</i>

253
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:55,561
Did Vice President Huiwang lie to me?

254
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,837
Miss Sofia,

255
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,406
I don't think

256
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,010
the General Manager likes me.

257
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:17,300
It's just his temper,

258
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,884
but it's not aimed at you.

259
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,786
It's aimed

260
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,522
at everyone.

261
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:28,127
If it weren't for the high salary
and good benefits of this job,

262
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,130
I probably couldn't stay either.

263
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,768
But,

264
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,205
I upset him on my first day here.

265
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,374
The General Manager was really angry…

266
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,877
No, no, no.

267
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:49,815
You have to believe that
you'll gradually get the hang of it.

268
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,183
I told you.

269
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:54,153
Practice makes what?

270
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,888
- Perfect.
- Perfect, right?

271
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,424
We've all been through this.

272
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,504
Keep going.

273
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,580
<i>She's right.</i>

274
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,816
<i>It's not easy to get into
such a well-compensated company.</i>

275
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:10,169
<i>Since I'm here to work and earn money,</i>

276
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,871
<i>what does it matter
if I get scolded for not doing well?</i>

277
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:13,939
Miss,

278
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:17,643
please tell me
the General Manager's preferences

279
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,012
and teach me how to be a good secretary.

280
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,266
Okay.

281
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:28,787
Great. Come on.

282
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,624
Read this when you get home.

283
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:37,229

Sorry, Vice President.

289
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,428
Shunyu, how was your first day at work?

290
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,663
Your General Manager was quite something,
wasn't he?

291
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,633
It's because I wasn't good enough.

292
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,001
I will continue to work hard

293
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,404
and earn more trust from the General Manager.

294
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,273
I like your attitude.

295
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,776
Listen, although the General Manager
has a bad temper,

296
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,144
he's not a bad person at heart.

297
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,445
As long as the employees perform well,

298
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,946
he will definitely reward generously.

299
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,782
It's like petting a cat.

300
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,483
Just stroke along its fur.

301
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:32,518
Meow.

302
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,919
Petting a cat.

303
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,055
Does the General Manager have a cat?

304
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,623
Do I need to help take care of it?

305
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,002
I have high hopes for you.

Okay.

General Manager, would you like
sparkling water or still water?

323

Still.

324
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:42,621
Do you want it warm, cold, or hot?

325
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,622
Warm.

326
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,290
Okay, would you like it at 45 degrees,

327
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,559
or 60 degrees, or 70 degrees?

328
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:48,994
Whatever.

329
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,563
I just want a cup of normal warm water.

330
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:52,564
Is it that hard to understand?

331
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,756
General Manager, taking too much medicine
is not good for your health.

334
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,391
It can easily have side effects.

335

My mom ruined her health that way.

336
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:22,761
Get out.

00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,634
you have a headache, right?

339
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:29,935
I've learned acupressure massage.

340
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,270
It's very effective.

341
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,768

342
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,073
Just give it a try.

It will be more comfortable.

364
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,766
One day, he suddenly asked me

365
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,502
if I was interested in taking on a challenge.

366
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,836
So, I'm here.

367
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:58,904
<i>[So, you got the job through connections?]</i>
No.

368
00:23:58,904 --> 00:23:59,938
What?

369
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,139
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,941
In fact, I went through many tests

371
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,443
before passing the evaluation.

372
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,778
<i>[Any tips for other candidates?]</i>
I don't really know.

373
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,081
However, I'm genuinely honored

374
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,983
to be able to join this company.

375
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,151
I will definitely live up
to everyone's expectations

376
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:14,920
and achieve the goals set by the company.

377
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,422
Um, excuse me, someone is calling me.

378
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,090
I might have to leave early.

379
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:21,293
Thank you for your hard work today, everyone.

380
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,494
Thank you.

381
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,728
After spending some time together,

382
00:24:25,728 --> 00:24:28,064
I realized that the General Manager
actually has a tender side.

383
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:32,928
It's just that no one has discovered it yet.

384
00:24:33,444 --> 00:24:34,976
Consider it as employee training.

385
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:36,756
Watch it. I will only do this once.

386
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:45,596
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

387
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:53,533
<i>♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫</i>

388
00:24:53,533 --> 00:25:00,722
<i>♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫</i>

389
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:08,011
<i>♫ When will I ever learn ♫</i>

390
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:12,196
<i>♫ A future that's further than forever ♫</i>

391
00:25:12,236 --> 00:25:15,747
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

392
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,422
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

393
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:23,347
<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>

394
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:26,973
<i>♫ Crossing mountains and rivers in memories ♫</i>

395
00:25:26,973 --> 00:25:32,946
<i>♫ All my longings for you ♫</i>

396
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:38,863
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>
<i>♫ And that childish face ♫</i>
