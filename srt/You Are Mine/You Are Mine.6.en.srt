00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:03,670
<i>[I heard you were injured at work?]</i>
My foot is much better.

2
00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:07,374
<i>[What would make you want to resign?]</i>

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,975
If the work is too dangerous…

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,110
Yao Shunyu.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,745
- Coffee.
- Yes.

6
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,346
Never mind, I'll call Sofia.

7
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,718
<i>[Why didn't you ask him to run errands?]</i>
Don't you see his short legs and injured foot?

8
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,653
Anyway, I happen to need
Li Huiwang for something.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,089
<i>[Will you stop an employee from leaving?]</i>
For those who want to leave,

10
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,357
why would I stop them?

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,560
Take care and so long.

12
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,597
<i>[ROUND 6 To him, I'm Different from Others]</i>

<i>[You Are Mine]</i>

20
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,147
How can you hide?

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,182
<i>Yao Shunyu, how could you be eaten like this?</i>

22
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,786
Although I'm your employee,

23
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,688
you can't make endless demands.

24
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,091
You treat me like a mouse
being toyed with by a cat.

25
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,894
I know this might be your
PTSD from being kidnapped,

26
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,697
but you shouldn't…

27
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,803
Too soon.

28
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,706
Yes.

29
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,141
I can't rush things.

30
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,377
I must let him know my good intentions first.

31
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:27,380
Just like merging companies,

32
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,516
we must first demonstrate goodwill,

33
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:32,118
and we can proceed once we've got our wish.

34
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,921
Otherwise, there will be backlash.

35
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:46,656
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>

36
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,609
<i>What does he think of me?</i>

37
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,479
<i>A toy or a stress reliever?</i>

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,315
<i>I should go and ask the ladies</i>

39
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,450
<i>if they have ever encountered such a situation.</i>

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,963
I apologize for my impulsive action just now.

41
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,165
Just like you said,

42
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,168
you were kidnapped because of me,

43
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,904
and it has caused me significant unease.

44
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,073
I…

45
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,476
am scared that you'd disappear.

46
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,651
Alright, then.

47
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,321
Eat up and head back quickly.

48
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,258
<i>How can I leave now?</i>

49
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:49,095
Yang said his wife suddenly felt dizzy

50
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,930
so he needed to go back and take care of her.

51
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,499
So?

52
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:57,237
You won't make me take a cab, right?

53
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,174
What if someone kidnaps me again?

54
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,812
General Manager, do you want
to stay the night without any preparations?

55
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,416
I can use your things.

56
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,618
Is there any problem?

57
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,290
Okay.

58

I'm getting used to seeing
the General Manager when I wake up.

68
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,653
General Manager.

69
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,791
You're up.

70
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,166
I remember telling you
to throw away this shirt.

71
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,435
Why is it at your house?

72
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,928
Give it back.

73
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:38,571
- Give it back to me.
- Why should I?

74
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,273
Just give it back.

75
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,307
Seriously.

76
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,742
Give it to me first, come on.

77
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,377
Are you going to wash it and give it to me?

78
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,745
- Why would I give it to you?
- Give it to me.

79
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:47,046
- Why should I give it to you?
- Please.

80
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,114
Give it to me.

<i>♫ Guess which line holds the pass code ♫</i>

82
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,557
I thought I could wash it

83
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,292
and it's still wearable.

84
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,361
It looked expensive.

85
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:06,366
I don't like to waste things.

86
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,868
I didn't say anything.

87
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,506
Alright then, I'll dispose of it.

88
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,578
No need.

89
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,981
I'm wearing this one to work today.

90
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,984
Clean the one from yesterday for me

91
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,856
so that I can change when I come next time.

92
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,274
Next time?

93
00:06:31,274 --> 00:06:32,925
That's right.

94
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:34,360
Is there a problem?

95
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,880
General Manager,

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,715
there are no stairs here anymore.

97
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,383
You can put me down.

98
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,492
See, I told you.

99
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:07,960
I'm all healed.

100
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>He ran so fast with an injured foot.</i>

101
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,633
<i>Does he hate to stay by my side?</i>

102
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,241
I'll leave first.

103
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:23,910
- Miss.
- Shunyu.

104
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,111
Come on, I wanted

105
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,213
to ask you about that thing last time.

106
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,215
Good morning, General Manager.

107
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,121
Did you come to work again
with the General Manager?

108
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:43,663
He seems to treat you differently.

109
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,732
Does he?

110
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,234
He treats everyone like this, no?

111
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,038
No.

112
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,408
Taking care of employees
and driving employees to and from work

113
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:58,394
doesn't seem like him.

114
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,747
Since it happened, it means…

115
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,618
Ask me what.

116
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,487
What?

117
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:12,792
You are different from others to him.

118
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,264
Different?

119
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,464
Different.

120
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,992
Different?

121
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,271
<i>Call me when you get home.</i>

122
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,409
<i>I'm glad you're fine.</i>

123
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,212
<i>I'm glad you're fine.</i>

124
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,359
<i>Good morning.</i>

125
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,361
<i>I like the way you say good morning.</i>

126
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,142
Yang bought too much

127
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,577
and I couldn't finish it.

128
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,380
Throw it away.

129
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,316
Won't that be a waste?

130
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,885
Then you can eat it.

131
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,953
Me?

132
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,556
Why, do you not like it?

133
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,191
No, not at all, I'm not picky.

134
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:21,894
And these all look delicious.

135
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,400
So?

136
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,670
So many delicious things,

137
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,972
and it's a pity for me
to eat them all by myself.

138
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,707
I will call the ladies to come together.

139
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,244
Come back.

140
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,928
Sit.

141
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,601
Let's eat.

142
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,403
Okay.

143
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,390
Yao Shunyu.

144
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,494
Don't make me a bad boss.

145
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,465
I know I'm severe,

146
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,067
but I'm also fair in reward and punishment.

147
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,504
You got hurt because of me.

148
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,841
If anything, I owe you an apology.

149
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,709
Besides,

150
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,013
the company won't be stuck
just because a secretary goes on leave.

151
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,214
So

152
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,049
stop taking everything

153
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:51,684
on your own shoulders.

154
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,357
Speak when you need to.

155
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,894
General Manager.

156
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,731
This is the first time
you've said this much to me.

157
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:11,637
Hurry up and eat, only by eating
can you have the strength to work.

158
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,071
<i>Yao Shunyu, why didn't you
mention the kidnapping?</i>

159
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,573
Mom.

160
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,276
It was not a kidnapping,
but a misunderstanding.

161
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,279
<i>What kind of secretary gets
kidnapped because of their boss?</i>

162
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,947
No, it was an accident.

163
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,782
The General Manager even risked
his own safety to rescue me.

164
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,150
It wasn't his fault.

165
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,419
<i>I thought you didn't talk to me
because you were busy at work.</i>

166
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:02,188
<i>Who knew such a thing happened?</i>

167
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,289
Mom.

168
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,524
I'm really fine here.

169
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,126
General Manager takes really good care of me.

170
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,562
I'm fine, don't worry.

171
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,631
<i>We don't live in the same world
with the General Manager.</i>

172
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,067
<i>Do you think he will truly put you at heart?</i>

173
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,168
<i>You know what?</i>

174
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,521
<i>You might as well quit your job
and come back to help out.</i>

175
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:21,407
<i>Your father is worried
that you will be wronged outside.</i>

176
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,642
<i>Okay? Come back quickly.</i>

177
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,845
<i>That's it. Quit your job right now.</i>

178
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,146
<i>Don't make your father worry.</i>

179
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,948
<i>I worry too, okay?</i>

180
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,451
Alright, Mom, um, I have to go now.

181
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,554
Let's talk about this later.

182
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:36,589
Bye.

183
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,268
Your subordinate got the numbers wrong,

184
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,803
and you signed it without looking.

185
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,505
Are your eyes for decoration?

186
00:12:52,505 --> 00:12:53,873
I'm sorry. General Manager.

187
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:55,107
I promise that next time, I will…

188
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,609
There won't be a next time.

189
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,250
What happened?

190
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,552
There was an expense note.

191
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,420
100 was written as 1,000, with an extra zero.

192
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,956
He didn't notice, and neither did I.

193
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,625
Does the General Manager
always check such details?

194
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,794
He checks every single note in this way.

195
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,462
You don't have to interfere in this.

196
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,230
Alright. You can leave first.

197
00:13:18,944 --> 00:13:20,132
Are you sure?

198
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,400
Yes, leave it to me.

199
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,984
Having fun chatting?

200
00:13:25,984 --> 00:13:27,306
General Manager,

201
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,776
I'm going to deal with the guy
who wrote the extra zero.

202
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,044
I promise you

203
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,879
this won't happen again.

204
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,850
Sorry.

205
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,430
Do you think I'm too fierce?

206
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,566
<i>[General Manager, Xia Shangzhou]</i>
I don't think you're fierce.

207
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:56,235
At least you didn't shout "get out".

208
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,271
I remember on my first day,

209
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,841
you scolded me and I almost wanted to quit.

210
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:06,946
Quit?

211
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,051
Where can you find a boss
who treats you so well?

212
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,654
I treat you very well too.

213
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,524
I take care of your food, drinks,

214
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,925
and even your sleep.

215
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,827
I even feel like I wasn't hired
to be a secretary,

216
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,028
but a nanny.

217
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,104
This is quite hard for you,

218
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,611
checking every note personally.

219
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,252
I have no option.
My mom keeps a close eye on things.

220
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,488
Does your mom know you have
trouble sleeping and emotional disorder?

221
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,756
I have you, don't I?

222
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,792
I sleep well with you,

223
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:57,129
and I'm also less likely to lose my temper.

224
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,200
But I can't possibly

225
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,801
stay by your side 24/7.

226
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,109
You reminded me.

227
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,079
Move in with me.

228
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,660
I've been sleeping well
the last few days with you,

229
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,363
but it's really too small
and inconvenient at your place.

230
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,365
Move in with me.

231
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,136
I provide free meals,
accommodation, and transportation.

232
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,571
Your safety will also be ensured.
Isn't it a good deal?

233
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,207
<i>Is he trying to keep me as a mistress?</i>

234
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,878
Think about it carefully and let me know.

235
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,821
I'll leave now.

236
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,266
Hello, Vice President.

237
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,208
Sign here.

238
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,453
You seem to be happy with Shunyu.

239
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,991
A little, maybe.

240
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:33,859
He's alright.

241
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,563
It's not easy to stay with someone
of your temperament.

242
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,465
Remember to treat him well, okay?

243
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,303
Am I not good to him?

244
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,140
I know he's thrifty and wants to save money,

245
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,842
and that's why I gave him a red envelope.

246
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,147
Do you really think that money
can solve any problem?

247
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,485
You said you should give someone
things they would like.

248
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,121
And he likes money, right?

249
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,356
Shunyu saves money to support his parents.

250
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,292
What would they think if they knew their son
was kidnapped because of a General Manager?

251
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,861
It was just an accident.

252
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,196
Have you ever thought
about if they are against it,

253
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,699
would Shunyu continue to work here?

254
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,036
How well do you deserve his loyalty?

255
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,016
I'm leaving now.

256
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,460
What happened?

257
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,231
It's almost time for this year's
department staff trip.

258
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,533
That's good news,

259
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,468
but why does everyone look so worried?

260
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,404
It's my first time participating in a trip.

261
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,873
Shunyu, do you have any places
you'd like to go?

262
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,175
We get to choose?

263
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:03,015
The location each year is personally
announced by the General Manager.

264
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,284
This year should be about the same.

265
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:10,289
I really want to go to a five-star hotel,
take a hot spring bath,

266
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,991
and eat gourmet food.

267
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,627
I also really want to eat Kaiseki

268
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,163
and take a hot spring bath.

269
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,398
Me too.

270
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,101
I look forward to it.

271
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,070
Shunyu, it's up to you
whether we can go or not.

272
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,473
This itinerary looks good.

273
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,575
Actually, I'm fine with wherever.

274
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:36,281
I got it.

275
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,889
The General Manager is about
to announce the location.

276
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,695
Five-star hotel.

277
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,765
Let's not go to hell again.

278
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,401
Come on.

279
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,402
Please.

280
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:03,675
<i>This year, we challenge to climb
to the top of Yu Mountain.</i>

281
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,513
<i>Shunyu will admire me even more</i>

282
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,649
<i>when he sees me conquering
the highest peak in Taiwan.</i>

283
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,290
I think this activity

284
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,092
makes great sense.

285
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,561
Climbing a mountain
symbolizes the future performance

286
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,998
of the company will
continue to make new records.

287
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,599
But I remember hearing

288
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,101
Shunyu having other ideas.

289
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,770
Shunyu, would you like to say something?

290
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,939
Me?

291
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,807
You can't possibly torture us.

292
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,509
We are already tired from work.

293
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,144
You should talk to the General Manager.

294
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,913
Make him change his mind.

295
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,247
How could that be possible?

296
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,849
The General Manager won't
change his mind for others.

297
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,284
He will definitely listen to you.

298
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,451
I've told you before.

299
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,987
You're very different to him.

300
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,231
Yao Shunyu, what do you want to say?

301
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,504
I don't want to climb the mountain.

302
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,407
I want to go bathe in the hot springs,

303
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,842
stay in a five-star hotel,
and eat gourmet food.

304
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,914
General Manager.

305
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,349
We climb mountains every year.

306
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,318
Every year we climb higher and higher.

307
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,320
Shunyu's foot injury has just healed.

308
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,621
He shouldn't really be climbing.

309
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,323
So I think

310
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,258
his suggestion is pretty good.

311
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,630
- Actually, I…
- Do you really want hot spring baths?

312
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:38,971
I haven't bathed
in a five-star hot spring before.

313
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,040
In the past, I only went
to public baths with my family.

314
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,553
Alright.

315
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,623
Then let's go on vacation
at a hot spring hotel this year.

316
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,792
Yay.

317
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,594
We can really go to a hot spring hotel now.

318
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:09,167
<i>So this is what it feels like
to make someone happy.</i>

319
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,503
<i>It's like an addiction.</i>

320
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,272
<i>I can't help but want to give him more.</i>

321
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:28,002
<i>♫ Turns out love shows without words ♫</i>

322
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:33,682
<i>♫ Some people are always unable to let go ♫</i>

323
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:39,121
<i>♫ I like you, and I sing for you ♫</i>

324
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:44,512

<i>♫ I just like you, and there's no reason ♫</i>

<i>He's short,</i>

330
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,057
<i>not handsome enough,</i>

331
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,625
<i>always acting carelessly</i>

332
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,026
<i>and hesitating on everything,</i>

333
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,598
<i>but somehow, I like him a lot.</i>

334
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,652
<i>It's addictive to sleep here.</i>

335
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:34,853
<i>I need to quit it.</i>

336
00:22:37,071 --> 00:22:42,688
<i>[The secretary that I'm
addicted to must be cut off]</i>

337
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:49,990

338

00:22:55,991 --> 00:23:00,675
<i>♫ You rarely speak softly,
but it makes me believe ♫</i>

340
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,749
Who allowed you to have a girlfriend?

341
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,017
A boyfriend is not allowed either.

342
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,051
General Manager, here.

343
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,619
You better go in the hot springs quickly,

344
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:08,904
or you might catch a cold.

345
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:11,590
I know I'm difficult to deal with.

346
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,991
Give me a bit more time.

347
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,128
I am flattered.

348
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,896
For a person like the General Manager,

349
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,365
whatever he does should have a goal, right?

350
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

351
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:35,357

00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,571
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

00:23:57,574 --> 00:24:01,246
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>
