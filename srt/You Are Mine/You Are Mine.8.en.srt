<i>[Is it true that new employees have to sign a contract?]</i>

2
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,503
I remember hearing the ladies saying

3
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,206
every new employee will sign a contract when they join the company.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,308
<i>[Did you sign a contract?]</i> 
 Of course, I signed it on my first day.

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,610
<i>[Did you review the contract?]</i> 
 I was happy that I found a job at the time,

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,245
and there were so many pages in the contract,

7
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:14,047
with the words many and small.

8
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,916
After all, isn't everyone signing the same contract?

9
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,551
So I just signed it right away.

10
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,622
<i>[Do all new employees have to sign a contract?]</i> 
 The company signs contracts with new employees.

11
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,841
It's a protection for both sides.

12
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:26,426
<i>[Does the contract provide actual protection?]</i> 
 Are you questioning me?

00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,541
Cheers.

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,114
Today, I will take on all the toasts

24
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,315
for the General Manager.

25
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:26,653
You're his secretary,

26
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,987
but I find you interesting.

27
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,122
Not bad.

28
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,723
Do you have a girlfriend?

29
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,660
<i>Who allowed you to have a girlfriend?</i>

30
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,694
<i>A boyfriend is not allowed either.</i>

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,435
You're young. Don't you want to fall in love?

32
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,705
I know a lot of single young girls.

33
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,707
What is your type?

34
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,009
I'll introduce some to you.

35
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,447
I'm not allowed to.

36
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:59,085
You're too old to be listening to your parents.

37
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:01,154
Leave it to me.

38
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:04,023
I'll introduce someone suitable for you to take home sometime.

39
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,458
Let's keep drinking.

40
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,462
Cheers.

41
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,598
- There are mixed drinks. 
 - Come on, cheers.

42
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,600
Drink up.

43
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,536
Another round.

44
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,304
Come on, another round.

45

I'll drink with you,

46
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,208
Director Taijian, you've had a lot.

47
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,944
Shunyu has also had too much.

48
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,446
We'll take him to his room.

49
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,647
Come on, drink more.

50
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,815
Come on.

51
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,816
Come on. You haven't had enough.

52
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,850
We'll leave first.

53
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,455
You seemed unhappy.

54
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,789
Did I forbid you to fall in love?

55
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,830
General Manager.

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,865
What are you doing? Let me down.

57
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,800
Stop. You haven't had enough.

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,935
Don't leave.

59
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:50,003
Let's keep drinking.

60
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,616
I'll drink with you.

61
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,674
Let me down.

62
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,064
Stay still.

63
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,413
I can walk. Let me down.

64
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,037
Fine. I'll let it slide.

65
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:10,123
Yao Shunyu, when you're sober,

66
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,358
don't tell me you've forgotten everything.

67
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:40,954
Are you okay?

68
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,724
I'm fine.

69
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,896
Wait.

70
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,533
I'm not fine.

71
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,973
<i>General Manager.</i>

72
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,944

<i>to you?</i>

74
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,187
You hit me.

75
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,862
Be good now. Get off me first.

76
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,098
Why should I listen to you?

77
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,302
You're always making demands.

78
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,573
It's not fair.

79
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,011
What do you want then?

80
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,666
Yao Shunyu.

81
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,126
Are you pretending to be drunk

82
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,595
or pretending to be sober?

83
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,833
You are the General Manager,

84
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:38,338
and I'm just a newbie getting paid.

85
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:42,342
Why would you…

86
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,378
What?

87
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,489
Do this?

88
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,827
General Manager.

89
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,730

90
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,368
General Manager.

91
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,107
It's not working hours now

92
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,744
and you are on top of me in this position.

93
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:24,317
Shangzhou.

00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,804
You can breathe now.

102
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,528
Did you drink?

103
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,314
Did I take all the drinks for you?

104
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,684
The Vice President said you couldn't drink.

105
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,921
It's because of you.

106
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:38,391
It's not that I can't drink.

107
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,926
I'm scared

108
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,563
that after drinking, I will lose control.

109
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,704
<i>If the General Manager asked you to be his mistress,</i>

110
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:52,905
<i>just…</i>

111
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,341
You…

112
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,744
You're doing this to me

113
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,149
for fun or because you like me?

114
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,652
Forget it.

115
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,788
It must be just for fun.

116
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,124
Do you think I'm doing this for fun?

117
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,212
Anyway, I have no experience.

118
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:18,164
Do whatever you want.

119
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,733
There is nothing I can do.

120
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,835
Yao Shunyu, don't…

121
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,071
Or is it because you like me?

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,842
So as long as I like you,

123
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,577
you'll let me do whatever I want?

124
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,514
You are the General Manager.

125
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,518
So as long as it's a big boss,

126
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,752
you'll be OK with it?

127
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,782
Forget it.

128
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,325
We were originally from two different worlds.

129
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,531
I'm neither capable nor outstanding,

130
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:30,303
so why would you want to be with me?

131
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,144
I see it now.

132
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,483
It's like a wolf seeing a sheep,

133
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:45,518
but the wolf is full,

134
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,287
so he doesn't eat the sheep

135
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,123
and just keeps the sheep around for fun.

136
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,301
Never mind. I won't argue with a drunk.

137
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,104
Yao Shunyu.

138
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,543

<i>It can't be…</i>

141

You treated me like that last night.

142
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,765
Aren't you going to take responsibility?

143
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,201
General Manager.

144
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,321
Who are you calling?

145
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:14,006
Didn't you agree to call me by my name?

146
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,310
Also, you're not allowed to drink next time.

147
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:26,886
We didn't do anything last night, did we?

148
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,824
The hot spring.

149
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,827
I want to bathe in the hot spring.

150
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:35,828
Come back.

151
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,129
I want to bathe in the hot spring.

152
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,497
It's late. what are you doing?

153
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,900
- There are no hot springs. 
 - I want to bathe in the hot spring.

154
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,601
The only thing that can get hot water is instant noodles.

155
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,277
Did you forget

156
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,279
about what happened last night?

157
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,416
<i>Drink up.</i>

158
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:01,153
<i>- I drank last night. 
 - We'll leave first.</i>

159
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,788
<i>And you took me to the room.</i>

160
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:05,091
<i>Then you kissed me.</i>

161
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:11,030
<i>You're just playing with me.</i>

162
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,231
<i>You can breathe now.</i>

163
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,234
Do you remember now?

164
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,505
<i>I'm neither capable nor outstanding,</i>

165
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,076
<i>so why would you want to be with me?</i>

166
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,459
You said you couldn't drink

167
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,895
because you were scared you'd lose control.

168
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,533
Did you also hit me?

169
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:49,535
Twice.

170
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,010
Wait for me here.

171
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,380
I'll deal with you properly after I come out.

172
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,219
<i>When a relationship has gone wrong,</i>

173
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:11,490
<i>the right thing to do is to get it back on track, right?</i>

174
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,034
Where did I do wrong?

175
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,403
Is he doing this on purpose

176
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,605
or is he just like this when drunk?

177
00:13:30,075 --> 00:13:31,177
Go wash your face too,

178
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,444
and we'll…

179
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,115
Shunyu?

180
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,100
<i>Pick up, damn it.</i>

181
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,203

<i>[General Manager, I want to resign.]</i>

218
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,136
Shunyu.

219
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,774
I'm sorry for making you worry yesterday.

220
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,176
What exactly happened?

221
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,879
Did the General Manager do something to you?

222
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,084
No.

223
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,921
Just…

224
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,293
I'm not adapting well.

225
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,996
And I'm not suited for the job.

226
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:51,570
If you see me as a sister, just tell me the truth.

227
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,739
You don't look fine at all.

228
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,917
My mom wants me to go home and help out.

229
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,423
I thought you wanted to make more money

230
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,759
so that your parents wouldn't have to work so hard.

231
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,194
Why would you give up so soon?

232
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,265
My parents are actually very against

233
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,800
me working here.

234
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,838
They say I'm too serious about everything

235
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:30,142
and that I easily get carried away.

236
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,379
But I think you're doing very well.

237
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,483
You're really doing a great job.

238
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:44,223
I fell for the General Manager.

239
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:54,366
The company does not explicitly

240
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,135
forbid office romances.

241
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,070
Besides, we all see how much

242
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,805
General Manager cares about you.

243
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,040
Sis.

244
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,678
Do you think the General Manager likes me

245
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,915
or he just enjoys having me around?

246
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:15,821
What do you think people would say

247
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,058
about the General Manager of Xia Corporation getting involved with a small secretary?

248
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:22,861
Especially when the secretary is a man

249
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,564
with no money, no power, and no background.

250
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,680
Sis.

251
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,903
Do you think the President would approve?

252
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,781
I just…

253
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,185
don't want my existence

254
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,555
to be a burden to the General Manager.

255
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,234
I've made some notes in this cheat book.

256
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,835
It's probably useless

257
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,505
so I won't bother to explain it myself.

258
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,274
Also,

259
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,510
what I told you just now,

260
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,078
please keep it a secret.

261
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,682
Thank you, Sis.

262
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,016
Shunyu.

263
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,730
Tell HR

264
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,765

265
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:35,033
Asking for reimbursement for a personal hotel stay,

266
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,535
does he think I'm blind?

267
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,626
General Manager.

268
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:03,028
I just got in touch with Shunyu, he…

269
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,514
asked for a resignation.

270
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,732
Because?

271
00:21:06,732 --> 00:21:09,034
He couldn't adapt, and he's not suited for the job.

272
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:13,171
Where is the employment contract that I asked you to check?

273
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:20,545
You can leave early today.

274
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,781
Yes.

<i>So bear with him.</i>

276
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,663

00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,098
<i>Okay, I'll bear with him.</i>

278
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:45,137
<i>He can give the money to someone like me who really needs it.</i>
