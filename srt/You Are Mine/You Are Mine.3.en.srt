1
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,011
Clumsy.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,712
Just breathing and taking up space.

3
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,082
Even a piece of furniture is more functional.

4
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,320
An incompetent secretary

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,654
will affect my efficiency.

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,257
So many questions.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,080
Are we done?

8
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,794
Where's the breakfast?

9
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,431
So, I should sit here, right?

10
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,845
I think the nature of this job

11
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,113
is a bit different.

12
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,117
Home care.

13
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:51,651
For example,

14
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,852
massages,

15
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:55,538
companionship for meals and chatting, and also

16
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:57,957
sleeping together?

17
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,125
Yao Shunyu.

18
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,094
Yao Shunyu!

19
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>[ROUND 3 You Look Cute with A Smile]</i>

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,344
<i>♫ I like you, and I sing for you ♫</i>

21
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:18,880
<i>♫ Guess which line holds the pass code ♫</i>

22
00:01:19,232 --> 00:01:21,888
<i>♫ Though you're confused, a bit stubborn ♫</i>

23
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,832
<i>♫ Childish and unromantic ♫</i>

24
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:32,448
<i>♫ You're my destined angel ♫</i>

25
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:43,174
<i>♫ You're my destined angel ♫</i>

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,856
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>

27
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,833
<i>Exclusive?</i>

28
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,834
<i>Of course.</i>

29
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,270
<i>Very good, thoughtful.</i>

30
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,053
The taste is satisfactory,

31
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,688
but you didn't consider the eater's appetite.

32
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,157
Yes, General Manager.

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,691
I am prepared for that.

34
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,631
This is the extra toasted bread crust I baked

35
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,932
so that you can snack on it

36
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,268
anytime get bored or hungry.

37
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,770
And it goes well with both coffee and tea.

38
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,206
It's widely loved by adults and kids.

39
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,344
The coffee has gone cold. Change it.

40
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,714
General Manager,

41
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,584
drinking coffee on an empty stomach
is not healthy.

42
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,853
Why don't we fill up first?

43
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:12,896
Yes, sir.

44
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,513
General Manager.

45
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,521
I'm not a child. What is this?

46
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,802
I will take them to the Secretary's Office.

47
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,416
Did I say…

48
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,242
<i>President</i>

49
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,447
You can leave now.

50
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,304
Yes.

51
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,456
Mom.

52
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,632
How can you not remember this?

53
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,768
Get out.

54
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,839
Are you okay?

55
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,242
- Miss.
- What happened?

56
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,543
It's okay. Let's go.

57
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,312
Are you hurt anywhere? Let's go rest.

58
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,814
We all went through this.

59
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,549
There will be more in the future.

60
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:17,550
It's okay.

61
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,052
Good boy.

62
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:22,522
Oh God, Shunyu was only there for a few hours,

63
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,893
but how did he become so haggard?

64
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,962
The General Manager was unhappy
with the sales turnover.

65
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:31,364
He berated every leader

66
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,665
of the Sales Department online.

67
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,834
Just now, I was repeating

68
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,602
what the General Manager had ordered.

69
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,372
I accidentally said one date wrong,

70
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,674
He had me stand next to the potted plant

71
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,009
as punishment.

72
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,827
The General Manager even said,

73
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:47,914
breathing is something I can manage.

74
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,651
I can't believe he did that.

75
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,787
This is what they call "serving the king
is like walking with a tiger."

76
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,323
Luckily, I don't have to face
the General Manager directly.

77
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:58,432
Shunyu,

78
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,060
we understand your feelings.

79
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,261
But,

80
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,931
thank you, for our sake.

81
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,204
But the General Manager was fine this morning.

82
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,339
Did anything happen after?

83
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,245
The General Manager's mother called him.

84
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:24,851
Miss,

85
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,152
is there anything wrong?

86
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,555
Allow me to introduce

87
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,090
the General Manager's mother,

88
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:34,127
AKA the President of the Xia E-commerce Group.

89
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,397
The General Manager is decisive,

90
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,399
but the President is even more terrifying.

91
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,371
Not only is her temper stronger
than the General Manager's,

92
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,407
but her desire for control,
unwillingness to take no for an answer,

93
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,908
and decision-making precision
are also unmatched.

94
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,211
Hello, President.

95
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,846
During her term as President,

96
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,848
she single-handedly made Xia Group

97
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,317
the number one e-commerce group in Taiwan.

98
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,091
After the General Manager's call
with the President,

99
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,492
his temper suddenly worsened.

100
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,394
Usually, it's due to one thing.

101
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,695
What thing?

102
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,448
Understood.

103
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,675
Everyone,

104
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,944
the President has set up another
blind date for the General Manager.

105
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,613
We're ready to start the operation.

106
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,815
Order flowers, reserve a restaurant,
and find musicians.

107
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,917
I'll do it. I'll surely arrange
a perfect, sure-to-win date

108
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,552
for the General Manager.

109
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,954
No.

110
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,457
You've got it wrong.

111
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,058
The General Manager is going on a blind date,

112
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,493
and our duty as the Secretary's Office

113
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,928
is to sabotage this blind date.

114
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,397
I used to be the junior one,

115
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,432
and I've already been
on the battlefield three times.

116
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:49,335
This time, I can finally let go of the burden.

117
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,472
If it's not you, then who is it?

118
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,313
Me?

119
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,814
I know I'm the newbie,

120
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,917
but I'm a man.

121
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,153
I'm a bad liar, an even worse actor.

122
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,021
No, I can't do it.

123
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,057
No, stop joking with me.

124
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,425
Really, I can't do it. Who would buy it?

125
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,493
No one would buy it.

126
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,028
What am I going to tell my parents?

127
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,263
Please.

128
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,664
No, don't. I really can't do it.

129
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,167
I really can't.

130
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:36,182
General Manager, he will be
responsible for this mission.

131
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,776
General Manager.

132
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,229
General Manager.

133
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,047
Here is the plan.

134
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,816
You and Miss Luo from Luo Enterprises

135
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,052
are supposed to meet in the hotel lobby.

136
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,987
On your way to the restaurant
booked by the President,

137
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:15,988
Shunyu appears.

138
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,156
Don't go.

139
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,158
Why are you going on a blind date?

140
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,360
- Go away.
- Why?

141
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,296
Have you forgotten about last night?

142
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,932
- What?
- How could you do this to me?

143
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,350
- What are you doing?
- Why?

144
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,770
- Let go of me.
- Please, don't go on the blind date.

145
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,409
- You're crazy.
- Don't.

146
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,582
Don't leave me.

147
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,217
Why are you going on a blind date?

148
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,896
As the new member of the Secretary's Office,

149
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,931
this is Yao Shunyu's first mission on board.

150
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,640
Action.

151
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,048
Strawberry.

152
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,162
Hello, General Manager.

153
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,163
Where are you?

154
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,132
She's almost here. What are you doing?

155
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,967
I'd like to ask you, General Manager,

156
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,603
what size condoms do you use?

157
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,805
Is there a difference
between dotted and ribbed?

158
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,973
And…

159
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,775
What flavor do you prefer?

160
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,276
It's not like we're really going to use it.

161
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,845
Why do you care?

162
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,216
Whatever. Just come over now.

163
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,202
Hi.

164
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,538
I'm Luo Mengmeng.

165
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:16,208
You're Xia Shangzhou, right?

166
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,845
A table has been reserved.

167
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,013
This way, please.

168
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,348
Wait a moment.

169
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,451
I just got off the plane
and I'm not hungry yet.

170
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,754
And I don't like eating in front of people.

171
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:29,789
Miss Luo.

172
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,792
Don't call me Miss Luo,

173
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,393
just call me Mengmeng.

174
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,096
Let's go, we can order room service.

175
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,032
I heard the room service here is delicious.

176
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,101
The steak salad is very famous.

177
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,319
Come on, let's go.

178
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,370
Wait a moment.

179
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:48,174
I need to take a call.

180
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,176
OK.

181
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,812
Don't keep me waiting too long.

182
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:58,751
Answer the call.

183
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,020
Yao Shunyu.

184
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,188
Where are you now?

185
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:03,589
If you don't come now, I will be swallowed.

186
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,912
Let's go, come on.

187
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:09,920
Wait a moment.

188
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,569
Don't go.

189
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,374
You are…

190
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,911
Mine.

191
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:28,948
I have a date today.

192
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,016
Sorry, next time.

193
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,853
Let's go.

194
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,323
Wait.

195
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,926
Why is it happening again?!

196
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:51,170
Pervert.

197
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,673
Wait.

198
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,378
- What are you doing?
- I want to tell her that you're not a pervert.

199
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,099
She finally left.

200
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:04,750
Just let her go.

201
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,786
But this is too far off script,

202
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,587
and it's damaging your reputation.

203
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,723
It doesn't matter.

204
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:12,391
Maybe this way,

205
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,093
I won't need to go on blind dates anymore.

206
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:17,730
I just wanted to tell her

207
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,533
that she can choose not to accept
men being with men,

208
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,501
but she can't call you a pervert.

209
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,073
So,

210
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,909
you can accept men being with men.

211
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:40,085
Luckily, they didn't get crushed.

212
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,688
I don't know if I can return them later.

213
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,891
Have you used it before?

214
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,793
Have you been in love?

215
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:50,296
Using it and being in love
are not the same thing.

216
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,999
So, have you used it or been in love?

217
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,171
I didn't get an invoice.

218
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm afraid Finance won't reimburse me.

219
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,642
Remember to pay me.

220
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,624
I feel like ever since Shunyu came,

221
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,160
the General Manager seems different.

222
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,963
The workload has been reduced,

223
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,932
and we can even leave work on time now.

224
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:30,169
Shunyu really is the lucky star
of the Secretary's Office.

225
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,071
Come on, Shunyu, eat more.

226
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,205
Eat more.

227
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,474
Shunyu, if it's not enough, there's more here.

228
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,508
Good boy.

229
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,110
Shunyu, thank you.

230
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,445
I'm glad to see that you

231
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,546
are getting along

232
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,614
with the General Manager.

233
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,233
But Miss,

234
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:48,020
I feel like I keep doing strange things.

235
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,439
Making breakfast for the General Manager,

236
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,491
massaging the General Manager,

237
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,295
and disrupting his blind dates with acting.

238
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,264
It's too hard.

239
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,033
And these aren't secretary duties.

240
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,736
Are these things

241
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,170
bothering you, Shunyu?

242
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,639
I want to become

243
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,840
a competent secretary like you,

244
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,109
able to share the workload
with the General Manager.

245
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,210
It seems

246
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:15,581
I've made you do things
you weren't willing to do.

247
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,983
No, General Manager.

248
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,885
I gave you time to get used to the environment,

249
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:20,986
but you're not satisfied.

250
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:22,671
Alright.

251
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,789
Next, we're entering

252
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,591
the platform's anniversary preparation period.

253
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,993
As you wish,

254
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,962
I'll let you share the workload.

255
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,701
The anniversary preparation period

256
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,471
is the busiest time of the year,

257
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,974
with the heaviest workload.

258
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,096
I've read so much data

259
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,998
that my eyes can't take it anymore.

260
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,016
Shunyu.

261
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,069
Shunyu.

262
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:46,672
Miss.

263
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,273
I have sent two analysis report samples

264
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,308
to your email.

265
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,843
Take a look.

266
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,444
Okay, thank you, miss.

267
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:54,346
Miss.

268
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,448
There's a rumor going around
in the Sales department.

269
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,584
They say the sales target this year

270
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,285
is set particularly high
compared to the previous years.

271
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,888
It's because the General Manager
messed up the blind date last time,

272
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,257
and the President was furious.

273
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,394
I remember teaching you

274
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,796
that gossip is strictly forbidden
in the Secretary's Office.

275
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,564
How innocent I am, Miss!

276
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,533
I was just delivering documents
to the Sales Department,

277
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,068
and they bombarded me with questions.

278
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:19,004
They also said the General Manager
was very calm this time.

279
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,172
He accepted such a large target

280
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,307
without blinking twice.

281
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,677
The General Manager must be
under a lot of pressure, right?

282
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,212
If you know that,

283
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,248
you should hurry up
and get the report sorted out.

284
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,349
Alright.

285
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,185
It's all my fault.

286
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,219
It must be because

287
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,789
I let the whole bag of condoms fall out,

288
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,058
which made the General Manager
look like a pervert.

289
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,928
The President must have heard
rumors and got angry.

290
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:45,364
Anyway,

291
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,466
now is a critical time for the General Manager.

292
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,068
As his secretaries, we should be

293
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,669
a good support team for the boss.

294
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,805
Shunyu.

295
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,039
Yes.

296
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,741
When you're with the General Manager,

297
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,643
try to share his burdens.

298
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,478
Yes, I will.

299
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,400
You were still here.

300
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,904
General Manager, dinner is here.
Do you want to eat now?

301
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,508
I'm not hungry now, later.

302
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,844
Okay, then I'll be at my desk.

303
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,078
Call me anytime if you need anything.

304
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,888
<i>No, no.</i>

305
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:17,689
<i>The General Manager is still working.</i>

306
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,057
<i>How can I sleep first?</i>

307
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,959
<i>He's still waiting for me.</i>

308
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,121
<i>General Manager, the document is ready.</i>

309
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:52,241
<i>Please check if there are any problems,
and rest early after.</i>

310
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:55,994
<i>Always with you, your secretary.</i>

311
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,679
You said you wanted to share the workload,

312
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,947
but you can't stand
working overtime for a week.

313
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,586
You're not going to a meeting.

314
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,754
You're dragging everyone down to catch a cold.

315
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,623
Forget it, just go home.

316
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,367
Get in.

317
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,611
Call me when you get home.

318
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,916
Okay, I'll leave first.

319
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,376
Mr. Yao,

320
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,644
there's construction at the entrance,

321
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,112
so I don't think the car can go in.

322
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,715
It's okay. You can drop me off here.

323
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:24,783
Please wait a moment.

324
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,485
The General Manager asked me
to buy porridge for you.

325
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,303
It's okay.

326
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:30,489
Just wait a moment, and I'll be right back.

327
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,903
What?

328
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,806
Anyone who dares to hurt you
must pay the price.

329
00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:05,040
I'm fine.

330
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,125
Unread and no reply. Getting bolder, huh?

331
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,312
General Manager, I'm fine.

332
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:11,596
I'm glad you're okay.

333
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,800
Send me his home address

334
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,934
and his family's phone number.

335
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,102
I'll leave right now.

336
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:18,603
It's two o'clock at midnight.

337
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:20,739
I can't possibly let you take a cab home alone.

338
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:28,283
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

339
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:36,220
<i>♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫</i>

340
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:43,409
<i>♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫</i>

341
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:50,698
<i>♫ When will I ever learn ♫</i>

342
00:22:50,698 --> 00:22:54,883
<i>♫ A future that's further than forever ♫</i>

343
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:58,434
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

344
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:02,109
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

345
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:06,034
<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>

346
00:23:06,034 --> 00:23:09,660
<i>♫ Crossing mountains and rivers in memories ♫</i>

347
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:15,633
<i>♫ All my longings for you ♫</i>

348
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:21,550
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>
<i>♫ And that childish face ♫</i>
