No, not at all.

It's just…

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,314
We are in a normal office romance relationship.

00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:15,315

Has anyone seen Yao Shunyu?

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,186
A bit clingy.

11
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:24,024
Were you interviewing Yao Shunyu just now?

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,243
Did he talk about me?

13
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,694
What did he say?

14
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,736
Where is he?

15
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,400
Yao Shunyu.

16
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,032
Shunyu.

17
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,088
Hey.

18
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,403
What are you doing?

19
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,204
Nothing.

20
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,606
Am I too clingy?

21
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:40,807
- No.
- What the heck?

22
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:41,824

- Okay.

Lisa said you wanted to see me.

Go ahead.

33
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:38,898
Why me?

34
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,704
You always say I'm short and clumsy.

Why?

You're the first one

to stay by my side

41
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,195
while I was at my lowest and most vulnerable.

42
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,499
To me,

43
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,401
you are special.

44
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,777
I've never been in love,

45
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,214
and I don't know much about it,

00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,183
but I admit

47
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,552
you are very attractive to me.

48
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:38,057
Many times it makes me panic,

49
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:40,326
and most of the time, I'm not sure

50
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,792
what that feeling means.

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,472
But now,

52
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,634
I understand.

00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,792
General Manager.

00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,273
Xia Shangzhou.

55
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,977
President, the General Manager is in a meeting.

56
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,608
You…

57
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,878
Mom. Stop it.

58
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,296
Let go of me.

59
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,831
Are you out of your mind?

60
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,376
Do you know how embarrassing
your actions are for the Xia family?

61
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,103
I'm always on guard

62
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,207
against those girls who have
intentions toward my son,

63
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,688
but I never expected,
despite all the precautions I took,

64
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,714
to overlook you, this little secretary.

65
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,783
Do you think you can get
everything from the Xia family

66
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,018
by being with Xia Shangzhou?

67
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,976
I'm with him because I like him.

68
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,226
Like?

69
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,627
What do you like about him?

70
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,963
Let me tell you.

71
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,364
Besides being the General Manager

72
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,033
of Xia's Group,

73
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,768
he has no money, no car, no house

74
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,737
not even a motorcycle.

75
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,875
It's okay, I have a bike.

76
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:04,978
Do you know how to ride one?

77
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,216
Do you accept eating toasts for three meals

78
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,321
and snatch for discount products?

79
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,456
Would you do it?

80
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,026
As long as it's with you,

81
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,094
I'm okay with whatever.

82
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:22,996
Okay.

83
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,834
If you can't afford him,

84
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,269
I will.

85
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,304
Shunyu.

86
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,605
You will?

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,642
Do you have any idea

88
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,744
what kind of environment he grew up in?

89
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,747
Do you know how much his food,
clothing, and daily groceries cost?

90
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,081
How high-end they are?

91
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,883
Do you know how much he spends each month?

92
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,485
There's no way you, an insignificant secretary

93
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:46,688
can afford him.

94
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,384
Well, how much do you plan
to pay me for leaving him?

95
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,431
Shunyu.

96
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,171
Five million.

97
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,046
I will only give you a maximum of ten million.

98
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,448
Because that's all you're worth.

99
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,744
Ten million.

100
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,096
So your son is only worth ten million?

101
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:07,500
Do you think the happiness of your son
can be measured in money?

102
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,003
You provide him with ample food and clothing,

103
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,407
but have you ever considered his feelings?

104
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,411
Did you come here today as a President

105
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,512
or as a mother?

106
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,580
Shunyu.

107
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,750
Do you know he has trouble sleeping

108
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,118
and often has headaches?

109
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,854
Do you know why he always lacks appetite

110
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,522
and has a weak stomach?

111
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,626
You might be rich,

112
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,416
but you cannot give your son
the warmth he needs.

113
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:38,231
Now…

114
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,360
Mom.

115
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,402
Now,

116
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,607
he has me.

117
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,115
I will be with him in the future.

118
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:57,817
Xia Shangzhou.

119
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,586
What do you think you will get

120
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,721
by choosing him?

121
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,790
You will lose Xia's Group

122
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,392
and your right to all properties.

123
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,063
Let go of him. I can't accept
you two being together.

124
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,232
You can't.

125
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,736
But I can't either.

126
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,373
I used to think that was everything.

127
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,242
But I realized after meeting him

128
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,392
that none of this matters

129
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,349
if I don't have him.

130
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,690
Let's go.

131
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,762
Excuse me.

132
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,096
That was scary.

133
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,957
I thought I was in an eight o'clock soap opera.

134
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,259
What era are we in? She's still slapping faces,

135
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:14,460
and twice.

136
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,296
Are you okay?

137
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,364
I'm fine.

138
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,733
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,970
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

140
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,672
After all, the President is your mother.

141
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,875
But I was really angry just now.

142
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,464
How could she do that to her own son?

143
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,481
Wait, does…

144
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,384
the President usually hit you as well?

145
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:45,725
I ordered the cheapest Americano.

146
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,663
Now we are both out of a job,

147
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,733
I can't afford your usual
pour-over single origin for the time being.

148
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,069
Not at all. I think it's good.

149
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,848
Keeping accounts?

150
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,919
Are you really planning to support me?

151
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,089
How?

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,792
Look.

153
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,796
Saving money is my specialty.

154
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,731
Besides these,

155
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,067
I have also joined a group-sale

156
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,835
and free-gift community.

157
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,704
Before we find a job again,

158
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,139
let's save a bit first.

159
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:39,378
If we really run out of savings unfortunately,

160
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,882
worst-case scenario,

161
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,951
we can help out at my family's breakfast shop.

162
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,186
I am very touched.

163
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,489
But if you're with me,

164
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,292
we don't need this.

165
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,629
Do you think that these years,
I only rely on the Xia family?

166
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,034
So you don't need my support at all?

167
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,104
I do. I really do.

168
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,774
You know, with the recent economic downturn,

169
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,911
stocks and funds are at a terrible loss.

170
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,447
I'm all trapped.

171
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,752
Let's go.

172
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,488
I was saved by my little secretary this time.

173
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:26,225
This is the first time I formally
left Xia's family in my life.

174
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,794
Where are we going then?

175
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,263
To your house.

176
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,534
My house is in the back.

177
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,208
[You Are Mine]

178
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,693
This one is good with cream.

179
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,728
Do you want some?

180
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,232
Yummy.

181
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,550
General Manager.

182
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,852
What is this thing that we have?

183
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,825
Now I'm supporting you,

184
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,196
so what do you think our relationship is?

185
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,941
What are you doing?

186
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,443
So what's our relationship now?

187
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,561
You tell me.

188
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,412
Aren't you the General Manager?

189
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,535
What is this?

190
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,581
A contract.

191
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,522
Our binding.

192
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,465
Why are you smiling?

193
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,967
Don't you get hungry?

194
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,039
Let me go eat something.

195
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,074
I am hungry.

196
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,643
And you're my food.

197
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,731
Go away.

198
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,776
I won't.

199
00:13:50,176 --> 00:13:51,296
Let's get this one.

200
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,431
What do you need it for?

201
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,440
I have pimples.

202
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,067
No, you don't. Put it back.

203
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,402
Fine.

204
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:09,315
No.

205
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,449
There are many people here.

206
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:13,752
No.

207
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,101
What?

208
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,402
Are you broken?

209
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,004
I need more.

210
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:38,644
Come down here.

211
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,390
I never dared to imagine
that we would be together.

212
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:56,462
This process of getting to know
each other little by little

213
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,564
gives me a sense of security.

214
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:07,552
Yao Shunyu.

215
00:15:10,336 --> 00:15:11,343
Yao Shunyu.

216
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,580
We are going on an island tour,

217
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,998
not abroad.

218
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,317
Why are you bringing so much luggage?

219
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,718
Comic books.

220
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,719
It's outrageous.

221
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,688
A pillow.

222
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,724
No, I must bring this.

223
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,795
We are going on an island tour.

224
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,363
We're not moving.

225
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:32,665
Hello?

226
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,067
Well, I need my pillow to sleep.

227
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,468
Why would you need that?

228
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,170
You can need me.

229
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,838
Who wants to need you?

230
00:15:41,216 --> 00:15:42,240
Fine.

231
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,608
Reconsider?

232
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,745
You attacked me.

233
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,864
What's your answer?

234
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,282
How can you do that?

235
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,350
What about now?

236
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,653
We were so different before,

237
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,158
but later we became closer and closer.

238
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,032
It's the sea!

239
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,592
I said before

240
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,928
that health is the greatest wealth,

241
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,749
but I want to modify this sentence now.

242
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,494
Xia Shangzhou,

243
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,598
you are my greatest wealth.

244
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,766
Being with you

245
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:45,304
makes me a happy tycoon every day.

246
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,780
Me too.

247
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,800
♫ The person I fell in love with is a rogue ♫

248
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,864
♫ You came uninvited to my heart ♫

249
00:17:08,864 --> 00:17:14,080
♫ Lured me to give away all my love ♫

250
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,220
♫ Without any promise for the future ♫

251
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,320
♫ You're too playful, my dear rogue ♫

252
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,489
♫ Hide when I love you the most ♫

253
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:30,610
♫ Hide in my dream with a charming posture ♫

254
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,460
♫ Making me continue to worship ♫

255
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,569
You can go on an island tour,

256
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,439
but posting photos to show off is too much.

257
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,275
If you're envious, you can also
take someone to play.

258
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,378
Thanks to you, I now have two jobs.

259
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,213
I'm so busy that I don't even have time to eat.

260
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,883
But I don't want to see your PDA at all.

261
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,052
If you have time to complain,

262
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,353
then you're not busy enough.

263
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,296
Alright, first things first.

264
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,357
You've been playing for a month.

265
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,126
When are you and Shunyu going to come back?

266
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,195
The company is in a mess now.
So much has happened.

267
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,397
Your secretaries are working overtime
every day and can barely hold on.

268
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,433
But you're there, right?

269
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,935
Stop making sarcastic remarks.

270
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,436
You know the President
can't let go of her pride.

271
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,671
She asked me to tell you.

272
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,106
End your vacation as soon as possible.

273
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,274
Come back to work next week. Do you understand?

274
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,311
Hello?

275
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:43,755
What's on your mind?

276
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,359
I was just thinking,

277
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,829
it's so nice to spend time

278
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,731
with you.

279
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,078
Come here.

280
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,218
I want one too.

281
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:49,656
♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫

282
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:57,632
♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫

283
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:04,960
♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫

284
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,680
♫ When will I ever learn ♫

285
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:16,256
♫ A future that's further than forever ♫

286
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,807
♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫

287
00:20:19,807 --> 00:20:23,904
♫ Without your guidance ♫

288
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:27,104
♫ How can I have hopes ♫

289
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:31,232
♫ Crossing mountains and rivers in memories ♫

290
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:37,006
♫ All my longings for you ♫

291
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:42,923
[You Are Mine]
♫ And that childish face ♫

292
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,423
Yu.

293
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,858
Shangzhou listens to you the most.

294
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:03,262
Help me persuade him to come back
and help out as soon as possible.

295
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,565
President.

296
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,201
Mrs. Xia.

297
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:11,403
Can you let Vice President Huiwang
hold on a little longer?

298
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,005
I will try harder to persuade him.

299
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,475
As you know, he's like a bird. Once set free,

300
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,012
he won't come back.

301
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,150
Yu.

302
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,952
Please think about it for me.

303
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,954
In the future, the entire group

304
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,489
will have to be handed over to him to manage.

305
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:33,025
He has to be responsible for all his employees.

306
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,528
Also, you will have to be responsible
for all the employees.

307
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,431
Excuse me.

308
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,016
Hello, Mom?

309
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,840
Hey, did you sleep with your General Manager?

310
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,071
I heard that he has even

311
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,407
given up the company for you. Is it true?

312
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,908
What did I tell you when you were young?

313
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,077
You can't be so selfish.

314
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,613
If it wasn't for your mother-in-law telling us,

315
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,716
we don't know how long we would
have been kept in the drum by you.

316
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,935
Hello, Yu.

317
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,336
Are you listening?

318
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:02,521
Yao Shunyu.

319
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,923
What's the General Manager's name,
Xia something?

320
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,825
Auntie, hello.

321
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,694
I am Xia Shangzhou.

322
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,896
Xia as in Xia Shangzhou's Zhou.

323
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,698
No, Xia.

324
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:19,938
I'm the General Manager
who seduced your son to bed.

325
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,108
Oh, what's this silly kid talking about?
