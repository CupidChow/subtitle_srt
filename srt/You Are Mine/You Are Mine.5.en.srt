1
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,431
I'm surprised.

2
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,216
And also very grateful to the General Manager.

3
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,344
Really.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,054
Although,

5
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:25,025
will the General Manager deduct my salary?

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,594
The company didn't really
pay the ransom, did they?

7
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,996
If they did pay,

8
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,365
would it be deducted from my salary?

9
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,405
As long as he is still a member
of the Xia Group,

10
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:41,925
as the General Manager,
I should stand up and protect him.

11
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:43,276
This is called

12
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:46,179
"Leading people and caring at heart".

13
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,219
I protected the company's assets.

14
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,354
Do you have a problem with that?

15
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,416
<i>[ROUND 5]</i>
<i>[Turns out... we do have something in common]</i>

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:06,144
<i>♫ I like you, and I sing for you ♫</i>

17
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:11,712
<i>♫ Guess which line holds the pass code ♫</i>

18
00:01:11,712 --> 00:01:15,104
<i>♫ Though you're confused, a bit stubborn ♫</i>

19
00:01:15,104 --> 00:01:17,504
<i>♫ Childish and unromantic ♫</i>

20
00:01:17,504 --> 00:01:25,103
<i>♫ You're my destined angel ♫</i>

21
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:35,023
<i>♫ You're my destined angel ♫</i>

22
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,080
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>

23
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,462
You're awake.

24
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,299
Good, your fever is gone.

25
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,037
General Manager.

26
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,307
Where am I?

27
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,574
Don't worry.

28
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,676
You're in my home.

29
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,216
Last night you had a nightmare in your sleep.

30
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,085
I worried you might hurt yourself,

31
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,853
so I had to hold you.

32
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,756
I'm sorry, General Manager.

33
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,258
I've caused you trouble again.

34
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,259
I will leave right now.

35
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,361
It's two o'clock at midnight.

36
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,730
I can't possibly let you take a cab home alone.

37
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,467
Do you want Yang to come and pick you up

38
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,535
at this hour?

39
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,271
Or…

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,607
Do you want to cause me more trouble?

41
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,914
Stay here tonight.

42
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,964
- General Manager.
- Stay still.

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,232
Sit up.

44
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,236
Here you go.

45
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,775
Go ahead.

46
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,990
Slow down. Don't choke.

47
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,191
Have some milk.

48
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,372
General Manager, do you want some?

49
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,709
It's too sweet.

50
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:04,844
I don't like it.

51
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,519
I'm full. Thank you, General Manager.

52
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,606
You're full?

53
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,074
Go to bed then.

54
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,480
General Manager,

55
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,115
are you going to sleep here?

56
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,283
This is my bedroom.

57
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,385
Where else should I go?

58
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,154
Then I'll sleep in the living room.

59
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,248
No, you can't.

60
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,492
What if you have a nightmare again?

61
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,527
Besides, you have a foot injury.

62
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,828
Don't move around.

63
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,600
Go to sleep.

64
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,149
Do you want me to tell you

65
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,283
a bedside story?

66
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,025
General Manager,

67
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,063
thank you for coming to save me today.

68
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,832
How did you know where I was?

69
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,804
The phone issued by the company
has a GPS installed

70
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,040
in case there's an emergency,

71
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,675
and we know your whereabouts.

72
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,612
What will happen to Han afterward?

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,716
He was arrested by the Police,

74
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,684
and whatever should happen will happen.

75
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,686
General Manager, he's really not a bad guy.

76
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,288
Can you please let this go?

77
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,924
- I'm really fine.
- If so, you wouldn't have nightmares.

78
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,493
If you're fine, how did you
get your foot injury?

79
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,495
Don't lie to me and say
you weren't scared at that time.

80
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,798
I've been through it too.

81
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:10,303
I've experienced the feeling
of fear and helplessness.

82
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,511
Although I was successfully rescued afterward,

83
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,914
for the person who ever got kidnapped,

84
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,550
it never goes away.

85
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:28,555
The sound of the kidnapper's high heels
walking toward me,

86
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,375
her long nails sliding across my face,

87
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,394
and that icy touch.

88
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,829
Whenever the combined smell

89
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,048
of perfume and makeup gets closer,

90
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:41,434
it makes me sweaty and sick.

91
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,222
Even now, I still dream of that scene.

92
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:49,108
I have headaches and insomnia.

93
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,849
Ironically, all those secretaries
my mother chose for me

94
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,819
remind me of the woman who kidnapped me.

95
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:04,424
I know what it does to a person.

96
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,692
So,

97
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:11,197
I will never let the person who hurt you off.

98
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:13,900
Also,

99
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,903
I'll never let anything happen to you.

100
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,280
General Manager.

101
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,248
I'm sorry to have worried you.

102
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,320
You came to save me today

103
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:36,956
and took care of me all night.

104
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,958
You must be very tired.

105
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,897
It must have been really hard

106
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,468
for you to fight through it alone.

107
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:04,617
Actually, in a way, you could say
we are sharing the same sickness,

108
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,718
no,

109
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:06,919
we're comrades in arms.

110
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,022
And you even came to save me today.

111
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,024
You have no idea how cool you were

112
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:13,359
when you stormed in.

113
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,861
Alright. I got it.

114
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,029
It's 3 o'clock, go to bed now.

115
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,176
General Manager.

116
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,577
Stop talking.

117
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,112
Aren't you tired enough?

118
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,283
How remarkable it is for you

119
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,985
to become who you are now.

120
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,786
Okay, goodnight.

121
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,957
No, you're only a few years older than me,

122
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,759
but you've endured so much.

123
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:48,928
Go to sleep.

124
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,236
Normally, you look fierce

125
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,005
and indifferent,

126
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,042
but

127
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,177
whenever you need me,

128
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,712
I will definitely be there.

129
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,333
Although

130
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,569
my figure is not as good as yours,

131
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:14,387
my brain is not as good as yours,

132
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,524
and neither do I have a family background
or powerful connections.

133
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,800
Thank you.

134
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:19,585
Good morning.

135
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:25,291
I like the way you say good morning.

136
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,426
I'm sorry, General Manager.

137
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,928
I didn't mean to.

138
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,932
My phone.

139
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,376
It's 10 o'clock.

140
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,972
I'm late.

141
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,308
I've texted Lisa

142
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,328
saying you need more rest.

143
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:47,513
You can come to the office in the afternoon.

144
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,285
Can I go home first?

145
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,756
I want to take a shower and change my clothes.

146
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,636
Boss, I bought everything
according to the size you provided

147
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:12,071
The tags have been removed.

148
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,009
I'll wait for you downstairs.

149
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,288
Take the clothes.

150
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,265
If you need help,

151
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,533
just tell me.

152
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,602
Thank you, General Manager.

153
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,936
I'm fine by myself.

154
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,242
<i>Call?</i>

155
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,352
<i>Not call?</i>

156
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>Should I call?</i>

157
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:06,880
Brother.

158
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,196
How do I express gratitude to a person?

159
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,831
Who is it?

160
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,566
Don't worry about that.

161
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,285
You're calling me brother now.

162
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:18,104
Little brother, if I don't know anything,

163
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,505
how can I give you any advice?

164
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:25,411
Well, what if someone did something for you

165
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,879
that you're very grateful

166
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,149
and you hope that they are happy?

167
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,585
Usually, you give them a gift.

168
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:34,920
What kind of gift?

169
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,523
It depends on what they like.

170
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,342
Do I know this person?

171
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,559
Is it someone from the company?

172
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,496
Is it Shun?

173
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,671
Shunyu.

174
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,373
- Miss.
- You're here.

175
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,808
I've heard you got hurt. Is it serious?

176
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,077
- Let me see.
- I'm fine.

177
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,779
Thanks to the care from the General Manager,

178
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,014
- my injury is not serious anymore.
- Okay.

179
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,350
- The cold is also gone.
- Be careful.

180
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,018
The General Manager took care of you?!

181
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,853
I'm glad you are fine.

182
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,455
Now that the preparation

183
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,589
for the anniversary is almost done,

184
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,424
try to not overexert yourself.

185
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,193
Thank you, Miss.

186
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,061
I've been meaning to ask,

187
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:18,364
is there any special event
in the company today?

188
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,702
- Let's go in first.
- Take it slow.

189
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,106
Careful, go slower.

190
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,986
The new employee
from the Secretary's Office, Yao Shunyu,

191
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,923
got involved in this bungled
kidnapping incident due to an accident,

192
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,358
during which his brave
and self-sacrificing spirit

193
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,560
is deeply touching,

194
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,528
and an award is hereby presented.

195
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,931
The Shun you mentioned?

196
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,732
So that's him.

197
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,067
Let brother give you a hand.

198
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,605
The General Manager gives the award in person.

199
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,707
The General Manager presents the award.

200
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:08,547
Come on.

201
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,685
Come on, look this way and say cheese.

202
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,637
- Cheese…
- Hold on.

203
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,156
Why do you have to be so serious
and formal when taking pictures?

204
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,226
Expressing gratitude
should be a bit more sincere.

205
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:26,565
Hug.

206
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,600
Dear Shunyu,

207
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,134
The General Manager has spread his arms wide.

208
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,337
- Hurry up and hug him.
- Hug.

209
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:33,706
Shunyu, don't leave
the General Manager hanging.

210
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,675
Hug.

211
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,751
- Sofia, can you take a picture?
- I will.

212
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,920
Look at each other.

213
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,255
- Come on.
- Look at each other.

214
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,961
Hold him properly, General Manager.

215
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,097
- Hurry up.
- That's right.

216
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,600
Come on.

217
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,335
Everyone, get ready.

218
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,704
Three two one.

219
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,473
Fire the cannon.

220
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,810
It's so hot.

221
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,647
Is the air conditioning not on? It's so hot.

222
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,762
Hello, Boss.

223
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,998
General Manager, I can go home by myself.

224
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,202
You got hurt because of me.

225
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:38,938
Before your foot heals,

226
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,539
the company will pick you up
for and after work.

227
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,674
Is there a problem?

228
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,842
No.

229
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,144
Get in the car then.

230
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,999
Um, thank you, General Manager.

231
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,334
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

232
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,235
Goodbye.

233
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,339
Get up.

234
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,041
Where are we going?

235
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,344
Get up here.

236
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,513
No need for that.

237
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,282
I can walk home by myself.

238
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,950
Don't make me say it a third time.

239
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,085
Get up.

240
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,240
General Manager.

241
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,642
Am I heavy?

242
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,845
No.

243
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,147
But if you stay in this position,

244
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,449
it'll make me feel like I'm a horse.

245
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,251
I will be more comfortable
if you lower yourself.

246
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,093
General Manager.

247
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:12,848
The clothes I'm wearing aren't cheap, right?

248
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:14,466
What do you think?

249
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,135
I bought them before.

250
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,137
If I don't wear them,
they'll just be thrown away.

251
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:21,373
Did you buy the wrong size?

252
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,675
Where do you live?

253
00:17:29,878 --> 00:17:32,000
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>

254
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,621
There is water here.

255
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,523
And…

256
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,925
General Manager.

257
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,361
I don't have black coffee at home.

258
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,096
Do you want tea instead?

259
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,468
Go sit down.

260
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,131
<i>Everyone, get ready.</i>

261
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,168
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

262
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
<i>Fire the cannon.</i>

263
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,120
<i>Good morning.</i>

264
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,896
Do you have something to say?

265
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,232
Um…

266
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,733
General Manager.

267
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,571
Do you ever feel like our distance

268
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:07,906
is too close?

269
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,391
Is it bad?

270
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,631
Do you not like it?

271
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,537
Or…

272
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:43,242
- You don't want to?
- You are the top leader in the company.

273
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,110
It's better to keep a distance
from your employees.

274
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,646
After all, there could be rumors,

275
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,214
so it's better for you this way.

276
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,851
What if I think it's fine?

277
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:01,860
<i>Did I</i>

278
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,912
<i>push it too far?</i>

279
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,073
I'm hungry.

280
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,677
Do you have anything good to eat here?

281
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,432
Okay.

282
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,260
I'm sorry, General Manager.

283
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,396
I haven't been shopping for groceries recently,

284
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,831
so there is not much to cook in the fridge.

285
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,409
How about these?

286
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:54,212
Okay.

287
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,481
Please sit on the couch.

288
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,549
<i>He got so scared he hid away.</i>

289
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,055
<i>So this is how it feels</i>

290
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,656
<i>for a mouse to be stared by a cat.</i>

291
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,461
<i>Or did I</i>

292
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,466
<i>do anything wrong just now?</i>

293
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,306
<i>He's the General Manager.</i>

294
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,308
<i>Don't flatter yourself.</i>

295
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,345
<i>I made it so obvious.</i>

296
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,814
<i>Would he be so dumb not to see it?</i>

297
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,516
<i>Or should I</i>

298
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,518
<i>be more straightforward?</i>

299
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:49,261
<i>He's probably kidding.</i>

300
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,130
<i>Yao Shunyu, you must not take it seriously.</i>

301
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,857
<i>You're mine.</i>

302
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,259
<i>How could I let you run away?</i>

303
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,946
Although I'm your employee,

304
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,447
you can't make endless demands.

305
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,049
I...

306
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,617
am scared that you'll disappear.

307
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,686
What does he think of me?

308
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:49,788
A toy or a stress reliever?

309
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,923
Where can you find a boss
who treats you so well?

310
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:53,225
I treat you very well too.

311
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:56,311
But I can't stay by your side 24/7.

312
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:57,562
Move in with me.

313
00:24:58,451 --> 00:25:05,239
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

314
00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:13,176
<i>♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫</i>

315
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:20,365
<i>♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫</i>

316
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:27,654
<i>♫ When will I ever learn ♫</i>

317
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:31,839
<i>♫ A future that's further than forever ♫</i>

318
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:35,390
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

319
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:39,065
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

320
00:25:39,065 --> 00:25:42,990
<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>

321
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,616
<i>♫ Crossing mountains and rivers in memories ♫</i>

322
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:52,589
<i>♫ All my longings for you ♫</i>

323
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:58,506
<i>[You Are Mine]</i>
<i>♫ And that childish face ♫</i>
