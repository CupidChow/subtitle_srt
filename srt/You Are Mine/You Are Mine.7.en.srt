Then let's arrange it this way.

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:02,769
The two of them can share a room.

3
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,571
I think it's a good idea.

4
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,006
We are discussing about the rooms
in the hot spring hotel,

5
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,807
such as who will be sharing a room.

6
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,810
<i>[How about the General Manager?]</i>
Of course, he will have his own room.

7
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,547
We're almost done, right?

8
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,182
Let's go.

9
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,484
Who arranged this list?

10
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,754
Why is Yao Shunyu
sharing a room with Li Huiwang?

11
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,089
<i>[Would you share a room with an employee?]</i>
He is my secretary, what do you think?

12
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,491
Why not share one with you?

Hello, Miss Lisa.

23
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,474
You look great in these shaping jogging pants.

24
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:15,809
Not only is your belly gone,

25
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:16,876
but your butt is also more lifted.

26
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:18,044
Is that so?

27
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,380

It seems to be true.

Although it's tight,

31
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,486
it feels cool on my body.

32
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,755
Wearing it in Summer won't be a problem.

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,657
We'll ask you to shoot

Here you go.

38
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,134
Didn't you mention that
your mother sells breakfast

39
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,403
and her legs would be
sore after standing all day?

40
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,637
This is for you.

41
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,372
It has an X-knitting method at the knee

42

and the most popular graphene material,

43
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,845
which can soothe discomfort
in the legs and knees.

But my mother doesn't
have a good figure like you

48
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,256
and she probably can't fit into it.

49
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,693
No.

50
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,796
Thankfully, these shaping jogging pants
are one-size-fits-all,

51
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,397

Do you have anyone you like in the company?

55

- Sofia.

No, thank you.

How does the General Manager go there?

63
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,627
Of course, he goes alone.

64
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,428
He won't bother to take the bus with us.

65
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:43,463

Where are you guys sitting?

73
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,060
Why so far away?

74
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,296
It makes me look like a loner.

75
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,597
You're not a loner.

76
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,833

that people reserve seats for you.

The drive will be about two hours
and fifteen minutes.

80

You'll be more comfortable sitting alone.

83
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,508
I'll go to the back.

84
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,345
Sit down.

85
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,794
General Manager,
I thought you were driving there.

86
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,196
It's too far.

87
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,565
You have a driver, and it's not like
you are driving yourself.

88

93

<i>They didn't misunderstand anything, did they?</i>

94
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,382
We are going out to play!

95
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,595
Did you not sleep well again?

96
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,899
I'm fine.

97
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,470
It's more comfortable
to take the car by yourself.

98
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,605
Why take the bus with us?

99
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:44,911
Alright then.

100
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,881
You can lean on here.

101
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,949
It should be more comfortable.

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,352
You are short.

103
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,353
Sit higher.

104
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,954
It's good to have a place to lean on.

105
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,189
Stop complaining.

106
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,995
It should be reserved for my girlfriend.

107
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,164
Who allowed you to have a girlfriend?

108
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,272
A boyfriend is not allowed either.

109
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,502
Don't be in a bad mood
because you didn't sleep well.

110
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,070
There are still many employees in the car.

111
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,372
Go to sleep.

112
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,774
Don't affect the mood of the staff later
when you get off the bus.

113
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,279
Go to sleep.

Let's take a picture.

126
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,949
Come on.

127
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,422
I hope I can

Which one is my room?

131
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,133
I didn't hear it just now.

132
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,768
The General Manager
has already taken your room card.

133
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:49,902
You are staying with him.

134
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,390
Isn't the General Manager
supposed to have a room for himself?

135
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,908
This is the benefit I fought for everyone,

136
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,811
but you guys shoved him to me?

137
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,679
I'd rather go hiking.

138
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,680
No.

139
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,483
Shunyu, how about this? After dinner,

140
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,218
just pretend to be going out with us

141
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,620
so you won't have to sleep
with the General Manager.

142
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,191
We all are salary earners.

143
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,393
Since the General Manager has chosen you,

144
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,229
you should hurry over there.

145
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,930
He is already waiting.

146
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,629
Why does it feel like we are

147
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:55,368

148
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,638

<i>A staff trip doesn't happen every day,</i>

150

<i>but I'm stuck with the General Manager.</i>

151
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,419
<i>How is this different from working?</i>

152
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,888
I'm sorry, General Manager.

153
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,567
Are you reluctant?

154
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:29,702
No.

155
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,103
Not at all.

156
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,473
I am flattered.

There's an outdoor hot spring bath!

160
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,860
And the water is still running.

161
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,495
I don't know if it will be too hot.

162
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,213
Shall we go in together?

163
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,160
<i>The is a small room.</i>

164
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,428
<i>Where can you hide?</i>

165
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,413
I'll go take a shower first.

166
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:56,522
<i>Why is he… why is he taking a shower?</i>

167
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,958
<i>A hot spring. Together.</i>

168
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,027
<i>A pair.</i>

169
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,328
<i>Love.</i>

170
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:38,964
<i>And also…</i>

171
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,601
Condoms.

172
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,744
<i>Is this decoration somewhat mistaken?</i>

173
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,153
The General Manager explained last time,

174
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,988
that he only impulsively approached me

175
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,491
because of the previous kidnap incident.

176
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,533
But why are these things here?

177
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,316
Company acquisition rule 101,

178
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,218
release goodwill.

179
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,652
The second step,

180
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,755
let the other party understand our advantages.

181
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,974
What am I doing?

182
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,315
Hello, Miss.

183
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,495
OK. I understand.

184
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,241
<i>He's pulling this stunt.</i>

185
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,943
<i>Emm…</i>

186
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:32,244
<i>Seduction.</i>

187
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,084
<i>Stay calm. Yao Shunyu.</i>

188
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,555
<i>You must stay calm.</i>

189
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,207
General Manager, hey…

190
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,875
You better go in the hot springs quickly,

191
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,744
because frequent changes in temperature

192
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:06,312
can make you catch a cold.

193
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,824
So this is your type.

194
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,827
No.

195
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,495
That's not true.

196
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,436
<i>Are you posing for a magazine?</i>

197
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,543
<i>But the General Manager's figure</i>

198
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,546
<i>is really good.</i>

199
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:43,649
The pool is quite large.

200
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,017
Come in with me.

201
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,953
Stop.

202
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,054
Actually,

203
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,023
the Secretary's Office
has called for a meeting,

204
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,391
so I'll go down first.

205
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,296
<i>Does he hate to stay by my side?</i>

206
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,646
You're also alone.

207
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,214
Were you abandoned?

208
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,751
- So close.
- I almost had it in my mouth.

209
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,219
One more time.

210
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,325
Are you playing dumb or do you not understand?

211
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,133
It's Lisa's fault. I got it on camera.

212
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,936
Don't just film her, film me too.

213
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,304
Get ready.

214
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,707
One more.

215
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,442
One, two, three.

216
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,278
Almost, almost. You didn't catch it for once.

217
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,280
- One more.
- One, two, three.

218
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,184
I'm awesome, so amazing!

219
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,752
I'm awesome.

220
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,054
This is workplace bullying.

221
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,323
- Stop it.
- Workplace bullying.

222
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,158
Help.

223
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,359
Shunyu is gone.

224
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,964
<i>So this is how you're like</i>

225
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,849
<i>when I'm not around.</i>

226
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,206
What's wrong with everyone?

227
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,641
Cheer up.

228
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,675
Miss, give me more.

229
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,844
General Manager.

230
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,746
The General Manager is in the room
taking a hot spring bath.

231
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,282
No.

232
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,605
<i>Am I making things hard for him?</i>

233
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,313
Where are you going again?

234
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,015
I wanted to get you something to eat.

235
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,282
I'm afraid you'll be hungry.

236
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,362
I'm alright. General Manager.

237
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,798
I really am.

238
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,034
You can keep the towel.

239
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,468
Look at you,

240
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,871
coming down here with your hair wet.

241
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,939
You already get headaches

242
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,574
and you're going to worsen it with this.

243
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,452
You seemed very happy with them.

244
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:43,262
I know I'm difficult to deal with.

245
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,331
That's because I've been
like this since childhood.

246
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,034
Give me a bit more time.

247
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,372
Of course.

248
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,874
The Secretary's Office has been saying

249
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,709
that your temper has improved a lot.

250
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,948
By the way, about that kidnapper last time,

251
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,600
I decided to let him go.

252
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,085
Really?

253
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,053
Are you willing to let Mr. Han go?

254
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,757
Didn't you want that?

255
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,694
Thank you, General Manager.

256
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,312
Right.

257
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,933
This is for you.

258
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,768
For me?

259
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:32,144
An insurance contract?

260
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,115
I know it's hard and dangerous

261
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,382
to work around me,

262
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,651
so I got you covered
with a couple of insurances.

263
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,487
I hope to provide you with more protection.

264
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,425
What my parents really want

265
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:49,228
is a son who is safe and uninjured.

266
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,796
That's okay. You can see if it's enough,

267
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,831
and if it's not, I can have someone handle it.

268
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,899
It'll be quick.

269
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,103
Thank you, General Manager.

270
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,876
It is my responsibility

271
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,577
to take care of my employees.

272
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,312
Don't worry.

273
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,516
I won't let anything happen to you again.

274
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,553
Trust me.

275
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,391
<i>So is this your way of comforting me?</i>

276
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,229
Let me get you something warm.

277
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,435
Good day, General Manager.

278
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,683
Are you tired or unhappy?

279
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,020
Did the General Manager

280
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,621
have any special requests for you?

281
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,391
Special requests?

282
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,495
If the General Manager
asked you to be his mistress,

283
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,013
just…

284
00:19:58,013 --> 00:19:59,982
Don't listen to her nonsense.

285
00:19:59,982 --> 00:20:02,701
You're drunk and talking
nonsense after one cocktail.

286
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,939
For a person like the General Manager,

287
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,976
whatever he does should have a goal, right?

288
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,580
Especially when it
comes to contract relationships.

289
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,284
He's just insecure.

290
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:20,719
It's his habit.

291
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,822
He wants to keep his accounts clear
so as not to have trouble later.

292
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:27,826
Is it because of the kidnapping
when he was young?

293
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,966
You're really special to him.

294
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,567
So bear with him.

295
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,669
He often says he's poor
and all he has is money.

296
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,005
Okay, I'll bear with him.

297
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:44,042
He can give the money
to someone like me who really needs it.

298
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,712
You're so young.

299
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:47,946
Why do you need money so much?

300
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:51,283
I want to free my parents
from selling breakfasts.

301
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,785
You have no idea how tiring it is.

302
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,490
You're so thoughtful.

303
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,858
Thank you, Miss.

304
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,038
Hello, Vice President, why didn't you come?

305
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,007
Your heartless General Manager

306
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,608
made me go on a business trip on short notice.

307
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,343
Have you guys had dinner yet?

308
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:20,612
Maybe in a while.

309
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,614
Is there anything I need to be aware of?

310
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,252
How well do you hold your liquor?

311
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:29,354
I'm alright.

312
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:33,225
How about 500 yuan
for every drink you take for him?

313
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,293
It's happening.

314
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:34,693
Let's go.

315
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:37,162
<i>Don't let the General Manager drink.
Drink for him.</i>

316
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,530
<i>Lisa is allergic,</i>

317
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,066
<i>and the others can't hold their liquor.</i>

318
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,200
It's my turn.

319
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,335
Cheers.

320
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,370
- Bottoms up then.
- This young man can drink.

321
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,105
Let's go. Drink up.

322
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:51,777
Drink.

323
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,479
Come on, another round.

324
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,082
Another round.

325
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,085
Drink up.

326
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,554
- Stop drinking.
- Drink up.

327
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,523
Director Taijian.

328
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:05,657
Hello.

329
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,925
You've had a lot.

330
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,161
And Shunyu has also had too much.

331
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,929
- We'll take him home first.
- I'm not drunk.

332
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,332
Come on, drink more.

333
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,600
General Manager.

334
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,557
Are you okay?

335
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,327
I'm fine.

336
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:20,992
Wait.

337
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,169
I'm not fine.

338
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,375
<i>General Manager.</i>

339
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,914
<i>What am I</i>

340
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,683
<i>to you?</i>

341
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,933
I just don't want my existence

342
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,769
to be a burden to the General Manager.

343
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,970
To the next owner of this cheat book,

344
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,039
please make sure

345
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,841
to take good care of the General Manager.

346
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,977
We were originally from two different worlds.

347
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,980
I fell for the General Manager.

348
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,181
So…

349
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,082
<i>Were you always planning on leaving?</i>

350
00:24:12,102 --> 00:24:18,890
<i>♫ Sometimes I feel like such a failure ♫</i>

351
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:26,827
<i>♫ Reluctantly I chose to let you go ♫</i>

352
00:24:26,827 --> 00:24:34,016
<i>♫ I deserve it for being too generous ♫</i>

353
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:41,305
<i>♫ When will I ever learn ♫</i>

354
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:45,490
<i>♫ A future that's further than forever ♫</i>

355
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:49,041
<i>♫ A love more persistent than the stars ♫</i>

356
00:24:49,044 --> 00:24:52,716
<i>♫ Without your guidance ♫</i>

357
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:56,641
<i>♫ How can I have hopes ♫</i>

358
00:24:56,641 --> 00:25:00,267
