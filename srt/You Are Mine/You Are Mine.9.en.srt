00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,433
(Cat-petting Group
Exclusive Interview PART9)

2
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:04,467
(Have you ever been chased before?)
I wonder if anything will be harder

3
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,567
than managing a company?

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,467
Gotta give him the best.

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,700
(Feels like the style is different today
and the watch is particularly expensive?)

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
This is

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,633
picked by the president.

8
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:18,300
He said being his secretary

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,833
has to live up to a certain standard.

10
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:22,033
(How are you feeling now
coming back to work?) It seems like

11
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:24,500
someone is my sugar daddy.

12
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,833
Never mind.

13
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,933
These things will pass.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,800
(Episode 9:
I like it because it feels safe)

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
You Are Mine

16
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,533
I can't afford a certain

17
00:01:13,633 --> 00:01:14,867
type of affection

18
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:16,200
I wouldn't even dare ask it.

19
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,700
So I couldn't buy a certain

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
type of affection

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,267
I couldn't buy it.

22
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:32,733
Why did you just take off the other day?

23
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,167
I've already quit.

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,933
And there's nothing you want to say to me?

25
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:45,300
I offer you no sense of security?

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,233
Why didn't you tell me when you were drunk?

27
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:48,333
And you explained nothing
when you were sober.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,367
I'm sorry, president.

29
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,567
I was drunk that day.

30
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:59,200
Please don't take it to heart.

31
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,033
Why did you quit?

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,533
Many are far better than me.

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,300
Just go find another secretary.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,567
Shunyu.

35
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,067
What if I only want you?

36
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,633
You only want me?

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,400
But I don't necessarily want you.

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,100
Besides, you're...

39
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:50,367
the president.

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,967
This is really not okay.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,633
Please just give me a break.

42
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,967
Alright.

43
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,433
If we really are just
employer and employee.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,133
Then fine.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,100
This is the contract you signed
when you first came in.

46
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:19,333
It says you have to stay for a year

47
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,200
or else you're gonna
pay ten times your salary.

48
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,700
Since we're doing this

49
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,967
let's just keep it professional.

50
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:31,833
Either you pay damages

51
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:33,567
or keep being my secretary.

52
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
I know you're gonna be mad
at the way I do things

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,067
but that's the only way to keep you.

54
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,433
It's not that you don't know

55
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,400
how tough our president is.

56
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,767
Not letting you go
means he cares about you.

57
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,700
Don't overthink it.

58
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,767
If something really happens

59
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:13,267
he will be sure to deal it for you.

60
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,133
But I don't want to.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,833
I'm not even planning to have some

62
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,200
grand romantic relationship.

63
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:25,533
Whenever I think about the things
I have to deal with.

64
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,767
I'm terrified.

65
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
You are terrified of trouble

66
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,167
for you or for him?

67
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,433
Is it possible to ask
the VP to talk to him?

68
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,800
I can't stay

69
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,833
but I don't have that kind of money either.

70
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,933
Huai-Wan.

71
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,200
He already helped you once.

72
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,067
It didn't work.

73
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:58,600
You are crazy.

74
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,833
What president would change a contract?

75
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:05,900
Transfer Lisa to the business department.

76
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,600
She reports every detail to you, anyways.

77
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,100
We were being nice
to bring Shunyu here

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,567
I reminded you that
you had to treat him well.

79
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,300
You ended up scaring him away.

80
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,333
What?

81
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:17,500
Now this forged contract?

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,367
Forcing him to stay?

83
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,733
Do you feel no shame?

84
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,000
I know that I screwed up.

85
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:29,233
I just want a chance to make it up.

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,767
I can't just let him go.

87
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:33,933
Otherwise, he wouldn't come back.

88
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:37,300
Shang-Zhou.

89
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,800
The world does not revolve around you.

90
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,767
I don't want to care anymore.

91
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,333
So...

92
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,067
there's only one way left.

93
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,500
You have to come up with a way
to embarrass him

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,833
to the point where he asks you to leave.

95
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,667
Alright.

96
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:10,067
Alright.

97
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:23,567
President.

98
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,067
Can I go out now?

99
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,500
Yang bought too much breakfast.

100
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:37,467
These are for you.

101
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,367
I just ate.

102
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,567
You did?

103
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,800
You seemed to have lost some weight.

104
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,967
Is there anything you'd
like to ask me to do?

105
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,100
President.

106
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,033
Can I go out now?

107
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,425
Now you're asking to leave
whenever you open your mouth.

108
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,733
Are you that unhappy to be with me?

109
00:08:21,533 --> 00:08:23,233
I'm having a headache again.

110
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:28,200
Can you rub it for me?

111
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,533
President.

112
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,200
The job I applied to was a secretary.

113
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,267
If you're going to ask me

114
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:36,967
to do tasks that go beyond my expertise

115
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:39,100
I'm gonna have to charge extra money.

116
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,767
Desperate for money, huh.

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Okay.

118
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,200
Give me a price

119
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,300
I'll pay it.

120
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,700
Thank you, president.

121
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,200
Since he's being this generous

122
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,733
it's a waste if I don't take it.

123
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:10,867
Right?

124
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,333
How much does this cost?

125
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,167
How about this?

126
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,367
Name a price.

127
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,600
I can afford it.

128
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:30,500
Shunyu.

129
00:10:31,433 --> 00:10:32,600
VP

130
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,900
What?

131
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,600
Thank you, VP.

132
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,267
Shang-Zhou got you upset?

133
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,133
Well, no.

134
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,567
Quite the opposite.

135
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,167
I made the president upset.

136
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,667
I would love to see

137
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,467
something this spectacular.

138
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,733
VP, did you have a
fight with the president?

139
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,167
I wasn't cool with him a long time ago.

140
00:11:31,267 --> 00:11:33,667
He is bossy and grumpy.

141
00:11:33,767 --> 00:11:34,300
Self-centered.

142
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,733
Not at all, VP.

143
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:38,367
He must be upset for a reason.

144
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:40,067
It's not personal.

145
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:46,100
Then what would you think about someone
who keeps things professional

146
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
if he did something personal to a person?

147
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,900
What would be the reason?

148
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,533
It's not a wrong thing

149
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,067
to put damages in the contract.

150
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,733
I just didn't read it thoroughly.

151
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:02,967
Go ask any other employees in Xias company

152
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,100
to see if anyone has this clause

153
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,467
in the employment contract.

154
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,967
Then why did the president...

155
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,467
Why.

156
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,133
Yeah, I had no idea.

157
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,167
He wanted to force someone to stay

158
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,800
so he had the nerve to change the contract.

159
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,100
It was my first time
to see him this rattled.

160
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,167
But he made you stay
with that kind of tactic.

161
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,067
He deserves it, right?

162
00:12:36,267 --> 00:12:37,633
I bet you must've heard the gossip

163
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:38,867
that president's mother

164
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:40,800
is very bossy and dominant.

165
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:43,367
That kid grew up

166
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:44,700
around his mother's elite education.

167
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,467
He was asked to be better than everyone

168
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,400
without showing a trace of his emotions.

169
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,800
Well.

170
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,033
He never knows how to express himself

171
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:56,200
because no one taught him to.

172
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:00,267
I'm not sure

173
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:02,700
if anyone would go this far and beyond

174
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,833
just to play around with someone.

175
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,467
Playing around.

176
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,967
Shang-Zhou told you this.

177
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,833
Did you confirm this with him?

178
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
The Shang-Zhou I know

179
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,733
doesn't know how to do that,
let alone how to play around.

180
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,967
So...

181
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:28,933
the president is really
trying to make me stay.

182
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,833
Sign this.

183
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,767
I did knock on the door.

184
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,867
Some business went wrong in Japan

185
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,567
I gotta take care of it later.

186
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,567
Oh, and

187
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:08,567
the chairman asked about
your relationship a couple of days ago.

188
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,167
She started to get suspicious.

189
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,767
No matter what she discovers

190
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,967
it would put Shunyu in a hard position.

191
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,500
When you did this to me

192
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,267
was it for affection or for fun?

193
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:32,600
The worst-case scenario of the merger

194
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,100
would be putting a promising company

195
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,967
on the road to self-destruction.

196
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,567
before the merger even happened.

197
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,667
I lost that Shunyu

198
00:14:47,767 --> 00:14:49,167
who loved to smile

199
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,733
and got content easily.

200
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:57,633
I already told Shunyu

201
00:14:57,733 --> 00:14:59,267
about the contract.

202
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,033
Got it.

203
00:15:09,433 --> 00:15:11,100
Then go take good care of it.

204
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,433
You looked for me?

205
00:15:22,533 --> 00:15:23,367
I'm going out

206
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,000
I won't be back by tomorrow.

207
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
You can just leave
after you finish your work.

208
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,267
I approved the resignation letter
you handed to me.

209
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:32,133
As for the handover procedure

210
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:33,600
I'd ask Lisa to take care of it.

211
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,600
President.

212
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:43,133
Why did you do it?

213
00:15:44,633 --> 00:15:46,467
Didn't Huei-Wan tell you everything?

214
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,500
There were no damages at all.

215
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,200
So...

216
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,567
just go if you want to.

217
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:12,867
Then why did you do that?

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,733
Why do you think I did this, huh?

219
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,733
And what do you expect from me?

220
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,567
I did this for fun

221
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:29,900
and to keep you, a dumb
little lamb, around me?

222
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,500
Or.

223
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:33,967
I did this to have sex with you

224
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,867
after I got drunk?

225
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:38,733
In your eyes

226
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,100
am I not that kind of person?

227
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,600
What does changing a contract

228
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:48,507
even mean then?

229
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,933
If that's what you want.

230
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,400
I'd give it to you.

231
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:13,767
Shunyu.

232
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,233
You are free.

233
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,067
Playing around?

234
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,633
Did Shang-Zhou tell you this?

235
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,467
You confirmed this with him.

236
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,867
The Shang-Zhou I know

237
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:48,300
let alone playing around

238
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,233
he doesn't even know how to do that?

239
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:54,100
Ain't I that type of person?

240
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,567
Why'd you change the contract?

241
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:56,967
What does that even mean?

242
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,833
Am I free?

243
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:05,600
How come I'm not even happy at all?

244
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,633
Can you dodge this?

245
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,367
If that's what you want.

246
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,833
I'd give it to you.

247
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:53,867
Shunyu.

248
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,033
You are free.

249
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,833
I offered you zero sense of security?

250
00:19:18,933 --> 00:19:20,500
You didn't tell me you were drunk

251
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,767
and you didn't explain anything
when you were sober.

252
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:27,900
I always thought affection
meant differently to him than me.

253
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
He's really great and confident.

254
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
He must do this for fun to tease me.

255
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,067
President.

256
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:42,700
He's out of my league

257
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,133
I thought he just wanted to have

258
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:47,000
a burden-free romantic relationship.

259
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,333
As long as you're okay.

260
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,067
Why didn't I believe
that he is in for real?

261
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,967
Because I'm a coward and not confident

262
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,567
without having any securities.

263
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:12,800
I'm just a self-centered idiot

264
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,033
I don't want freedom

265
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:15,433
I want you.

266
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:19,000
Xia Shang-Zhou.

267
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,833
Xia Shang-Zhou.

268
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,367
Xia Shang-Zhou.

269
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,767
Pick up the phone.

270
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,800
Hi.

271
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,833
Hello, sis.

272
00:21:18,933 --> 00:21:19,500
Um.

273
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
Do you know the president's schedule today?

274
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,233
I'm looking for him.

275
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,600
President?

276
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,500
He was abroad. What's wrong?

277
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,900
Do you want to get hold of the VP first?

278
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,900
Abroad?

279
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:32,633
Where is he?

280
00:21:32,733 --> 00:21:33,633
Japan.

281
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,400
There's been a problem with the handover.

282
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,167
The VP was gonna be there.

283
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:39,133
He brought his suitcase
with him to the company

284
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,900
and the president said
he wanted to be there himself.

285
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,600
Huei-Wan was so pissed.

286
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,600
Who changed his mind at this last minute?

287
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,733
Last time he did it to dodge the chairman

288
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,200
but I'm not sure about
the reason this time.

289
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:53,333
Shunyu.

290
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,167
Are you alright?

291
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,867
I'm good.

292
00:21:57,633 --> 00:22:00,033
Did the president tell
you when he'd be back?

293
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,900
The fare of the return flight
hasn't been reimbursed.

294
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,533
But probably next week.

295
00:22:04,633 --> 00:22:06,667
Or you could just call him.

296
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,833
Right.

297
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,167
It doesn't necessarily make me happy

298
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:30,133
being stood up by someone.

299
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:15,467
Is it that spicy?

300
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,333
There was this one real and genuine love

301
00:23:27,433 --> 00:23:28,800
right in front of me.

302
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:31,700
But I didn't cherish it.

303
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:37,900
Now I have regretted the moment I lost it.

304
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:44,033
Not a thing in this world
can be more miserable than this.

305
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,100
In 1995.

306
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,433
Cinderella with the Journey to The West ending.

307
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,800
Joker.

308
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,300
Boss Gu.

309
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,000
Do you think there is real love

310
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,100
between a man and a man?

311
00:24:19,033 --> 00:24:22,600
Do you believe the matter of real love

312
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,467
should be discussed only
between man and man?

313
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,100
No?

314
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,367
Yes?

315
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:37,867
So.

316
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:42,233
You're saying that
if you meet someone you like

317
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:45,000
no matter how hard it gets ahead.

318
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,700
I should grab this person.

319
00:24:50,467 --> 00:24:52,233
Do you want a bowl of noodles?

320
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:53,833
It's on the house.

321
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,533
Thanks.

322
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:24,600
Lisa said you were looking for me.

323
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,967
I have a question for the president.

324
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:33,400
Since I'm not a clone of the president

325
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,367
I seriously have no idea.

326
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,167
Go ahead.

327
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:47,500
Why me, huh?

328
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:53,515
Didn't you say
I've got short legs and I'm stupid?

329
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:58,233
Why is it me?

330
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,300
Being around you

331
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,167
offers me a sense of security.

332
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:37,533
Growing up

333
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:39,167
everyone around me

334
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,367
all wanted me to be my best self

335
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:42,833
to be number one.

336
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,467
Because that's the only thing

337
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:46,567
that can fit their expectations and dreams.

338
00:26:47,867 --> 00:26:49,933
You are the first one

339
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:54,000
who stays with me during my most

340
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,533
vulnerable times.

341
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,333
For me

342
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:07,233
you are special.

343
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,233
I get it now.

344
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,067
(Final Episode)
After I met him, I realized

345
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,333
nothing else matters

346
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:44,967
without his presence here.

347
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:47,800
Do you have any idea how
embarrassed our family will be by you?

348
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,067
I like him.

349
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,233
That's why I am with him.

350
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:50,833
What exactly

351
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,367
does our relationship mean?

352
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:53,467
Then what do you think

353
00:27:53,567 --> 00:27:54,933
our relationship means?
