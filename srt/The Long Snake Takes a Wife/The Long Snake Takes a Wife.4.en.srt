1
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,879
Second Uncle

2
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,159
It's so late,

3
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,040
and you're still up?

4
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,319
The weather has turned cold.

5
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
Can your body handle sitting there?

6
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,239
Here,

7
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,640
have some wine

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,599
to warm yourself up.

9
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:51,799
Second Uncle.

10
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,159
Good.

11
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,799
When did you take on an apprentice?

12
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,040
Second Uncle,

13
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,280
you're getting on in years.

14
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,760
Be careful not to get scammed.

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,560
That girl Bailing

16
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,759
comes from a pitiful background.

17
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,759
Although she's usually a bit reckless,

18
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:19,479
she has a kind heart.

19
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,199
For a while,

20
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,280
she kept coming to the shop to help out.

21
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,680
Over time,

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:24,680
she just stayed on.

23
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,719
Second Uncle.

24
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,120
Come on.

25
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,479
Let me, let me, let me.

26
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm not betting on this.

27
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,199
Mine, mine.

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Still betting Big.

29
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,479
Mine, mine.

30
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,039
Bet Small.

31
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,199
Triple!

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,319
Do you think your luck is exceptionally good?

33
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,079
Nonsense.

34
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,600
This is the betrothal gift from Chang Xian'er.

35
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,839
However much you win

36
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,720
becomes the amount of the betrothal gift.

37
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,079
Choose the Red Invitation

38
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,800
or the Black Invitation?

39
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,399
What does the red one mean?

40
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,079
What does the black one mean?

41
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,600
Red means a violent death in three days.

42
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,120
Black means a violent death in five days.

43
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,560
Do you choose the red or the black?

44
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,800
Do you choose the red or the black?

45
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,879
I choose...

46
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,319
Bailing.

47
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,279
Wake up.

48
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,839
Let's go.

49
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,839
You're awake.

50
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,600
Are you all right?

51
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:34,720
I...

52
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,839
I think I saw a ghost just now.

53
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,360
You did see a ghost.

54
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,600
A Gambling Ghost.

55
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,839
Don't be so flashy from now on.

56
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,439
That was a Gambling Ghost just now.

57
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,839
It got jealous seeing you win money at the casino.

58
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,560
Luckily, I arrived in time.

59
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,839
How did you know I was here?

60
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,519
It seems you're really short on money.

61
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,720
What do you need money for?

62
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:02,600
None of your business.

63
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,399
Sister Bailing!

64
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,639
Xiao Shiliu.

65
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,839
What are you doing here?

66
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,399
Something bad happened.

67
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,040
Sister Bailing is back!

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
Sister Bailing!

69
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,959
So cute.

70
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,720
Why have you gotten so thin?

71
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:33,839
Come here.

72
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,639
Let me take a look.

73
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,360
Have you been good lately?

74
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,639
Yes.

75
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,920
Xiao Shiliu.

76
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,519
Here is the money for food this month.

77
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,639
Keep it safe.

78
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,160
So you were earning money

79
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,600
to support these children.

80
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,319
These children

81
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,360
are all homeless

82
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
and helpless orphans.

83
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,560
I'm the only family they have now.

84
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,879
Sister Bailing,

85
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,480
Xiao Jiu was taken by Ghost Sanniang.

86
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,000
What happened?

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,199
Last night,

88
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,839
while I was sleeping...

89
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,519
Baby be good,

90
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,399
baby come here.

91
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,120
Mother's treasure,

92
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
baby is here.

93
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
Come quickly

94
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
to Mother's embrace.

95
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,039
Mother will lift

96
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,679
baby up high.

97
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,840
Baby, come here.

98
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,960
Ghost Sanniang

99
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,000
Mm-hmm.

100
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is Ghost Sanniang?

101
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,000
In town, a while back,

102
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,200
there was a woman who sold tofu from a carrying pole.

103
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,799
Everyone called her San Niang.

104
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,200
San Niang was a warm-hearted person.

105
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,840
Everyone liked her very much.

106
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,679
Here you go.

107
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,159
Take care.

108
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,559
Thank you.

109
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,519
Until one day...

110
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,440
How is this? Is it enough?

111
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,039
It's enough.

112
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Mother's treasure is here...

113
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,799
Come quickly...

114
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,320
into Mother's arms.

115
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,159
Mother lifts her treasure up high.

116
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
She was a perfectly fine person.

117
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,279
How did she go mad?

118
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,200
It's truly tragic.

119
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,519
Baby.

120
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,519
Be careful.

121
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:13,840
Dad.

122
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,679
Come here, quick.

123
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,799
Child...

124
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,919
Dad!

125
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,720
You damn lunatic!

126
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,080
You scared my child!

127
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Let's go, quick.

128
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,519
Child...

129
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,200
My child...

130
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,000
What is this thing?

131
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,000
Not long after,

132
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,639
someone by the roadside

133
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,159
discovered San Niang's body.

134
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,559
They say that

135
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,639
San Niang's ghost, once night falls,

136
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,039
wanders all around.

137
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,600
When she sees a child she likes,

138
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,039
she takes them away.

139
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:21,200
Child...

140
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,240
Child...

141
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:28,120
My child...

142
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,639
There are no ghosts in the world,

143
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,759
only troubled hearts.

144
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,159
Rumors stop with the wise.

145
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,080
Since San Niang loved children so much,

146
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:36,840
how could she harm them?

147
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,919
You mean...

148
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,919
it wasn't San Niang's ghost that took Xiao Jiu?

149
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,320
In this world,

150
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
the human heart is scarier than ghosts.

151
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,799
Xiao Shiliu said that night,

152
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,639
San Niang took Xiao Jiu right through the main gate.

153
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,679
An adult.

154
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,120
With a limp.

155
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,360
What did you say?

156
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
Look at this footprint.

157
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,759
This size...

158
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:25,240
only an adult would have it.

159
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:26,919
And the depth of the left print

160
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:27,919
is deeper than the right.

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,360
It proves the left leg is lame.

162
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,080
Was San Niang a cripple?

163
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Bailing,

164
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
apart from Xiao Jiu and Xiao Shiliu,

165
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,240
are all the other children disabled?

166
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,320
Yes.

167
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,399
That explains it.

168
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,600
They take the healthy children away.

169
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,720
There must be some ulterior motive.

170
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,759
You mean...

171
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,919
they originally wanted to take Xiao Shiliu too,

172
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,559
but Xiao Shiliu managed to escape?

173
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,919
So,

174
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,519
they might...

175
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,559
come back again tonight.
