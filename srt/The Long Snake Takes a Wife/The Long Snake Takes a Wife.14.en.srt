1
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,080
Why?

2
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,520
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

3
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,479
Fine.

4
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,680
Fine.

5
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,360
Fine.

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,039
Fine.

7
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,759
Why?

8
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,759
Why did you lie to me?

9
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,360
San Yatou.

10
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,680
You don't love me.

11
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,400
Why did you give me hope?

12
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:19,599
I love you.

13
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,039
But...

14
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,680
If you love me, why leave?

15
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,120
Why leave without saying goodbye?

16
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,520
Sometimes,

17
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,439
love isn't as beautiful as you imagine.

18
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
San Yatou.

19
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,080
You don't know me.

20
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,199
I do know you.

21
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,319
Enough to love you.

22
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,319
Then right now,

23
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,879
do you still love me?

24
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,280
You wretched girl.

25
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
You won't pay back the Lai Mansion's money.

26
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,560
Instead you run here to flirt.

27
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,000
You refuse to enter the fine Lai Mansion,

28
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,800
but prefer this ugly freak.

29
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,560
Aren't you afraid of nightmares?

30
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:22,800
None of your business.

31
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,600
I can let him go.

32
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,560
But I have to deal with you.

33
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Come with me.

34
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,160
I didn't expect...

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,759
that he would leave me again without goodbye.

36
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,920
So I went out to look for him.

37
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,000
Later,

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,319
I heard he was arrested.

39
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,480
So I hurried back.

40
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,120
So the Lai Mansion's harassment...

41
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:56,759
was also to take revenge on him.

42
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,959
Let's leave together, okay?

43
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,240
To the ends of the earth.

44
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,399
We can go anywhere.

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,839
Love...

46
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,800
is indeed not just one person's effort.

47
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
But two people running towards each other.

48
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,399
Don't you agree?

49
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,720
Why does that sound so sarcastic?

50
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,040
What are you trying to say?

51
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,480
Talking to a blockhead like you...

52
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,399
can I even make it clear?

53
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,279
What do you mean?

54
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,600
Why are you walking so fast?

55
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,680
No, what exactly do you want to say?

56
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,959
Uncle Bao.

57
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,000
San Yatou!

58
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,680
San Yatou!

59
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,040
San Yatou!

60
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,759
Why did you have to do this?

61
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,759
Uncle Bao.

62
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,319
What exactly happened?

63
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,399
Yesterday, when San Yatou

64
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,040
returned home,

65
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,959
she locked herself in her room.

66
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,519
She wouldn't come out.

67
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,879
I thought she was upset,

68
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
and would be fine in a few days.

69
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,519
But last night...

70
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,080
Yatou

71
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,200
What are you doing?

72
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,559
Yatou

73
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,240
Yatou

74
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,480
Yatou

75
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,799
Yatou

76
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,799
What's wrong, Yatou?

77
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,799
The legends are all true.

78
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,840
If you violate the Ghost Opera Troupe's taboos,

79
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,240
your life will be taken away.

80
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:19,480
Oh, San Yatou.

81
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,480
Mr. Bai.

82
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,720
Mr. Bai.

83
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,240
Zhang Sheng, why are you here?

84
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,000
I felt like you had something to say that day.

85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,799
What is it?

86
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,480
Go ahead.

87
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,559
Actually...

88
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,720
The night of the performance at Ba Xian Tang,

89
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,679
Hongniang and I were there too.

90
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,440
Bravo!

91
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,399
Wonderful!

92
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,440
Bravo!

93
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,080
That's great!

94
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:08,960
Bravo!

95
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,519
Hongniang left for a while during the show.

96
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,080
But she came back very soon.

97
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:15,720
Where did you go?

98
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:16,639
What's wrong?

99
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,159
Let's watch the play.

100
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,639
Good.

101
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,759
Good.

102
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
It's just that...

103
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,000
she looked very pale.

104
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,679
I thought she was just tired,

105
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,000
so I didn't think much of it.

106
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,279
It seems...

107
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:32,480
it really has something to do with Ba Xian Tang.

108
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,720
Let's go to the theater again tomorrow.

109
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:02,519
After the incident with San Yatou,

110
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,559
this place was closed down.

111
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,919
Everyone is afraid of violating the taboos

112
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,960
and getting into trouble.

113
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
What are you doing here?

114
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,519
Master Xue.

115
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,159
Master Xue.

116
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,399
Long time no see.

117
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,919
Do you remember me?

118
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,519
I know you.

119
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,480
You're that kid from the Bai family

120
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,200
with the cursed fate.

121
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,279
Instead of working in your Yin-Yang Shop,

122
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,759
what are you doing here in my humble shop?

123
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,879
You also work in the spirit world.

124
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,120
The shop's rules...

125
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,799
No admittance for idlers.

126
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,240
Don't you know that?

127
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:50,960
Master Xue.

128
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:52,720
We...

129
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,559
we were worried that

130
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,080
being alone in this theater

131
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,720
might be lonely for you.

132
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,720
So,

133
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
we brought good wine and roast chicken.

134
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,840
Good wine.

135
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,679
Have another cup.

136
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,840
A rat paying respects to a cat...

137
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,600
What do you want? Speak.

138
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,200
Master Xue,

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,440
we actually just want to

140
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,120
ask about the Ghost Opera Troupe.

141
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,799
Half a month ago,

142
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:32,879
when they performed here,

143
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,320
was there anything

144
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,559
unusual that happened?

145
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,200
That night,

146
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,799
something strange really did happen.
