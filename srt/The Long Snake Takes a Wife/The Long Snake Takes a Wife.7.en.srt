1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,200
Rain on a sunny day

2
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,840
The Serpent's Wedding

3
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,480
This isn't real

4
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:42,599
Mother

5
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,239
I will definitely get justice for you

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,040
What is it?

7
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,439
Don't you want to know

8
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,920
the truth about The Serpent's Wedding?

9
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,840
I know a thing or two

10
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,920
Maybe I can

11
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,840
provide you with some clues

12
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:11,319
What clues?

13
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,360
That depends on how you behave

14
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,759
Fine

15
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,199
You don't have to pay back the money

16
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,159
We're even

17
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,199
It's a deal

18
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,240
Where exactly are you taking me?

19
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,199
Don't ask what you shouldn't ask

20
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,199
You'll know when we get there

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,360
Don't you want the clues?

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,919
On the Xiangjiang River flows the water

23
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,759
Underwater carp swim around

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
River hustlers

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,599
Hairless turtles

26
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,439
Was that secret code you spoke at the door?

27
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,400
Of course

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,479
This is an underground gambling den. You need a contact to enter.

29
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,800
You need a contact to enter.

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,120
The ones chasing you for debt last time

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
were from here, right?

32
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,159
You still dare to come back?

33
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,919
What's the big deal?

34
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,240
You paid off my debt for me

35
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:21,759
Why are you gambling already?

36
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,319
Hey

37
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,080
I won

38
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,599
I won

39
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,199
All in

40
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,719
Open, open, open

41
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:31,960
Bet on Big

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,680
Bet on Big

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,719
Dad

44
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,960
What exactly is going on?

45
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,240
What exactly happened to Hongniang?

46
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,479
Hongniang's ghost has come back for revenge

47
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,639
Hongniang's ghost has come back for revenge

48
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,000
What do you mean?

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,319
Retribution

50
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,519
Hongniang's ghost is back

51
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,519
Stop hitting him

52
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,360
If you don't pay the money

53
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,240
I'll break your legs

54
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,120
And I'll burn down your shop too

55
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
How about this

56
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,360
I'll give you another idea

57
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,279
Such a fresh-faced girl

58
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,519
if you sell her to Yanyue Lou

59
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,199
not only will your debt be cleared

60
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
you'll also make a small profit

61
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,399
I'll be back at this time tomorrow

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,199
Let's go

63
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,759
Dad

64
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,279
I'll beat you to death

65
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,759
I'll beat you to death

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,120
I'll beat you to death

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,040
Dad

68
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,399
Dad

69
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:07,920
Dad

70
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,600
Dad

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,399
Stop hitting me

72
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:09,759
Dad

73
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,279
You selling Hongniang to them,

74
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,040
isn't that forcing her to her death?

75
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,399
You

76
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,000
You shut your mouth

77
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
You good-for-nothing

78
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,439
If I didn't sell her

79
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:21,000
how could I pay your gambling debts?

80
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,279
If the gambling debts aren't paid

81
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,879
wouldn't they take your life?

82
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,399
Huh?

83
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,199
How about this

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I'll sell you to Yanyue Lou right now

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,240
Then we'll be even

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,160
Do you agree?

87
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,639
Don't

88
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,120
I don't agree

89
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,399
I'll keep hitting you

90
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,240
Beat you to death

91
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,800
Beat you to death

92
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,959
I have money

93
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,480
I have money

94
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,839
I have money

95
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,879
Let's go.

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,839
Ever since

97
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,480
Hongniang left that day,

98
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,759
she never came back.

99
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,480
So what you told us before was a lie.

100
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,079
You even claimed

101
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,839
Hongniang was taken by Chang Xian'er.

102
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,279
It was my father and me

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,160
who wronged Hongniang.

104
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
This isn't exactly honorable.

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,240
So,

106
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,560
everyone said she was taken by Chang Xian'er,

107
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,480
and I just went along with it.

108
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,480
You're the ones who killed Hongniang.

109
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,720
It wasn't me.

110
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,160
It really wasn't me.

111
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,800
I also hoped Hongniang

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,120
could get away.

113
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,120
It must be Hongniang's ghost

114
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,720
coming back for revenge.

115
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,279
How can you be so sure

116
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,720
that it's Hongniang's ghost causing trouble?

117
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,560
Because

118
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,759
someone saw Hongniang's ghost.

119
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,920
Who?

120
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,519
Zhang's Umbrella Shop's

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,439
Zhang Sheng.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,759
Hongniang really is quite pitiful.

123
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Li Laosan usually seems so quiet and reserved.

124
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,319
I didn't expect him to be so wicked.

125
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,120
Treating a person like an object

126
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,920
to be bought and sold.

127
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,519
The world these days

128
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,639
has really changed.

129
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,439
Whether it's the underworld or the law,

130
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,560
nothing beats the path of righteousness.

131
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,439
However,

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,920
Li Laosan's death was so strange.

133
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,160
Who had such a big grudge against him?

134
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,680
Could it be like what Heigou said,

135
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,639
that Hongniang's spirit lingers on?

136
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,480
Don't follow me

137
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,600
Don't follow me

138
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,439
Bailing

139
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,439
How is the investigation going?

140
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,240
Zhang Sheng

141
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,560
He was Hongniang's lover before

142
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,519
Before Hongniang died

143
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,319
she was with this Zhang Sheng

144
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,680
Didn't expect Hongniang's love life to be so colorful

145
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,439
Don't follow me

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
Holding an umbrella on a sunny day

147
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,839
Are you crazy?

148
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,480
Don't follow me

149
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't follow me

150
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't follow me

151
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:27,920
Don't pay attention to him

152
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,759
It's bad luck

153
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,800
Who is this person?

154
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,879
The shopkeeper of the umbrella shop ahead

155
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,840
Umbrella shopkeeper

156
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:35,799
Yes

157
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:36,799
Ma'am

158
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,519
Then why did you just say

159
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,159
it's bad luck?

160
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,440
Getting involved with the dead while alive

161
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,480
can't lead to anything good

162
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,919
Take my advice

163
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
Go to the temple and pray, quickly

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,799
Ma'am

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,799
We...

166
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,840
are Zhang Sheng's friends

167
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
What happened to him?

168
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,159
Tell us about it

169
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,039
This Zhang Sheng...

170
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,559
has been bewitched by a ghost

171
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,799
Don't follow me

172
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,639
A few days ago, Li Laosan's daughter, Hongniang

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
wasn't she taken away by Chang Xian'er?

174
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,919
This Hongniang was Zhang Sheng's lover

175
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,799
After Hongniang died

176
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,600
on the night of the seventh day

177
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,159
Blind Wang

178
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
was beating the watch on the street

179
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,399
The night is deep, the dew is heavy

180
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,799
The gates of the underworld open

181
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:26,200
The gates of the living are shut tight

182
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,840
Do not open them

183
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,080
The night is deep, the dew is heavy

184
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,279
The gates of the underworld open

185
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,080
The gates of the living are shut tight

186
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,519
Do not open them

187
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
Don't follow me

188
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
Don't follow me

189
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,240
Don't follow me

190
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,799
Don't follow me

191
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,240
Hey, umbrella shop guy

192
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,679
Darn it, it's not raining tonight

193
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:51,039
Why are you out with a red umbrella?

194
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,000
You're scaring people to death

195
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,559
Don't follow me

196
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,240
Zhang Sheng

197
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,960
I'm talking to you, why are you ignoring me?

198
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,279
I've bumped into a ghost in the middle of the night

199
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,159
Ghost!

200
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,679
Ghost!

201
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,759
After that day

202
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
the umbrella shop closed down

203
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,559
Zhang Sheng was sick for several days, too

204
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,440
before he recovered

205
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,200
Hongniang's spirit lingers

206
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,360
haunting Zhang Sheng

207
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,679
Zhang Sheng holding an umbrella on a sunny day

208
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,679
Could Hongniang's spirit really be lingering?

209
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,679
The blind man's words can't be trusted

210
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's go

211
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:45,399
Come with me and have a look
