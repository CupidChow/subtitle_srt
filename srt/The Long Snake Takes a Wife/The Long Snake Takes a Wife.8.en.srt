1
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Welcome.

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,079
You are...

3
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,640
We're looking for a suitable umbrella.

4
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,280
Please.

5
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,120
Feel free to look around.

6
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,000
Zhang's Umbrella Shop...

7
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,639
...was passed down from your ancestors, right?

8
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,479
I, Zhang Sheng, have failed the Zhang ancestors.

9
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,759
Zhang's Umbrella Shop has declined in my hands.

10
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,039
As far as I know,

11
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,319
umbrella making involves seventy-two steps.

12
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,080
Such exquisite craftsmanship...

13
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,759
...you must pass it on well.

14
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,960
This red umbrella looks very different.

15
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,199
This umbrella is indeed different from the others.

16
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,240
It can ward off evil.

17
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,560
This umbrella was made using an ancient method.

18
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,240
Modern umbrellas...

19
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
...are made in seventy-two steps.

20
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,479
The ancient method of umbrella making...

21
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,319
...uses eighty-six steps.

22
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,639
The secret lies in those extra fourteen steps.

23
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,800
These fourteen steps are called Divine Shrouding.

24
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,759
An oil-paper umbrella after Divine Shrouding...

25
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,080
...can ward off evil,

26
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,319
avert disaster,

27
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,199
and expel ghosts.

28
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,759
Others say Hongniang was harmed by Chang Xian'er.

29
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
What do you think?

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,159
I...

31
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Why did you kill Hongniang?

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,759
What are you saying?

33
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,319
You killed Hongniang.

34
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,439
She was brutally murdered.

35
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,439
Her resentment is deep.

36
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,039
Now she's a vengeful ghost coming for your life.

37
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,280
Is that not so?

38
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,080
It wasn't me.

39
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,759
I didn't do it.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
You still dare to deny it?

41
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,360
You said you could see Hongniang's ghost.

42
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,319
If you didn't have a guilty conscience,

43
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,159
why use Divine Shrouding to hide?

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,639
I didn't kill Hongniang.

45
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,840
Hongniang wasn't killed by me.

46
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,840
Then what exactly did you do...

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,159
...for Hongniang's restless spirit to haunt you?

48
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,079
How could I harm Hongniang?

49
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,759
How could I bear to harm her?

50
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,399
It's her who won't let me go.

51
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:31,199
After she died,

52
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,639
whenever I went out,

53
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,519
I felt a chill all over my body.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,439
Once, after staying out too long,

55
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,720
I went home and fell seriously ill.

56
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,639
While I was in a deep sleep,

57
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,600
I found Hongniang standing right in front of me.

58
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,639
As if she had something to say to me.

59
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,519
It must be because I failed to protect her.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,800
She hates me.

61
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,839
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,839
It's raining.

63
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,639
Let me walk you back.

64
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,199
We're here.

65
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,519
Thank you.

66
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,439
You're welcome.

67
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,040
Silly girl.

68
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,480
Running out when it's raining?

69
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:38,480
Go back inside.

70
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,199
Hongniang.

71
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,720
Zhang Sheng.

72
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,879
It's raining.

73
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,879
This is for you.

74
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,680
Hongniang.

75
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,000
Marry me.

76
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:14,800
Will you?

77
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,480
Silly girl!

78
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,120
If word of this gets out,

79
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,879
how will I show my face in public?

80
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,720
Huh?

81
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,039
How can you be so shameless?

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,000
You're going to be the death of me!

83
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,159
That night, Hongniang came to find me.

84
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,200
Hongniang was crying her heart out.

85
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,960
It turned out Li Laosan, to pay off gambling debts,

86
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,000
was going to sell Hongniang.

87
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,759
I was willing to pay to redeem Hongniang.

88
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,720
Hongniang suggested...

89
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,600
...that I take her far away.

90
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,759
Hongniang.

91
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:14,639
What's wrong?

92
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,279
Take me away.

93
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,440
Take me away.

94
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,600
I'll take you away.

95
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,279
Come.

96
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,960
Zhang Sheng.

97
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,720
Where are we?

98
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:55,759
Zhang Sheng.

99
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,440
Hongniang.

100
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,159
Don't be afraid.

101
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,480
We'll make do here for tonight.

102
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,679
We'll leave tomorrow.

103
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,320
Okay.

104
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,320
Hongniang!

105
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,919
Hongniang!

106
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,000
Hongniang!

107
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,799
Hongniang!

108
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:31,679
Hongniang!

109
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:35,759
Hongniang!

110
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,279
Hongniang!
