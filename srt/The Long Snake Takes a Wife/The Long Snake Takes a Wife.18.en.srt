1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,599
Hongniang

2
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,640
Heigou

3
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,519
What are you doing?

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
Hongniang, I really like you.

5
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:29,400
Hongniang.

6
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,719
I really do like you.

7
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
Let go of me!

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,840
You jerk!

9
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,840
Get away!

10
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,319
Let go of me!

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
Heigou, what do you want?

12
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,159
I already told you.

13
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,760
I'd rather die than say yes to you.

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,319
Just give up on that idea.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,599
That damn girl.

16
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,719
Just you wait.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,200
Just turned eighteen.

18
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,799
A fresh young chick.

19
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,959
Just a bit of a fiery temper.

20
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,560
The girls in our house...

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,240
...who doesn't have a temper?

22
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,360
In the past,

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
they were all chaste and virtuous women.

24
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,159
Now,

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,240
which one doesn't know all the tricks?

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
They can do it all.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Keep this money safe.

28
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,479
Of course.

29
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:20,120
I'll be taking her with me then.

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
Before long,

31
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,719
if you want to see her again,

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,800
it's going to cost you.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,319
Of course, of course.

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,360
Come with me.

35
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,319
This way, please.

36
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,039
Hongniang.

37
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,759
Hongniang!

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,159
Hongniang!

39
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,000
I was wrong before.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,199
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,879
But...

42
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,479
...now my dad wants to sell you to a brothel.

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,919
You have to leave, quickly.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,840
It's true.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,800
Go, quickly!

46
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,759
Don't ever come back.

47
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,479
That day, Hongniang...

48
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,319
...could only have gone to find you.

49
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,960
What did you do to her?

50
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,360
It was you.

51
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,759
You harmed her.

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,039
I failed Hongniang.

53
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,360
I let her down.

54
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,560
Where did Hongniang go?

55
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,960
I really don't know.

56
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,479
Even though I'm a piece of trash,

57
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,039
but...

58
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,919
...how could I ever harm Hongniang?

59
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,719
After that day,

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I never saw her again.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,319
Now Hongniang is nowhere to be found,

62
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,759
dead or alive.

63
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,719
You all say you...

64
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,680
...aren't the killer.

65
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,080
Then where did Hongniang go?

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,759
Was she really taken by Chang Xian'er?

67
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:13,879
No.

68
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,319
There's one person who hasn't arrived yet.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
Someone else?

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,079
A ghost.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,959
Hongniang?

72
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,120
Hongniang.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,680
Sister Hong.

74
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,120
Sister Hong.

75
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:01,600
Sister Hong.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,639
Don't be afraid.

77
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,199
I'm here.

78
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:04,920
It's okay.

79
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:12,920
It's alright.

80
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,040
It's okay.

81
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,079
Hongniang.

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,079
So you really aren't dead.

83
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,240
What exactly happened?

84
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,920
Those people who died...

85
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,079
...did it have something to do with you?

86
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,279
This world is full of wretched people.

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
I am one.

88
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
San Yatou was one too.

89
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,199
I've been hiding in this Changxian'er Temple.

90
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,839
That day, San Yatou...

91
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:03,879
Why?

92
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,279
Why did you leave me all alone?

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
You wretched girl, so you were hiding here.

94
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,319
Run!

95
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:17,680
I'll teach you to run!

96
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,160
Help!

97
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,360
Help me!

98
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,040
Move!

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,639
Move!

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,480
Let go!

101
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:31,800
Let go of me!

102
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,720
Let me have my fun before I take you back.

103
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,040
I was worried about San Yatou,

104
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,399
so I followed her all the way home.

105
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,399
Take a few more puffs.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,079
San Yatou...

107
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,519
This way, you and San Yatou

108
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,519
will be together forever.

109
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,399
I killed Li Laosan too.

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,680
What?

111
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:52,959
Hongniang!

112
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,920
Where did you go?

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,920
I missed you so much.

114
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,639
That day...

115
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,800
I was tricked by Zhang Sheng into coming to this Changxian'er Temple.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,079
After he abandoned me...

117
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,959
Zhang Sheng!

118
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,639
Zhang Sheng!

119
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,559
You wretched girl!

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,320
I spent money to buy you!

121
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,399
You haven't paid off your debt and you try to run?

122
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,200
If I hadn't heard

123
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,279
Old Woman Hu from the umbrella shop tip me off,

124
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,759
I wouldn't have known you got married.

125
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,759
I beg you, please let me go.

126
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,000
I will pay you back.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,559
What?

128
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,759
Let you go?

129
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,039
I beg you.

130
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:06,480
Get up!

131
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,919
What about my ten silver dollars then?

132
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,120
What will you pay me with?

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm selling you to the brothel today

134
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
to pay off your debt.

135
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,679
Move!

136
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,759
No!

137
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,919
No! Let go of me!

138
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,360
Since you can't pay the money...

139
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,840
It doesn't matter.

140
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,720
What are you doing?

141
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,759
Today...

142
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,759
we're going to...

143
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,000
keep the goods for ourselves.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,799
Come on!

145
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,399
Let go of me!

146
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,200
Help!

147
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,759
Let go of me!

148
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,200
Let go of me!

149
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,559
I'm the one who wronged you.

151
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,200
I went back to find you that day.

152
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:00,759
But you were gone.

153
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,120
I really didn't know where you were.

154
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,600
I failed to protect you.

155
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,519
I thought you would love me.

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,679
Thought you would take care of me.

157
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,679
Protect me.

158
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,440
It was all a lie.

159
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,399
Let go of me!

160
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,799
Let go of me! Help!

161
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,360
Let go of me!

162
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,320
Let go of Sister Hong!

163
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,159
Let go of me!

164
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,840
Sister Hong!

165
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:40,919
Let go!

166
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,159
You damn fool!

167
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,080
You want to meddle in this?

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,799
I'll fucking kick you to death!

169
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,879
Come here, you!

170
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,320
No! Help!

171
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
Let go of me!

172
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,279
Let go of me!

173
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,000
Let go of me!

174
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,320
Help!

175
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
Let go!

176
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,840
Sister Hong!

177
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,919
Sister Hong!

178
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:41,559
Sister Hong!

179
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,559
Please don't go, okay?

180
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,480
I'm married now.

181
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,639
A wife must follow her husband,

182
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,399
good or bad.

183
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,399
Zhang Sheng treats me sincerely.

184
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,919
His mother...

185
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,360
just has some misunderstandings about me.

186
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,559
Don't worry.

187
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,240
I will come to see you.
