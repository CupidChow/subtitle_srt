1
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,359
Come in.

2
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Mother.

3
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,920
What are you doing?

4
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,799
Give me your hand.

5
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,879
Give me your hand.

6
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,120
I just want to check something.

7
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,879
The child.

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,719
Come here.

9
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,799
He's crying.

10
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,480
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

11
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,879
There, no more crying.

12
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,879
The blood isn't mixing.

13
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,079
Darn it.

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:01:59,920
Darn it.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,680
How is that possible, Mother?

16
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:03,000
Look at it.

17
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,840
That woman...

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
What a sin.

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,439
This must not get out.

20
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,919
If word gets out...

21
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,080
our family will lose all face.

22
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,879
That wicked woman.

23
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:32,639
Watch how I deal with her.

24
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,039
Let's go.

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:36,800
Come.

26
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,400
Mother.

27
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,719
What did the midwife say?

28
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,080
She said...

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,719
it's because you had too much sex after the birth.

30
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,680
That's why she ended up like this.

31
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:51,919
What?

32
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,759
I haven't touched her since the birth.

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,120
You slut.

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,919
She's been worn out by someone else.

35
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
She wants our Zhang family

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,439
to clean up her mess.

37
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,080
Even at this point,

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,280
she's still thinking of cheating.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,520
She's a slut to the bone.

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,280
Sheng'er.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,680
This woman...

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,840
we can't keep her anymore.

43
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,479
It must be all over town by now.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Mother.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,719
Then what do we do now?

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, Mother

47
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,479
Zhang Sheng

48
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
Where are we going?

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Mother wants to kick you out

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,759
She said to let Li Laosan take you away

51
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,719
We can't stay at home anymore

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm taking you away

53
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,080
What about the child?

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,000
What will happen to the baby?

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
Mother won't mistreat the child

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,599
I'll come back for her later

57
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,199
Let's go

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,599
Go

59
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,039
Zhang Sheng

60
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,319
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,399
Where is this?

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm so scared

63
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,920
Hongniang

64
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,079
Don't be afraid

65
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,959
Let's just make do here for tonight

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,000
Wait for me here

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,600
Don't run off

68
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,399
I'll go find some firewood

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,800
To keep you warm

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,319
No, don't go

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,279
Don't leave me here alone

72
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,439
Don't go, Zhang Sheng

73
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,000
Be good

74
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
I'll be back very soon

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Zhang Sheng!

76
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,079
Zhang Sheng!

77
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm the one who failed Hongniang

78
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,199
I didn't take good care of her

79
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,800
But I beg you

80
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,279
Don't take me away

81
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,160
Don't take me away

82
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,759
Why is it you two?

83
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,920
At my age, I'm still putting on a show with you

84
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,959
Aren't you afraid my old bones will fall apart?

85
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,000
The blood kinship test isn't accurate at all

86
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,879
I think your mother just wanted to break you up

87
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:24,879
So she lied on purpose

88
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,319
Speak

89
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,319
Where is the child?

90
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,279
Mother...

91
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,000
She said she sold the child

92
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,839
Your mother just values sons over daughters

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,000
I think she's causing trouble on purpose

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,639
We asked the midwife who delivered the baby

95
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,000
The child Hongniang gave birth to

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,560
is truly your own flesh and blood

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,800
Your mother concealed it on purpose

98
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,279
to frame Hongniang

99
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,240
What did you say?

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,199
Hongniang wanted to be with you forever

101
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,199
But you forgot your vows

102
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,600
You failed to protect her

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,560
Things really didn't turn out that way

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,800
Now you've even sold your own daughter

105
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,120
You are such a jerk

106
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,360
For Hongniang's death

107
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,839
you must also be held responsible

108
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,399
No

109
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,439
No!

110
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,639
I didn't kill Hongniang

111
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,639
That day, I just took her to...

112
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,720
Changxian'er Temple

113
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,279
And then I left

114
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,160
I really don't know what happened after that

115
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Master

116
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,920
Slow down a bit

117
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
I want to go back to sleep

118
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,519
You're getting on in years

119
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,199
Yet you're still so spry

120
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,759
I don't think that Zhang Sheng loves Hongniang at all

121
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:03,120
Who leaves their wife in a temple and ignores her?

122
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,040
Could she really have been taken by Chang Xian'er?

123
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,959
I'm afraid it's not that simple

124
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,399
What do you mean?

125
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,160
Zhang Sheng is hiding something from us

126
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
Then let's go interrogate him again

127
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,879
It's useless

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
If he wanted to talk

129
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,600
He would have said it just now

130
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:19,800
Then...

131
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Say something

132
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,480
Speak

133
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,680
Say something

134
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,399
Honey

135
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,560
Honey, don't be angry

136
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,279
I was wrong

137
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,000
Wrong about what?

138
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,800
I was wrong about everything

139
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,240
I realized you really are a good-for-nothing

140
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,519
You can't even squeeze out a word

141
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,360
How did I end up with you in this life?

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,240
You really deserve to die. Why don't you just die?

143
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,360
You really have no prospects at all

144
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,839
It's bad enough you don't make money

145
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,920
But you don't even have a gift

146
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,079
What other woman is like me?

147
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,199
Which of my sisters isn't living better than I am?

148
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,319
Why don't you just die? What's the point of you living?

149
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:55,839
This is...

150
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:57,759
really not giving the man any face

151
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,199
You two

152
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,800
We can talk things over nicely

153
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,240
It's late at night

154
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,079
Harsh words hurt

155
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,759
And can easily attract unclean things

156
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,079
None of your business

157
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,120
He's my man, I'll do what I want

158
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
Come here

159
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,279
What are you doing?

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,879
Can't you see others are bullying me?

161
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,399
You coward

162
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,240
You really are a coward

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,519
You have a big head and a thick neck

164
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:19,600
I think you look like a pig

165
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,639
Can you actually understand what I'm saying?

166
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:20,920
You...

167
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,399
Why don't you just die?

168
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,279
What's the point of living?

169
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,439
What a piece of trash

170
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,079
Look at how you live

171
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,240
Not like a man at all

172
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,639
Whose husband is like you?

173
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,399
Coward

174
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,000
Idiot

175
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,840
Tell me, what is the point of you living?

176
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,879
Speak

177
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,360
Hurry up and speak to me

178
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,320
Honey

179
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:49,600
You're back.

180
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:51,320
Tell me, why did I ever marry you?

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,519
I get no comfort with you.

182
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,679
I just suffer grievances every day.

183
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,279
What's wrong, honey?

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,519
I am not your wife.

185
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:57,519
I don't care who is.

186
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,919
Alright, honey.

187
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,759
Don't be angry.

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,879
Let's eat first.

189
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,200
I've made everything.

190
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,039
What can you do besides cooking every day?

191
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,639
If it weren't for your inability to earn money,

192
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,080
would I, over a single coin,

193
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
be looked down upon by others?

194
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,159
Honey,

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,519
I'm sorry you've suffered with me.

196
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,879
Don't be mad.

197
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,360
Let's eat first.

198
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,320
Eat, eat, eat.

199
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,360
That's all you know how to do.

200
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,320
What grown man hangs around the kitchen all day?

201
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,480
You good-for-nothing.

202
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,519
All you know is staying at home...

203
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,039
Cooking, cooking, cooking.

204
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,679
If it weren't for your uselessness,

205
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,879
would I, because of you,

206
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:27,840
get into fights with others

207
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,240
and get bullied?

208
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,080
Would I suffer grievances because of you?

209
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,480
Marrying you in this life

210
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,399
is my life's

211
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,960
biggest mistake.

212
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,039
I'll let you eat!

213
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,200
I'll let you eat!

214
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,120
You...

215
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,039
What?

216
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,000
You want to hit me?

217
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,240
Hit me then!

218
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,960
Go ahead, hit me!

219
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,080
Kneel down.

220
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Kneel down right now!

221
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,000
Did you hear me?

222
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,840
Kneel down!

223
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
A kind word warms in deep winter.

224
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,480
A harsh word chills in midsummer.

225
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,279
Master,

226
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,240
what does this mean?

227
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
Speaking is an art.

228
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,559
Everyone is an energy field.

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,200
If you speak too much,

230
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
energy gathers,

231
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,279
and summons spirits.

232
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
But,

233
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,080
I talk so much every day,

234
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,399
and I don't feel anything different.

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,639
You certainly can't see the Spirit of Stupidity.

236
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,120
Don't think I don't know you're talking about me.

237
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,559
Words gather to form a spirit.

238
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,840
It is called a Word Spirit.

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,840
Speak with virtue.

240
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,399
Disaster comes from the mouth.

241
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,320
Master San.

242
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,559
Master San.

243
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,519
Why the rush to find me?

244
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,320
What's the matter?

245
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:10,120
Something happened to my husband.

246
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,799
Please go and take a look.

247
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,120
He was fine, and then this happened.

248
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,720
I can't wake him up no matter what.

249
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,440
What a good-for-nothing.

250
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,200
Good for nothing but ruining things.

251
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,000
Getting sick when everything was fine.

252
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,919
Now we have to spend money on medicine and prescriptions again.

253
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,039
Master San,

254
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,159
do you think there is...

255
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,480
...a free prescription?

256
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,679
He's usually very healthy.

257
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,639
It shouldn't be anything serious, right?

258
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll leave it to you.

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,279
Master San!

260
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,679
Let's go, too.

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,039
Don't go!

262
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,600
If you leave, what about my husband?
