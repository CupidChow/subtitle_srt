1
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,159
Ghost Opera

2
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,040
is also called Changxian Opera.

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,319
It is a unique genre created by Baxian Tang.

4
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,280
The Baxian Tang Opera Troupe

5
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:28,200
is different from other troupes.

6
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,200
When they perform on stage,

7
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,480
they don't paint their faces,

8
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,760
but wear wooden masks instead.

9
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,560
Most masks have green faces and fangs.

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,239
The common folk believe

11
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,359
that when the actors are on stage,

12
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,840
they are no longer themselves.

13
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,359
When the Baxian Tang Opera Troupe performs,

14
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,719
there is a special rule.

15
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:51,319
While the performance is ongoing,

16
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,879
once the audience has arrived,

17
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,120
they cannot make noise or move about freely.

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,840
They cannot leave halfway,

19
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:01,079
nor can they use foul language,

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,280
or

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,760
do anything against the rules.

22
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,519
Otherwise,

23
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:09,919
it will attract the evil spirits attached to the actors.

24
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:11,919
Second Uncle,

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
if what you say is true,

26
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,000
then San Yatou's disappearance

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
is likely related to Baxian Tang.

28
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,919
Yes.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,520
It must be them.

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,280
San Yatou

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,879
must have been taken by them.

32
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,000
This Baxian Tang

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
every three years,

34
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,280
appears only on the seventh of the seventh lunar month.

35
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,879
The troupe members are very strange.

36
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,400
They arrive under the cover of night

37
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,520
and leave before sunrise.

38
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,919
No one knows

39
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,159
what they look like under the masks.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,039
Folks say

41
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,039
Baxian Tang's plays

42
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,800
are not just for people to watch,

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,360
but also for

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,280
the gods and ghosts of heaven and earth.

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,280
Furthermore,

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,199
before and after every performance,

47
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,439
someone goes missing.

48
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,080
That's just too strange.

49
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,639
Before, everyone

50
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,479
also suspected Baxian Tang.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
But

52
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,400
they left right after the performance.

53
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,919
For so many years,

54
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,080
nothing has been found

55
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,000
that seemed amiss.

56
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,039
So where are they now?

57
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,400
At the break of dawn,

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,719
they just left the town.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,719
They probably...

60
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,319
probably haven't gone too far.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,960
Uncle Bao,

62
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,919
don't panic yet.

63
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:31,960
I think

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,879
we should bring them back first.

65
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,280
Until San Yatou is found,

66
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,879
we can't let them leave.

67
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:37,800
Yeah.

68
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I'll go get some men.

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,199
Stop!

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,280
Stop!

71
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,199
It's them!

72
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,479
Take them all away!

73
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
Take off all their masks!

74
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
The masks cannot be removed!

75
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,879
Why can't they be removed?

76
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,920
They protect the dignity of us all!

77
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,079
Cut the crap!

78
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,680
If I say take them off, take them off!

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
I want to see

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,040
what kind of demons and monsters you are!

81
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,079
Take them off!

82
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,120
So, it turns out you...

83
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
the Baxian Tang Opera Troupe...

84
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,199
are organized by people with defects.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,160
People like us...

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
are looked down upon on the streets.

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,800
To make a living...

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,959
and to protect ourselves...

89
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,319
we have no choice but to wear masks...

90
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:33,800
and travel everywhere to perform.

91
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,959
From south to north...

92
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,639
we have always had only one route.

93
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:43,240
It takes three years to complete one round.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,800
That is why...

95
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,279
you only see us perform once every three years.

96
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,439
In that case...

97
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,399
in every place...

98
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,560
you never stay for too long.

99
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,079
At the same time...

100
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:59,040
it also makes people think you are mysterious.

101
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,800
Is that right?

102
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,160
Take them all away!

103
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,079
Move!

104
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,920
Get in there, all of you!

105
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,279
We've searched everything.

106
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,319
Apart from the troupe members...

107
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,439
and some...

108
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,560
performance costumes and props...

109
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,720
other than that...

110
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,120
there is nothing else.

111
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,240
Master...

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,079
could we have made a mistake?

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,279
Second Uncle...

114
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:31,800
I think...

115
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,879
until San Yatou is found...

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,279
anything is possible.

117
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,480
If today...

118
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
we can't link them to San Yatou's disappearance...

119
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,920
then tomorrow morning...

120
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,160
we'll have to release them.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,399
Hongniang.

122
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,920
Black Dog.

123
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,839
Zhang Sheng.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,399
San Yatou.

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,879
What's wrong?

126
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,560
You look distracted.

127
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,639
Is something on your mind?

128
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,800
If the troupe members aren't Chang Xian'er...

129
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,839
how could a perfectly fine person just vanish?

130
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:38,199
Do you really think...

131
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,480
those people in the troupe are wrongly accused?

132
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,279
Some things, at first glance...

133
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,240
might seem like nothing.

134
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,720
But if you look a few more times...

135
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,240
you will definitely find flaws.

136
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,800
Could it be that San Yatou...

137
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,439
really violated the troupe's taboos...

138
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,920
and provoked some evil spirit?

139
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,920
Real or fake, plays are meant for people to watch.

140
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,199
Those so-called rules...

141
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,120
are just to create mystery.

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,319
Master once said...

143
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,560
the troupe members...

144
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,199
are all pitiful people.

145
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,360
And there doesn't seem to be anything suspicious.

146
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,000
Master...

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,399
why are you here?

148
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,799
Tomorrow morning...

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,840
the Police Station is going to execute the Troupe Leader.

150
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,399
People from the Lai Mansion pressured the police...

151
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,799
to convict the Troupe Leader.

152
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,879
It's likely...

153
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,000
torture to extract a confession...

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,039
and forced admission of guilt.

155
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,039
The Lai Mansion...

156
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
what do they have to do with the troupe?

157
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,200
The ones who bullied San Yatou on the street last time...

158
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,399
were they from the Lai Mansion?

159
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,159
Yes.

160
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,039
The Troupe Leader of Baxian Tang Opera Troupe

161
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,000
regarding the disappearance of local resident San Yatou,

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,399
is a prime suspect.

163
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
He committed murder and robbery,

164
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
and refuses to plead guilty.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
With witness testimony complete,

166
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,720
he is to be executed immediately.

167
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,399
Stop!

168
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:43,840
Stop right now!

169
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,120
This has nothing to do with him!

170
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,879
Don't kill him!

171
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,799
Don't kill him!

172
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,440
Yatou.

173
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,279
You came back.

174
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,559
Where have you been?

175
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,240
Why did you come back?

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,919
Leave, quickly!

177
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,039
Just go!

178
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,279
I don't know him at all!

179
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,480
You've wronged an innocent man!

180
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Let him go!

181
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,559
Let him go at once!

182
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,960
Go, quickly!

183
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,799
This is an unexpected turn of events.

184
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,679
Take him away for now.

185
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,559
We will decide later.

186
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,480
Why did you come back?

187
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,360
Didn't I tell you to leave?

188
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,159
I'm not leaving.

189
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,840
If I go, we go together.

190
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,120
So, they do know each other.

191
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,200
It seems they're more than acquaintances;

192
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,919
they are deeply in love.

193
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,080
