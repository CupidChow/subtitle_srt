1
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,519
The old folks often say...

2
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,159
"When sun-showers fall, skirt the woods."

3
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,000
For Chang Xian'er of the forest is taking a bride.

4
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
What this means is,

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,519
if on a bright sunny day,

6
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,040
a sun-shower suddenly starts,

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,439
you must not enter the mountain woods.

8
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,840
Because the mountain's Chang Xian'er

9
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,319
will organize a wedding procession

10
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:35,920
to roam through the forest.

11
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,840
The snake wife weeps,

12
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,079
the rain falls.

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,640
The living must avoid it,

14
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:41,840
and take a detour.

15
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,280
They say on the fourth day of the fourth month,

16
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,239
the village paper-cutter,

17
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,400
Li Laosan's daughter, Hongniang,

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,560
went into the woods to chop firewood.

19
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,879
"It's way too hot."

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,759
"If only it would rain a little."

21
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,879
Ever since Hongniang went missing,

22
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,199
this Li Laosan

23
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,680
has gone completely mad.

24
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,199
All day long, he beats on a broken bowl,

25
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
roaming through these woods.

26
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,919
He says he's going to find Chang Xian'er

27
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:50,400
and demand Hongniang back.

28
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,439
Chang Xian'er takes a bride!

29
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,800
The bride's family sends blessings!

30
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,960
Betrothal gifts arrive at the door!

31
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,039
The in-laws come to receive her!

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,639
And wouldn't you know it,

33
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,160
he actually managed to find them.

34
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,720
But somehow,

35
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,639
this Li Laosan

36
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,399
ended up crawling out of a mass grave.

37
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,800
Hongniang

38
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,279
Why are you here?

39
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,439
Dad

40
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,720
Save me

41
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,639
Dad

42
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,759
Save me

43
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,240
Ever since then,

44
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,920
Li Laosan has been bewitched.

45
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,279
He runs to the back mountain every night,

46
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,720
and only comes back at dawn.

47
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,079
Everyone says

48
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,279
that Li Laosan's soul

49
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,120
followed Hongniang,

50
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
and was taken by Chang Xian'er too.

51
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,040
No wonder the town lately

52
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,959
has been in such a panic.

53
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,439
Once night falls,

54
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,839
there's not a soul on the streets.

55
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,240
It's becoming a ghost town.

56
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,399
Looking at it this way,

57
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,800
it really is quite spooky.

58
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,360
Don't you doubt it.

59
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,120
Let me tell you,

60
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,319
the people in town now

61
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,240
don't dare to go out.

62
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,079
They're all afraid of running into Chang Xian'er.

63
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,879
Now that you mention it, I remember.

64
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,319
The stories about Chang Xian'er from before,

65
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,160
I've heard them too.

66
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:23,920
In the town,

67
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:24,920
people have been taken away before.

68
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,040
Yes.

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,839
Don't be afraid, everyone!

70
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,759
Evil-Warding Talismans!

71
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,839
Realgar wine!

72
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,480
Snakes flee on sight!

73
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,360
You'll be absolutely safe with this!

74
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,079
Hey, wait.

75
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,279
Who are you?

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,720
Who is this?

77
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:40,720
I don't know.

78
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,920
I am Baiyun Town's

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
only evil-warding Funeral Supplies Shop,

80
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,199
the Yin-Yang Transit Station's

81
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,519
second generation Wandering Grand Mage,

82
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,759
Yan Sanye's beloved disciple and Joint Guardian,

83
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,560
Bailing.

84
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,160
I'm here this time

85
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,560
because I was invited to handle Li Laosan's

86
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
spooky situation.

87
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,439
Are you talking about that

88
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,600
Yan Sanye from the funeral shop?

89
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,800
I heard Sanye has some skills

90
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,639
in warding off evil.

91
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,680
Right.

92
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,120
That's right.

93
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,160
Of course!

94
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,480
Hey, wait a minute.

95
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:03,959
Hold on.

96
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
This thing of yours,

97
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,560
it's not cheap, is it?

98
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,600
Are you trying to scam us?

99
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,600
Look at what you're saying.

100
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,560
You fine gentlemen,

101
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,279
all so dashing

102
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,600
and incredibly smart.

103
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,199
How could I scam you?

104
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,040
Three coins.

105
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,439
Three coins to ensure your safety.

106
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,720
Do you think that's expensive?

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,279
A bowl of your tofu pudding

108
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:27,600
sells for eight coins, right?

109
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,160
Well...

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,439
That's true.

111
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,000
Tofu Zhang,

112
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
you're ripping us off!

113
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,120
That's too expensive!

114
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,240
Last ten left!

115
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,839
Unbelievable!

116
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,680
First come, first served!

117
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,839
First come, first served!

118
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,120
Hey!

119
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,800
I want two!

120
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,439
I'm paying first!

121
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,319
Me too! Me too! Me too!

122
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
I want three!

123
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,600
I'll come back another day!

124
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,519
I'm leaving now!

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,639
This is mine!

126
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,560
Give it to me! Give it to me!

127
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,519
Why are you snatching from me?

128
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,399
I paid first!

129
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,360
Be reasonable!

130
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,079
What is going on?

131
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,199
You brat

132
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,959
I finally found you

133
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Let's see where you run now

134
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,480
Boss Braggart

135
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,680
I've got something to do today

136
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll treat you to dinner another day

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,519
Stop

138
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't run

139
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:09,800
Don't run

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,199
Stop

141
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,439
What do you want?

142
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,040
Don't force me

143
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,199
Knives for sale

144
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,800
Knives for sale

145
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,839
Don't run

146
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,080
Stop

147
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,840
You, stop

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
Stop

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,919
Don't run

151
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,919
Keep running, you brat

152
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,720
Boss Braggart

153
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
Why so serious?

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,679
This is the money I just collected

155
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,600
You take this first

156
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll give you the rest tomorrow

157
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,759
This isn't even enough for the interest

158
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
If you really can't pay up

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,159
I'll chop off an arm and a leg

160
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,879
And sell you to a brothel to cover the debt

161
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,960
A group of men

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,000
bullying a weak woman

163
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,000
If word gets out

164
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

165
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,320
Kid, mind your own business

166
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,320
This brat owes us money

167
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,080
Paying back debts is a universal law

168
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,039
What? Are you paying for her?

169
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,120
How much does she owe?

170
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,159
I'll pay it

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,639
One hundred silver dollars

172
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,960
How do I owe that much?

173
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,399
No money? Why play the hero?

174
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,200
I only owed them

175
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,120
ten silver dollars

176
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,879
They are loan sharks

177
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,679
Cut the crap

178
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,679
Teach them a lesson

179
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
Here is your money

180
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,960
But let me give you a piece of advice

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,840
Don't bully people with your power

182
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
You will bring about your own ruin

183
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,879
Now get lost

184
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,000
Let's go, let's go

185
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,200
Thank you

186
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,399
I still have things to do today

187
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,279
I'll treat you to dinner another day

188
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,679
How did you owe them so much money?

189
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,919
None of your business

190
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,440
Hey

191
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,919
I haven't finished speaking

192
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,799
What are you doing?

193
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,440
You are from Baiyun Town

194
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,039
Take me to see Li Laosan

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,320
Why are you looking for Li Laosan?

196
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,600
His family is being tormented by Chang Xian'er

197
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,639
leaving the place in a chaotic mess

198
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,919
Aren't you afraid

199
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,360
of provoking something unclean?

200
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,240
Just take me to see him

201
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,240
If there really is something unclean

202
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:55,879
I would actually like to

203
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:56,919
see it for myself

204
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,360
You're sick

205
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,200
Who's joking with you?

206
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,720
I paid the money for you

207
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,279
Your debt is on me now

208
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,000
Either

209
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,399
pay the money

210
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,440
or

211
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,080
do the job

212
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,039
You...

213
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,919
Fine

214
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,919
Taking you to Li Laosan is no problem

215
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,000
But

216
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,080
you'd better be prepared

217
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,320
This Baiyun Town

218
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,360
is no place for strangers
