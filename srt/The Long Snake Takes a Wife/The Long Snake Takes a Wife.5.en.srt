1
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,599
Xiao Shiliu

2
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,799
On the day of the incident,

3
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,439
where did you go?

4
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,400
What did you do?

5
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,239
Retrace your steps from that day

6
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,040
and walk through it again.

7
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:26,599
Give me some food.

8
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,079
Please give me something to eat.

9
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,159
Go, go, go.

10
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,120
Come here.

11
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,199
You've got some nerve.

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
Daring to deliver yourself to us.

13
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,680
It's actually you.

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,120
Speak.

15
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,319
Where did you hide Xiao Jiu?

16
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,000
If you don't speak,

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll take you to the authorities.

18
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:39,919
Speak!

19
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,039
I'll talk!

20
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,400
I'll tell you everything!

21
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,240
What are you doing?

22
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,479
The man from the old sister-in-law's house is out for a stroll.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
Last night,

24
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,639
I dreamt the River God sent a fish.

25
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,439
So I really want a Prince of the Dragon Palace

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,719
to have a feast.

27
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,960
You look unfamiliar.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,879
I want a fish from the River God's family.

29
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,280
Why do you care if I'm familiar?

30
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:24,840
As long as the silver is familiar, that's enough.

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:28,960
Who is she?

32
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,240
A barren field with a disappointing belly.

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,400
I've worked my ox to death,

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
yet she still can't pop out a brat.

35
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:36,879
Cut the crap.

36
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,680
Take me to see the Prince.

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,240
Follow me.

38
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,719
Asking for a beating!

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
Come on in.

40
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,879
Come.

41
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:11,599
The price is fair.

42
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,280
Pick whichever you like.

43
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,840
Xiao Jiu!

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,319
Sister Bailing!

45
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,360
Who exactly are you?

46
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,680
They're just unwanted bastards.

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,800
I sold them,

48
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,319
and they get food and drink.

49
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,319
What's wrong with that?

50
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,959
They just lost their families.

51
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,680
It doesn't mean no one cares,

52
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,360
or no one loves them.

53
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,160
On the contrary, you people,

54
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,000
who trade children like objects,

55
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,199
are the most despicable.

56
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,360
Come.

57
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,279
These human traffickers

58
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,319
order people to spot children by the roadside,

59
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,079
and kidnap them under the cover of night.

60
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,600
All to make money from trading them.

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,839
The people from the police station

62
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,399
will be here soon.

63
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,000
They will make proper arrangements.

64
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,199
As for those without families,

65
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,439
it's alright.

66
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:12,800
I will

67
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,839
adopt them all.

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
And turn this into an orphanage.

69
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,560
From now on,

70
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,800
you mustn't run off anymore.

71
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,800
San Niang was going to take us

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,680
to a fun place.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
But now we

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,959
have been kidnapped by bad guys.

75
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,519
San Niang must be looking for us anxiously.

76
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,680
Don't talk nonsense.

77
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,079
How could San Niang take you away?

78
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,000
She's been gone for a long time.

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,560
It's true.

80
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,160
San Niang came to the ruined temple last night.

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
She said she'd take us to a fun place,

82
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,839
where we could see our mothers.

83
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,839
That's why we followed her.

84
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,600
That is Zhang Langjun.

85
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,839
San Niang's husband.

86
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
I heard that

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,920
after San Niang and the child died,

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,399
he became very depressed.

89
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,279
Everyone sympathizes with him.

90
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,360
It seems that to commemorate his wife and child,

91
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
he even dug a well in his home.

92
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,879
Can you pick locks?

93
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,600
Of course.

94
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,079
Soul-Suppressing Lock

95
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,240
What is this?

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,439
Soul-Binding Chains

97
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,560
Legend has it, they are used to suppress souls.

98
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,279
To prevent reincarnation for eternity.

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,399
But...

100
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,399
Zhang Langjun is already suffering from losing his wife and children.

101
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,319
Why would he do this?

102
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,720
What is San Niang's surname?

103
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Her surname is Di.

104
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,800
Di.

105
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:26,439
The name Di contains fire.

106
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,079
Then he definitely shouldn't have dug a well as a memorial.

107
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,800
He doesn't want her to find peace.

108
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,240
You mean...

109
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,439
Be good, Bao'er.

110
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,800
Come here, Bao'er.

111
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:49,199
Mommy's dearest.

112
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,639
Bao'er is here.

113
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,279
Come quickly.

114
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,040
Into Mommy's arms.

115
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,199
Mommy will give Bao'er...

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,839
A lift up.

117
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:12,879
The well.

118
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,399
Isn't this the well Zhang Langjun dug for San Niang?

119
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,200
San Niang.

120
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,639
What are you doing?

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,720
I beg you, Sir, seek justice for me.

122
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440
You lost your children...

123
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
And died of overwhelming grief.

124
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,480
Where is the injustice?

125
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,679
I was murdered.

126
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,240
It was not an accidental death.

127
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,759
I beg you, Sir, seek justice for me.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
I beg you, Sir, seek justice for me!

129
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,399
San Niang.

130
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,399
Whether the dream is real or not...

131
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,559
I will definitely investigate the truth.

132
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,279
Your grievance...

133
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,159
I will take it on.

134
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,960
What is he doing here?

135
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,960
We'll see.

136
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,279
Sui'er.

137
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:54,960
Why are you unhappy?

138
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,039
Being lied to every day...

139
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,519
Who could be happy?

140
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,720
Sui'er.

141
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,879
How could I lie to you?

142
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:06,799
Don't worry.

143
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Once this time passes...

144
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,440
I will marry you and bring you home.

145
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,159
Your wife and children...

146
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,200
Have been gone for so long.

147
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,240
Who doesn't know by now...

148
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
That you are all alone?

149
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,799
What are you still waiting for?

150
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:21,879
I think you...

151
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,120
Just want to break your promise.

152
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,879
You have found someone new...

153
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,759
And want to abandon me, your old love.

154
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,679
Sui'er.

155
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,279
You know I love you the most.

156
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,519
For you...

157
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,039
I even... my wife and children...

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,720
Sui'er.

159
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,600
I'll take you home right now.

160
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,320
Sui'er.

161
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,360
Now it's just the two of us.

162
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,879
Wait a moment.

163
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,240
Go move that dead person's tablet away.

164
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,720
It gives me the creeps.

165
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,000
Is it okay now?
