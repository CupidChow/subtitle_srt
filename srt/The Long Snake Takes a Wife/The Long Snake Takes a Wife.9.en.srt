1
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,359
I looked everywhere for her but couldn't find her.

2
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,319
Later I heard that something happened to her.

3
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
She must be unable to rest in peace.

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,599
That's why she's haunting me.

5
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,519
I let her down.

6
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,840
You mean...

7
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,920
Hongniang has been following you since she died?

8
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,519
Yes.

9
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,239
I have to carry that red umbrella whenever I go out.

10
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:43,040
Otherwise, I'll fall seriously ill.

11
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,760
Red umbrellas can ward off evil.

12
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,079
By carrying it,

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Hongniang's ghost can't touch you.

14
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,200
But she keeps following you.

15
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,120
Is that so?

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,439
I suppose so.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,439
Hongniang must hate me.

18
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,879
Hate me for not protecting her.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,959
For not keeping our promise.

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,360
Life and death, separated by Yin and Yang.

21
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,000
Lights out, people gone, hearts entangled.

22
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,560
How can you be sure...

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,560
that she doesn't have some other purpose

24
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,599
for haunting you?

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
I actually haven't thought about that.

26
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,240
Actually, you could give her a chance.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
To see her.

28
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,159
Even if I don't use the red umbrella,

29
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,599
I still can't see her.

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Bailing.

31
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,080
Five Grains.

32
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,159
Yin-Yang Callers.

33
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:39,919
Stabilizing Coin.

34
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,360
Prepare for Rice Divination.

35
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,159
What is this?

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
The Five Grains rise from the earth.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,319
Connecting the Qi of Yin and Yang.

38
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,759
The Five Grains...

39
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,800
are the mixed grains we eat every day.

40
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:56,400
The rooster calls the sun and moon.

41
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:57,759
The green duck swims in the water.

42
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,560
These are raised for over ten years:

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,759
The red-combed rooster and green-billed duck.

44
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,439
The Stabilizing Coin...

45
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,360
is a silver dollar.

46
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,879
Passed through many hands,

47
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,080
full of human vitality.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,919
Used to...

49
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:09,759
suppress.

50
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,879
The rooster's crow calls heaven and earth.

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,919
The green duck leads the way through darkness and light.

52
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,960
Remember the path you came from and follow it here.

53
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,840
Meet your old friend, do not linger among the living.

54
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,759
Rise.

55
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:35,439
Brother Sheng.

56
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,439
Hong...

57
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,199
Hongniang.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Hongniang.

59
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,120
You must take good care of yourself.

60
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,519
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,319
Bailing.

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,199
Bailing.

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,360
Come back.

64
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,839
What happened to me just now?

65
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
Hongniang has left.

66
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,240
You can let go now.

67
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,600
Thank you both.

68
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,160
Let's go.

69
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:50,959
You guys...

70
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,800
By the way.

71
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,639
Since you've already seen Hongniang,

72
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,480
then...

73
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,439
I'll ask for three silver dollars as payment.

74
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,160
That's not too much, right?

75
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Thanks.

76
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:13,279
I'm off.

77
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,839
Not a bad deal you made there.

78
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,240
At least there's some income.

79
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,560
You seem to be short of money.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,120
None of your business.

81
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm warning you, don't get any ideas about me.

82
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,800
We are even now.

83
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,680
Run!

84
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,439
Run again!

85
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,399
I'll teach you to run!

86
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,079
Stop hitting him!

87
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,920
Dad!

88
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,959
Let me go!

89
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,839
Stop hitting!

90
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,399
Don't hit my dad!

91
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,439
Dad!

92
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,519
Stop hitting!

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,920
Stop hitting!

94
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:57,120
What are you doing?

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,199
Mind your own business.

96
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,480
Or I'll beat you up too.

97
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,519
Try me.

98
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,879
This old man owes us a debt

99
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,800
Even if he goes to the police, he has no case

100
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Old man, figure it out yourself

101
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,800
You just wait

102
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,439
Just wait

103
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,399
Dad

104
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,519
Are you okay?

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,639
Get up, quick

106
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,120
Get up, quick

107
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Uncle Bao

108
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,839
San Yatou

109
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,879
What is going on here?

110
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,720
They are all servants of the Lai Mansion

111
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,120
The harvest was bad this year

112
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,160
I still owe the Lai Mansion land rent

113
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,680
I can't pay it back

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,600
Uncle Bao

115
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,639
You should take this money

116
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,680
How can I do that?

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,800
How can I accept your money?

118
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,839
Uncle Bao

119
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,839
Just take it

120
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,360
It's not much money anyway

121
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,560
San Yatou

122
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Take your Dad to get some medicine, quick

123
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,639
And get some good rest

124
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,800
Thank you

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,519
Let's go, Dad

126
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:20,439
What are you laughing at?

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,360
That's a sinister laugh

128
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,279
By the way

129
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,120
Where were we just now?

130
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,399
What do you think...

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,840
...of Zhang Sheng?

132
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
He's quite nice

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,120
Gentle and cultivated

134
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,399
Devoted in love

135
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,120
If it weren't for Chang Xian'er

136
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,360
Hongniang being with him

137
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,240
Would probably be very happy

138
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,519
Since Zhang Sheng loves Hongniang so much

139
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,639
Why would he fear Hongniang's ghost?

140
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
Maybe

141
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,440
He's just simply afraid of ghosts

142
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,000
Is that not allowed?

143
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,039
First of all, there are no ghosts

144
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,559
And as you and I both know

145
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,879
That is just his inner demon

146
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,639
If you really love someone that much

147
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,000
You'd be dying to see them more

148
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,320
How could he be like that?

149
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,879
You mean

150
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,759
He feels guilty towards Hongniang

151
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:18,600
He has a guilty conscience

152
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,840
Also, I observed something before we left

153
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,639
Only his mother's spirit tablet was on the table

154
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,080
But not Hongniang's

155
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,679
Don't you think that's strange?

156
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,919
You're right

157
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,039
And his mother's incense ashes were plentiful

158
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,759
It looks like he offers incense every day

159
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Which means

160
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,639
His mother holds a heavy place in his heart

161
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,639
Plus, his mother's death was also very strange

162
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,559
Even if a ghost killed her

163
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There must be a reason

164
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,519
It seems he's hiding something from us

165
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,080
Let's go back first

166
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,159
Let's think this through

167
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,919
Zhang Sheng's mother

168
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,080
Was famously difficult to deal with in this town

169
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,720
His mother treasured him like a gem

170
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,080
Usually

171
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,679
Matters big and small in the house

172
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,120
Were all decided by his mother

173
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:20,039
She passed away a while ago

174
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,200
Leaving Zhang Sheng all alone

175
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,960
It seems this Zhang Sheng is hiding something from us

176
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:28,639
And

177
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
It has to do with his mother

178
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,799
We're helping him so much

179
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
Yet he won't tell us the truth

180
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,080
Let's go

181
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:35,759
Let's go find him

182
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,320
If he wanted to tell us, he would have by now

183
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,080
If you just rush over there like that

184
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,200
What he says

185
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,399
Might not be the truth

186
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
If that's the case

187
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,440
Then we need to

188
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,159
Really think of a way

189
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,519
It seems

190
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,720
Chang Xian'er has to make an appearance

191
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,399
We're closed

192
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,919
