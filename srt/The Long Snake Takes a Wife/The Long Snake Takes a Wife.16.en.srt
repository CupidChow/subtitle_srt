1
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,400
Uncle Bao

2
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,480
Uncle Bao

3
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,480
It's you two.

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Come on in.

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,480
Don't catch a cold.

6
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,519
Come.

7
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,599
Have a drink with me.

8
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,080
Uncle Bao

9
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,759
Since San Yatou passed away...

10
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,639
you must miss her a lot.

11
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
Everyone says San Yatou

12
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,439
was taken by Chang Xian'er.

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
Uncle Bao

14
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,759
what do you think?

15
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,560
Actually, I examined San Yatou's body.

16
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,080
This matter isn't that simple.

17
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,039
She suffered injuries while she was alive.

18
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,000
So I've been suspicious about this.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,879
What are you trying to say?

20
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,039
San Yatou...

21
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,680
she's already gone.

22
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,560
Saying all this...

23
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,840
can it bring her back to life?

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,520
Uncle Bao

25
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,159
that's not what he meant.

26
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,159
Please don't get angry.

27
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
Then what does he mean?

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,240
What are your intentions?

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,120
Uncle Bao

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,919
We just want to find the truth for San Yatou.

31
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,879
And clear her name.

32
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,199
Get out!

33
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,759
Get the hell out!

34
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:12,879
Uncle Bao

35
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,280
Get out!

36
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:13,919
Is there something...

37
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,080
Get out!

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
you're hiding from us?

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,120
All of you, get out!

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Uncle Bao!

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,120
My girl...

42
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,879
How could you bear to leave your dad?

43
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,000
How am I supposed to live on?

44
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,279
San...

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,319
San Yatou...

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,240
Aren't you dead?

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,439
Uncle Bao was acting strange yesterday.

48
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,199
San Yatou just died...

49
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
but he seemed very reluctant to talk about it.

50
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,600
What are you doing?

51
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,519
I think we need to visit Uncle Bao again.

52
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:03,439
You dare go back?

53
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
We were kicked out yesterday.

54
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,759
San Yatou violated the Ghost Opera Troupe's taboo.

55
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,279
What do you think about that?

56
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,879
The Ghost Opera Troupe...

57
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,879
isn't it just some mystifying trickery?

58
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,959
I don't believe in any retribution.

59
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,360
You mean...

60
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,319
San Yatou's death...

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,360
has nothing to do with the Ghost Opera Troupe?

62
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,480
Exactly.

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,439
This is definitely not that simple.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
I examined San Yatou's body.

65
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,600
She had obvious injuries.

66
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,040
What about Uncle Bao?

67
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,639
He must be hiding something.

68
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:40,959
Let's go.

69
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,079
Let's go take a look.

70
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,360
Uncle Bao?

71
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Uncle Bao?

72
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,439
Uncle Bao?

73
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
We're coming in.

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Uncle Bao!

75
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,279
Uncle Bao!

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,680
Who did this?

77
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,639
Uncle Bao...

78
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,160
He chose to leave on his own.

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,560
My girl...

80
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,399
You know our family's situation.

81
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,680
I don't want you to suffer with me.

82
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,439
This Young Master Lai...

83
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,839
is rich and powerful.

84
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,079
And he's taken a liking to you.

85
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:16,360
If you marry over there...

86
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,199
you'll surely enjoy a good life.

87
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,639
Dad...

88
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,000
what kind of person he is...

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,240
you know perfectly well.

90
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:25,040
Isn't this pushing me into a fire pit?

91
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,720
That they took a liking to you

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,800
is your good fortune.

93
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,839
You should be content.

94
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,480
Did you smoke opium again?

95
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,199
Did you?

96
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,360
You smoked away all the family's money.

97
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,240
And now you want to sell your daughter.

98
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,560
Are you even human?

99
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,680
If anyone's marrying, you do it.

100
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,040
I definitely won't marry.

101
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,959
This marriage...

102
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:46,920
You will marry whether you want to

103
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
or not.

104
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,680
Madam Lai.

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,720
Young Master Lai.

106
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
My daughter is a bit shy.

107
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,399
She's afraid to see people.

108
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,720
It doesn't matter.

109
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,600
A Pure maiden who has yet to get married

110
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,600
shouldn't be seen by just anyone.

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
Then this marriage...

112
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,360
we have settled it.

113
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,560
It's settled.

114
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Then your son-in-law

115
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,120
will come to ask for her hand in a few days.

116
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,399
Father-in-law.

117
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,560
Please accept this money.

118
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,519
Once related to our Lai Family,

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,759
you won't worry about food or clothing.

120
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,480
You'll have wealth and honor.

121
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,600
Of course.

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,399
Of course.

123
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,159
Yatou.

124
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,039
Yatou.

125
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,559
Yatou.

126
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,559
You accepted the Bride price.

127
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,200
And now you tell me there's no one here?

128
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you take my Lai Family for fools?

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Young Master Lai.

130
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:13,200
My daughter is still young.

131
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,399
She acted on impulse.

132
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,440
I'll go find her for you right now, okay?

133
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,480
Find her now?

134
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,639
So you father and daughter can run away together?

135
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,000
Young Master Lai.

136
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,600
I wouldn't dare!

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,799
We are in-laws now.

138
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,480
How could I deceive you?

139
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,679
Screw you.

140
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,919
You think you're worthy of being in-laws with our Lai Family?

141
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
If we hadn't taken a liking to your girl,

142
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
how many lifetimes would it take for you

143
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,799
to have any connection with our Lai Family?

144
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,399
I gave you plenty for the Bride price.

145
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:36,639
If I don't see her,

146
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,840
I'll take your life.

147
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,120
Go.

148
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:41,159
Catch her and bring her back to me.

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,720
Yes.

150
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,080
Screw you!

151
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,120
Stop hitting him!

152
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,440
What is going on here?

153
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,240
Young Master.

154
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,080
She was like this when we brought her back from Changxian Temple.

155
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
I heard that place is spooky.

156
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,480
She probably encountered something unclean.

157
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,879
Like this, she wants to enter our Lai Family's door?

158
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm telling you.

159
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Hurry up and pay back the money you owe the Lai Family.

160
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,200
Or else I'll take your life.

161
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,919
Young Master Lai.

162
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,799
Young Master Lai, I beg you.

163
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,320
I have no money, Young Master Lai.

164
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,279
Screw you.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's go.

166
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:16,720
This...

167
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,279
Where is my money?

168
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:25,279
Where's the money?

169
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,120
Where is my money?

170
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,399
Where is my money?

171
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,639
Where is my money?

172
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,519
Where is my money?

173
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,159
Where's the money?

174
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
I'll be back later.

175
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,840
Just a few more puffs.

176
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,480
Yatou.

177
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,720
Dad bought your favorite sugar cake.

178
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,840
Yatou.

179
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,240
So Uncle Bao knew he was in the wrong,

180
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,799
that's why he made up

181
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:51,679
such a legend about a Ghost Opera Troupe.

182
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,360
It seems he couldn't get past his own conscience.

183
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,759
Find someone to help Uncle Bao

184
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,720
take care of his funeral arrangements.
