1
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
But that night,

2
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,359
something strange really did happen.

3
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,120
What strange thing?

4
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,640
The opera troupe has many rules for performances.

5
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
Before the show,

6
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,000
the townspeople

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,799
have to put the troupe's payment

8
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,120
into thirteen cloth bags.

9
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,959
Ten coins in each bag.

10
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,760
Thirteen bags,

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
making exactly

12
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,079
one hundred and thirty coins.

13
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,879
If they find that

14
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,840
the actors on stage aren't serious

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,560
or make a mistake,

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,359
they cut down one bag immediately.

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,719
But this rule

18
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,040
is practically nonexistent for the troupe.

19
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,560
Because the audience

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,480
is so captivated by the play,

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
who would bother touching the bags?

22
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,120
That night,

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,280
when the performance was nearly over,

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,400
I was patrolling around

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,120
as usual.

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,479
Bravo!

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,639
Chang Xian'er is here!

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,400
This La Li Tou is a fool,

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
but he can distinguish

30
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,120
right from wrong.

31
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,560
It was because he stole

32
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,080
the money bag in front of the stage

33
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,759
that Chang Xian'er blamed him.

34
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,680
Xue Lao,

35
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,879
where is La Li Tou now?

36
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,520
Changxian'er Temple.

37
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,280
Before Hongniang's incident,

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,319
didn't she come here with Zhang Sheng?

39
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,680
Xue Lao also said

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
La Li Tou has no fixed home,

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,719
but spends most of his time at Changxian'er Temple.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
I wonder if he's there now.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,759
Let's go.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,400
Let's go in and take a look.

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,560
La Li Tou!

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,120
La Li Tou!

47
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,000
La Li Tou!

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,159
It seems he's not here.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
W-What's going on?

50
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,360
Could there really be evil spirits here?

51
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
La Li Tou!

52
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,599
Why are you here?

53
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,279
Look at him.

54
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,120
He seems badly frightened.

55
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,519
La Li Tou,

56
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,519
what exactly did you see that night?

57
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,160
Chang Xian'er...

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,079
Chang Xian'er is here...

59
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,839
Stop asking.

60
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,600
He won't be able to tell us anything in this state.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,720
Then what do we do?

62
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,000
Since he cannot

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,079
tell us himself,

64
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,040
then let's have him

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
take us to see it.

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,800
First, I'll hypnotize him

67
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,079
and send him back to the troupe.

68
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,800
Mystic Heaven, Spiritual Earth.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Mind and thought as one.

70
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,000
Yin and Yang, ten thousand forms.

71
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,279
All things flow and change.

72
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,199
Be not startled, be not afraid.

73
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,079
Be not afraid, be not startled.

74
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,639
Hour of the Pig, third quarter.

75
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,240
Mind returns to the void.

76
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,720
Make him believe he has returned to that day.

77
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,240
Let's see if there are any clues.

78
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,120
La Li Tou.

79
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:57,839
Chang Xian'er is here.

80
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,079
Chang Xian'er has come to catch me!

81
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,519
Chang Xian'er is here!

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,720
Chang Xian'er is here!

83
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:05,879
Speak what you know.

84
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
This Great Immortal will not blame you.

85
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,920
Or else I will eat you!

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,959
Sister Hong.

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,360
Sister Hong was crying.

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,759
Will La Li Tou be okay with you doing this?

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Once the knot in his heart is untied,

90
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,120
he'll be fine after a few days of rest.

91
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,519
But he didn't say anything.

92
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,480
He did.

93
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,439
That night, Hongniang left halfway through,

94
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,360
and appeared backstage.

95
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,519
He must have seen something happen.

96
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:54,759
What's going on here?

97
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:55,279
Look.

98
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,560
The Lai Mansion today...

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
with all this fanfare.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
What are they trying to do?

101
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,319
What's happening?

102
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,000
Listen to me, everyone.

103
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,720
Our Young Master Lai

104
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,079
has recently contracted an illness.

105
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
We are hiring experts to treat him.

106
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,279
If anyone can cure our Young Master,

107
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,240
the Lai Mansion will reward them heavily.

108
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,839
Young Master Lai is used to bullying men and women.

109
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,439
Now he's getting his retribution, isn't he?

110
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,759
Exactly.

111
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,800
Serves him right.

112
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:21,639
Don't you know some medicine?

113
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,439
Of course.

114
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,480
I studied the art of healing and saving lives.

115
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
Evil people get their just deserts.

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,279
Let's go.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,360
What are you doing?

118
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
Why make it so mysterious?

119
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,079
All secretive.

120
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,800
Can you really cure my son?

121
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,240
Is he actually possessed?

122
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,319
We'll know after we see him.

123
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,920
My Lai family...

124
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,480
fasts and prays to Buddha every day.

125
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,079
Although my son is spoiled and willful,

126
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:09,800
he has never done

127
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,519
anything wicked.

128
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,959
Why does Heaven treat

129
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,160
my Lai family like this?

130
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,800
That's not necessarily true.

131
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,199
In all things,

132
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,680
one cannot just look at the surface.

133
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,959
Perhaps

134
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,360
your son did something wicked

135
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,360
that you don't know about.

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,639
What exactly happened?

137
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,159
Please tell us, Madam.

138
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,360
A few days ago,

139
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
a Ghost Opera Troupe came to perform.

140
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,679
My son insisted on making a fuss

141
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,960
to go watch the opera.

142
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,240
Everyone knows

143
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,600
when watching the opera,

144
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,039
one cannot leave halfway.

145
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,320
But that day...

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,080
Bravo!

147
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Good!

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
Good!

149
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Wonderful!

150
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,759
Good!

151
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,720
It's really good!

152
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,159
Wonderful!

153
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:17,759
Son!

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,159
Son!

155
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,039
Son, what's wrong?

156
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,960
What's wrong?

157
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,120
Since then,

158
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,159
my son has been possessed.

159
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,840
Calling him, shouting at him...

160
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,360
he doesn't react.

161
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,639
We found doctors, physicians,

162
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,759
exorcists, Taoist priests...

163
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,639
none could cure him.

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,799
If you can cure him,

165
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,600
whatever conditions you raise,

166
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:46,799
I will agree to them all.

167
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,519
Let me see the Young Master first.

168
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,960
Take a look.

169
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,320
Son!

170
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,360
Son!

171
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,840
Stop banging!

172
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,000
You're bleeding!

173
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,320
Think of a way, quickly!

174
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
Save him!

175
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,919
Think of a way, quick!

176
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,399
Son!

177
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,799
It's not demonic possession.

178
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,679
It's poison.

179
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,919
How could this happen?

180
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,720
Nerve damage caused by a potent toxin.

181
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,039
After the brain damage,

182
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
he became delirious,

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
and his intellect regressed.

184
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:57,080
Is there any medicine to cure my son?

185
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:58,960
You can try

186
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,320
giving him some detoxifying medicine first

187
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,519
to see if it works.

188
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,559
Then...

189
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,200
the previous doctors,

190
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,919
why didn't they find the cause?

191
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,879
Perhaps because Lai Mansion

192
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,200
abuses its power too much.

193
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,399
Others fear that the slightest mistake

194
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,320
would invite retaliation.

195
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,679
See them out.

196
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,080
Let's go, you two.

197
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,279
My son.

198
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,639
It breaks my heart.

199
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,519
It really is strange.

200
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,799
Right after San Yatou died,

201
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,799
something happened to the Young Master.

202
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,360
That's right.

203
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,799
San Yatou was destined not to enter Lai Mansion.

204
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,360
You heard that, right?

205
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,200
I heard it.

206
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,120
He said San Yatou was going to enter Lai Mansion.

207
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,679
And...

208
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,799
Young Master Lai's trouble started after San Yatou died.

209
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,080
Let's go.

210
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,399
Let's go check Uncle Bao's house.
