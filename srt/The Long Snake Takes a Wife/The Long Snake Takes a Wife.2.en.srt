1
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:27,920
It's just past 7-9 PM

2
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,519
Why is the street empty?

3
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,400
Maybe

4
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,640
everyone is afraid of Chang Xian'er

5
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,799
so

6
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,719
they dare not go out

7
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,840
Miss Bailing

8
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,719
Miss Bailing!

9
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
You're finally here

10
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Let's go take a look, quick

11
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,359
Heigou Ge

12
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,200
Don't rush

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm here, aren't I?

14
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,719
That's true

15
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,959
Who doesn't know

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,120
Yan Sanye of the Bai Pu Shop

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,120
has Spiritual Sight

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
Discerning Yin and Yang

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,840
Miss Bailing

20
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,760
and you are Sanye's head disciple

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,159
so it can't be wrong

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,400
The mysterious things in this world

23
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,319
are nothing but various coincidences

24
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,959
and farces woven by human hearts

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,560
Miss Bailing

26
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,120
I haven't heard

27
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,319
that Sanye

28
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,719
accepted a new disciple

29
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,879
He's just passing through looking for someone

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,479
He's no trouble

31
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,759
Outlander

32
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,280
You talk big

33
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,759
Here in Baiyun Town

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,280
it's a long way from anywhere

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,840
Be careful, it's dark and the road is slippery

36
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,159
Don't twist your ankle

37
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,199
Miss Bailing

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
let's go

39
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,080
Dad

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,000
Dad, open the door

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,400
Dad

42
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:40,960
Heigou Ge

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,080
what is going on?

44
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,879
Well, this morning

45
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,199
as soon as I opened the door and came out

46
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,759
I saw my dad coming back from outside

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,080
I reckon

48
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,759
he was looking for Hongniang all night

49
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
But today was really strange

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,560
I spoke to him

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
but he ignored me

52
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,360
He even pushed me out and locked the door

53
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Tell me

54
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,479
this...

55
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,759
what should I do, Miss Bailing?

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,639
Dad

57
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:23,240
Dad

58
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:28,360
Dad

59
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,719
Help!

60
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,199
Dad

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,279
Dad

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,680
Dad

63
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,639
Dad

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,959
Snake

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,959
Snake

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:29,800
Snake

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,399
Giant snake

68
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,720
Serpent's Coil

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,920
What does that mean?

70
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,439
Serpent's Coil

71
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,959
It starts appearing from the waist,

72
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:47,480
a cluster of dense blisters.

73
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:48,199
Later on,

74
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,759
it spreads along the waist,

75
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,079
looking just like a snake

76
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,079
wrapped around the waist.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,560
Hence the name,

78
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,600
Serpent's Coil.

79
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,079
Legend has it,

80
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,040
once the snake circles all the way around,

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,959
the person will die.

82
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,079
Chang Xian'er

83
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,160
Spare me!

84
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:08,879
Chang Xian'er

85
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:09,959
Chang Xian'er

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,319
Little brother,

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,800
please think of a way, won't you?

88
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,800
Prepare a pair of Yin-Yang Candles,

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,360
two pairs of Heaven-Earth Needles,

90
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,879
and three Crystal jars.

91
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,000
Light the Yin-Yang Candles.

92
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
Silver needle passes the fire dragon.

93
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,600
The hundred gates of heaven and earth open.

94
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,279
All things come naturally.

95
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,959
The sealing of the gates

96
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,639
is for the gray souls.

97
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
Mystic gates join the Yang.

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,519
The First House Gate.

99
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,519
True Qi from eight directions.

100
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:38,160
Spirit-Capturing Realm.

101
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,399
Capturing souls inside and out.

102
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,199
Come with the water.

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,680
Sir,

104
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,319
my dad, he...

105
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,240
Let him rest quietly at home.

106
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,279
I'll write a prescription later.

107
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
Just have your dad take it for half a month.

108
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:12,800
Hey.

109
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,360
Who exactly are you?

110
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,759
Stop pretending.

111
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,199
Paper cuttings cover heaven and earth

112
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,480
Bronze mirror

113
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,759
Reflects Yin and Yang

114
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,199
What does that mean?

115
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:39,839
Paper-Cutting Soul Summoning.

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,800
Sir.

117
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,399
You also know of Paper-Cutting Soul Summoning?

118
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,720
What is Paper-Cutting Soul Summoning?

119
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,120
Paper-Cutting Soul Summoning

120
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,600
is a technique from the paper-cutting trade,

121
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,639
a special kind of sorcery.

122
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,839
It uses paper cuttings

123
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,199
to create five dolls holding hands,

124
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,560
with ox horns on their heads,

125
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,079
to ward off ghosts and suppress evil.

126
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,519
Covering the area with paper dolls

127
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,079
signifies the round heaven and square earth.

128
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,000
What you say is correct, sir.

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,839
But this is merely a legend.

130
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,600
It is nothing more than a form of

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,040
solace for the human heart.

132
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,079
It cannot be trusted.

133
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,000
Who exactly are you?

134
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
How do you know so much?

135
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,480
White clouds, green mountains, one mid-sky.

136
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,120
No birth, no death.

137
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,879
Speak not of this to others.

138
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,920
I am

139
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,279
Bai Zhongtian.

140
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,600
Bai Yan Jue.

141
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,680
Paper-Cutting Soul Summoning

142
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,519
is not a legend.

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,920
It is real.

144
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,920
My father loves to gamble.

145
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,040
He owed a lot of gambling debts.

146
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,040
One time,

147
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,319
the creditors came to our door.

148
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,519
Please spare me!

149
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,079
Ouch!

150
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,279
Ouch!

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,560
Masters, please spare my life!

152
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,000
Ouch!

153
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,480
What are you doing?

154
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,040
Keep hitting him!

155
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:57,839
Father!

156
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,560
Li Laosan.

157
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,600
When you borrowed the money,

158
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
you solemnly promised me

159
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,480
to repay the principal with interest.

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,079
Where is the money?

161
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,240
In the beginning,

162
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
I only borrowed thirty silver dollars from you!

163
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,439
Now you're asking me for two hundred!

164
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,680
Where am I supposed to get that?

165
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,000
I have so many brothers,

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
and the fee for the trouble of collecting,

167
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,240
plus the interest...

168
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,079
it's now three hundred silver dollars.

169
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,839
Keep hitting him!

170
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:24,959
Stop hitting him!

171
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,120
I'll pay!

172
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,279
I'll pay!

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,439
Stop.

174
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:31,199
Father!

175
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,800
Are you all right?

176
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,759
I'll give you one more day.

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,240
If you don't pay up,

178
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,240
I will burn this shop of yours

179
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
to the ground.

180
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,399
I will do whatever it takes

181
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,480
to pay you back!

182
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,799
Let's go.

183
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:48,840
Father.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,559
Are you okay?

185
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:49,879
Father...

186
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:52,000
Why don't we run away?

187
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,440
Father?

188
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,799
Father!

189
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,679
Father!

190
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:04,519
Hongniang.

191
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,720
I beg you,

192
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:08,320
I beg you to save me!

193
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,440
These are debts you incurred yourself.

194
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,879
You brought this on yourself.

195
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,159
Save me!

196
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,120
Hongniang!

197
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,919
Hongniang!

198
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,399
Go to the Great Immortal

199
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:18,759
and plead on my behalf!

200
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,120
Don't talk nonsense!

201
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,679
Hongniang,

202
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,960
I sincerely beg you,

203
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,879
please help me.

204
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,440
As long as you can save me,

205
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
whatever conditions you name,

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,759
I'll agree to anything.

207
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,360
Hongniang,

208
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:38,440
I beg you.

209
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:38,879
Hongniang!

210
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
I beg you!

211
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,279
You should go.

212
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,320
I'll figure something out for the money.
