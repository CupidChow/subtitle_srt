1
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,879
If you violate the troupe's taboos,

2
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,799
your life will be taken away.

3
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,000
Chang Xian'er Temple

4
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:39,400
Chang Xian'er

5
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,079
Chang Xian'er is here!

6
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,599
Hongniang uses heart's blood to build a bridge,

7
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,760
and the Yin-Yang Cloth to clear her name.

8
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,319
She has already been betrothed to Chang Xian'er.

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,799
Why is it that everything

10
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,519
is related to Chang Xian'er?

11
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,200
Tian'er.

12
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,120
Mom.

13
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,439
Can you tell me,

14
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,480
what exactly is going on?

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
What's happening in there?

16
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
Haven't you heard?

17
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,680
Chang Xian'er has been caught.

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,159
Huh?

19
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,080
Is that true?

20
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,599
On the night of the opera,

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
the fool saw with his own eyes

22
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,919
Chang Xian'er killing someone.

23
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,800
Mr. Bai is going to report to the officials now.

24
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,400
What's all the noise about?

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,560
Are you ever going to stop?

26
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,960
Honestly.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,520
Master Xue,

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
what is wrong with you?

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,400
At your age,

30
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,919
why do you blab about everything?

31
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,159
When did we ever

32
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,560
catch Chang Xian'er?

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,919
I never said

34
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,280
we caught Chang Xian'er.

35
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:47,000
Who did you hear that from?

36
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,479
I said it.

37
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,639
You said it?

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,719
Are you out of your mind?

39
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,039
We didn't catch anything.

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,240
It doesn't matter if we catch him or not.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,680
As long as the news reaches him.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,439
La Li Tou.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,520
La Li Tou.

44
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,120
La Li Tou!

45
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,039
Who is it?

46
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,960
Who's calling me?

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,479
La Li Tou.

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,439
Chang Xian'er, spare my life!

49
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,279
Who exactly are you?

50
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,720
You actually want to kill to silence us?

51
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
I'm taking you to the officials right now.

52
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,079
Bailing!

53
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,079
Bailing!

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,519
It's poison!

55
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,199
Since you're all here,

56
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,480
I'll send you all on your way together.

57
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,879
If I had known you fool

58
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,680
would cause so much trouble,

59
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,600
I wouldn't have let you live this long.

60
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,920
Zhang Sheng!

61
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:55,399
Who exactly are you?

62
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,399
Why did you kill Hongniang?

63
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,160
Why?

64
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,079
Li Laosan's death,

65
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,120
Zhang Sheng seeing a ghost,

66
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,839
and La Li Tou getting possessed...

67
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,439
Behind these events,

68
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:13,079
there must be someone lying.

69
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
Am I right,

70
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,319
Heigou?

71
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,319
It really is you.

72
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,279
Dad!

73
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,519
Quick!

74
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:45,839
Dad!

75
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,519
Quick, quick, quick!

76
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,079
Where did you go so late at night?

77
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,519
Easy now.

78
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,199
Quick!

79
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,759
Close the door.

80
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:55,800
Okay.

81
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,920
Dad...

82
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,079
Your mom ran away when you were little.

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,519
You've been with me,

84
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:05,199
and suffered a lot.

85
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,399
It doesn't matter if I stay a bachelor all my life,

86
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,519
but you can't

87
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,720
follow in my footsteps.

88
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,839
Why are you saying this, Dad?

89
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,160
Come here, son.

90
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,120
Come.

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,079
Help me untie this.

92
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,439
With our family's meager savings,

93
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
if we were to have a proper wedding,

94
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,399
you...

95
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:33,000
would be a bachelor for life.

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,120
Dad...

97
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,879
can only use this cash

98
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:37,639
to buy a wife for you.

99
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,600
Behave yourself.

100
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:41,800
You...

101
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,000
go wait outside now.

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Dad...

103
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
will teach her a lesson for you first.

104
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,160
Let me tell you,

105
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,600
from now on,

106
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,600
you are our Heigou's wife.

107
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
Stay here and behave.

108
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,879
Bear children for Heigou.

109
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,120
Carry on the family line for me.

110
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,959
If you don't listen to me,

111
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,360
I'll break your legs

112
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,160
and throw you to the back mountain to feed the wolves.

113
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,079
Do you hear me?

114
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,800
Do you hear me?

115
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:25,759
Don't hit me.

116
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,240
Hongniang.

117
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,560
Eat it while it's hot.

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,360
Does it still hurt?

119
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:46,759
Come.

120
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,679
I just cut this.

121
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,519
Hongniang, look.

122
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,559
Do you like it?

123
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,840
You useless waste.

124
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,600
Do you know...

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,559
I took our family's savings...

126
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,720
took it all out...

127
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,200
and bought you a wife.

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,879
You say you don't want her just like that?

129
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,600
Well?

130
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,039
You plan to be a bachelor all your life?

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,360
Dad.

132
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,720
She's quite pitiful too.

133
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,159
What?

134
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:19,519
You...

135
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
Dad.

136
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,360
How about this.

137
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,720
Since my son...

138
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,879
doesn't want to force you...

139
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,519
then I won't force you either.

140
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,840
But there's one thing.

141
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,679
I spent...

142
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,000
ten silver dollars...

143
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,799
to buy you.

144
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,200
You pay me back twenty silver dollars.

145
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
Once it's paid off...

146
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,320
I'll let you go.

147
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,279
My parents were killed by bandits.

148
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,440
I have no money.

149
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:55,440
What?

150
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,919
No money?

151
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,039
But I can work.

152
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,240
I can work to pay it back.

153
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,840
You what?

154
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,080
You work?

155
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:03,720
You...

156
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,960
Fine.

157
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,919
Then starting tomorrow...

158
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,919
you work here in our home for me.

159
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,159
You can't leave until you've paid off my money.

160
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,480
But there's one thing.

161
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:21,080
You're not allowed to sneak away halfway.

162
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,080
If I catch you and bring you back...

163
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,879
I'll break your legs.

164
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,600
Do you hear me?

165
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,879
I heard you.

166
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:37,639
Hongniang.

167
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,320
My dad...

168
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,759
My dad isn't a bad person.

169
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,000
He's just scared of being poor.

170
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:42,960
Look...

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
it's the chaos of war out there right now.

172
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,440
You have nowhere to go either.

173
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:47,600
How about...

174
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,840
just stay here for now.

175
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,519
There's plenty of food.

176
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,720
When you want to leave...

177
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,879
we'll leave then.

178
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,759
You killed Hongniang.

179
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,279
I didn't.

180
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,960
I didn't harm Hongniang.

181
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,039
What you said before...

182
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,519
was all lies.

183
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,720
Everything I said is true.

184
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,200
It was him.

185
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,519
If it weren't for him...

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,360
Hongniang...

187
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,600
would have accepted me long ago.

188
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,480
Hongniang.

189
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
The performance at Ba Xian Tang tonight...

190
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,600
let me go with you.

191
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,159
Mm.

192
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,080
Okay.

193
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,000
This is good.

194
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,799
Good.

195
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,360
It's really nice.

196
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,039
Really good.

197
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,960
Amazing.

198
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,480
It's impossible between us.

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,039
The one I love is Zhang Sheng.

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,720
Hongniang.

201
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,080
You know I like you, right?

202
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,919
You have some feelings for me...

203
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,440
don't you?

204
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,480
Let go.

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
I'll save up the money as soon as possible...

206
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,279
and pay your dad back.

207
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,279
Hongniang.

208
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,879
Give me another chance, okay?

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,399
Just give me one more chance.

210
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:23,799
Okay?

211
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,919
Let go.

212
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,039
Don't you bully Sister Hong!

213
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:39,639
Don't you bully Sister Hong!

214
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,720
Don't you bully...

215
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,039
I'm telling you,

216
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,799
about this,

217
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,559
if you dare breathe

218
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,279
a single word,

219
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,720
I'll have Chang Xian'er take you!

220
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,639
Chang Xian'er is here!

221
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,840
Chang Xian'er is here!

222
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,279
It's wonderful!

223
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
Bravo!

224
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,919
Bravo!

225
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,759
Wonderful!

226
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,399
Let's watch the show.

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,000
Bravo!

228
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,240
Wonderful!

229
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,000
Bravo!

230
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,240
Bravo!
