1
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,879
My body is barely cold,

2
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,120
yet you behave so shamelessly in our home.

3
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,000
I am filled with such hatred!

4
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,079
San Niang!

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Why did you seal me at the bottom of the well?

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,319
Why?

7
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,000
San Niang!

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:54,799
San Niang!

9
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,280
I was wrong!

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,640
San Niang!

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,840
No!

12
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,799
It was her!

13
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,719
She seduced me! It's not my fault!

14
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,319
San Niang!

15
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,400
You clearly abandoned your wife and children,

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,959
and now you dare to slander me!

17
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:07,879
Sister...

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,560
He told me himself.

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,280
He said he never loved you at all.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,639
He said...

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
being with you...

22
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,479
was only to get your family fortune.

23
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,120
All day long, behind your back,

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
he would have affairs with me.

25
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,680
After getting drunk,

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,360
he even said...

27
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,400
he said he wanted to make you disappear completely.

28
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,400
It was all him!

29
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,680
It had nothing to do with me!

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,680
San Niang!

31
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,560
I was wrong!

32
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,520
I was wrong!

33
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,280
San Niang!

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,719
I was wrong!

35
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,080
San Niang!

36
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,639
San Niang!

37
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,680
So you really did kill San Niang.

38
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,599
You Betrayer.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,039
The well you built...

40
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,000
was never meant to commemorate your wife and child.

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,400
It was to prevent them from finding peace.

42
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,520
The Soul-Suppressing Lock.

43
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,039
My guess was indeed correct.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,319
The deaths of San Niang and the child...

45
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,319
you are the real culprit.

46
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,879
Speak up, now!

47
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,919
Or I'll shoot you!

48
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,400
I'll talk!

49
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,080
I'll tell you everything!

50
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,520
Yue'er.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,599
Yue'er.

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
Why are you sitting here all alone?

53
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,039
San Niang?

54
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,199
How did you come back?

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,199
How could you do this to me?

56
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:43,800
I worked to support the family while heavily pregnant,

57
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,360
while you were cheating at home,

58
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,240
and even locked our child outside the room!

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,680
You Betrayer!

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,639
You vixen!

61
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,800
You wrecked my family! I'll beat you to death!

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,879
Calm down!

63
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,360
Are you done yet?

64
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,800
Are you alright, Sui'er?

65
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,719
Where are you hurt?

66
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,319
Let me see.

67
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,319
Mother!

68
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,639
Are you okay?

69
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:03,840
Mother!

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,199
San Niang!

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,759
Mother, what's wrong?

72
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,080
San Niang!

73
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:06,800
Mother!

74
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,400
Are you alright?

75
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,039
Mother!

76
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,520
San Niang!

77
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,079
Mother and child are safe.

78
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
It is truly a blessing amidst misfortune.

79
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,240
San Niang's body is weak.

80
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
You must take good care of her.

81
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,240
I know I was wrong.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,600
San Niang.

83
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,160
Please forgive me.

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
I won't dare do it again.

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,720
I will treat you twice as well from now on.

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,600
San Niang.

87
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,759
For the sake of our young child,

88
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,319
won't you give me another chance?

89
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:52,720
San Niang.

90
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,519
Yue'er.

91
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,959
Go beg your mother.

92
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,560
Mother.

93
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:58,920
San Niang.

94
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,680
Yue'er.

95
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,399
Mother is going out to sell goods.

96
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
You stay home and watch your brother.

97
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,439
Understood, Mother.

98
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:37,839
Yue'er

99
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,360
Yue'er, listen to Dad.

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,439
Take your brother out to play for a while.

101
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,000
Come back in a while.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,680
Go.

103
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,680
No.

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:43,959
Yue'er, be good.

105
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,199
Dad.

106
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,199
I won't go.

107
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,879
Dad.

108
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:46,680
Be good, Yue'er.

109
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,000
Bad person.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,600
Yue'er.

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,439
You are a bad person.

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,079
Yue'er.

113
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:51,560
Bad person.

114
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,519
Get out.

115
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:52,920
Yue'er.

116
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,879
You get out.

117
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:54,079
You bad person.

118
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,000
Stop fussing, Yue'er.

119
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,120
Get out of here.

120
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,040
Stop making a scene, Yue'er.

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,319
Leave my house.

122
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,040
You bad person.

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,439
You get out.

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,319
Don't you fuss.

125
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:02,720
Yue'er.

126
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,279
Get out.

127
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,120
Leave my house.

128
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,680
Get her away quick, or we're done for.

129
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,160
Let go.

130
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,319
Get out of here.

131
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,040
I'll teach you to make a scene.

132
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,600
Dad.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,079
Why just won't you listen?

134
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,639
No!

135
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,600
Why just won't you listen?

136
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,560
Dad.

137
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,680
Let me out.

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,720
Dad.

139
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,839
So noisy.

140
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,160
Make sure it's done cleanly.

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,759
Bao'er, be good.

142
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,480
Come here, Bao'er.

143
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,120
Mother's precious Bao'er is here.

144
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,160
Come quickly.

145
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,040
Into Mother's arms.

146
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,199
Mother lifts Bao'er...

147
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,639
...up high.

148
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Bao'er, be good.

149
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,079
Come here, Bao'er.

150
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,199
In Mother's heart...

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
...Bao'er lives.

152
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,759
Come quickly...

153
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,439
...into Mother's arms.

154
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:01,160
Let's go.

155
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,240
But before...

156
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,199
Xiao Jiu and the others said...

157
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,639
...they saw San Niang's ghost.

158
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,319
Then who was it really?

159
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,160
Maybe it was a relative of San Niang.

160
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:24,920
Also seeking justice for them.

161
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,199
Met an unworthy man in this life...

162
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,920
...hope to meet a good man in the next.

163
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,839
They are just some unwanted bastards.

164
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,959
I sold them.

165
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,560
They have food and drink.

166
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,480
What is wrong with that?

167
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
They only lost their family.

168
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,680
It doesn't mean no one cares...

169
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,279
...or no one loves them.

170
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
You're still up this late?

171
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,600
What are you thinking about?

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,079
Master.

173
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,319
You haven't gone to bed yet?

174
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,639
I'm getting old.

175
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,319
I don't need much sleep.

176
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,439
Master.

177
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,879
Is something weighing on your mind?

178
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,360
Ever since that man arrived...

179
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,000
...you haven't been yourself.

180
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,679
Time flies so fast.

181
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,039
In the blink of an eye...

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,679
...twenty years have passed.

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,519
Bodhisattva bless us.

184
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,879
Bodhisattva bless us.

185
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,240
Bodhisattva bless us.

186
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,720
Bodhisattva bless us.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,120
Bodhisattva bless us.

188
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,600
Bodhisattva bless us.

189
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,759
The child must be born before the midnight hour.

190
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,799
Bodhisattva bless us.

191
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,399
Mother.

192
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:02,600
Don't be so superstitious.

193
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,840
As long as mother and child are safe...

194
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,799
...that's all that matters.

195
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,240
Bodhisattva bless us.

196
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,440
The baby is born!

197
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,039
How is everything?

198
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,399
Yin Midwife.

199
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,799
Is there something wrong?

200
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,039
The child was born at the wrong time.

201
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,639
What do you mean, wrong?

202
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,840
When the child cried...

203
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,080
...it was exactly the midnight hour.

204
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,519
Before the midnight hour is Yang.

205
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:38,159
After it is Yin.

206
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,600
This child...

207
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,240
...was born right on the line between Yin and Yang.

208
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,480
Born in a Yin year, Yin month, Yin day, and Yin hour.

209
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,879
He has the Fate of Fourfold Yin Earth.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,399
This...

211
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,960
...what does that mean?

212
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:51,759
This earth...

213
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,120
...is no ordinary earth.

214
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,759
It is the Yin earth used to bury coffins.

215
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,279
Yin earth buries the living.

216
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,919
Evil spirits will draw near.

217
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,840
It will plague your entire family.

218
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you saying?

219
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,480
Plague the whole family?

220
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,000
What should we do?

221
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:08,559
Yin Midwife...

222
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,159
...you must think of a way!

223
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,200
Heaven's Yang controls the Yin.

224
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:13,919
Middle Earth covers the spirit.

225
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,399
This child...

226
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:16,919
...shall be named Zhong Tian.

227
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,519
Zhong Tian.

228
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,200
Good.

229
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:20,799
This name...

230
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,879
...can keep him safe for a while.

231
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,399
As for the rest...

232
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,960
...it depends on the Bai family's fate.

233
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,559
Bad luck charm!

234
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,639
Jinx!

235
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,559
Everyone in the house is dead!

236
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
Bad luck charm!

237
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,559
Jinx!

238
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,519
Bad luck charm!

239
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,519
Jinx!

240
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,600
Bad luck charm!

241
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,799
Jinx!

242
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,919
Bad luck charm!

243
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,879
Jinx!

244
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:00,279
Tian'er!

245
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,240
Tian'er!

246
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
What happened to you?

247
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,279
Did you get bullied again?

248
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:04,960
Ah!

249
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,600
Auntie Bai!

250
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,600
Zhong Tian's father...

251
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,679
...fell into the river and drowned!

252
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,919
Go and see, quick!

253
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,799
What?

254
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,159
This child is truly bad luck.

255
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,879
He cursed his whole family to death.

256
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,559
That's right.

257
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,879
We said it long ago.

258
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,720
This child is born with a curse.

259
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,200
So...

260
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,399
...he is a pitiful soul too.

261
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,519
All these years, all alone...

262
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,799
...wandering out there.

263
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,720
He must have suffered a lot.

264
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,279
Go to sleep.
