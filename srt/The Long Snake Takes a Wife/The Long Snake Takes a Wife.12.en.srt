1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,359
I'll leave it to you.

2
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:17,760
Master San.

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,840
Let's go too.

4
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,879
Please don't go.

5
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,599
If you leave, what about my husband?

6
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:28,879
Your husband?

7
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,480
Didn't you always look down on your husband?

8
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,920
Thinking that usually,

9
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,599
he makes you unhappy and angry?

10
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,400
Now you're set.

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,680
From now on,

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,280
he won't bother you anymore.

13
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,879
In a few days,

14
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,079
he'll be completely dead.

15
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,159
And that's the end of it.

16
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,480
Yeah.

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,920
It's great if he dies.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,000
Find a new one.

19
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,040
A handsome one.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
A rich one.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
One who can sweet-talk.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
One who understands romance.

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
We're leaving now.

24
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,480
I...

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,519
I can't lose him.

26
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,239
I can't lose him.

27
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,680
Why not?

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,319
I see that usually,

29
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,640
you're very fierce towards him,

30
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,400
treating him like an enemy.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,400
I...

32
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,639
I...

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,639
am just afraid of losing him.

34
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,719
That's why I am

35
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,159
so strict with him.

36
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,520
Although he hasn't let me

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,039
make big money,

38
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:23,840
but...

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,199
he hasn't let me worry about food or clothes.

40
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,120
When I'm sad,

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
he acts as my punching bag.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,120
When I'm unhappy,

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,479
he cheers me up.

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,280
I have a bad temper,

45
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,039
but he tolerates me.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,599
If it were anyone else,

47
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,960
no one could do that.

48
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,719
Really.

49
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,319
So the more it's like this,

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,199
the more I fear losing him.

51
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:44,599
I...

52
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,560
I just...

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,039
I just have a sharp tongue but a soft heart.

54
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,039
Do you know how many people,

55
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,039
just because of a sharp tongue

56
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:50,800
and a soft heart,

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,639
unintentionally hurt those

58
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,680
closest to them?

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,560
I know I was wrong.

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,240
I beg you,

61
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
save my husband.

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,840
I beg you to save him.

63
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,159
Please, I beg you.

64
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,639
Since that's the case,

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
the one who can save him

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,479
is only you.

67
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,039
Me?

68
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,719
In your home,

69
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:13,639
there is an Evil spirit.

70
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,840
This Evil spirit feeds on negative emotions.

71
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,360
Your husband's condition...

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,840
he's been mostly consumed.

73
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,039
If it gets any later,

74
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,039
even a god

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,840
couldn't save him.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Then I...

77
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,879
Then what should I do?

78
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,159
Human words for humans,

79
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,319
humans follow the Way.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,360
Ghost words for ghosts,

81
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,039
ghosts must not listen.

82
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,439
Drink it all at once.

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Sir,

84
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,519
Sir, what's happening to me?

85
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,480
As long as the evil entity has no energy to feed on,

86
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,600
it will naturally dissipate.

87
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,160
You just need to keep silent.

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,839
And then...

89
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,439
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,319
I didn't realize supporting the family was so hard.

91
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,560
Yet I tormented you every day.

92
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,720
This life belongs to both of us,

93
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,680
but I made you bear it all alone.

94
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,439
I know I was wrong.

95
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,759
I'll change.

96
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,759
I promise to change.

97
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,399
I'll be with you,

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,600
no more being unreasonable,

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
no more bullying you.

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,480
Honey

101
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,240
You're awake.

102
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,439
Why are you crying?

103
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,639
You...

104
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,600
What's wrong?

105
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,120
Are you hungry?

106
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,319
I'll cook something for you.

107
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,120
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,399
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,519
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,800
Brother Bai.

111
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,399
What exactly is going on?

112
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:43,680
Word Spirits.

113
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,079
Word Spirits.

114
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,759
That's right.

115
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,040
Whenever we speak in our daily lives,

116
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,439
the Word Spirit appears.

117
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,319
It is a type of language monster.

118
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Once you say something you shouldn't,

119
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:56,920
the consequences...

120
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,279
are unimaginable.

121
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,639
Every sentence...

122
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,720
carries a strong power of intent.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:02,800
Therefore,

124
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:04,439
whether they are kind words...

125
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,480
or ominous ones,

126
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,560
if said often enough,

127
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,839
things will develop in that direction.

128
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Someday in the future,

129
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,160
they might just come true.

130
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,199
This...

131
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,959
is the power of the Word Spirit.

132
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,360
That's right.

133
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
Besides, usually...

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,839
you're always criticizing him...

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,279
and you're not considerate of him.

136
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:22,079
Even without the Word Spirit,

137
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,319
a normal person hearing that so much...

138
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,480
wouldn't be able to stand it either.

139
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm so sorry.

140
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,279
One kind word warms for three winters,

141
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,360
while harsh words chill even in June.

142
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,559
From now on, you two...

143
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,559
live a good life together.

144
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,039
Thank you both.

145
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:40,960
Let's go.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,399
I realize now...

147
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,279
that the choice I made back then...

148
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:53,360
was the right one.

149
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,559
From now on,

150
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,799
I can never say I want to leave you again.

151
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,679
It's okay.

152
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:58,000
It's okay.

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,919
In the future...

154
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,919
say whatever you want.

155
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,399
What do you mean?

156
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:03,320
Don't tell me...

157
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,480
you want to leave me?

158
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,840
Look at what you're saying.

159
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,240
I said...

160
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,240
I want to be with you for a lifetime.

161
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,440
Don't forget,

162
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,679
I have the Word Spirit.

163
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,039
I want to be beautiful, I want to be rich.

164
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,559
I want to be beautiful, I want to be rich.

165
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm going to use the power of the Word Spirit...

166
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,720
to become your master...

167
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,240
and make you do my bidding.

168
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,399
I'll make you my dog.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,840
Crazy.

170
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Then you'd better work hard at it.

171
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,600
Wait,

172
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,840
can you really see those...

173
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,159
unclean things?

174
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,200
That was all nonsense.

175
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,279
There are no such things as Word Spirits.

176
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Then...

177
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,519
what about the Charm Water Yang Lin drank?

178
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,240
That?

179
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,919
It was just a bowl of strong liquor...

180
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,360
mixed with burnt ashes.

181
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:57,399
Any normal person who drinks it would

182
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,320
lose their voice for a few days.

183
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,120
I just wanted her to quiet down.

184
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Sometimes, repeating words too often

185
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,919
simply creates for the listener and speaker

186
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,759
a psychological suggestion, that's all.

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
What about He Xian?

188
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,039
I can only say...

189
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,600
his acting is pretty good.

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,840
You mean...

191
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:21,919
he...

192
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,120
Miss Bailing!

193
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,000
Uncle Bao.

194
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,480
Don't panic.

195
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:30,639
Speak slowly.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,919
San Yatou...

197
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:33,000
something happened to her.

198
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,799
A few days ago,

199
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,440
Ba Xian Tang came to town to perform.

200
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,320
I took San Yatou to watch the show.

201
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,720
The play was only halfway through,

202
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,759
I just turned my head,

203
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,559
and San Yatou was gone.

204
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,480
I don't even know

205
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,879
when she left.

206
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,039
The rule for Ba Xian Tang performances

207
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,320
is that you can't leave in the middle.

208
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,639
Didn't you know that?

209
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,399
Of course I knew.

210
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,120
I thought

211
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,960
San Yatou would be back in a moment.

212
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,720
But...

213
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,919
when the show was over,

214
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,720
I still didn't see San Yatou anywhere.

215
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,159
I searched everywhere,

216
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,440
but I couldn't find her.

217
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,320
What am I going to do?

218
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,200
If the legend is true,

219
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,240
then...

220
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,720
San Yatou is in grave danger.

221
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,799
What legend?

222
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,240
Ghost Opera.
