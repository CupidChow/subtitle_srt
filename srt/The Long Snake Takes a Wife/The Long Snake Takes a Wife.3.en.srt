1
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,319
The Chang family has a joyous occasion

2
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,080
The living must keep away

3
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,319
A lucky day chosen in a foul year

4
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,039
The Serpent Bride states her name

5
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,520
Honored Uncles

6
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,759
This woman is named Hongniang

7
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,599
She wishes to marry into the Chang family

8
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,599
Heart's blood builds the bridge,

9
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,199
Yin and Yang seal the pledge.

10
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,879
Uncles of the Chang family, please judge

11
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,959
This woman is a fine choice

12
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,319
Excellent

13
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,839
Then tomorrow at the Hour of the Pig

14
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,519
Your nephew will welcome his wife

15
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,279
Hongniang

16
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,639
Hongniang, wake up

17
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:55,360
Hongniang

18
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why are you here?

19
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,959
Chang Xian'er said he'll marry you tomorrow

20
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,279
Let's go, quickly

21
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,879
There's no rush

22
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,279
Wait a moment

23
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,199
Hongniang

24
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:34,399
Hongniang

25
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,319
What are you doing?

26
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,399
Why are you just standing there?

27
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,800
Come and help me!

28
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,600
Seeing our father depends on this.

29
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,839
Who dares trespass on my Chang Xian'er forbidden ground?

30
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,439
Trespassers shall die.

31
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,240
Run!

32
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,040
Run!

33
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,160
Legend has it...

34
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,480
inside Chang Xian'er's cave,

35
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,439
there is a snake's mouth

36
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,240
leading straight into Chang Xian'er's belly.

37
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:41,800
Anything

38
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,879
that touches the liquid inside Chang Xian'er's belly

39
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,720
can turn stone into gold.

40
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,680
That is why Hongniang

41
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,759
faked a marriage match

42
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
to sneak in.

43
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,839
She actually wanted to get the gold

44
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,680
to pay off my father's gambling debts.

45
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,120
So Hongniang

46
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,360
is being taken for the wedding now, right?

47
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:01,839
My father

48
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,399
feels guilty towards her.

49
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,360
So

50
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,319
he wants to use this method

51
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,720
to find Hongniang

52
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,800
and rescue her.

53
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,040
Didn't you go to Chang Xian'er's cave before?

54
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,079
Can't you just go find her directly?

55
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,399
The location of Chang Xian'er's cave

56
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,879
is not fixed.

57
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,639
Without Chang Xian'er leading the way,

58
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,480
we cannot find it.

59
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,759
People always imagine things they can't understand

60
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,879
to be bizarre.

61
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,160
Now that the person is safe,

62
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,079
the one silver dollar reward we agreed on...

63
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,639
Hand it over.

64
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,920
Mr. Bai,

65
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,600
thank you.

66
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,720
You...

67
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:43,600
You saw it too.

68
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,839
Just now, this matter

69
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:45,920
was all

70
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,079
done by Brother Bai.

71
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,759
So this money

72
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,920
should go to Brother Bai.

73
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,920
Miss Bailing,

74
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,040
if you can help me find out

75
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,399
who harmed my father,

76
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,519
I will give you

77
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,000
double the reward.

78
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,279
Li Laosan offended Chang Xian'er.

79
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,600
Where am I supposed to find that for you?

80
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,920
I will find the real culprit.

81
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,240
As soon as there is news,

82
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,199
I will notify you.

83
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,079
Good.

84
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,959
What are you pretending for?

85
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,439
Within two days,

86
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,480
I will definitely bring Chang Xian'er before you.

87
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,600
Then you'd better do your best.

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,800
When you earn the money,

89
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,040
remember to pay me back.

90
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,519
You...

91
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm so angry!

92
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,480
I'm so angry!

93
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm so angry!

94
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm so angry!

95
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm so angry!

96
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,039
I'm so angry!

97
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,840
To think a Cheng Yaojin would appear out of nowhere.

98
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,879
Master,

99
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,080
I met a charlatan today.

100
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,120
He actually...

101
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,200
he actually knows the...

102
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,240
Bai Yan Spell.

103
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,639
And he stole my thunder.

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,360
If I meet him again,

105
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,759
I won't let him off.

106
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,759
Are you talking about me?

107
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
Why are you here?

108
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,000
You're here to steal something, aren't you?

109
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:12,519
I...

110
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,960
You dare hurt me while stealing?

111
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,200
Let me go if you have the guts!

112
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,159
Where did this brat come from,

113
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,720
daring to run wild here?

114
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,639
Master,

115
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,279
he's just a sneak thief!

116
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,000
Catch him, quick!

117
00:09:59,399 --> 00:09:59,960
Second Uncle.

118
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,279
Calling me Dad won't help!

119
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,200
Stop trying to cozy up!

120
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,519
You are...

121
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:18,639
Tian'er?

122
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,320
Yes.

123
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,000
Second Uncle.

124
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,279
Second Uncle.

125
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,799
Let me have a look.

126
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,279
You've grown up.

127
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:41,320
You've really grown.

128
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,399
All these years out there,

129
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,120
you must have suffered a lot.

130
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,120
Master.

131
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:51,720
What are you saying?

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,639
Miss Bailing,

133
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,360
there might be a misunderstanding between us.

134
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,919
Misunderstanding?

135
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
Don't try to get cozy with me.

136
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,720
My Master is old and confused,

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,240
but I'm not that easily fooled.

138
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,279
Insolence!

139
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,600
Master!

140
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,559
Back then, I asked someone

141
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,320
to send you to the provincial capital to study medicine.

142
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,559
Before we knew it,

143
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:14,919
so many years have passed.

144
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,799
Second Uncle,

145
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,399
actually, I came back this time

146
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,440
to find out the truth about my mother.

147
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,840
The day your mother disappeared,

148
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,360
it rained while the sun was shining.

149
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:34,399
I know.

150
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,080
The Serpent Deity's Wedding.

151
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,279
You must have heard about it too.

152
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:43,559
Back then,

153
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:45,679
your mother walked into the old woods

154
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,240
and was taken away by Chang Xian'er.

155
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,039
Everyone

156
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,840
was very afraid of Chang Xian'er,

157
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,320
so the matter

158
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,200
was just left unresolved.

159
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,759
But now,

160
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,840
this Chang Xian'er has appeared again.

161
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,159
It's causing quite a stir.

162
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,559
Wasn't Hongniang taken by Chang Xian'er?

163
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,639
We'll know if we investigate.

164
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,080
Yes.

165
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,559
You just got back to town,

166
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,159
and aren't familiar with many things.

167
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:16,720
I'll give you a helper.

168
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
There is strength in numbers.

169
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,919
With your old bones,

170
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,080
you'd better not push yourself.

171
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,080
But since you mentioned a helper,

172
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,320
I actually do need one.

173
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,639
You want me to be your helper?

174
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,879
Keep dreaming.

175
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,679
Let's rely on our own skills

176
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,759
and see who's better.

177
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,279
Starting today,

178
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,120
you will follow him.

179
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,399
His words are my words.

180
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,559
If you dare disobey,

181
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,279
I'll starve you for half a month.

182
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,799
Master!

183
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,559
I can be your helper.

184
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,240
However,

185
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,159
if you dare tell Master about the money,

186
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,360
I'll break you.
