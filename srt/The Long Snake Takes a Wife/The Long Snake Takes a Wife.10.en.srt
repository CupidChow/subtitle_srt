1
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,120
You...

2
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,519
Who are you?

3
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,120
Chang Xian'er claims a life.

4
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,079
The living must keep away.

5
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,799
Male of the Zhang Umbrella Shop.

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,120
Named Sheng.

7
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,799
Native of Longshan.

8
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,599
Born in 1924.

9
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,319
Is this you?

10
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,239
It is me.

11
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,760
Since it is confirmed.

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,239
Forest Spirits on the left and right.

13
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,159
Hook his soul and take him away.

14
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,680
What are you doing?

15
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,280
Where are you taking me?

16
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,519
To hook your soul.

17
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,200
To claim your life.

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,519
To serve the Immortal Wife of the Chang Family for generations.

19
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,919
Immortal Wife of the Chang Family.

20
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,319
You mean...

21
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,520
Is it Hongniang?

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,639
The Immortal Wife washes her face with tears all day.

23
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,919
Chanting your name.

24
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,919
Zhang's mother, Hu Langui.

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,719
Is already serving by her side.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,680
Awaiting you to join.

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,319
Seize him.

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,719
No.

29
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,960
I don't want to go.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,560
Don't take me away.

31
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,240
I am the one who wronged Hongniang.

32
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,560
I beg you.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,039
Don't take me away.

34
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,919
What exactly are you hiding?

35
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,719
Speak the truth and this Immortal will judge.

36
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,879
Dare to speak half a word of lie.

37
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,599
I will let you be buried in the Immortal Land forever.

38
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:51,719
Never to be freed.

39
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:55,280
The day Hongniang came to find me.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,520
Sheng'er.

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,199
It's too late.

42
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,280
Stop working.

43
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,159
What if you wear your body out?

44
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,439
I know, Mom.

45
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,680
You know, you're not young anymore.

46
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,800
When will you get a wife?

47
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,960
Give Mom a big grandson to care for.

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,360
Mom.

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,039
Aunt Li from the next town.

50
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,680
Said she wanted to propose a match for you.

51
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,400
Who is here so late?

52
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,479
I'll go look.

53
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,520
Go ahead.

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,759
Hongniang.

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
Hongniang.

56
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:53,159
Drink some tea.

57
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:57,960
Sheng'er.

58
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,039
You brat.

59
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,879
No wonder you wouldn't let me matchmake.

60
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,400
You found one yourself.

61
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,399
Whose young lady is this?

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
She looks so pretty.

63
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:20,800
Mom.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,560
Her name is Hongniang.

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,879
She is not local.

66
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,720
Her parents are gone.

67
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,279
I want to marry her.

68
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,680
Good.

69
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:33,439
Then let's pick a date.

70
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,720
Get married quickly.

71
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
Give birth to a big chubby boy.

72
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:22,959
Old Mrs. Zhang.

73
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,519
How are you so lucky?

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,360
This girl looks so fresh and beautiful.

75
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,480
How could she fall for...

76
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,720
Your family's Zhang Sheng?

77
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,199
Exactly, exactly.

78
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
How can you say that?

79
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,399
How is our Zhang Sheng...

80
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,079
Not good enough for...

81
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,079
An out-of-town girl?

82
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,680
I'm saying this for your own good.

83
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,079
This woman is too beautiful.

84
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,120
There will be a lot of trouble.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,839
Right, right, right.

86
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,240
You say she's an out-of-towner.

87
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,600
Our town doesn't have...

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,720
Such a fresh-looking girl.

89
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,600
Why does this girl look so familiar to me?

90
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,040
Isn't this Li Laosan from the southern paper-cutting shop's...

91
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,399
Woman he bought with money?

92
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:03,800
Mom

93
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,600
Have some tea

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,079
That you can stand here today

95
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,399
is entirely because our Zhang Sheng likes you

96
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,000
Before this

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,560
no matter how your parents raised you

98
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,199
or if they raised you at all

99
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,600
today

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,160
since in front of so many people

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,279
you have entered our Zhang family

102
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,480
you must follow our Zhang family rules

103
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:23,920
Mom

104
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,079
I understand

105
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:26,439
Mom

106
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,160
Hey, don't

107
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Don't call me Mom just yet

108
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,600
After you bear a grandson for our Zhang family

109
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
it won't be too late to call me that

110
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,560
Hongniang

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry you had to endure that

112
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,199
My mom has a sharp tongue but a soft heart

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,399
It wasn't easy for her to raise me

114
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,879
She's also very strong-willed

115
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:54,319
and doesn't want anyone to say a bad word about us

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't take it to heart

117
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,720
Since I chose to marry you

118
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,040
I don't care about these things

119
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,639
I will definitely treat our mom with respect

120
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,519
As long as you treat me with sincerity

121
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,639
I don't care about anything else

122
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,160
Hongniang

123
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,120
I swear

124
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,639
I will treat you well

125
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,879
and won't let you suffer any grievances

126
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,120
Being able to marry you

127
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,959
is a blessing I earned in a past life

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's so good to have you

129
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,000
You fool

130
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,279
You married such an

131
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,279
unclean woman

132
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,240
and brought her into the Zhang family

133
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,279
Do you think it's not shameful enough?

134
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,199
Get out

135
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,079
Get the hell out

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,079
Mom

137
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,839
Hongniang has already married me

138
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,120
She is my wife

139
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,160
Her past has nothing to do with me

140
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
I want to be with her now

141
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,519
No one can separate us

142
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,680
How can I show my face in public?

143
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
You unfilial jerk

144
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:22,959
Mom

145
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,439
Please don't be angry

146
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,360
I will treat you with filial respect

147
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,920
Please rest assured

148
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,560
Mom

149
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,519
If you can't accept Hongniang

150
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,240
I'll take her away tomorrow

151
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,080
Then you won't just lose face

152
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,240
you'll lose your son too

153
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,320
You

154
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,639
Mom

155
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,639
What's wrong?

156
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,519
Mom

157
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,320
Mom, don't be angry

158
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,679
Mom

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,559
Mom

160
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,879
Let me help you hang these

161
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,240
No need

162
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,679
I'm afraid you'll dirty my clothes

163
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,879
Sheng'er

164
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,919
Eat more

165
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,879
These are all your favorites

166
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:15,919
Here

167
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Thanks, Mom

168
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:23,840
Hongniang

169
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,399
You eat too

170
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:27,759
Hongniang

171
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,159
Go get me a bowl of porridge

172
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,799
Okay

173
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
You just eat

174
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,240
We saved some for her

175
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:39,279
Enough, Mom

176
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,000
Mom

177
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,480
Yes

178
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,799
I'm done eating

179
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:48,279
Leave it for Hongniang

180
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,720
I'm going back

181
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,279
Mom

182
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,399
There's no food left

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,159
If there's no food, then don't eat

184
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:13,799
Missing one meal won't kill you

185
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:15,720
Clear the table

186
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,799
We can't wait any longer

187
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,120
Someone's going to die

188
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
What is there that can't wait

189
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,080
When I gave birth to our Sheng'er

190
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,679
I picked an auspicious time

191
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,279
Look

192
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,519
how successful he is now

193
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,720
Mom

194
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,320
Hongniang is screaming so loud

195
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,639
She's in unbearable pain

196
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:47,639
Don't wait any longer

197
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,360
What do you know

198
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,440
I've given birth, I've been through it

199
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,960
If you ask me, she's just being delicate

200
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,360
We must wait another four hours

201
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:59,399
Lives are at stake

202
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,679
Mom

203
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,240
Hongniang is in so much pain

204
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,399
We can't wait any longer

205
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,080
I have to go in

206
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,960
You can't go in

207
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,440
No man watches a woman give birth

208
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,759
It's bad luck

209
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,720
Women giving birth are all like this

210
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,200
Push

211
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:22,720
I can see the head

212
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,799
Mom

213
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,279
Hongniang gave birth

214
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,519
Congratulations, it's a girl

215
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:32,600
Auntie Zhang

216
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,159
you're truly blessed this time

217
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,000
A money pit that missed the auspicious time

218
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,080
What blessing is that

219
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:39,559
Mom

220
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Look how pretty she is

221
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:43,799
Doesn't she look like me when I was little

222
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,440
I don't think she looks like you at all

223
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,080
Then she must look like Hongniang

224
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,559
Hongniang

225
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,639
Come, Hongniang

226
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,080
Let me show you

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,360
Does she look like you

228
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:03,919
You've worked hard
