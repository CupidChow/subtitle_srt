Yes.

Then you shouldn't persuade me.

20
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,092
Do you think I'm the one who wants you

21
00:03:07,212 --> 00:03:08,812
to break up so that
I can take advantage of it?

That's not what I meant.

What are you doing here?

64
00:06:45,652 --> 00:06:46,452
I have been calling you.

65

My throat is hoarse.

What are you doing here?

67
00:06:49,412 --> 00:06:50,132
I didn't hear you.

68
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,252

69
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:53,092

72
00:06:56,612 --> 00:06:57,812
Did you come to work these days?

73
00:06:58,772 --> 00:07:00,172
You either sleep here or just space out.

74
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:02,432
You leave before 7 p.m. every day.
What are you up to?

75
00:07:02,532 --> 00:07:03,292
I have things to do.

76

What's going on?

77
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:05,852
Which girl has deceived you?

78
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,372
Cheated out of money or heartbroken?

79
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:09,772
Are you serious?

80
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:11,972
Why would you wish that for me?

81
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,172
Do I look like a fool
that everyone can deceive?

82
00:07:14,332 --> 00:07:15,372
You are a fool.

83
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:16,772
You've been deceived several times.

84
00:07:17,172 --> 00:07:18,412
I had no control over you before.

85
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:19,932
You don't have any control over me now.

- I have a duty to manage your money.
- On what grounds?

88
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:27,772
On what grounds?

89
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:29,972
Why should you manage my money?

90
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:32,576
You can provide for me,
and I'll give all my money to you.

91
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:34,172
Fine, I'll provide for you.

92
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:35,292
Give it all to me.

93
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:36,532
I'll pay you monthly,

94

out of money.

100
00:07:48,704 --> 00:07:50,560
- If you like me, just say so.
- Get over yourself.

101
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:51,932
I could consider it.

102
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:53,412
But let me be clear first.

103
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,092
I'm not seeking marriage now.

104
00:07:58,412 --> 00:07:59,092

106
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:02,652

make a cup of coffee?

112
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,092
I have something to deal with.

113
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:51,852
You're so tolerant.

114
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:54,496
You've been at the company for so long,
and the product has been launched,

115
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:55,972
and you're still making him
lattes every day.

116
00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:58,892
That's what an assistant does.

117
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:00,852
Why are you still an assistant?

118
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:02,612
Being an assistant is pretty good.

119
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,372
Less pressure.

120
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:04,652
Help me out.

121
00:10:04,932 --> 00:10:06,212
Extra sugar and milk, you know.

122
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:16,412
Off work now.

123
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:18,092
What shall we eat?

124
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:22,492
But, no noodles or dumplings.
Let's try other dishes.

125
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:23,652
You know it.

126
00:10:24,172 --> 00:10:26,492
I have something to tell you
about He Xindi.

127
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,332
I think she's been
acting very unusual lately.

128
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:31,200
She seems overly concerned for me.

129
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,412
You know she's been
pursuing the senior, right?

130
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,816
But the senior ignored her.

131
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,732
Recently, she suddenly started
to take an interest in me.

132
00:10:38,532 --> 00:10:39,412
She told me today

133
00:10:39,732 --> 00:10:41,172
she wants to manage my money.

134
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:42,812
I said then you might as well
provide for me.

135
00:10:43,492 --> 00:10:43,932
Let's go.

136
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:48,972
My right hand is failing.

137
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:55,612
I said

138
00:10:58,812 --> 00:11:00,292
I can't move my right hand.

139
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:05,984
What do you mean?

140
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:13,612
It's deteriorating.

141
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:38,372
Que, I'll leave now.

142
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:39,252
Bao.

143
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:43,452
Sorry, do you have plans tonight?

144
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,352
No, nothing.

145
00:11:48,812 --> 00:11:49,412
Perfect.

146
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,852
Anyone who looks at it
would think it's an arm issue.

147
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,292
It won't raise any suspicions.

148
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,172
Trust me. I have experience.

149
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,212
One year in Junior High,

150
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:58,812
I dodged my holiday homework
with this trick.

151
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:01,772
This counts as making good use of waste.

152
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:02,972
You're using it again.

153
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:04,052
Nice.

154
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:09,732
An arm injury

155
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,572
would take at least
three months to heal.

156
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,692
It would work for at least three months.

157
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:15,212
It takes 100 days to heal.

158
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:16,292
Three months are reasonable.

159
00:12:17,952 --> 00:12:19,332
What if after three months?

160
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:24,772
What if my left hand also fails?

161
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:27,772
We'll put a brace on the left hand too.

162
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,652
Don't worry. I always have a way.

163
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,172
That's good.

164
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,452
You really can't tell.

165
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:42,892
I'll wear it when I go out.

166
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:49,972
I'm thinking

167
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:54,012
maybe you shouldn't work anymore.

168
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:55,812
I have savings, too.

169
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:58,172
And I also asked for some money
from my mom a few days ago.

170
00:12:59,052 --> 00:13:00,372
My funds aren't profitable.

171
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:01,172
I want to sell them.

172
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:03,212
Then I'll have tens of thousands yuan.

173
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,172
It's enough.

174
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:08,572
If I don't go to work,

175
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:10,412
I'll have no social security

176
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:11,652
and health insurance.

177
00:13:12,928 --> 00:13:14,412
For medical care and medication,

178
00:13:14,812 --> 00:13:16,292
there will be a lot of expenses.

179
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,452
The money you have

180
00:13:19,252 --> 00:13:19,812
won't be enough.

181
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:21,652
I will earn more.

182
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:25,892
He Xindi and I can make money
through our live stream.

183
00:13:26,532 --> 00:13:28,812
If you don't work, we can pay
the social security ourselves.

184
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:31,892
And think about it.
Your right hand is bandaged now.

185
00:13:32,172 --> 00:13:34,212
You can't draw designs
with your left hand.

186
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,092
It's not realistic to work like this.

187
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,332
Right?

188
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,612
I still don't understand.

189
00:13:42,412 --> 00:13:44,052
We haven't done anything wrong.

190
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:45,572
Why the secrecy?

191
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,452
They must not know.

192
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:55,972
You hid it

193
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:57,412
from Que.

194
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,812
But what about your parents?

195
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:03,372
It's not necessary.

196
00:14:04,532 --> 00:14:06,532
We can all think of a solution together.

197
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:08,412
There's always a way.

198
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:09,492
More minds

199
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:12,252
would be better than just the two of us
worrying about these things.

200
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:15,692
This illness

201
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:17,492
is not a cold or a fever.

202
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:20,612
It's not something you can hide

203
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:22,212
and recover from in a few days.

204
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,052
Do you really…

205
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:28,492
Do you really want to wait

206
00:14:31,332 --> 00:14:33,132
until you can't move at all

207
00:14:33,972 --> 00:14:35,092
before you tell them?

208
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:38,932
Have you thought about

209
00:14:40,052 --> 00:14:41,572
how they'd cope

210
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,612
without being prepared?

211
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:50,212
Ever since that day,

212
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,492
I've been worried.

213
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,492
I can't even sleep.

214
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,372
I'm just afraid that one day,

215
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:03,572
if you fall down and can't get up,

216
00:15:04,852 --> 00:15:05,932
and I'm not there,

217
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:07,452
what should we do?

218
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:13,972
Lin Tuo.

219
00:15:17,212 --> 00:15:18,732
Stop suffering alone.

220
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:28,692
Hungry?

221
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:30,692
Let's have hot pot.

222
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:31,892
Let's go.

223
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:35,692
You won't listen.

224
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:37,292
Let's go.

225
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:39,012
What did you say? Say it again.

226
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:39,612
Lower your voice.

227
00:15:40,052 --> 00:15:41,372
The neighbors are asleep.

228
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:42,932
Your father is asleep too.

229
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:43,872
Quiet.

230
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:45,292
What are you talking about?

231
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,132
Lower your voice.

232
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:48,332
Your father is asleep too.

233
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:49,892
Come on.

234
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:52,892
I understand that you wanted a drink,

235
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,336
but why did you drag Bao along?

236
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:56,292
You scared that kid.

237
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:58,692
You kept saying you were fine,

238
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:01,012
but you got drunk and threw up.

239
00:16:01,652 --> 00:16:02,972
Fill it up for me.

240
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:04,132
That's enough.

241
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,172
Fill it up.

242
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,292
What are you yelling about?

243
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:08,892
Did we wake you?

244
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,812
Dad, fill it up for my dad.

245
00:16:10,812 --> 00:16:11,532
Godfather.

246
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:12,412
Is she drunk?

247
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,652
What? How did she get so drunk?

248
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,092
Right, a company dinner.

249
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,212
She drank too much.

250
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:18,572
Didn't you drink?

251
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,732
I did.

252
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
I can hold my liquor
better than she can.

253
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,852
She shouldn't be drunk like this.

254
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,252
Look, her face is swollen from drinking.

255
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:26,572
Be careful.

256
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,372
Just hold her.

257
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:30,372
Dad, let me tell you.

258
00:16:30,932 --> 00:16:32,452
I'm an adult.

259
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:34,532
I can survive without anyone.

260
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:35,892
He's just Lin Tuo.

261
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:38,688
Can't I live without him?

262
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:40,132
Can't I go on living?

263
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:42,372
She's drunk.

264
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:43,492
Really drunk.

265
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:00,492
Lin Tuo.

266
00:17:01,932 --> 00:17:03,168
What happened to your hand?

267
00:17:04,131 --> 00:17:05,344
I fell down when playing soccer.

268
00:17:05,852 --> 00:17:06,332
A fracture.

269
00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:07,532
A fracture?

270
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:11,332
Right hand? How are you going to work?

271
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,212
It's fine.

272
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:15,572
Okay, tell me if you need anything.

273
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:22,732
What's wrong with your arm?

274
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:25,184
I fell when playing soccer.

275
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:29,612
How come you hurt your arm?
Don't people usually hurt their legs?

276
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:31,052
Lin Tuo.

277
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:32,972
Leader.

278
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:35,492
Come out with me.

279
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:44,972
The Leader is so cruel.

280
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,172
He still has Lin Tuo work
with his hand like this.

281
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:50,932
What's going on?

282
00:17:52,092 --> 00:17:53,092
My right hand is failing.

283
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:54,252
This is a camouflage.

284
00:17:55,652 --> 00:17:56,692
You're quite resourceful.

285
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:58,372
Are we going to a meeting?

286
00:17:58,612 --> 00:17:59,492
There's no meeting.

287
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:00,932
Is work that important?

288
00:18:01,172 --> 00:18:02,432
I want you to see someone.

289
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:08,412
Just come clean.

290
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,252
About what?

291
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:12,612
About what?

292
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:14,412
Your break-up.

293
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:15,932
As your father, I don't even know.

294
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:17,932
Do I deserve to be kept in the dark?

295
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:19,172
Do I deserve to know nothing?

296
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,492
Don't you already know everything?

297
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,852
But you didn't tell me.

298
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:27,012
She did tell you.

299
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:28,892
When did she… When did she say it?

300
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,972
Last night, when she was drunk.

301
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,732
Even if you did

302
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:36,852
tell me when you were drunk

303
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,492
last night, still…

304
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,532
He Xindi.

305
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:41,532
She lied to me.

306
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:43,452
Why did you conspire
with her to deceive me?

307
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:45,092
Aren't we on the same side?

308
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,812
No, I didn't mean to.

309
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:51,092
But she wouldn't let me tell you.
I figured I couldn't be a traitor.

310
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,932
Right now, in my heart, you are one.

311
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:56,012
You can't do this to me.

312
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:58,372
It's Lin Tuo who broke up with her,

313
00:18:58,372 --> 00:18:59,332
but I'm to blame for that.

314
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:00,532
What did I do?

315
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:03,972
Wait, what?

316
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:05,852
Did Lin Tuo break up with her?

317
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:08,252
No, I did.

318
00:19:09,092 --> 00:19:09,732
Why?

319
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:12,052
I didn't want to be together.

320
00:19:15,092 --> 00:19:16,572
An Zhique.

321
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,092
What are you playing at?

322
00:19:20,612 --> 00:19:21,572
You have been fine.

323
00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:23,092
How can you break up just like that?

324
00:19:23,332 --> 00:19:26,012
You're not children playing house.
You can't call things off like that.

325
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:27,012
Most importantly,

326
00:19:27,052 --> 00:19:29,052
you've both met each other's parents.

327
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,972
If you break up, what should I…

328
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:32,852
What should we do, right?

329
00:19:33,932 --> 00:19:36,212
Does meeting the parents
mean we can't break up?

330
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:39,652
An Zhique, you still think you're right.

331
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:40,932
Let me tell you, this…

332
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:42,452
It's clearly your fault.

333
00:19:43,252 --> 00:19:44,572
I know Tuo well.

334
00:19:44,972 --> 00:19:46,292
He's such a good child.

335
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,132
I won't even mention
how he usually treats us.

336
00:19:48,132 --> 00:19:50,812
He even paid for my surgery.

337
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:53,052
He took on a huge
responsibility at a young age.

338
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:54,812
This isn't about the money.
What does it show?

339
00:19:55,012 --> 00:19:57,412
It shows that he is
responsible and accountable.

340
00:19:57,932 --> 00:19:58,452
Isn't that so?

341
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:01,332
You can't find such a person easily.
So why would you break up with him?

342
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,572
You're making the wrong choice.

343
00:20:05,492 --> 00:20:06,372
Are you saying

344
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:09,452
that we can't break up
just because he paid for your surgery?

345
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:12,372
Does that mean I have to marry him?

346
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:14,972
What's wrong with that?

347
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,332
In the past, girls sold themselves
to bury their fathers.

348
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,532
I didn't even ask you to bury me.

349
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,532
Why can't you make it work with him?

350
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,132
He Xindi, stand up.

351
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,132
Tell me the truth. Why is she
behaving so outrageously?

352
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:31,692
I don't know.

353
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,052
I really don't know.

354
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:34,372
This has nothing to do with me at all.

355
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,012
I still don't know what's going on.

356
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:37,612
I swear.

357
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:38,572
If I lie to you,

358
00:20:38,572 --> 00:20:40,172
I'll never make money
through my lives stream.

359
00:20:42,212 --> 00:20:43,892
Fine, An Zhique, you say it.

360
00:20:55,852 --> 00:20:56,732
What is there to say?

361
00:20:57,732 --> 00:20:58,812
There's nothing to say.

362
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:01,492
I'm telling you both.

363
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:03,612
Neither of you should go to Lin Tuo.

364
00:21:04,412 --> 00:21:06,412
If you do, I will turn against you.

365
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:09,172
Que.

366
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,532
Let her go.

367
00:21:10,532 --> 00:21:12,172
You're turning against me, aren't you?

368
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,932
You're heartless for saying that.

369
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,212
An Zhique, if you're capable,

370
00:21:15,212 --> 00:21:17,372
spend the rest of your life
in your room and don't come out.

371
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:18,412
Don't get married.

372
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,052
I'm so angry. So angry.

373
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,612
She's doing this on purpose.

374
00:21:27,692 --> 00:21:30,372
These are the people who use
knowledge to change the world.

375
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,172
Every time they develop a new drug,

376
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,212
they save thousands
or even millions of lives.

377
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:36,812
Compared to them,

378
00:21:37,892 --> 00:21:39,732
our professions seem
somewhat insignificant.

379
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:43,132
That's what my father thought.

380
00:21:44,452 --> 00:21:46,412
So he believes that if I'm not a doctor,

381
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:48,012
I'm not in a proper career.

382
00:21:48,572 --> 00:21:49,696
That's not necessarily the case.

383
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,772
Every job has its value.

384
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,292
However, the value of some jobs

385
00:21:54,292 --> 00:21:55,772
indeed cannot be measured in money.

386
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,732
I've never been to college.

387
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:01,052
So I have great admiration
for highly educated people.

388
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,132
Haiyang.

389
00:22:06,912 --> 00:22:07,412
Dr. Wu.

390
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:08,292
Sorry for the wait.

391
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,492
The meeting took longer than I thought.

392
00:22:10,532 --> 00:22:12,096
No, sorry to interrupt.

393
00:22:12,492 --> 00:22:14,892
- Lin Tuo, this is Dr. Wu Xinrui.
- Dr. Wu, this is Lin Tuo.

394
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,492
- Hello, Dr. Wu.
- Lin.

395
00:22:17,452 --> 00:22:18,972
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

396
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:20,092
Have a seat.

397
00:22:20,092 --> 00:22:20,612
Okay.

398
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:21,440
Sit.

399
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:24,972
You're so young.

400
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,692
23 years old.

401
00:22:29,452 --> 00:22:30,732
Have you been diagnosed

402
00:22:31,492 --> 00:22:32,372
with ALS?

403
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,012
Yes, I have.

404
00:22:35,612 --> 00:22:37,692
The doctor has explained
some of the situation.

405
00:22:37,852 --> 00:22:39,572
But I personally really want to know,

406
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:42,292
from the perspective
of your pharmaceutical research,

407
00:22:43,052 --> 00:22:44,372
are there any drugs against ALS?

408
00:22:48,532 --> 00:22:49,332
ALS is

409
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:52,852
indeed a project our lab
has been working on.

410
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:54,772
But unfortunately,

411
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,372
up to now,

412
00:22:58,012 --> 00:22:58,852
there is no cure.

413
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:04,812
Actually, the doctor has also told me
there is no cure.

414
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,292
But you do have a research topic.

415
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:12,492
Well…

416
00:23:13,092 --> 00:23:14,132
The development of drugs

417
00:23:14,532 --> 00:23:17,132
is a very complex and lengthy process.

418
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,732
It requires a significant amount of
human and financial resources.

419
00:23:20,172 --> 00:23:21,852
We do have a project on it.

420
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:22,892
However,

421
00:23:24,292 --> 00:23:25,376
the difficulties are tremendous.

422
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:27,412
You need a lot of money.

423
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:28,932
Money is just a part.

424
00:23:29,212 --> 00:23:29,732
Of course,

425
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:31,852
with an investment,

426
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,532
the project can be advanced.

427
00:23:34,092 --> 00:23:36,412
But it might take ten years,

428
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:37,292
decades,

429
00:23:37,852 --> 00:23:40,452
or even the effort
of several generations to complete.

430
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:46,612
You heard him just now.

431
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,772
There is a project on ALS.

432
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:51,172
Dr. Wu's pharmaceutical company
is researching it.

433
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,052
It's the same with many
incurable diseases.

434
00:23:53,052 --> 00:23:55,492
Targeted drugs and specific cures
have been developed bit by bit.

435
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:58,372
In the past, dysentery
was an incurable disease.

436
00:23:58,612 --> 00:24:00,092
Whooping cough could be fatal.

437
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,852
Smallpox and chickenpox were
considered incurable,

438
00:24:02,052 --> 00:24:03,252
not to mention cancer later on.

439
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:05,252
Haven't they all
been overcome one by one?

440
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,532
It's a matter of time.

441
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:09,760
Get in the car.

442
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:29,212
Do you know how much time
I have with my illness?

443
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:34,692
Three to five years.

444
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:38,332
For me, time

445
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:41,932
has a limit now.

446
00:24:44,412 --> 00:24:45,692
So what?

447
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:48,092
It's not tomorrow.

448
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:50,852
Three to five years is not a short time.

449
00:24:50,852 --> 00:24:52,012
Have some faith in yourself.

450
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:55,052
I am looking for experts and doctors

451
00:24:55,492 --> 00:24:56,172
in this field now.

452
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,852
Let's understand more
about the situation,

453
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,612
so we can have more options.

454
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:02,972
Didn't we learn a lot today?

455
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,252
Leader, thank you.

456
00:25:13,332 --> 00:25:14,452
There's nothing to thank me for.

457
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:20,172
Tuo,

458
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:24,692
whose life has no limit?

459
00:25:26,252 --> 00:25:28,372
In the end, don't we all
have to leave this world?

460
00:25:31,772 --> 00:25:32,732
We can only move forward.

461
00:25:37,852 --> 00:25:38,532
Moving forward.

462
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:44,320
Let's get a bite
before returning to work.

463
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:46,332
Think about what to eat now.

464
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:48,612
Okay.

465
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:57,692
Ye.

466
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,132
No matter what,

467
00:25:59,132 --> 00:26:01,012
you should still let your father know.

468
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:04,212
I don't want to go back.

469
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:10,972
So you're planning to go
straight to university

470
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:12,252
without even saying goodbye?

471
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:13,692
Eat.

472
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,452
Let's talk after eating.

473
00:26:16,412 --> 00:26:17,052
Dad.

474
00:26:17,652 --> 00:26:19,052
You always indulge him.

475
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:20,092
I indulge him?

476
00:26:20,092 --> 00:26:20,972
Of course, you do.

477
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:23,132
He's always running over here on a whim.

478
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:23,892
Why would you do that?

479
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:25,692
Going to university
without saying goodbye?

480
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,052
The child doesn't come home.

481
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,652
Don't you know what the problem is?

482
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:30,532
Both children don't come home.

483
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,732
Aren't you and Lin Shouzheng at fault?

484
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:37,092
I wasn't blaming you.

485
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:39,212
Tuo has been

486
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:40,852
in Chongqing for such a long time.

487
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:41,732
Have you ever visited?

488
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:44,292
Ye has been

489
00:26:44,692 --> 00:26:46,212
with me for a semester.

490
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,852
Has Lin Shouzheng come by even once?

491
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:51,932
Why is it always the kids
who are wilful?

492
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:53,252
If you ask me,

493
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:54,852
Lin Shouzheng is the most wilful one.

494
00:26:55,692 --> 00:26:57,012
Just tell him that.

495
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,132
Ye is not leaving.

496
00:26:58,772 --> 00:26:59,892
He'll stay with me.

497
00:27:00,292 --> 00:27:01,852
Tomorrow, I will take him to university.

498
00:27:02,812 --> 00:27:03,732
I'll pay the tuition fees.

499
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:06,132
After all, what he's studying
isn't something you like.

500
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:09,492
This university
has nothing to do with you.

501
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,052
Come, go play gateball with me.

502
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:15,652
Dad, finish your meal first before…

503
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:16,932
I'm full.

504
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:18,332
Take your time.

505
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:20,172
Seriously.

506
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:24,812
He's spoiled Ye.

507
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:27,572
Grandpa.

508
00:27:27,972 --> 00:27:29,452
Where will we play gateball this late?

509
00:27:30,132 --> 00:27:31,212
There's no gateball.

510
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:33,920
I didn't want to stay inside
and argue with your mom.

511
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:35,892
She's fifty years old.

512
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:37,772
I feel bad if she gets upset.

513
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:40,452
Are you really going
to take me to university?

514
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:41,412
Of course.

515
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:43,452
I might also check on your brother.

516
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,892
Lately, I've been feeling uneasy.

517
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,732
I keep feeling
like something has happened.

518
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:50,172
Did he have a fight with Que?

519
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:52,732
Impossible. They never fight.

520
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:55,132
That's good.

521
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,092
We're going to visit him.

522
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:59,132
Okay, let's go.

523
00:27:59,372 --> 00:28:00,532
Let's each have an ice cream.

524
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:01,572
Take a carefree stroll.

525
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:08,852
Don't delete his WeChat account.

526
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:11,212
It'd be so awkward if they made up.

527
00:28:12,332 --> 00:28:14,132
Can they really reconcile
under these circumstances?

528
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:15,372
How long has it been?

529
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,452
Just think about it.

530
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:18,172
If Que really wanted to break up,

531
00:28:18,332 --> 00:28:19,212
why would she get drunk?

532
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:21,664
Let's wait and see.

533
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:23,812
No need to wait.

534
00:28:24,852 --> 00:28:25,452
Just delete it.

535
00:28:26,332 --> 00:28:27,732
Let's get over it.

536
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:28,992
We're not getting back together.

537
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:34,332
Go to work.

538
00:28:57,212 --> 00:28:57,772
Guangpu.

539
00:28:59,012 --> 00:28:59,892
My grandpa is here.

540
00:29:02,452 --> 00:29:03,972
So suddenly? When did he arrive?

541
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,492
Is it okay?

542
00:29:14,492 --> 00:29:15,052
Yes.

543
00:29:15,452 --> 00:29:17,772
I got a fracture when playing soccer,
Don't get it wrong, got it?

544
00:29:18,052 --> 00:29:18,852
I got it.

545
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:20,012
The main problem is

546
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:21,772
what if your grandpa asked about Que?

547
00:29:23,212 --> 00:29:24,132
We'll handle it later.

548
00:29:34,528 --> 00:29:35,296
Ye.

549
00:29:45,652 --> 00:29:46,972
What happened to your arm?

550
00:29:50,652 --> 00:29:51,612
I fell while playing soccer.

551
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:53,372
You fell while playing soccer?

552
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:57,412
Que never mentioned it to me.

553
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,572
I didn't want you to worry.

554
00:30:02,492 --> 00:30:03,492
Right, Grandpa.

555
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:06,132
It's normal to fall when playing soccer.

556
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:09,092
Thank you for cooking
so many dishes after a long ride.

557
00:30:09,092 --> 00:30:10,372
Wouldn't it be better to eat out?

558
00:30:10,372 --> 00:30:11,892
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes.

559
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:13,332
Take a seat to rest.

560
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,168
You make us feel worried.

561
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,252
How could you hurt yourself like this?

562
00:30:26,656 --> 00:30:27,292
Grandpa.

563
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:30,212
You should tell us before you came.

564
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:31,372
What else is there to say?

565
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:33,772
I knew you were busy,
so I didn't disturb you.

566
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,212
Que just brought the two of us over.

567
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:40,092
You could have just called,
and I would have come to pick you up.

568
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:41,692
No need.

569
00:30:41,692 --> 00:30:43,892
Do you think I'm so old
that I can't walk anymore?

570
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,812
Does it hurt?

571
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,184
It's alright.

572
00:30:49,184 --> 00:30:50,092
Let's dig in, Grandpa.

573
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,332
Let's dig in.

574
00:30:52,292 --> 00:30:53,532
Wait a moment.

575
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:55,972
We have another guest arriving soon.

576
00:30:58,528 --> 00:30:59,212
Coming.

577
00:30:59,212 --> 00:30:59,972
I'll go get it.

578
00:31:03,772 --> 00:31:04,372
Uncle.

579
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,112
- Chen is here too?
- Hello, Uncle.

580
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:07,252
An, you've come.

581
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:08,172
Uncle, I'm here, Uncle.

582
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:10,372
This isn't much.

583
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,132
You didn't have to.

584
00:31:11,132 --> 00:31:12,092
Of course, I should.

585
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:13,492
- We are waiting for you.
- Thank you.

586
00:31:14,132 --> 00:31:15,572
Come on. Sit down.

587
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,144
- Have a seat, and let's eat.
- Okay.

588
00:31:19,972 --> 00:31:21,344
I'm not sure if it suits your taste.

589
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,172
I like it.

590
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,492
What happened to your hand?

591
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,332
He hurt himself

592
00:31:26,332 --> 00:31:27,212
when playing soccer.

593
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:29,052
Yes, Uncle.

594
00:31:29,984 --> 00:31:31,332
That's quite normal.

595
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:32,932
Now you can even
chip a tooth while swimming.

596
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:37,012
He's so careless. Come on.

597
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:38,612
Come on, try the dish
and see if you like it.

598
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,532
Come on. Let's eat.

599
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:41,772
Yeah.

600
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,852
How come you're here?

601
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,092
When did you fall?

602
00:32:08,288 --> 00:32:09,092
A couple of days ago.

603
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,372
You seem to be in good spirits.

604
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:13,492
You went to play soccer.

605
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:16,372
So, that's why I fell.

606
00:32:21,376 --> 00:32:23,212
I didn't want Grandpa to feel upset.

607
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:24,412
So I came.

608
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:29,452
Why is Uncle here too?

609
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,412
Well, Grandpa said he
wanted to see my dad.

610
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:34,572
I couldn't just say no.

611
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:39,292
Well,

612
00:32:41,696 --> 00:32:42,612
does your dad know it?

613
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:43,612
He does.

614
00:32:47,892 --> 00:32:48,732
Well…

615
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,652
Why did he show up anyway?

616
00:32:51,328 --> 00:32:53,212
My dad is a man who insists,

617
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,852
unlike you.

618
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:03,132
What are you two chatting about,
right next to the trash can?

619
00:33:03,572 --> 00:33:04,732
Where are you going?

620
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,132
Going downstairs to buy some stuff.

621
00:33:07,296 --> 00:33:09,012
Is your cafe close to here?

622
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:11,372
Not far. I'll take you there
for fun tomorrow.

623
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,492
Okay, it's settled then.

624
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:14,332
You have to work when you go.

625
00:33:15,332 --> 00:33:16,172
Then I won't go.

626
00:33:16,172 --> 00:33:17,052
How dare you?

627
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:26,452
I've saved this tea set and tea leaves

628
00:33:26,812 --> 00:33:27,892
specially for you.

629
00:33:28,892 --> 00:33:30,332
I heard from Que that you love tea.

630
00:33:30,772 --> 00:33:31,652
I remember that.

631
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:33,692
You're considerate.

632
00:33:34,532 --> 00:33:36,412
Have a try.

633
00:33:38,972 --> 00:33:40,452
This tea smells so good.

634
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:43,212
Come on.

635
00:33:48,372 --> 00:33:48,892
That's great.

636
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:54,572
Tuo is lucky to meet Que.

637
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:55,892
And you too.

638
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,772
You're a great father.

639
00:33:58,172 --> 00:33:59,612
It's his double blessing.

640
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:03,492
Right now,

641
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,852
I'm just anxious for them
to get married soon

642
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,652
so that I can have a great-grandson.

643
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:14,592
Yeah.

644
00:34:15,332 --> 00:34:16,731
I'm also looking forward to it.

645
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:17,412
Isn't that so?

646
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:19,332
Come on. Have some tea.

647
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,412
Uncle, please, you don't need
to escort me out.

648
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:26,691
Stay here for a few more days.

649
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,211
I'll take you out for some fun.

650
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:29,291
We can have tea.

651
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:30,412
Take good care of yourself.

652
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:31,251
All right.

653
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:32,052
I'll be waiting for you.

654
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:32,932
Yeah. Of course.

655
00:34:32,932 --> 00:34:35,332
Grandpa, come and visit
our cafe with Ye later.

656
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:36,480
Alright, I will.

657
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,892
I want to visit it.

658
00:34:37,892 --> 00:34:38,771
Okay, see you then.

659
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:39,652
See you, Grandpa.

660
00:34:39,852 --> 00:34:40,452
Goodbye, Grandpa.

661
00:34:40,612 --> 00:34:41,572
Take care.

662
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:42,291
Goodbye, Uncle.

663
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:43,452
Okay, bye.

664
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:47,012
Dad.

665
00:34:47,612 --> 00:34:48,332
You're going too far.

666
00:34:48,332 --> 00:34:49,056
Thank you.

667
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:50,932
I forgot to give them the sausage.

668
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:51,572
I'll do it.

669
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,812
Seriously.

670
00:34:52,812 --> 00:34:54,172
I'm telling you, you should…

671
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:56,372
What's going on?

672
00:34:57,248 --> 00:35:00,252
She insists on drinking milk tea.
Why would you want that?

673
00:35:00,252 --> 00:35:03,132
- You'll get fat. You can't drink that.
- Yes, you will. You shouldn't.

674
00:35:03,132 --> 00:35:04,932
- Sausages I filled.
- Thank you.

675
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:06,812
Steam before slicing,
and it goes well with alcohol.

676
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:08,292
Thank you. I love sausages the most.

677
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:09,172
That's good to know.

678
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:09,932
- Thank you.
- Great.

679
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:10,732
Alright.

680
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:11,772
See you then.

681
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:13,932
- Goodbye, Grandpa.
- Okay.

682
00:35:15,652 --> 00:35:16,732
Press that button.

683
00:35:21,852 --> 00:35:22,932
You're the best.

684
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:50,692
Take this card.

685
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:52,172
Spend it wisely.

686
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,368
No need.

687
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:55,776
Mom gave the tuition fees to Grandpa.

688
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,132
And he also gave me living expenses.

689
00:35:58,372 --> 00:36:00,852
I saved this money for you anyway.

690
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:04,852
Take it.

691
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,692
Keep it for yourself,
and take care of yourself.

692
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:14,612
When does school start?

693
00:36:15,452 --> 00:36:16,852
The registration is in three days.

694
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,052
Three days?

695
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:22,492
Alright.

696
00:36:24,972 --> 00:36:26,012
Have you told Dad?

697
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:29,212
No.

698
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,132
He's been ignoring you?

699
00:36:39,892 --> 00:36:40,892
He remains the same

700
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:42,692
all the time.

701
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:47,892
Alright, go to sleep.

702
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,972
I'm going to sleep too.
I have to work tomorrow.

716

This is our Cafe.

717
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,092
(HW Cafe)

718
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:49,772
Please come in.

719
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:51,452
Be careful.

720
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,772
It's quite spacious inside.

721
00:38:53,772 --> 00:38:56,212
Yes, we have two small
private rooms in there.

722
00:38:58,132 --> 00:38:58,732
Private rooms?

723
00:38:58,732 --> 00:39:00,692
Right, I will show you in a moment.

724
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,772
Did you make all of these?

725
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:05,172
Yes, we made them ourselves.

726
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:06,252
Great.

727
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:07,372
They look delicious.

728
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:08,892
I'll get you a piece in a while.

729
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:10,572
Look inside there,

730
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:12,092
we even have a small gallery.

731
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:14,532
I got the inspiration
after my last visit

732
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:15,452
to your little garden.

733
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:17,932
These flowers and plants are lovely.

734
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:20,652
Young people are indeed creative.

735
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,372
Very pretty.

736
00:39:25,652 --> 00:39:27,332
These are items from the small workshop.

737
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:29,052
Without you,

738
00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:30,252
none of this would exist.

739
00:39:30,252 --> 00:39:31,292
It's all thanks to you.

740
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:32,452
All thanks to me?

741
00:39:32,812 --> 00:39:34,332
Come on, Grandpa, sit down.

742
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:36,012
Sure.

743
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:41,092
These tables and chairs

744
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:42,532
were all made by Tuo.

745
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:43,852
Were they?

746
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,932
Alright.

747
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:47,212
It's worth the time he spent
in my workshop.

748
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,212
We couldn't afford to ask you
to make our tables and chairs.

749
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:51,812
Nowadays,

750
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:52,972
I can't see well.

751
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,052
I can only admire it with my eyes.

752
00:39:55,552 --> 00:39:56,772
I can't do the physical work.

753
00:39:58,816 --> 00:39:59,612
This is nice.

754
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:01,852
Where is Ye?

755
00:40:02,412 --> 00:40:04,532
He's been working inside
since early morning.

756
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,892
Make him work more.

757
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,612
Grandpa, your afternoon tea is ready.

758
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:11,292
Thank you, young lady.

759
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,448
Grandpa.

760
00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:14,572
My name is Bao, and I'm a boy.

761
00:40:15,452 --> 00:40:16,452
Oh, a boy.

762
00:40:17,012 --> 00:40:18,012
Call me if you need anything.

763
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:18,812
Thank you.

764
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,532
These dimples of his.

765
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:21,532
He's a boy.

766
00:40:21,532 --> 00:40:22,652
- A boy.
- So handsome.

767
00:40:22,652 --> 00:40:23,852
Grandpa, have a taste.

768
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,492
This is our red velvet cake.

769
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:29,532
Really? I'll give it a try.

770
00:40:29,532 --> 00:40:30,292
Taste it.

771
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,012
Tasty, isn't it?

772
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:35,292
So delicious!

773
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,572
Please have another bite of that.

774
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,052
This is nice.

775
00:40:40,492 --> 00:40:41,092
Ye.

776
00:40:41,092 --> 00:40:41,792
Ye.

777
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,412
You see, I'm just free labor.

778
00:40:44,052 --> 00:40:44,652
He's unhappy.

779
00:40:44,652 --> 00:40:45,612
He's acting all serious.

780
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:47,092
Grandpa.

781
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:48,452
Pu.

782
00:40:48,452 --> 00:40:50,292
Grandpa, you're here!

783
00:40:50,292 --> 00:40:51,412
Hello, Grandpa.

784
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:52,572
I'm Que's best friend.

785
00:40:52,572 --> 00:40:54,212
I'm also a partner of this shop.

786
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:55,252
You can call me Xindi.

787
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:56,852
- I've seen you before.
- You've seen me?

788
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:57,692
In the photo.

789
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,412
You look prettier in person.

790
00:41:00,412 --> 00:41:01,292
I do?

791
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:03,052
That's what everyone says.

792
00:41:03,052 --> 00:41:04,532
I rely on this to find a boyfriend.

793
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,332
Okay, have you found one?

794
00:41:08,128 --> 00:41:08,732
Yes, I have.

795
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,452
One of our seniors.

796
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:13,852
Does that senior know about that?

797
00:41:13,852 --> 00:41:14,572
Shut up.

798
00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:16,672
Grandpa.

799
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:19,572
I'll bring him to meet you later,
so that you can check him out for me.

800
00:41:20,492 --> 00:41:22,492
I'll analyze your
Eight Characters for you.

801
00:41:22,652 --> 00:41:24,128
Do you know how to do that?

802
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:26,132
Why don't you test us two first
to see if we're compatible?

803
00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:28,332
- He definitely brings me bad luck.
- Right, give us a reading.

804
00:41:28,332 --> 00:41:30,144
We mustn't turn out compatible.
That would be trouble.

805
00:41:30,144 --> 00:41:31,648
Who would want to be
compatible with you?

806
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,252
Grandpa, I'll show you
my live-streaming room.

807
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:35,892
That one, the big glass room.

808
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:36,812
Grandpa, mind your steps.

809
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:38,372
That room in there.

810
00:41:47,052 --> 00:41:48,332
Be careful with it.

811
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:49,972
If you break one,
you'll have to pay for it.

812
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:50,972
Why should I?

813
00:41:50,972 --> 00:41:52,212
What?

814
00:41:52,212 --> 00:41:53,772
Shall I pay for it then?

815
00:41:54,772 --> 00:41:55,612
You.

816
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,652
Stop saying that.
You should call me sister.

817
00:41:57,652 --> 00:41:58,572
Underage.

818
00:41:59,412 --> 00:42:00,412
I'll say it one more time.

819
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:01,692
I am an adult now.

820
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,212
And I'm about to go to college.

821
00:42:03,412 --> 00:42:04,732
Don't call me underage anymore.

822
00:42:04,812 --> 00:42:07,412
Even if you were 80 years old,
you'd still be underage in front of us.

823
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:10,852
You and Lin Tuo could still
be together at the age of 80.

824
00:42:15,072 --> 00:42:16,852
Still, you'd still be underage.

825
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:23,332
Do you know Xu Tianhai?

826
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:25,732
Yeah, he's my brother's
childhood friend.

827
00:42:26,732 --> 00:42:28,212
His sister is in the same grade as me.

828
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:30,016
She went abroad
right after high school graduation.

829
00:42:31,692 --> 00:42:32,852
Do you have his WeChat?

830
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:34,332
Yes, I do.

831
00:42:34,332 --> 00:42:35,492
Let me take a look at his Moments.

832
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:37,492
Why?

833
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:40,012
Just let me have a quick look.

834
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:57,132
(Xu Tianhai's Moments)

835
00:42:57,132 --> 00:42:59,040
(My mom has found new ways
to pressure me into marriage.)

836
00:42:59,808 --> 00:43:02,252
(She has even started playing
the wedding march for me.)
