when pulling your tooth?

spend so much money for this?

That's what comes with the set meal.
Don't expect it to be good.

Of course.

Can't you eat something nice?

93
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,552
You can't just eat whatever's on sale.

94
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:57,992
It's nice. I just love stuff on sale.

95
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,352
Do you drink the soup or not?
If not, I'll use it for rice.

Yes, yes.

97
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:11,792
Listen. You shouldn't have bought
that apartment.

98

for the down payment and mortgage,
affecting your quality of life.

100
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:19,552
Then what? Living in this tiny place?

101
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,432
Old An drives every day,
so his back is getting bad,

102
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,936
and we take turns sleeping on the couch.

103
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:27,072
He insists on taking turns with me
even if I told him to sleep in the bedroom.

104
00:09:27,752 --> 00:09:29,552
I wonder if he's going
through menopause.

105
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,912
He doesn't listen to anything,
and is being stubborn.

106
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:35,192
What? He is just being considerate.

107
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,072
I'm telling you,
Old An truly adores you.

108
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,752
If my dad was half like him,

109
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:41,032
I wouldn't feel like I'm an orphan.

110
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:44,712
People say fathers love
their daughters the most.

111
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:46,192
I wonder if I'm not his real daughter.

112
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:50,352
Your dad's been married three times
and has several children already.

113
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:51,592
He doesn't have time to adore you.

114
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:52,632
Then don't expect me to treat him well.

Jiang Chucheng. Look.

118
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:11,512
- Let me see.
- Is he cool?

119
00:10:16,472 --> 00:10:18,272
No one told me that.

120
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:20,512
I shouldn't have gone to pull my tooth.

121
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:26,312
How is it? Do you think he's cool?

122
00:10:26,312 --> 00:10:27,552
He's just my type.

123
00:10:29,192 --> 00:10:31,264
But he had already graduated
when we enrolled.

124
00:10:31,792 --> 00:10:33,832
Otherwise, I would definitely get him.

125
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:35,272
Who is he?

126
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,832
Who's he? I don't know him.

127
00:10:39,832 --> 00:10:42,272
He seems to be the boy
who bought dumplings from me.

128
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:44,392
Is he from our school?

129
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,312
This is the school soccer match,
so he must be from our school.

immediately when I'm done.

You do your internship,
and don't worry about me.

170

00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:45,032
Mom is busy with Ye.
She doesn't have time for me.

178
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:51,112
Grandpa, I have to go for my interview.

179
00:13:51,112 --> 00:13:53,992
I'll take the train back later.
Take care.

180
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:02,272
(Mom, I have to do a holiday internship,
so I won't come back.)

181
00:14:03,672 --> 00:14:04,416
(Mom)
(Hmm.)

182
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:08,992
Director, I'm begging you.

183
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,632
Director, please give me
one more chance, okay?

184
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,192
It's not that I'm inconsiderate.

185
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,992
The client has a problem with you
and wants a replacement.

186
00:14:15,992 --> 00:14:17,392
My grandma's really sick,

187
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:19,072
and she's still
in the intensive care unit.

188
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:20,272
No one takes care of her.

189
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:24,152
Zhang, you weren't just late that day,

190
00:14:24,152 --> 00:14:25,912
but you were often late before.

191
00:14:26,472 --> 00:14:28,232
You kept a client waiting for 1.5 hours.

192
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,872
It's even worse now.
You lost the contract.

193
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:32,352
How can we explain this to the client?

194
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,912
Our boss has even
personally gone to apologize.

195
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,112
Can you still stay in the company?

196
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:42,592
Don't give me a hard time.
Go get paid and leave.

197
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,352
(Director, Interview Supervisor)

198
00:15:30,352 --> 00:15:33,192
Okay. From left to right,

199
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:36,272
please introduce yourselves in turn.
Let's begin.

200
00:15:38,232 --> 00:15:41,992
Hello, my name is Xu Xiaokai,
22 years old, from Dalian.

201
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:45,112
I am a junior at Huapei University,
majoring in new media.

202
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,472
My profile includes
the awards I have received

203
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:50,712
and my scientific research design.
During my sophomore summer break...

204
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,080
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:25,912
Sorry, I forgot to mute my phone.

206
00:16:27,992 --> 00:16:28,792
What's your name?

207
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:30,192
Lin Tuo.

208
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:32,392
Details matter.

209
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:36,752
If every candidate's
phone rang like yours,

210
00:16:36,752 --> 00:16:38,152
how can our interview go on?

211
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:42,472
This is the basic professional etiquette
every professional should have.

212
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:48,160
Sorry. I was careless
and it affected you.

213
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:52,952
I will learn from it. Sorry, everyone.

214
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,168
Continue.

215
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:14,552
During my sophomore summer break,
I participated in the Xuehai Cup,

216
00:17:14,552 --> 00:17:17,831
I won a third-place team prize
in a new media design competition.

217
00:17:17,831 --> 00:17:20,111
And I really want to get this job.

218
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:36,632
Thank you. I forgot to mute my phone.

219
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:38,072
It's nothing.

220
00:17:38,072 --> 00:17:40,912
Not at all. It affected your interview.

221
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:42,992
Well, I'll go tell them.

222
00:17:43,552 --> 00:17:45,672
I'll say it's my fault.
It has nothing to do with you.

223
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:48,512
There's still time. Let's go.

224
00:17:48,512 --> 00:17:49,352
No need.

225
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:52,432
Why? You came here for the interview,
but you haven't said anything yet.

226
00:17:53,232 --> 00:17:56,632
I studied furniture design
and this position is for new media.

227
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,312
I don't understand it at all.

228
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,152
The result now is perfect.
Don't mind it.

229
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:09,712
Did you just run out
without an interview?

230
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:11,912
You came out because of me.

231
00:18:12,552 --> 00:18:15,472
I can't just stay in there
like nothing happened.

232
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,392
I won't do this interview, either.

233
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:22,632
Is it really okay?

234
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:24,712
Yes, let's go.

235
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:26,400
Let's go.

236
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,272
I have a senior
whose friend is a headhunter.

237
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:35,912
He asked that friend
to recommend me some interviews.

238
00:18:35,912 --> 00:18:37,952
But that headhunter always recommends me

239
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,832
some interviews that have
nothing to do with my major.

240
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,152
I'm too embarrassed to say no,
so I have to go.

241
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:47,912
How about we add a contact on WeChat?

242
00:18:49,312 --> 00:18:51,112
Sure, I'll scan you.

243
00:18:57,072 --> 00:19:02,552
My name is An Zhique, Z-H-I-Q-U-E.

244
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:05,792
An Zhique, you have a very special name.

245
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,432
My name is Lin Tuo, T-U-O.

246
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:12,632
I'm leaving then.

247
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:13,472
- Bye.
- Bye.

248
00:19:19,072 --> 00:19:21,072
Are you from
Dong Yuan University of Technology?

249
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,872
Yes, how did you know?

250
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:28,512
So am I. I saw your photo
on the Moments that day.

251
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:30,072
The school soccer match.

252
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:32,992
What's your major?

253
00:19:33,792 --> 00:19:35,112
Information Big Data, what about you?

254
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:37,432
Industrial Design, junior year.

255
00:19:37,432 --> 00:19:42,272
Me too. We met
at the wet market yesterday.

256
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:47,232
I'm just helping out.
They're not well wrapped.

257
00:19:47,232 --> 00:19:48,472
How about I refund you the money?

258
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:54,792
It's you.

259
00:19:55,832 --> 00:19:56,872
What a coincidence.

260
00:19:56,872 --> 00:19:58,552
- Yes.
- Yes.

261
00:19:59,872 --> 00:20:03,512
Let me treat you to a meal
to thank you next time.

262
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,432
Sure.

263
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,992
I'm really leaving then.

264
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:11,952
How about today?

265
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:21,152
Sure.

266
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:31,792
His hometown is the Snow Village
in the Northeast.

267
00:20:32,672 --> 00:20:35,192
He says in winter the snow is so thick
that it reaches directly to his knees.

268
00:20:35,832 --> 00:20:37,032
I've never seen much snow.

269
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:39,192
I really want to visit his place.

270
00:20:40,192 --> 00:20:41,792
Have you ever seen heavy snow?

271
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:45,072
No. I haven't even left Chongqing.

272
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:46,552
Why?

273
00:20:49,152 --> 00:20:50,792
Because I'm poor,
I don't have money to go.

274
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:55,232
I haven't been out much, either.
My parents won't allow it.

275
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:57,792
They always think I'm still a kid.

276
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:02,352
When I was a kid,
I just wanted to grow up.

277
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:05,072
Once I grow up,
I'd be free and have money.

278
00:21:05,072 --> 00:21:08,152
As I've grown up, my life
becomes harder and poorer.

279
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:12,352
So you're making dumplings
as a part-time job at the wet market?

280
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:17,112
I also sell goods via livestreaming
with my bestie. I do all sorts of works.

281
00:21:17,752 --> 00:21:19,912
The owner of the dumpling stall
is my neighbor.

282
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,192
Her husband fell ill,
so I went to help her out.

283
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:25,912
I thought, "how hard can it be
to sell dumplings?"

284
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:28,792
But I found out I am really clumsy.

285
00:21:29,432 --> 00:21:30,632
You just need more practice.

286
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:35,352
Can you make dumplings?

287
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:39,272
Yes, I've been cooking with
my grandpa since I was a child.

288
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:42,512
My grandpa is a carpenter
and a good cook.

289
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:47,752
So I learned how to cook
and the woodwork from him.

290
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,112
I'm also good at making dumplings.

291
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,192
I can cook many dishes
for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner.

292
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:56,352
Impressive. I can't.
I can only cook a few dishes.

293
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,952
Anyway, I mainly eat vegetables.

294
00:22:00,512 --> 00:22:01,432
You like to eat vegetables?

295
00:22:03,472 --> 00:22:06,192
Vegetables are cheaper,
and help lose weight. It's perfect then.

296
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:09,432
But I make great coffee.

297
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:12,592
I spent my freshman and sophomore years
working part-time at a coffee shop.

298
00:22:13,192 --> 00:22:16,192
I'll let you try the coffee I make
if there's a chance.

299
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:21,152
Alright, we have to do internships,

300
00:22:23,712 --> 00:22:27,152
so we can look for a company
and interview together.

301
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:30,472
Find a lucrative job together.

302
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:32,256
Okay.

303
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:43,512
No way. I have to go back
to prepare the livestreaming.

304
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,632
Well, have you finished?

305
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:46,552
Yes, I've finished.

306
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:48,352
Hello.

307
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:49,872
I've already paid.

308
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:52,152
Didn't I say I would treat?

309
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:52,952
Because you're poor.

310
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:56,632
Just kidding. Let's go.

311
00:22:56,632 --> 00:22:58,752
Okay, I'll treat you next time.

312
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,792
Okay, next time.

313
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:05,912
You can't just ignore me
because you've had a romantic encounter.

314
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:07,552
What are you talking about?

315
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,080
It's just a coincidence that we met.

316
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:13,472
What a coincidence.
Now that you know him,

317
00:23:13,472 --> 00:23:16,192
how about getting that senior's WeChat?

318
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:19,632
We just met and had a meal together.

319
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:20,992
I'll ask him when we get more familiar.

320
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:24,712
Then date him now.
You have to meet often to get familiar.

321
00:23:24,712 --> 00:23:26,912
No one would do so.

322
00:23:28,832 --> 00:23:30,304
Then invite him
to watch our livestreaming.

323
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,192
If he likes anything,
I would give it to him.

324
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:36,152
You sell girls' stuff.
Why would a boy like it?

325
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:37,872
Did you ask if he has a girlfriend?

326
00:23:37,872 --> 00:23:41,792
Come on. We just met.
How can I ask that?

327
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,192
Let's go. Don't delay making money.

328
00:23:43,192 --> 00:23:44,992
Just ask him.

329
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:47,872
(Babies, Xindi is about to show you)

330
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:50,152
(a super great product!)

331
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:52,352
(Xie Xin Mansion)
(This perk is exclusive here.)

332
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,112
(Meco Juice Tea.)

333
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:01,032
(This juice tea comes
in five different flavors.)

334
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:02,272
Do you know her?

335
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,152
No.

336
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,312
Then why do you watch her
selling goods? You fancy her?

337
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:09,992
She's your type, right?

338
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,752
What do you mean?

339
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:17,824
This girl seems to be
He Xindi from our school.

340
00:24:17,824 --> 00:24:19,912
(You keep it in the fridge
during summer time...)

341
00:24:19,912 --> 00:24:22,032
Let me tell you,
there's something off about her.

342
00:24:22,032 --> 00:24:23,432
I think she's a liar. Stop watching.

343
00:24:24,992 --> 00:24:26,712
What? She's just selling stuff.

344
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:28,832
It's all fake. Trust me.

345
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,244
(Xie Xin Mansion)

346
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:32,352
Did you hear me?

347
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:32,912
Yes.

348
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:36,032
Hello, phone number
ended with 0059, right?

349
00:24:36,032 --> 00:24:37,192
- Yes.
- To the train station.

350
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:40,192
Wait for me, I'll be back in a few days.

351
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,152
Let me know when you arrive.

352
00:24:42,072 --> 00:24:43,072
I'm off.

353
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:43,752
Don't watch it.

354
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:45,712
Got it. Go back.

355
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:55,296
(Luzhou, Sichuan)

356
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,512
Don't overcook it.

357
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:11,752
It's fine. Tuo, grab a plate.

358
00:25:12,472 --> 00:25:13,184
Okay.

359
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:16,576
It's ready.

360
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,712
The crown prince is dead.
Who killed him? Let me take a look.

361
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:30,672
You don't watch suspense dramas now?

362
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:34,072
Right, it's too exhausting.

363
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:36,632
I can't figure out
who the murderer is, boring.

364
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:39,992
Costume idol drama is simpler.
He'd kill her, and she'd marry him.

365
00:25:39,992 --> 00:25:42,312
Watching them dating is interesting.

366
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,512
When did you start
liking to see people dating?

367
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,712
I didn't have time for dating
when I was young.

368
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,192
After getting married,
your grandma controlled me.

369
00:25:51,192 --> 00:25:53,152
She wasted my best years.

370
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:54,872
So I watch this now.

371
00:25:56,752 --> 00:26:01,112
Grandpa, have you
taken a fancy to someone recently?

372
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:06,272
Some take a fancy to me,
but I don't take them to heart.

373
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:10,232
You can date. I support you.

374
00:26:10,232 --> 00:26:11,552
You set an example to me first.

375
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:15,392
You make the soup.
I'll finish watching this part.

376
00:26:16,592 --> 00:26:17,408
Okay.

377
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:28,312
Ruthless.

378
00:26:29,592 --> 00:26:30,632
Is it really that good?

379
00:26:31,192 --> 00:26:32,792
Malicious, this guy is bad.

380
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,432
Have a shrimp.

381
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:38,112
So stupid.

382
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:41,792
Grandpa, I'll go pick up Ye from school.
I'll come back after dropping him off.

383
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,192
When you get home,
spend some time with your parents.

384
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,432
Be good. It's not often you come back.

385
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,352
Stay one day and come back tomorrow.

386
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:04,512
When you see Ye,
don't talk about studying.

387
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:06,912
What's wrong?

388
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:11,632
He's being pushed so hard
by your parents that he's freaking out.

389
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:14,912
They push him to get high scores
and to get into medical school.

390
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,552
I'm afraid something bad
is going to happen.

391
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:22,752
Take him for a break.
Don't stress him out.

392
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,032
Let him relax, you know?

393
00:27:25,672 --> 00:27:29,712
Okay. Enjoy the dinner. I'm going now.

394
00:27:38,672 --> 00:27:39,432
You're dating someone?

395
00:27:39,952 --> 00:27:41,392
What?

396
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:43,792
No, you're so happy.
You must be dating someone.

397
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,152
There's nothing to make me sad, anyway.

398
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:49,832
Well, if you're dating someone,
you must tell me.

399
00:27:49,832 --> 00:27:51,072
Okay, please?

400
00:27:51,072 --> 00:27:54,432
Rest assured. I'll definitely tell you.
What are the requirements?

401
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:58,016
Many. First of all, he must be healthy,

402
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:02,752
kind, handsome,
and preferably has a good education.

403
00:28:02,752 --> 00:28:05,312
B-But most importantly,
he must treat you well.

404
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:10,552
Why would someone
like that treat me well?

405
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,152
Then why not?

406
00:28:12,152 --> 00:28:13,912
You are so good. You can't be wronged.

407
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:20,792
Dad, do you believe in fate,

408
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:21,712
coincidence?

409
00:28:23,352 --> 00:28:25,152
Of course.

410
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:28,272
I have experience in this.

411
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:31,712
Your mom and I wouldn't be together
if there's no coincidence.

412
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:34,472
I used to drive a truck, you know.

413
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,552
Yes.

414
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:39,712
Long, long ago,
I was making deliveries in my truck.

415
00:28:39,712 --> 00:28:42,792
A girl stopped me and said
she wanted me to give her a ride.

416
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:47,552
I was kind and nice,
so I gave her a ride.

417
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:50,512
I thought you did it
because she's pretty.

418
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:51,992
Definitely, right?

419
00:28:52,792 --> 00:28:54,632
We had a good chat.

420
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:57,712
But everything has to come to an end.

421
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:59,272
When we arrived, she left.

422
00:28:59,272 --> 00:29:02,672
You didn't even get her contact?
What a pity.

423
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:05,232
Indeed. I was upset for several days.

424
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:06,232
I didn't even eat well.

425
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:06,872
That upset?

426
00:29:06,872 --> 00:29:08,152
But as the old saying goes,

427
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:12,072
every cloud has a silver lining.

428
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:15,872
Another day, long, long ago,
I went to eat at a restaurant.

429
00:29:18,072 --> 00:29:19,472
Guess who I met?

430
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:20,632
The girl who stopped your truck.

431
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:24,632
H-How did you know?
Did I ever tell you this?

432
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:25,832
You never told me.

433
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:28,632
That sounds like those soap operas.

434
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:32,632
No, this is fate.

435
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:39,352
I ordered a bowl of rice
and she gave me a bowl of soup.

436
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:40,872
The rice always goes with a soup.

437
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:45,952
You are wrong. She personally
served me this bowl of soup.

438
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,552
I thought this girl
must be interested in me.

439
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,232
Then I had to take the initiative.

440
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:52,632
So I went to order rice meal every day,

441
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:53,792
and she served me soup every day.

442
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,592
Again and again, day after day.

443
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:58,192
In the end, I served her soup.

444
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,192
Because she became your mom.

445
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:07,912
After that, I came to Chongqing
with your mom.

446
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:11,952
Fate.

447
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:15,432
Fate.

448
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:25,552
Kid, fate is not something
that comes easily.

449
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,552
It's actually harder to hold on to.

450
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,552
I failed to hold on to your mom.

451
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:39,552
Dad, Iet's go.

452
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:44,192
Right, you haven't told me yet.

453
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:45,872
W-What about your fate?

454
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:48,912
I do have fate, well...

455
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:51,072
I'll tell you about it later.

456
00:30:51,072 --> 00:30:53,432
No, no. There must be
something, An Zhique.

457
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:10,152
Why are you here?

458
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:11,552
I'm here to pick you up.

459
00:31:12,632 --> 00:31:14,672
Am I a child? I need picking up?

460
00:31:15,672 --> 00:31:17,992
Have you eaten? Is BBQ okay with you?

461
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:39,752
Ye, I'm coming in.

462
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,272
Don't just hide in your room
once you get home.

463
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,392
Study.

464
00:31:53,032 --> 00:31:53,952
Using your phone to study?

465
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:04,632
When did you buy this?
It wasn't here last time I came back.

466
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:17,152
Let's have a chat.

467
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:18,816
I am busy.

468
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:20,952
I didn't offend you.

469
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:26,432
Aren't you just called back to scold me?

470
00:32:26,952 --> 00:32:31,432
Just about going to medical school?
Enough, I don't want to hear it.

471
00:32:31,432 --> 00:32:33,272
No, I wanted to come back.

472
00:32:33,832 --> 00:32:35,512
Tuo, Ye.

473
00:33:07,832 --> 00:33:10,312
Keep your phone down.
It's disturbing your brother's studying.

474
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:14,832
Mom, I want to talk to you.

475
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:15,552
You...

476
00:33:17,552 --> 00:33:18,232
You are back.

477
00:33:22,512 --> 00:33:23,296
Dad.

478
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:25,912
Why are you here?

479
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,792
I'll go heat up the food for you.

480
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:28,992
I came back to see grandpa.

481
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:33,392
Are you about to have a holiday?
What's your plan?

482
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,832
I need to do an internship.

483
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:40,032
Do junior internships count for credit?

484
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:40,768
Yes.

485
00:33:42,672 --> 00:33:44,872
Then don't come back. It wastes time.

486
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:54,752
Lin, have dinner first.

487
00:34:11,352 --> 00:34:13,792
Come on, have some soup.

488
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,312
Thank you, mom.

489
00:34:27,952 --> 00:34:28,472
What's wrong?

490
00:34:32,432 --> 00:34:33,088
A minor matter.

491
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:35,808
Say it.

492
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:44,312
What if... what if...

493
00:34:45,912 --> 00:34:49,352
What if Ye can't
get into medical school...

494
00:34:53,072 --> 00:34:53,872
What do you want to say?

495
00:34:56,191 --> 00:35:00,712
I-I just want to say it's hard
to get into the medical school.

496
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:04,712
What if Ye can't
get into medical school...

497
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:05,872
Then retake it.

498
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:10,832
Dad, I think we should
consider Ye's opinion.

499
00:35:11,832 --> 00:35:14,712
Will you finish the soup?
If not, go back to your room.

500
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:22,352
Do you plan
to take the postgraduate exam?

501
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,952
Yes, I'm planning.

502
00:35:30,072 --> 00:35:31,272
Then don't worry about others.

503
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:34,112
I can handle your brother's affairs.

504
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:37,536
Okay.

505
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:56,448
(Package Delivery Message)

506
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:31,936
(I suddenly feel like
going to the movies.)

507
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,523
(Maybe a little more handsome? LOL.)

508
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,024
Mom.

509
00:36:55,272 --> 00:37:00,752
Well, why did you suddenly ask about Ye?

510
00:37:04,552 --> 00:37:06,112
I just wanted to speak up for him.

511
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:09,792
The college entrance exam is coming up.

512
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:13,312
It's normal to be emotional.

513
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:16,832
As his elder brother,
you should give him some guidance.

514
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:21,552
Mom, I think

515
00:37:22,512 --> 00:37:25,592
we should consider Ye's opinions.

516
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:28,232
Is there no other way
but getting into the medical school?

517
00:37:28,232 --> 00:37:30,072
The right path is not the only one.

518
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:32,272
It's his freedom to choose the path.

519
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:36,112
We can't keep interfering with
his life with what we think.

520
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:43,472
You're not here to see grandpa,
but for Ye.

521
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:46,472
Wait, why do you all say that?

522
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,232
I am caught in the middle now.

523
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:50,792
Ye thinks I am here
to scold him on your behalf.

524
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:52,952
And you think I'm trying
to convince you on his behalf.

525
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:57,312
I saw Ye is not in a good state,
so I was a bit worried.

526
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,472
You didn't want to go to medical school

527
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,832
and wrote your desired school and major
on your own when applying for schools,

528
00:38:07,832 --> 00:38:09,752
which almost
got your dad a heart attack.

529
00:38:09,752 --> 00:38:12,952
And after that, he hadn't talked to you
for over a year. Don't you remember?

530
00:38:16,232 --> 00:38:17,832
Your dad already compromised once.

531
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:22,472
It is impossible for him
to compromise again.

532
00:38:22,472 --> 00:38:24,192
This is not a compromise.

533
00:38:24,192 --> 00:38:26,432
Why do you always put yourself

534
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:28,712
in the position of a victim
on this matter?

535
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:29,952
What do you mean?

536
00:38:31,672 --> 00:38:35,792
We just don't want
to repeat what happened.

537
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:37,192
Don't we get tired of it?

538
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:42,192
You're about to graduate
and take the postgraduate exam.

539
00:38:44,792 --> 00:38:46,832
I'm not taking the postgraduate exam
and I can't pass it.

540
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:49,592
Even postgraduates
struggle to find jobs nowadays.

541
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:52,872
Can you get a job
as a regular undergraduate?

542
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,712
Can you be independent?
Can you support yourself?

543
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:56,072
Have you thought about any of this?

544
00:38:56,752 --> 00:39:00,472
I have. I can find a job
and support myself.

545
00:39:04,752 --> 00:39:07,072
Then do what you want
and take care of yourself.

546
00:39:07,072 --> 00:39:07,872
Mom.

547
00:39:07,872 --> 00:39:10,312
Alright, I don't want to talk to you.
I'll go see your grandpa.

548
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:56,448
We have buns today.

549
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,872
Dad, your blood pressure
has been a bit high lately.

550
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:04,272
How do you know it?

551
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:05,712
The monitor is connected to my phone.

552
00:40:07,312 --> 00:40:10,112
Well, there's nothing good
about the high technology.

553
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:12,152
We have no privacy at all now.
It's not a good thing.

554
00:40:12,872 --> 00:40:15,112
High blood pressure is not a good thing.

555
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,872
You can't drink anymore.

556
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,272
I've scheduled a health check-up
for you on Thursday morning.

557
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:20,912
Thursday morning?

558
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:24,152
I have to work on Thursday.

559
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:26,752
Just take half a day off.

560
00:40:26,752 --> 00:40:27,912
I've paid, no refund allowed.

561
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:30,112
You spend money recklessly.

562
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:33,872
Where to get the health check-up?
Hospital?

563
00:40:35,912 --> 00:40:37,752
I don't want to go to hospital.

564
00:40:37,752 --> 00:40:39,192
I hate going to hospitals.

565
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,912
Where are you going if you don't go to
the hospital when you're sick?

566
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:43,952
Do you want me to treat you at home?

567
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:46,432
I'll go. What's there to check for?

568
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:49,312
Just a normal checkup and gastroscopy.

569
00:40:50,872 --> 00:40:53,872
Gastroscopy?
They insert the tube through here?

570
00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:54,792
It's painless.

571
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:58,512
Is the painless one more expensive?

572
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:03,632
Well, just change to the standard one.

573
00:41:03,632 --> 00:41:04,232
I-I don't need it.

574
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:04,872
The standard one.

575
00:41:05,392 --> 00:41:07,832
With the standard one,
you might feel disgusted or throw up.

576
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:10,672
At this age, don't suffer.

577
00:41:12,272 --> 00:41:13,472
My daughter is considerate.

578
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:18,352
But actually, I'm not that fragile.

579
00:41:18,352 --> 00:41:19,672
Indeed, I can endure it.

580
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:22,832
I can even swallow an egg,
not to mention the tube.

581
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:24,752
Swallow it to show me.

582
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:25,272
L-Like this.

583
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,832
You choked, right?

584
00:41:33,272 --> 00:41:33,992
I'll peel one for you.

(The first cup of sugar latte in autumn)

586
00:41:58,532 --> 00:41:59,652
(Sugar Latte)

588

(How much for one sugar latte?)

589
00:42:15,392 --> 00:42:17,792
(15 per cup, free today.)

590
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:27,632
(Where's the free coffee?)

591
00:42:30,032 --> 00:42:31,512
(Half an hour
to get to the train station.)

592
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:33,992
