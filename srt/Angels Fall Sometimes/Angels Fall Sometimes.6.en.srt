Here is for you.

15
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,923
Thank you.

16
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:55,563
Pick one.

17
00:02:02,763 --> 00:02:04,683
Do you know why I love lollipops?

18
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:10,242
When I was little, my mom got sick.

19
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:12,123
She had to take medicine every day,

20
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:13,923
and my dad bought her
lollipops every day.

21
00:02:14,523 --> 00:02:17,483
Whenever I was upset,
my mom would give me her lollipop.

22
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:21,683
My mom passed away when I was nine.

23
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:25,603
At that time,
I ate a lollipop every day.

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,443
Because life was just too bitter.

25
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,883
Think about.
How would a child like me be happy?

26
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,923
Then I thought I'd grow up overnight.

27
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:35,643
I thought once I grow up
and earn money, life would be better.

28
00:02:36,603 --> 00:02:40,563
But who knows it gets harder
when I get older.

29
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:43,123
It's still bitter
after I eat a lollipop.

30
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:50,323
Then you should thank these lollipops.

31
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,523
You don't show any of the bitterness.

32
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:59,243
Do you think we've grown up now?

33
00:03:01,323 --> 00:03:03,083
We grew up the moment
we graduated from the college.

34
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,643
It's harder when we get older.

35
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:08,923
Let's hang up now.

36
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,083
I'll be careful next time.

37
00:03:12,803 --> 00:03:16,763
Look, people on the street
all seem so busy.

38
00:03:17,723 --> 00:03:19,083
Perhaps they can't find a job.

39
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:21,203
Maybe they just lost love.

40
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:26,803
Maybe they got their credit card bills.

41
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,203
Maybe they just
got scolded by their boss.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,763
Maybe they just met someone they like.

43
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:34,843
Maybe they met someone they like
but are too scared to confess.

44
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,883
Maybe they just made
a completely different choice.

45
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:41,523
Just like these mystery box lollipops,

46
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,963
the unknown is what's interesting.

47
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:52,643
It's vanilla-flavored.

48
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:55,003
Chocolate.

49
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:56,603
There's always one that's sweet.

50
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,723
I'll buy all your lollipops from now on.

52

Morning!

53
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:22,122
- Morning.
- Morning.

54
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:43,323
Meeting in Conference Room 3
in two minutes.

55
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,603
Okay, what should I bring?

56
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,403
A notebook, pen,
and a tablet if you have one.

57
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:48,160
Okay.

58
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:52,923
Conference Room 3.

59
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:07,763
Two matters.
First, about the Shanghai exhibition.

60
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,603
Second, introducing the new colleague.

61
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:12,803
The newcomer in Team 3, Lin Tuo.

62
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:15,083
He will be in Team 3 during probation.
Let me introduce.

63
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,523
Huo Sheng, Peng Qianfan, Huang Xiaolv.

64
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,403
Hello, my name is Lin Tuo,
graduated from Dong Yuan.

65
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:24,803
Get to the point. Does it matter
where you graduated from?

66
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:28,323
He's fresh out of college,
and doesn't know anything.

67
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,843
Don't expect much on him.
He'll be with you during probation.

68
00:05:32,563 --> 00:05:33,843
Ask Huang Xiaolv for basic questions.

69
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:36,123
You're in no position to worry about
professional matters right now.

70
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,403
Work with Huang Xiaolv
on assisting everyone.

71
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:40,963
I don't allow any idlers
or fools in my team.

72
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,683
Do it if you can do it.
If you can't, tell me in advance.

73
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:45,963
Got it. I will try my best.

74
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:48,123
It's basic. Act with brains.

75
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:49,603
Make four copies of this.

76
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:53,443
Understood.

77
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:53,963
Coffee.

78
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:56,123
Understood.

79
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:56,736
Let's start.

80
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,603
- It's starting.
- Yes.

81
00:06:10,963 --> 00:06:14,043
Hello, welcome to Xindi's live stream.

82
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:17,483
Today, I and my assistant
are here to bring benefits to you.

83
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:18,323
- Here it is.
- It's

84
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:21,683
this Meco Juice Tea.

85
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:25,043
The one the assistant holds
is in peach grapefruit flavor.

86
00:06:25,043 --> 00:06:26,523
Each juice tea contains

87
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,563
at least three kinds of fruit
and one kind of tea.

88
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,483
Come on, have a taste.

89
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,003
Let me have a taste.

91
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,443
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

92
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:55,003
Thank you. I hope you place your order.

93
00:06:55,003 --> 00:06:57,483
We have lychee, passionfruit,

94
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,443
peach and jasmine tea.

95

(Conference Room 3)
Anyway, in this exhibition,

96
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,643
no duplication.

97
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:20,723
I don't want to repeat the same.

98
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:23,203
Five special exhibition booths.

99
00:07:23,203 --> 00:07:25,683
Think about how we design
and arrange it, okay?

100
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:28,096
Thank you.

101
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:33,043
Leader, materials.

102
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:35,648
Thank you.

103
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,243
Lin Tuo, you'd take the meeting minutes.

104
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:42,483
Okay.

105
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:45,243
What you have is
the exhibition project description.

106
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,403
For our reserve design,

107
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,923
(No recording)
today, make a draft proposal first.

108
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,323
Put practical operation first.

109
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:53,003
Don't talk about superficial stuff.

110
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:57,923
Did you add sugar?

111
00:07:57,923 --> 00:07:58,443
Two pieces.

112
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,883
I can't drink as much as you do.

113
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:07,163
You could drink a lot beverage.

114
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:10,923
I'm not doing this for me,
but for both of us.

115
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,883
Come on. I'm just a part-timer.

116
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,323
You have to pay me more for this.

117
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:22,203
Okay, we have many orders.

118
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:24,803
There are quite a few
who directly ordered three sets.

119
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:27,083
Fine. Whatever.

120
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,803
I have to make a cake
for Lin Tuo's birthday tomorrow.

121
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,643
His birthday is tomorrow.
Why do you make a cake today?

122
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:34,363
We'd celebrate at 12 A.M.

123
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,336
Alright, that's all for today.

124
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:42,403
Still, put practical operation first.

125
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:47,723
Lin Tuo, send the meeting minutes
to the group in half an hour.

126
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:49,243
Which group?

127
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:55,283
Haven't you joined our team group?

128
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,003
Do you need me to add you to the group?

129
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,323
No, no.

130
00:08:59,323 --> 00:08:59,963
Half an hour.

131
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:09,123
Get used to it.

132
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:11,363
He just can't speak well.

133
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,396
He scolded me for half a month
when I first got here.

134
00:09:15,396 --> 00:09:18,363
I was getting depressed
and I think he's getting depressed too.

135
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,123
However, his temper has improved
a lot now. Just bear with it.

136
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:23,963
No way. He scolded me yesterday.

137
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:26,963
Only Ms. Qian can handle him.

138
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,563
But to be honest,

139
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:33,003
he's one of the top in the business.
Just learn from him.

140
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:53,963
Hello, I'm looking for Lin Tuo
from Design Department Team 3.

141
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:56,523
Go in here, turn left and go straight.

142
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,523
Design Department Team 3
will be on your right.

143
00:09:58,523 --> 00:09:59,243
Okay, thank you.

144
00:10:13,163 --> 00:10:13,792
Leader.

145
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:20,403
You sent the meeting minutes in just
20 minutes. I thought you are good.

146
00:10:23,243 --> 00:10:26,523
But when I opened it, what is this?

147
00:10:27,643 --> 00:10:29,483
Some primary school diary?

148
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:34,363
School didn't teach you this, right?
So you don't know it.

149
00:10:35,403 --> 00:10:38,603
Can't you ask if you don't know?
Can't you look it up?

150
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:41,603
The Internet is so developed.
Can't you check it yourself?

151
00:10:42,883 --> 00:10:43,523
Did you record it?

152
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:49,984
Yes, but my phone
ran out of power midway.

153
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:54,243
So, what's your plan? To make it up?

154
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:56,283
Do I need to teach you

155
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:59,243
hand-by-hand
on how to take meeting minutes?

156
00:11:00,763 --> 00:11:03,443
No, I will reorganize a new one now.

157
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:06,923
Don't leave until you get it.

158
00:11:28,643 --> 00:11:29,363
I'm off, Lin Tuo.

159
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:30,963
Bye.

160
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:31,776
Bye.

161
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:34,643
I'm leaving. Bye.

162
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:35,843
Bye, bye.

163
00:11:37,723 --> 00:11:38,963
Lin Tuo, aren't you leaving?

164
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,083
I haven't finished yet.

165
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,443
Okay, send it to the group then.
Remember to remind our leader, bye.

166
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:44,963
Bye.

167
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:51,083
Can you go now?

168
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:53,883
Senior, I haven't finished yet.

169
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:55,163
What's it?

170
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:56,923
Today's meeting minutes.

171
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:00,923
It took you a whole day on it?

172
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:04,283
I got scolded for the previous one.

173
00:12:06,803 --> 00:12:07,563
Let me take a look.

174
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:09,083
Sure.

175

(Spring Breeze Self-Study Room)

176
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:27,283
An'an, sorry I'm late.

177
00:12:27,883 --> 00:12:30,083
It's fine. I've been waiting.

178
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:30,624
- Here.
- Okay.

179
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:34,123
I need to pick someone up,
so I'll be back late.

180
00:12:34,843 --> 00:12:35,443
Then you'd go.

181
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,563
By the way, how's Lin Tuo's new job?

182
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:43,843
It's quite good. He doesn't even
have time to reply my message.

183
00:12:43,843 --> 00:12:46,043
Being so busy right away
means he's highly valued.

184
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:50,803
But you're the only one
I can rely on now.

185
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,483
Let me know if you find the right job.

186
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:54,483
I'll find another part-timer.

187
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:55,803
Okay.

188
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:56,683
Alright, then I'll leave.

189
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:57,603
Just go.

190
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:58,243
Okay, bye.

191
00:12:58,243 --> 00:12:58,803
Bye.

192
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:23,883
It should be fine now.
You can submit it.

193
00:13:23,883 --> 00:13:27,883
Thank you, senior.
Sorry to bother you on it.

194
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:31,163
Your boss is so difficult to deal with.
Let's go. I'll treat you to a meal.

195
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:31,872
Okay.

196
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:39,883
Alright.

197
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:40,384
Let's go.

198
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,528
(Spring Breeze Self-Study Room)

199
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,108
(Lin Tuo)

200
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:58,603
Hello.

201
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:01,763
Sorry, I really didn't have time
to check my phone today.

202
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:02,923
Where are you?

203
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:08,043
It's okay. I went to the study room.
Have you finished work?

204
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:12,923
I just got off work.
Senior and I are going to have dinner.

205
00:14:12,923 --> 00:14:14,203
When you get off work, come join us.

206
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,883
I won't go there.
An'an just went out for something.

207
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,403
I'm the only one here.

208
00:14:19,403 --> 00:14:21,403
Don't let the senior pay.

209
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,843
I know. You get back to work.
I'll pack some food for you.

210
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:28,043
No need. You guys eat.

211
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,683
- Bye.
- Bye.

212
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,243
Uncle Four.

213
00:14:44,243 --> 00:14:44,923
Que.

214
00:14:44,923 --> 00:14:45,523
Where's Beibei?

215
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:47,563
She is with her mom.

216
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:48,963
Happy birthday.

217
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,003
It's Lin Tuo's birthday.

218
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:53,483
Then tell him for me.

219
00:14:53,483 --> 00:14:54,923
Okay, thank you, Uncle Four.

220
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:55,763
I'm going in.

221
00:14:55,763 --> 00:14:56,363
Just go.

222
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:11,683
Come on, senior. I'll toast to you.

223
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:12,443
Come on.

224
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,203
I'd be interviewing now
if it wasn't for you.

225
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:16,643
I just handed in your resume.

226
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:20,483
If you weren't qualified,
Ji Jia wouldn't have wanted you.

227
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:26,203
But honestly, Wei Haiyang
is a very excellent designer.

228
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,843
He's also one of the founders of Ji Jia
and has a stake in the company.

229
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,123
But he has a strange temper.

230
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:37,440
He has no interest in management,
just focused on design.

231
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:41,883
But he knows the market so well
that even his boss can't control him.

232
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:45,563
He's the kind of guy
who has a big say in Ji Jia.

233
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,763
Mr. Wei is quite difficult
to get along with.

234
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:52,603
I've been scolded here for a few days.

235
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:56,763
He always tells me to leave
if I can't stand it.

236
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:00,363
His two assistant designers
have been with him for years.

237
00:16:00,363 --> 00:16:03,843
None of them have turned into designers.

238
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,843
Would I just be
an assistant in the future?

239
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:11,003
You'd never know.

240
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,283
All the assistants
he's worked with have gone on

241
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:14,603
to be big designers at other companies.

242
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:17,203
Many companies are waiting
to poach his assistants.

243
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:22,083
Then I might wait to be poached as well.

244
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,523
What? You've just been here,
and you're already thinking of it?

245
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,483
Don't worry, Mom. I know.

246
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:36,803
Beibei is pretty good.
Enough, the money is enough.

247
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:42,483
It's my fifth year
and I want to do it one last time.

248
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:49,243
If I don't pass, I won't take it again.

249
00:16:52,603 --> 00:16:55,483
Okay. Mom, take care.

250
00:17:22,923 --> 00:17:23,763
An'an.

251
00:17:23,763 --> 00:17:24,362
Que.

252
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:28,843
You don't look right.
Are you feeling unwell?

253
00:17:29,643 --> 00:17:32,603
I think I have a little cold.

254
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:36,363
It's almost time. Why don't you
go back and rest a bit earlier?

255
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:41,563
Thank you.
I'll make that up for you tomorrow.

256
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:43,443
It's okay. Just go.

257
00:17:43,443 --> 00:17:44,283
I'll take my stuff.

258
00:17:44,843 --> 00:17:46,363
Go to the hospital
if you really feel unwell.

259
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:59,003
(Que has a cold.
I told her to go back early.)

260
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,123
(Go home to check on her.)

261
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:05,883
Senior, m-my friend is sick.
I need to go check on her.

262
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:08,603
I'll take you there.
Waiter, check please.

263
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:09,763
No need. Senior, I've paid.

264
00:18:10,363 --> 00:18:12,163
This meal is to thank you.

265
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:15,203
It's quite late.
Don't take me there. I can go by myself.

266
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:16,163
Alright, then take care.

267
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:18,123
Bye, senior.

268
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:29,403
Que.

269
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:36,763
Do you have a fever?

270
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:39,763
No, just a bit of a cold,
and I feel a bit dizzy.

271
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:41,003
Let me check.

272
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:48,160
It's not serious.
Have you taken your medicine?

273
00:18:48,843 --> 00:18:49,683
Not yet.

274
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:58,243
How did you know I am back?

275
00:18:59,203 --> 00:19:01,843
An'an sent me a message,
saying you're not feeling well,

276
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:02,883
so I hurried over.

277
00:19:17,363 --> 00:19:18,243
Drink your medicine first.

278
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:36,203
What's wrong?

279
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:40,603
Nothing, I just want to hug you.

280
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:47,403
I've been so busy at work lately,

281
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,043
so I didn't take care of you
and made you sick.

282
00:19:52,803 --> 00:19:54,403
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

283
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:59,963
No. You're busy at work
and still worried about me.

284
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,080
(Alarm: Reminder in 10 minutes)

285
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:11,483
Close your eyes.

286
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:14,283
Close your eyes now.

287
00:20:14,283 --> 00:20:15,283

Que, do you think I can be a designer?

313
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:44,643
Who told you not?
Your colleagues or leaders?

314
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:50,563
No, I'm just feeling a bit unsure.

315
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:57,203
Look at you, got scolded at work, right?

316
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:04,123
I've been there doing chores every day.

317
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,736
I haven't done
a single design task so far.

318
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:10,963
This isn't what I expected at all.

319
00:23:13,043 --> 00:23:16,163
It feels like I'm the only person
in the company who's redundant.

320
00:23:19,003 --> 00:23:23,003
Then someone like me who graduated
and couldn't find a job for months,

321
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:24,323
would I be considered redundant?

322
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:28,163
Of course not. You've been
working hard since high school,

323
00:23:28,163 --> 00:23:30,803
and even saved up enough for an apartment.
You're much better than me.

324
00:23:31,923 --> 00:23:34,643
But I've always admired
that you have a clear goal.

325
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:38,363
Look at me. I just want to make money.

326
00:23:38,363 --> 00:23:40,283
I don't even know what I want to do.

327
00:23:40,283 --> 00:23:43,323
But you are different.
You want to be a designer.

328
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:45,803
You've never wavered from this dream.

329
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:50,843
Not before, not now
and never will, right?

330
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:56,323
So, if you feel upset,

331
00:23:56,843 --> 00:24:01,043
uncomfortable, or unfair at work now,

332
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:04,443
aren't all these to help you
become a designer?

333
00:24:05,923 --> 00:24:10,363
Think about it. There'll be
posters of you with your name

334
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,043
and the furniture you designed
all over the shopping places.

335
00:24:14,723 --> 00:24:16,323
What you are doing now is for that day.

336
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:25,163
You're right. Thank you.

337
00:24:25,683 --> 00:24:28,763
Come on, just work hard

338
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:30,763
and become an outstanding designer.

339
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:33,283
Make all those big promises
you made come true.

340
00:24:33,283 --> 00:24:36,723
A large balcony, a large kitchen,
and a large living room.

341
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:41,323
Now I've lost my apartment
and I'm relying on you now.

342
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:44,083
It's my great pleasure.

343
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,443
Cheer up.

344
00:25:08,683 --> 00:25:10,043
What is this?

345
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:12,928
I met a distributor yesterday
and had a really good chat.

346
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:16,443
He said his company deals in
many household goods. Be careful.

347
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:18,203
And then he sent me these two big boxes,

348
00:25:18,203 --> 00:25:19,523
saying we could discuss collaboration.

349
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:22,723
What are all these?

350
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,443
It's all for baking
and looks pretty good.

351
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:31,723
But baking stuff
isn't easy to sell or show.

352
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:36,283
Don't sell them. Just keep them for me.

353
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:37,883
What do you want these for?

354
00:25:38,883 --> 00:25:42,163
These are good brands for making cakes.

355
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:46,123
Right, if you like them,
just take them all.

356
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:46,723
Thank you.

357
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:49,843
I'll ask him later
if there's anything else.

358
00:25:49,843 --> 00:25:50,592
Okay.

359
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,603
What are your plans today?
Don't you celebrate his birthday?

360
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:56,323
We've celebrated.
He is working overtime today.

361
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:59,003
We almost missed the celebration
because he was dining with the senior.

362
00:25:59,003 --> 00:26:02,123
What? A meal with the senior?
Why didn't you tell me?

363
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:05,483
Can't you just give me a chance
to hang out with him?

364
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:09,123
Do you still need it?
Don't you have his WeChat?

365
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:09,923
Contact him yourself.

366
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:12,043
I do have it.

367
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:15,363
I invited him out for a meal and drinks.

368
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:16,563
He said he's not available.

369
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,563
Does he have a girlfriend?

370
00:26:21,483 --> 00:26:22,123
I don't know.

371
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:24,843
Did you send a message to the senior?

372
00:26:25,523 --> 00:26:26,163
No.

373
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:29,363
Did he send you a message?

374
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:31,283
I don't know him that well.
Why would he?

375
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:34,923
The senior offered you
an interview opportunity,

376
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:36,883
so you should invite him for a meal.

377
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:38,443
I failed the interview.

378
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,363
How can you be like this?

379
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:43,483
He offered you a chance
for an interview.

380
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:46,003
Successful or not, he has helped you.

381
00:26:46,003 --> 00:26:47,723
You should be grateful.

382
00:26:47,723 --> 00:26:50,243
You can't ask him out, so you expect me
to make it for you, right?

383
00:26:51,763 --> 00:26:55,563
Sounds like you can ask him out.

384
00:26:56,163 --> 00:26:58,243
Let me tell you, I'm doing this for you.

385
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:02,803
It doesn't matter if you can't
ask him out. But at least you would try.

386
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,283
Save it.

387
00:27:07,163 --> 00:27:08,643
Just try.

388
00:27:08,643 --> 00:27:09,563
Not necessary.

389
00:27:10,243 --> 00:27:13,003
What's wrong with you?
Are you my bestie?

390
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:15,563
Just help me out.
You have a good reason,

391
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:18,123
and I've got nothing.
Come on, ask him out.

392
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:21,203
I-I-I'll do it.

393
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:28,283
(Thank you for referring an interview.
I'd like to treat you to a meal.)

394
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,403
(I wonder if you are free.)

395
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:32,643
He replied.

396
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:36,603
(Not at all,
but I have time for a meal.)

397
00:27:36,603 --> 00:27:38,643
Set up a time. I'll do it.
I'll set up the time.

398
00:27:45,083 --> 00:27:47,323
He agreed. Tonight.

399
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:48,523
Let's have a meal.

400
00:27:51,323 --> 00:27:54,563
Wait, why is he available
when you ask him?

401
00:27:57,856 --> 00:27:58,432
Can't believe it.

402
00:27:58,948 --> 00:28:00,224
(Finance Room)

403
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:07,003
First, align and paste properly.
Second, categorize clearly.

404
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,403
Why doesn't your team
seem to understand?

405
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:11,456
(Invoice)
What do you mean by this?

406
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:12,928
Asking me to do it for you?

407
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:18,963
I'm new here,
and I don't know how to paste this.

408
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,923
You are new here?
So what are you doing here?

409
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:25,803
And take a good look yourself.

410
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:28,123
This is the electronic invoice
your Team 3 submitted, right?

411
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,083
This format is wrong.
Can't figure out the paper ones,

412
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,443
neither the electronic ones?

413
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:35,243
You can't get reimbursed today.

414
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:39,443
Wait, I'll redo it.

415
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:40,683
Hurry up.

416
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:41,440
Okay.

417
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:57,603
Why do you look so happy
to see these things?

418
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,763
You should just sell cakes.
Why bother looking for a job?

419
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,843
I am out of money. Once I have money,
I'll definitely do it.

420
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:10,363
We can use these things

421
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:12,243
and make money in your live stream.

422
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:13,603
How?

423
00:29:15,643 --> 00:29:18,643
Now that we have tools and an oven.

424
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:20,803
Your livestreaming isn't popular now.

425
00:29:20,803 --> 00:29:23,243
We could just make some cakes
as free gifts for customers.

426
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,003
Good idea.

427
00:29:26,843 --> 00:29:28,763
But you haven't made cakes
for a while. Can you still do it?

428
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:32,563
What? I've spent
my high school days in the cafe.

429
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,643
My skills are as good as
those in bakery shops, okay?

430
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,123
If it weren't for my desire
to study a high-paying major in college,

431
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:40,203
I would have become
a professional barista or pastry chef.

432
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:44,363
Alright, you'd do it.
It's for free anyway.

433
00:29:44,363 --> 00:29:46,323
What?

434
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,483
Wait to eat the cakes then.

435
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:51,523
Okay, I'll have a taste.

437
00:30:00,323 --> 00:30:02,683
Where have you been?
Didn't you know we have a meeting?

438
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:07,123
The finance department
said the form is wrong.

439
00:30:07,123 --> 00:30:08,083
(Conference Room 3)
Go work in finance.

440
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:15,883
It's over now? That's quick.

441
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:18,883
Today's meeting didn't cover much.
We just checked the project catalog.

442
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,123
I have already recorded it.

443
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:22,323
I'll send it to you
to do the meeting minutes.

444
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:25,683
I didn't get any feedback after I sent
the minutes of the last meeting.

445
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:28,363
What do you expect? No feedback
means it was approved.

446
00:30:30,003 --> 00:30:30,683
Ordered the meals?

447
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:32,683
Yes.

448
00:30:32,683 --> 00:30:34,403
No worries, we didn't cover much
in today's meeting.

449
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:38,203
Okay. I'm just here
to take the meeting minutes.

450
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,363
You get back to work. I'll tidy up.

00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:03,723
Having a meal with a client.

455
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:05,923
Right, An Zhique asked us
for a meal tonight.

456
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:09,376
She told me,
but I might not be able to make it.

457
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,763
I have to work overtime.
You guys go eat.

458
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,683
If I can finish early,
I'll go to find you.

459
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:14,403
Okay.

460
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:19,243
Chucheng, here, flowers.

461
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:21,043
For you.

462
00:31:22,523 --> 00:31:24,963
The girls here don't receive
flowers every day like you do.

463
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:26,723
For you.

464
00:31:27,843 --> 00:31:30,003
I don't think it appropriate, Chucheng.

465
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:30,643
Come on.

466
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:50,683
I have two documents
to be delivered this afternoon.

467
00:31:50,683 --> 00:31:52,403
Take them to my office
as soon as you get them.

468
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,283
Okay, Ms. Han.

469
00:31:55,003 --> 00:31:56,203
Have you booked the private room?

470
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:58,603
Yes, for four people.
The wine and the car are ready.

471
00:32:00,123 --> 00:32:00,672
I'm leaving.

472
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:02,123
Ms. Han, take care.

473
00:32:07,443 --> 00:32:09,963
Qiqi, you can take it.
It matches the flowers.

Hello, senior.

Hello.

00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:57,923
Well, you two live together?

486
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:02,323
I'm staying at her place,
and I'm looking for a place.

487
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:05,363
Senior, what are we eating today?

488
00:33:06,043 --> 00:33:08,483
I've already made a reservation
for a nice restaurant. Let's go.

489
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:11,203
Let's go. He's so considerate.

490
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:12,843
Wait.

491

Oh my, this is so beautiful, senior.

492
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,483
With such a nice view,
this restaurant must be good.

493
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:37,763
Does it good?

494
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:38,803
Senior, does it good?

495
00:33:39,523 --> 00:33:40,128
Yes.

496
00:33:41,123 --> 00:33:43,803
This restaurant requires a reservation,
so I've booked three sets.

497
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:46,043
If there's anything you don't like,
we can change it.

498
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:47,323
I like everything. No need to change.

499
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:51,763
Would you like some wine?
The red wine is quite good.

500
00:33:54,003 --> 00:33:57,163
I don't drink,
but I'll join you for a glass today.

501
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:01,643

502
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:03,403
I have to go to the study room later.

503
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:06,443
I'm afraid I can't do my job.
I'll have some juice.

504
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:07,643
Sure, orange juice?

505
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:08,443
Sure.

506
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:09,843
Senior, we'd drink.

507
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:12,202
I have to drive.

508
00:34:12,202 --> 00:34:16,123
Call for a designated driver.
It's a nice place to drink red wine.

509
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:18,523
Alright. Waiter!

510
00:34:19,843 --> 00:34:23,163
Serve the dishes. Bring me the wine
I've previously stored.

511
00:34:23,163 --> 00:34:24,403
And one glass of juice.

512
00:34:24,403 --> 00:34:25,963
Okay, Mr. Jiang, please wait a moment.

513
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:26,752

Yes.

of Design Department Team 3)

522
00:35:02,923 --> 00:35:06,240
Huang Xiaolv, our leader asked me
to archive the design drawings. So how?

523
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:09,723
Just create a folder, categorize
and label them properly.

524

I'll send the drawings over now. I have
already sent the electronic version.

526
00:35:17,803 --> 00:35:20,203
But there are a few things
I need to revise and I'll be there.

527
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:20,803
I'm okay here.

528
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:21,643
I'll talk to you later.

529
00:35:41,283 --> 00:35:44,563
Sheng, sorry to bother.
I need to archive the design drawings.

530
00:35:44,563 --> 00:35:47,203
Are those from the RAR folder yesterday?
Any more today?

531
00:35:47,763 --> 00:35:50,483
I think so. They are dated,
so find them yourself.

532
00:35:52,963 --> 00:35:53,563
Okay.

533
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:13,643
Senior, do you like hip-hop music?

534
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:15,523
Like, the rap kind.

535
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,563
How about I rap a bit
for you right now? Come on.

536
00:36:22,123 --> 00:36:22,688
Right now?

537
00:36:23,443 --> 00:36:26,603
Freestyle. I can do it for you now.

538
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:28,283
Come on, beat the rhythm.
One, two, three, four.

539
00:36:28,283 --> 00:36:28,923
Keep it down.

540
00:36:28,923 --> 00:36:31,443
Okay, come on, senior.
One, two, three, four.

541
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:36,163
Get ready. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

542
00:36:36,163 --> 00:36:37,883
Grapes, wine, and glasses.

543
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:39,643
I drink all the wine the senior pours.

544
00:36:39,643 --> 00:36:41,283
Don't laugh at me if I get drunk.

545
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:42,923
I wish I could go back with you.

546
00:36:42,923 --> 00:36:44,723
Who has a crush on Chucheng?

547
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:47,683
You'd just come with me, come with me.

548
00:36:47,683 --> 00:36:48,843
Senior, was my rap good or not?

549
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:52,203
Come on, let's drink.
I'll finish this one.

550
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:52,723
Senior, don't.

551
00:36:52,723 --> 00:36:54,803
Come on, Que. I'm drinking this.

552
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:04,843
Comfortable.

553
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,403
(Whole Lease Information)

554
00:37:10,403 --> 00:37:11,683
Are you moving out?

555
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,603
I can't stay in your place forever.

556
00:37:14,603 --> 00:37:16,763
I didn't drive you out.

557
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,603
What? Without me,
could your place be so clean?

558
00:37:20,603 --> 00:37:22,843
Then don't do it. I'll hire a maid.

559
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:26,483
I have to rent a place
to live on my own.

560
00:37:26,483 --> 00:37:29,723
Why? There's no one else here.

561
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:31,243
Why do you have to move out?

562
00:37:32,243 --> 00:37:35,683
Guangpu, don't you date? Don't I date?

563
00:37:38,803 --> 00:37:40,923
All because of that woman,
An Zhique, right?

564
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:43,803
You just want to be with her, right?
You want to live with her, right?

565
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,803
What about me, your friend?

566
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:49,323
I rent my own place,
not living with her.

567
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:51,883
You want to live with her?

568
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:54,483
You have to get her dad's permission.

569
00:37:55,803 --> 00:37:58,083
I don't bring girls home.

570
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,683
Why don't you think about me?

571
00:37:59,683 --> 00:38:01,043
Have a place for me in your heart, okay?

572
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:03,883
Perfect. After I move out,
you can bring girls home.

573
00:38:05,563 --> 00:38:06,483
Do you have the money?

574
00:38:07,563 --> 00:38:09,563
My grandpa gave me some,
enough to rent a place.

575
00:38:10,963 --> 00:38:13,163
Fine, give me your phone.

576
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:15,083
What for?

577
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:19,483
You can't rent too far from me.
I'll give you a range.

578
00:38:19,483 --> 00:38:20,043
Go on.

579
00:38:20,043 --> 00:38:22,443
I know a lot about real estate.

580
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:24,203
Let me tell you, around here,

581
00:38:24,203 --> 00:38:25,723
you can rent this one.

582
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:26,603
I cannot afford a place like this.

583
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:36,923
Good, I didn't expect you to be late
after you've come for a few days.

584
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:40,883
The road where I live is under repair.

585
00:38:46,643 --> 00:38:48,803
Why are you young people
so fond of making excuses?

586
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,883
Making excuses when there's a problem.

587
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:55,763
No. It won't happen again.

588
00:38:56,963 --> 00:38:59,360
I would like to know
why I didn't receive the archived files

589
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,763
of the design drawings yesterday.
Come on, explain.

590
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:04,563
You didn't say
I had to send them to you.

591
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:07,243
Not finished yet, right?

592
00:39:08,043 --> 00:39:10,083
I don't know which design drawings are.

593
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:13,363
I asked Huang Xiaolv,
but she went to deliver materials.

594
00:39:13,883 --> 00:39:17,243
I didn't get the chance
to ask the rest of the team.

595
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:19,683
I thought I'd ask them
for details today.

596
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:22,483
Actually, I already have
the drawings organized.

597
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:25,763
But I don't know

598
00:39:27,523 --> 00:39:30,163
how to categorize them.

599
00:39:30,163 --> 00:39:32,443
So I plan to...

600
00:39:32,443 --> 00:39:33,003
Lin Tuo.

601
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:37,760
This is a company, not a kindergarten.

602
00:39:38,443 --> 00:39:41,163
No one has the time
or duty to teach you.

603
00:39:41,163 --> 00:39:43,203
People are here to work and make money,

604
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:46,563
to create profit for the company
and earn money for ourselves.

605
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:49,283
You can't avoid all troubles

606
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,643
by just saying you don't know.

607
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,603
You get paid
to solve the company's problems.

608
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:59,683
If you're not ready,
what are you doing here?

609
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:12,243
It's not that I'm not ready.
I'm here to be a designer.

610
00:40:13,923 --> 00:40:15,163
But all these days,

611
00:40:15,803 --> 00:40:18,643
I've been photocopying, pouring coffee,
booking meeting rooms,

612
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:23,123
taking meeting minutes, ordering meals,
making claim forms, and even cleaning.

613
00:40:23,803 --> 00:40:25,603
Is this the work of a designer?

614
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:28,403
You have meetings every day
with or without me.

615
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:30,603
Anyone can tell me
to do all kinds of chores.

616
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:34,283
I've been working really hard.
It's my first job,

617
00:40:34,283 --> 00:40:36,083
so I haven't had experience
with many things.

618
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:38,083
Can't I take some time to learn?

619
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:43,003
I applied for a designer position,
not to do logistical chores.

620
00:40:53,723 --> 00:40:54,963
Are you a designer?

621
00:40:58,843 --> 00:40:59,523
No.

622
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:03,003
Then why all the complaints?
Why all the long speech?

623
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,683
Are you suggesting that I failed
to recognize your talent?

624
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:08,483
Fine, come sit there.

625
00:41:13,603 --> 00:41:15,163
If you're not satisfied,

626
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:18,083
you can go out and set up your company,
be the CEO, be the boss.

627
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:19,763
Okay?

628
00:41:22,323 --> 00:41:23,403
I didn't mean that.

629
00:41:23,403 --> 00:41:24,163
Then what do you mean?

630
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:30,643
You can't do anything well.
You aim high but with puny abilities.

631
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,163
Still,

632
00:41:35,883 --> 00:41:38,363
get out now and do your job well
if you want to stay.

633
00:41:38,363 --> 00:41:42,363
If you can't, just leave.
Figure it out for yourself.

634
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:49,483
I'm sorry.

635
00:42:18,683 --> 00:42:19,323
Do you smoke?

636
00:42:21,523 --> 00:42:22,123
No.

637
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:24,403
Got scolded?

638
00:42:28,203 --> 00:42:32,723
Do you know how many
resumes Ji Jia gets a day?

639
00:42:36,523 --> 00:42:40,963
We've got over 1300
in the design department alone.

640
00:42:42,083 --> 00:42:43,243
And we hired only three.

641
00:42:44,683 --> 00:42:49,803
You're the only one
who just graduated with no experience

642
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:53,803
and no history of studying abroad.
Do you know why?

643
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:57,483
I don't know.

644
00:42:58,723 --> 00:42:59,603
I didn't choose you,

645
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,243
but Wei Haiyang.
