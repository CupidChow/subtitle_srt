(The most painful thing is
that patients will)

(gradually lose their mobility

(The cost of care is very high.)

20
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,620

(HW Cafe)

27
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,660
I'll get it. It's so heavy.
Are you running away from home?

28
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,780
No way.

29
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,140
Que, this is from your dad.

30
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,340
He gave this to me just now.

31
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,540
He told you to take care of yourself
and not to exhaust yourself.

32
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,260
Is he downstairs?

33
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,340
He left after giving me this.

34
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,220
Hello, the number you have dialed
is powered off.

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
What's the matter?

36
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,180
What's the matter?

37
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,980
I told my dad I wanted
to take care of Lin Tuo in his house.

38
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,620
Doesn't your dad agree?

39
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,220
My dad wouldn't let me out

40
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,780
or bring me the things
if he doesn't agree.

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,020
He is not that kind of person.

42
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,020
He feels pity for Lin Tuo.

43
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,248
This big box is filled with
nutritional supplements.

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,496
Bao, come and help me put this inside.

00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,060
You two go ahead with your things.
Go ahead.

46
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,260
Your dad doesn't agree you
to come over, right?

47
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,220
If that's the case,
he would not buy these things.

48
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:47,380
Then why doesn't he answer your call?

49
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,300
He's driving, so can't answer the call.

50
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,416
Don't overthink it.

51
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:54,620
Don't you know my dad?

52
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,420
He's afraid
I couldn't take good care of you.

53
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I still put all of you in trouble.

54
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,460
If I were the one who got sick,
would you come and take care of me?

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,880
Would you come
if your parents wouldn't agree?

56
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,540
Yes.

57
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,980
Then it's okay.

58
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,220
The water is here. He Xindi,
I have been waiting for you.

59
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,100
Thank you, He Xindi.

60
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
What for? Are you serious?

61
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,020
Yes. What's the matter?

62
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,980
Don't you men like being taken care of?

63
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,900
What do you mean?

64
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,820
Cut the crap.

65
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,620
Tell me if Lin Tuo is going to
be paralyzed or not.

66
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,780
If yes, someone has to take care of him.

67
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,420
How much does it cost
to hire a free caretaker?

68
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,180
Now Que is there.
You don't need to pay her

69
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,380
or worry about her taking care of Tuo.

70
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,020
She is like a free caretaker now.

71
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,340
Well, He Xindi. Let me ask you.

72
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,936
First, is An Zhique
Lin Tuo's girlfriend?

73
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,380
Second, does Lin Tuo
treat An Zhique well?

74
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,860
Of course.

75
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,220
Everything's fine before he gets sick.

76
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,420
What's the point?

77
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,580
If Lin Tuo doesn't treat Que well,

78
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,180
could Que be with him?

79
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,140
It's so different.

80
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,820
Well...

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,300
You men are selfish.

82
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,260
If it were you,

83
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,340
could you do the same?

84
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,180
He Xindi,
can you stop thinking this way?

85
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,380
Let me tell you, He Xindi.

86
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,940
If you got sick,

87
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,656
I assure you I wouldn't leave you.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,660
Absolutely. I can do it.

89
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,140
I-I...

90
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,072

Are you cursing me to be sick?

91
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,940
You! What have I done to you?
Why do you hate me so much?

92
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,860
Are you nuts?

93
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,500
Is this the point?

94
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,752
What's wrong with you?
Can't we talk properly?

95
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:57,340
You're the one who's wrong.
I don't want to talk to you properly.

96
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,180
You just now...

97
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:58,980
You just go home.

98
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,380
Wait, where are you going?

99
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,140
None of your business.

100
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,740

105
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,740
Yes, I just called.

You can call me Que.

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,460
Are you familiar
with the situation here?

109
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,340
Yes.

110
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,220
We are not exclusively for ALS patients.

111
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,860
We also take in some patients
who are paralyzed

112
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,140
and some who cannot
take care of themselves.

113
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,780
Our main job here is
to provide them with nursing care

114
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,540

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,260

117
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,300
and apply for the intern caregiver.

118

Let's talk about food first.

129
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,580
The bedridden patients
require a diet high in calories,

130
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,060
protein and vitamins.

Come on, be careful.

134
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,100
Sit down.

135
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,660
Uncle, please sit.

136
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,580
Okay.

137
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,300
Uncle, have some water.

138
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,180
I can do it myself.

139
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:40,180
I thought about everything
when you broke up with Que,

140
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,900
except for this.

141
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,420
I didn't expect it either.

142
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,064
Uncle, I didn't mean
to keep it from you.

143
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,900
Breakup really hurts Que.

144
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,584
Tuo.

145
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,916
You know that Que's mom
passed away early on, right?

146
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,340
I know.

147
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,660
It's cancer.

148
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,552
Que was only four years old
when her mom passed away.

149
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,140
She knew nothing.

150
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,300
She even thought her mom
had gone to work out of town.

151
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,580
I used to take taxis during the day
and live in the hospital at night.

152
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,620
For three and a half years.
You may not believe this.

153
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,300
I took a shower once a month
and I really smelled.

154
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,500
In the last year,
I couldn't even drive the taxi anymore.

155
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,976
Because I fell asleep
while waiting for the traffic signal,

156
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:00,620
I feared causing an accident.

157
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,660
I lost over 15 kg
in those three and a half years.

158
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,860
Others might think
I was the one who got sick.

159
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:20,220
It was about both physical
and mental exhaustion.

160
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,100
I felt lost and hopeless.

161
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,820
I am not superstitious.

162
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:33,980
But during that time, whenever I saw
a temple, I would go and burn incense.

163
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,936
I would go kowtow and pray.

164
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,696
I wanted

165
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,196
someone could help me
to drive her mom's illness away.

166
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,220
I hoped someone to help me.

167
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,780
But it was useless.
Her mom passed away anyway.

168
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,340
All those years of carrying
her mom to go around,

169
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,220
this arm of mine got worn out.

170
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,980
You might not even know.
I can't even lift my arm.

171
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,260
If I want to lift my arm...

172
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,220
That's why I never wanted
to go to the hospital.

173
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,700
Because the smell of the hospital
reminds me of

174
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,460
those three and a half years.
Though I want to forget it, I can't.

175
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:30,820
Now, once I close my eyes,

176
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,280
those scenes come to me
just like a movie.

177
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,740
So you don't want Que to be like this.

178
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,780
I don't. I really don't.

179
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,180
It's a torture to live those days.

180
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,380
Tuo, I'm not being selfish.

181
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,180
And I like you, you're like a son to me.

182
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,024
But I'm a dad.

183
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:09,540
Sometimes I wish
I could just take over for Que.

184
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,300
I've suffered before,

185
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,072
so it doesn't matter
if I suffer a few more years.

186
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:18,500
But I really don't want
my daughter to suffer too.

187
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,780
C-Can you understand me?

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,208
Yes.

189
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:31,616
If I have a choice,

190
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,780
the last person
I want to be a burden to is Que.

191
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,416
My love to Que is not less than you.

192
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,540
I know.

193
00:13:54,048 --> 00:13:59,232
Actually, I came here today
to beg you to let...

194
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,820
But I-I'm really struggling with this.

195
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,220
I don't want my daughter to suffer.

196
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,740
But I feel sorry for you
if she leaves you.

197
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:25,740
To be honest,
when Que told me about your matter,

198
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,340
I tried to stop her, but failed.

199
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,180
I know my daughter well.

200
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,980
She's just stubborn.

201
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,940
This might be fate.

202
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,232
When her mom got sick,
I was told to give up,

203
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,140
even relatives told me so.

204
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,540
But I never give up.

205
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,140
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

206
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:02,496
we have to go all out for it.

207
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,016
So, Tuo, strong will is
what one should have.

208
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,220
An Zhique has the strong will.

209
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:16,128
I hope you do too.

210
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:19,680
The two of you need to pull together
and move forward together.

211
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,752
Since you can't change it, just face it.

212
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,420
I want to tell you.

213
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:37,280
For the sake of my daughter
and her strong will to you,

214
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:42,820
you should stick with it, okay?

215
00:15:48,736 --> 00:15:53,184
Uncle, rest assured, I will.

216
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,100
Good.

217
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:23,328
Excuse me. Clear the elevator.

218
00:16:23,328 --> 00:16:25,180
He was fine just now,
but what's wrong with him now?

219
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,020
Make way.

220
00:16:50,144 --> 00:16:53,060
Hello, Ye. Where are you?

221
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,540
Y-Ye.

222
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:29,940
What's wrong?

223
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,140
Nothing. I just played soccer

224
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,380
- before...
- You're still lying.

225
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,380
You're in a wheelchair
and still lying to me.

226
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,140
Ye.

227
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,340
When did this happen?

228
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,260
Two months ago.

229
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,900
Mom and Dad know it, right?

230
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,420
Just keeping it from me
and treating me like a child.

231
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,780
I don't deserve to know your affairs?

232
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,300
You don't tell me anything
about the family anyway.

233
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,260
Mom and Dad treat me this way,
and so do you.

234
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,860
No, Ye.

235
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,980
You said to stand by my side
no matter what,

236
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,180
and tell me to trust you.

237
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:23,300
But what now? Have you ever trusted me?
Do you even consider me your brother?

238
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,180
Ye, I don't want to affect you.

239
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,848
Enough. You all are acting like this.

240
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,260
You'll do what you want,

241
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,100
and never consider me.
I am just superfluous.

242
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,540
If I hadn't come today,

243
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,808
I didn't even know
my brother is already disabled.

244
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,660
Are you going to spend the night here?

245
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,980
Not your business.

246
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,230
So whose business is it?

247
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,030
Your brother is sick now,
so stop being willful.

248
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,030
Why didn't you tell me?

249
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,630
I just found out too.

250
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,470
Your brother didn't tell anyone.
We just found it out.

251
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,750
He's diagnosed for over half a year.

252
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,750
He got slapped by your dad for you,

253
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,430
saved the money for you
as living expenses,

254
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,990
and sent you to school with a smile.

255
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,870
What else do you want from him?

256
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,870
I hate it when he's like this,

257
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,790
carrying everything
on his own like a savior.

258
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,070
Why didn't he tell us
about his illness? Why?

259
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,750
Because he loves us.

260
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,270
If he could carry it himself
until the end,

261
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,990
he definitely wouldn't tell anyone.

262
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:58,270
But this disease will take years,
so he can't carry it himself anymore.

263
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,470
It hurts him more when all of us know.

264
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,190
Because we have to watch him weaken,

265
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,790
and none of us can save him.

266
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,390
You can't save him
if you know everything.

267
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,230

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,750

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:00,990

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,350
Off you go.

359
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,910
Okay, okay.

360
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,350
You'd hold him, and I'll go over there.

361
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:08,800
Come on.

362
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,470
Okay, I'll clear the way.

363
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:21,190
Lift it up. Give it a try.

364
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,190
Left foot to go forward and backward,
and right foot to go side by side.

365
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,070
- Gently.
- Be careful.

366
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,470
- Be careful.
- Watch out.

367
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,550
This is...

368
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,510
- What's this?
- Go backward.

369
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,270
It's quite handy.

370
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,928
Back off.

371
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,390
- Turn.
- Make a turn.

372
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,030
It's good.

373
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,310
- This is so convenient.
- I wondered how he would go to work.

374
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,030
Someone must be pushing him.

375
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,470
Well, it's settled then.

376
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,110
How much is it?

377
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,848
Don't worry about the money.
My dad gave it to him.

378
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,190
Then thank your dad for me.

379
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,750
We're so close, no need to mention it.

380
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,990
Ye, you can even
do the grocery shopping now.

381
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,830
He's really grown up now.

382
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,550
I've always been a grown up man.

383
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,150
Brother, a new wheelchair?

384
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,430
Guangpu bought it for me.

385
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,990
Stop studying the new wheelchair.

386
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:21,150
Go and make some food for us.

387
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,790
The noodles I've made recently
are really delicious.

388
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,230
You could try later.

389
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,350
You didn't even close the door
when you came in.

390
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,670
I'll make more introductions.

391
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,910
You might have already noticed.

392
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,550
Tomatoes...

393
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,430
- Tomatoes...
- Carrot...

394
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,230
Use both hands and feet.

395
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,110
Make a turn.

396
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,950
You familiarize yourself
with the foot controls.

397
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,510
Do we raise rabbits at home?

398
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,110
My brother loves carrots.

399
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,270
Right, give some assistance.

400
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,310
It's kind of like

401
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,390
a manual and automatic
integrated system.

402
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,990
Come on, grab my finger.

403
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,910
Not bad, quite strong.

404
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,790
How about this leg?

405
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,950
I can feel it.

406
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,110
Let me try.

407
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,230
How about this?

408
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,710
Yes.

409
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,270
Nice, both legs are good.

410
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,830
But I still can't walk.

411
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,310
We have a fancy wheelchair now.

412
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,590
It is so comfortable
to sit in a wheelchair. Why walk?

413
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,070
I just learned a new massage technique.

414
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,510
Physician No.1 at your service.

415
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,430
Is it comfortable?

416
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,790
Nice. Thank you, Physician No.1.

417
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,270
Give me a good rating.

418
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,110
Que.

419
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,950
I have something to say.

420
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,110
Go ahead.

421
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,430
Actually, I've been
staying at home all this time

422
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,390
trying to get used to wheelchair.

423
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,910
I think I'm getting used to it.

424
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,710
I know. You want
to go back to work, right?

425
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,270
Why do you know what's in my mind?

426
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,470
Otherwise,
how could I be your girlfriend?

427
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,830
What do you think? Is it okay?

428
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,470
Of course it's okay.

429
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:33,630
Yesterday the senior and the Leader
came to my shop.

430
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,950
I've mentioned this to them.

431
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,590
So what did they say?

432
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,790
They agree,
then I will definitely agree too.

433
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:43,630
We are trying to live a normal life now.

434
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,790
We don't resist getting sick.

435
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,630
But I think we need to be open

436
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,710
and honest about this.

437
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,470
We have to compete fairly
for the job opportunity,

438
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,510
making everyone believe that we can.

439
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,710
I agree.

440
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,830
Come on, I'll give you a massage.

441
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:13,190
Leader.

442
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,710
Leader.

443
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,550
Finally back.

444
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,870
Let's go up.

445
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,920
(Vice President)

446
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,150
Qian Hong.

447
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,710
Lin Tuo.

448
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,536
Ms. Qian.

449
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,670
Your director attended the board meeting
for the first time for you.

450
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,110
He never bothered to attend
these old man meetings.

451
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,190
Say something useful.

452
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,710
Isn't it useful? I must explain
the causes and consequences.

453
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:50,910
I am a partner, and I'm supposed
to be in the board meeting.

454
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,070
It's just that
what they consider important

455
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,790
is different from what I think.

456
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,990
Lin Tuo, no more sentimental words.

457
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,390
Haiyang has already

458
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,750
made your situation very clear
to us at the board meeting.

459
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,150
We have struggled for so many years,

460
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,390
always believing in a principle.

461
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,310
That is one must have
some warmth in this cruel world.

462
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,030
Once you join in the Ji Jia,
you are one of us.

463
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,230
You've worked for Ji Jia,
and we will not treat you unfairly.

464
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,310
So, the board has unanimously agreed

465
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:27,390
that you continue to work for Ji Jia.

466
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,030
All positions in Ji Jia are open to you.

467
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,070
You can still make money
even you're sick.

468
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,270
You can still go far
sitting in a wheelchair.

469
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,230
Grow up, boy. Don't cry.

470
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,030
The salary definitely won't
be as high as before.

471
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,390
You'll be charged for being late
and leaving early. Do you agree?

472
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,310
No problem.

473
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,710
You have a long way to go.

474
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,670
You're the youngest designer in Ji Jia.

475
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,430
We are so proud of you.

476
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,910
First, I would like to thank you.

477
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,710
Thank you for being here today.

478
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:23,350
I would like to take up some time
to explain something to you.

479
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,710
And I hope you can understand.

480
00:32:49,252 --> 00:32:50,528
(What kind of disease is ALS?)

481
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,030
Leader, well...

482
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,550
Hello, I am Lin Tuo from Design Team 3.

483
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,950
As you can see, I'm in a wheelchair.

484
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,750
It wasn't an arm injury.

485
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,070
Instead, I was diagnosed
with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,

486
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,430
which is commonly known as ALS.

487
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,430
Do you know about it?

488
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,830
I don't know.

489
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,110
There will be more and more jobs
for which I am not qualified.

490
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,990
So I hope you can have
some knowledge of my disease.

491
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,790
This is a disease
where the muscles gradually atrophy.

492
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:00,870
My right hand is weak now,
and I can't lift my right arm.

493
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,190
I still have feeling in my legs,
but I can't walk normally.

494
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:12,190
Next, the muscles on my left side
will gradually become immobile as well.

495
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:15,589
My whole body will
gradually enter a rigid state,

496
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,750
just like being frozen.

497
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,630
I will end up with a breathing disorder.

498
00:34:22,549 --> 00:34:26,016
It's a disease where freedom
is taken away little by little.

499
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,270
Of course,
it wouldn't happen all at once.

500
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,029
It might take several years.

501
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:39,430
But so far,
there has been no successful cure.

502
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,488
After I got sick,

503
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,430
the first person I told
was my leader, Wei Haiyang.

504
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,190
He encouraged me and helped me
realize my dream of being a designer.

505
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,270
He helped me find other opportunities
when I can't draw anymore.

506
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,790
Even a lot of people misunderstood him,

507
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,750
but he never gave up on me.

508
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,950
And my family,
my loved one, and my friends.

509
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,110
They all gave me
the greatest support and courage.

510
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,390
So I do not want
to end my life just like this.

511
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,110
I want to do something I am capable of

512
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,630
while I still could in Ji Jia.

513
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:38,910
I want to fulfill
this little dream with you.

514
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:44,470
I hope you can give me
this opportunity. Thank you.

515
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,030
Keep going, Lin Tuo.
Everything will be fine.

516
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,830
Keep going.

517
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,870
Lin Tuo, keep going.

518
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,070
The information for Yaoshi
is basically all here.

519
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,630
Make a proposal
that satisfies the clients' needs.

520
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,150
I'm sure you could do it.

521
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,990
Lv, ask Lin Tuo to do some chores.

522
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,550
Proofread the materials
or categorize the graphics.

523
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,230
Alright, Leader.

524
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,048
Okay.

525
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,270
You weren't in your office.

526
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,190
What's wrong?

527
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,550
I heard Lin Tuo needs to be lifted
to commute to and from work.

528
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,552
There are only two boys in your team.

529
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:09,950
We have many boys in my team.
Let's take turns.

530
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,510
What's wrong? Don't you want it?

531
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,150
Thank you.

532
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:29,310
Not at all. Don't fight me
for clients in the future.

533
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,590
In the future,
you pick the clients first.

534
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,990
