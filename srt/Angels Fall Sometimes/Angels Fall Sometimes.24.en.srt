Tuo.

15
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,880
It's just a flowerpot that fell.
Don't worry.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
That pot of roses. What a pity.

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,720
Flowers bloom and will eventually fall.

18
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,960
Yes. Otherwise,
they're not even qualified to fall.

19
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,120
We are lying here.

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,240
Aren't we also waiting for the day
we can say goodbye?

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,320
Tuo, have you ever despaired?

22
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,120
Yes, many times.

23
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,720
When I first knew I was sick,

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,240
I didn't want
to accept it or tell anyone.

25
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
So many times I tried to sleep it off

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,800
and end it all.

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
And then my grandpa passed away.

28
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,760
I felt like my life was empty.

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,160
So close to death,

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
I felt nothing is meaningful.

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,320
At that time, I really couldn't hold on.

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,120
I tried to commit suicide six times.

33
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:36,720
I don't know if I was lucky or not.

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,800
I got saved every time.
It's just that close.

35
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,960
That man saved me three times.

36
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Every time I woke up, I could see
his face streaming with tears.

37
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,080
Do you hate him?

38
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,640
Yes. Hating him is the only way

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,920
I can stop thinking about
how wonderful we were.

40
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,480
So he can live a good life.

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,560
I can't let him spend
his whole life on me.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
But it's hard to hate someone.

43
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,240
You can't even have a proper farewell.

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,720
We can only live our lives with regrets.

Once Ye returns,
I can finally have a meal at home.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,720
The food in our school canteen
is terrible.

52
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,200
I miss our mom's cooking so much.

53
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
You used to complain my cooking.

54
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,760
I didn't cherish it before.

55
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,920
Come on, let's start. Try this fish.

56
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,640
Que's dad taught me how to make it.

57
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,240
Then I must try it. Here I go.

58
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,560
This is much tastier than
what my dad makes.

59
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,240
Really?

60
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,840
Exactly.

61
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Right. I came back here
to tell you something important.

62
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,600
I have applied to the school
to drop out after this semester.

63
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Why?

64
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,088
I want to get in the medical school.

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,320
It's my own decision.

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,280
I want to go to medical school
to study neurology,

67
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
and be a doctor in the future.

68
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,760
Not just for my brother,

69
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,640
but also
for those desperate ALS patients.

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,280
I hope you can support me.

71
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,320
I'm sure I can get in.

72
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,320
You are making decisions
on your own again.

73
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,760
Thought it through?

74
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,560
If you really want to do it,
I support you.

75
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
I support you too.

76
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,920
Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dad.

77
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,760
I used to be too bossy,

78
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,120
always forcing you and your brother
to get in the medical school.

79
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,240
Do you know why?

80
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,960
Because our Lin family has been
doctors for three generations.

81
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,400
We've always been known as Dr. Lin.

82
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,560
So I've always had an obsession.

83
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,440
I don't want the honor
of our Lin family to end.

84
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
That's why I've been pushing you guys

85
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,080
to get in medical school,

86
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,280
completely disregarding your feelings,

87
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,120
or considering you
also have your own dreams.

88
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Dreams are dreams. Dad.

89
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,000
Our Lin family will be doctors
for four generations.

90
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,320
I will be the next Dr. Lin.

91
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
Little Dr. Lin. Come on. Eat up.

92
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,440
I've forgiven Xing Kai.

93
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,360
Really. I no longer blame him.

94
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
He was sad when he left.

95
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,520
He must have loved you so much.

96
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,200
I believe it. But love ultimately
can't fight against reality.

97
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,720
Nothing can fight against reality.

98
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,400
But right now we're alive.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,600
Being alive is also reality.

100
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,000
I really envy you.

101
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
Not just you and Que,
but also Guangpu and Xindi.

102
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,280
I've thought a lot these days.

103
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,480
Pushing away Xing Kai
is not only reality, but also me.

104
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,760
I wouldn't be like this

105
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
if I was half as strong as you.

106
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,200
I'm not strong at all. I just trust Que.

107
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,920
I keep telling myself

108
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,040
that I can't blame Que
if she wants to quit one day.

109
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,880
Can you?

110
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,680
Actually, blaming someone
is just wanting him to stay.

111
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,720
I would blame her
because I don't want her to go.

112
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,360
Of course I hope she doesn't leave.

113
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,800
But I want her to be happy and carefree,

114
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,760
living life without any burdens.

115
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,040
This is what I really want.

116
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,760
Here.

117
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,600
Tuo, the sun is nice today.
Let's get some sun.

118
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Going on a trip?

119
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
Tuo's birthday is coming up.

120
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
I want to take him on a trip.

121
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,840
Where to?

122
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,840
Not somewhere particularly far.

123
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,880
It's just somewhere
with a better scenery.

124
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
Just the two of you?

125
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,120
Your uncle and I can go too.
We can take care of you.

126
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,880
No, Guangpu and Xindi would go along.

127
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,960
Let them go. Let the kids go.

128
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,560
Why do we go with them?

129
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,520
No. If something happens, we can help.

130
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,160
She just said they won't go too far.

131
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,400
If anything happens,

132
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,800
the two of us can
still go there to help, right?

133
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,280
Auntie, I will go and confirm
Tuo's condition with Director Zhou.

134
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,040
Go ahead. Tuo has been
in the hospital for so long.

135
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,960
It's good for him to go out.

136
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,720
Besides, you have been
with him all the time

137
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,440
and never left.

138
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,080
I'm ashamed of myself as his mom.

139
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,720
Thank you for your hard work, Que.

140
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,080
Auntie, not at all.
Tuo is the one who works hardest.

141
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,840
Does it look good?

142
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,840
Yes.

143
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,640
Come on, let's put on the scarf.

144
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,000
Is it that cold?

145
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,200
It will get cold in a while.

146
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
Where's Guangpu?

147
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,120
He Xindi, let me tell you.
Men's love for women

148
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,320
has always been reflected
in details and things.

149
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,240
I swear to heavens.

150
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,880
I'm loyal to my marriage
and my wife, He Xindi.

151
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,960
Even if someone tries to shoot you,

152
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,800
it must have penetrated my chest first.

153
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,480
What do you mean?

154
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,840
- Wait.
- Then

155
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,560
I'll be killed, huh?

156
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,200
I mean, I really do love you.

157
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,800
I really do love you.

158
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
Even if such things
happen in the future,

159
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,960
I will definitely
make you witness a miracle.

160
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,960
A miracle. Just watch, okay?

161
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Honey, wait for me.

162
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,504
Let's go. Do you understand me?

163
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:10,040
I understand.

164
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,720
Do you understand?

165
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,080
So do you want
to wear long johns or not?

166
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,760
Not anymore.

167
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
I'll take you somewhere
better than here.

168
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,640
Okay.

169
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,552
Be careful.

(Chunjiang Station)
(Shuanglin Station, Sanjiang Station)

171
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,520
Is this a train station?

172
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,280
This is an abandoned station
called Chunjiang Station.

173
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,599
You take me all the way out here

174
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,319
to see an abandoned station?

175
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,920
Tuo, do you still
remember the day we met?

176
00:17:32,032 --> 00:17:38,976
Of course. Your phone rang
when we were in the interview.

177
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,400
Yes, I was so shocked.

178
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,880
Then you suddenly stood up.

179
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,400
I thought I took that blame,

180
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,560
then you could continue your interview.

181
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,040
But then you ran out as well.

182
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,440
And both of us were out.

183
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,960
If I hadn't run out,
how could I find a boyfriend?

184
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,104
In fact, when you stood up,

185
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,680
I recognized you right away.

186
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,400
Isn't that the boy

187
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,280
who came to my store to buy my dumplings
that I couldn't sell?

188
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,480
Who would have thought
that this boy helped me twice?

189
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,080
This must be fate.

190
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Yes. I said to treat you,

191
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,280
but you paid for the meal.

192
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,680
I remember everything
you said to me that day.

193
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,000
You said you were very envious
of your classmates from Snow Country.

194
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,520
You've never seen snow before
and you really want to see it.

195
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,040
Tuo, I'll give you a snow as your gift.

No. Chen Guangpu,
are you still wearing long johns?

276
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,504
It's so cold here in the mountains,
it might even snow.

277
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,600
If we can live like this,

278
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,200
see the sunrise
when we wake up in the morning,

279
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,560
and sit by the fire here,
watching the stars at night,

280
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,800
it's pretty good.

281
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,400
Yes.

282
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,160
Que.

283
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,168
If one day,

284
00:26:37,156 --> 00:26:39,876
I have to get a tracheotomy.

285
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,680
What do you want me to choose?

286
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,280
Whatever you want.

287
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,840
Because you're the only one
who can choose.

288
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,600
My duty is to respect your choice
and stand up for your rights.

289
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,120
I dread that day.

290
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,120
Me too.

291
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,440
Not only that day,
but also dread many things.

292
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,280
I am afraid you'd leave me,
my dad would leave me,

293
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,040
people around me would leave me.

294
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,360
But what can we do?

295
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,800
We all have to leave each other
and say goodbye to this world.

296
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,880
You and I aren't the only ones
who are upset.

297
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,080
You are right.

298
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,240
Dread changes nothing

299
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,640
or solves nothing.

300
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,200
Having such a disease
makes us unfortunate.

301
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,520
But there are a lot of
unfortunate people in this world.

302
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,960
Is everyone going
to despair and give up?

303
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,640
There are still many people in the world

304
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
who insist on living bravely.

305
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:32,000
You are the one who made me brave

306
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,120
and live on.

307
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,080
Because you're the one
who gave me courage.

308
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,120
Tuo, let's not dread, okay?

309
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,360
Let's live our lives well
and be together now.

310
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Even if one day you'd leave me,

311
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,320
I will carry on living
with the love you give me.

312
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,280
We will always meet again.

313
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,200
It'll be a new life
when we meet each other again.

314
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,320

315
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,200
This snow is a gift from the heaven.

Good afternoon, teachers and students.

319
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,560
My name is Lin Tuo.

320
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,200
The topic of my speech today is

321
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,480
The Time of My Existence.

322
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,760
I am a patient
with an incurable disease.

323
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,480
The medical term for my disease is

324
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,680
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,

325
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:21,280
commonly known as ALS.

326
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,800
I started losing my right hand

327
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,160
and gradually my whole body.

328
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,320
Later on,

329
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:46,280
I will remain conscious

330
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,320
until respiratory failure

331
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,720
and death.

332
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,360
I'm not the strongest one,

333
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,720
but I am the luckiest one.

334
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,360
In this darkest diseases,

335
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,120
I felt all the love

336
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,720
and kindness in the world.

337
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,080
My family, my parents,

338
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,400
lover, friends,

339
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,520
have created this miracle for me.

340
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,560
My dad is an excellent heart surgeon.

341
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,560
He has saved many lives.

342
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,080
My mom is a head nurse.

343
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,000
She has worked in
emergency services for over 20 years.

344
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,280
My parents gave up their jobs
after I fell ill.

345
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,280
My dad is now busy every day

346
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,760
in ALS drug development
and patient care.

347
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,280
My mom trains caregivers and families
at a rehabilitation nursing home.

348
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,960
They didn't relax for a moment,
just like before.

349
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
My best friends

350
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,800
have become ambassadors of love for ALS,

351
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,640
helping ALS patients
in every way possible.

352
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,560
Uncle Guo established a patient group,

353
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,920
using his simplicity and perseverance
to unite the helpless patients.

354
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,560
Mr. Gao Feng used all his savings

355
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,880
to establish the Jianyu Mutual Fund,

356
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,520
which attracts many neurology experts.

357
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,640
Led by Professor Zhou Fumeng,

358
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,000
a collaborative group dedicated
to the study ALS was formed.

359

and my senior Jiang Chucheng.

360
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,960
The two designers
have worked hard to create

361
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,159
more suitable beds
and smart wheelchairs for ALS patients.

362
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,880
They're all doing miracles
for this incurable disease.

363
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,920
Life will eventually come to an end.

364
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:36,120
Whether it be long or short,

365
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,712
we can't live meaninglessly.

366
00:34:43,712 --> 00:34:45,444
(Jiang Chucheng, Design Director)

367
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,400
As long as we are alive,

368
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,280
there are people to love and be loved.

369
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:04,448
This love will live on for us.

370
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,240
Not being forgotten by the ones you love

371
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,840
is the reason to live on.

372
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,360
The last part of my speech

373
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:47,600
is dedicated to my lover, An Zhique.

374
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,840
Because of you,

375
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,400
I saw the light in the darkness.

376
00:36:04,772 --> 00:36:06,564
Meeting you

377
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:12,680
is the luckiest thing in my life.

378
00:36:17,604 --> 00:36:18,852
I know

379
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:25,560
love cannot fight against death.

380
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,680
But if there is still time,

381
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,560
I'll always be there for you.

I can help you sell dumplings.

390
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,040
We're graduating tomorrow.

391
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,280
We will leave here, and then grow up.

392
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,840
You don't have to grow up,
just stay with me.

393
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,280
I'll protect you, so you can be a child.

394
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,640
I'll buy all your lollipops from now on.

395

396
