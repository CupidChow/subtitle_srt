I'd like some new perspectives.

182
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:04,595
Lin Tuo, you've been here for a while.

183
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:08,755
It's your first time in this meeting.
What do you think?

184
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:14,635
It's pretty cool.

185
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:20,675
We want your ideas, not comments.

186
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:23,155
Tell us the pros and cons.

187
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:42,515
Wei Haiyang, have you been
intimidating him?

188
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:44,235
He's too scared to talk.

189
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:50,555
Go ahead. Aren't you quite eloquent?

190
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:56,675
Alright, then I'll express my opinion.

191
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:01,155
This series features a special design

192
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,635
that adopts a light luxury style

193
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:06,955
with European court elements.
It's gorgeous and vintage.

194
00:12:07,595 --> 00:12:12,035
But it's too complicated
and takes up too much space.

195
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,915
It's not practical.
So there will be wasted raw material.

196
00:12:14,915 --> 00:12:17,395
The cost may multiply because of that.

197
00:12:18,835 --> 00:12:22,795
Plus, such a design
suits big houses better.

198
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:24,835
It sets the bar high for the buyers.

199
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:44,875
That's just my point of view.

200
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:46,715
Sit.

201
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,835
Alright. Good.

202
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:57,235
I agree.

203
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:01,355
We want honest opinions
throughout the conference.

204
00:13:03,195 --> 00:13:04,315
Who's next?

205
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,355
Come on, that's not your report.

206
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:19,155
You're fine.
Just pay attention to your diet.

207
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:22,115
I scheduled your next appointment here.

208
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,195
Come whenever you feel something wrong.

209
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,235
Okay.

210
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,955
Doctor.

211
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:31,835
My dad doesn't sleep well.
He has sleep apnea.

212
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,355
Sometimes.

213
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:37,035
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

214
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,675
Measure your blood pressure every day.

215
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:42,675
Okay, that's it for today. Dismiss.

216
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,315
Junyi, come with me.

217
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:03,275
Mr. Wei.

218
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,595
Please express yourself next time.

219
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,755
Don't make the kid
who's on probation do it for you.

220
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:19,235
What a great apprentice.

221
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:34,515
Well, you're really bold.

222
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:43,995
He's your junior?

223
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:47,435
You recommended him here?

224
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:48,256
Yeah.

225
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:53,075
You picked a good one.

226
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,395
He's new and doesn't know how to speak.

227
00:14:57,555 --> 00:14:59,035
You won't be mad at him, right?

228
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,835
Do I look so petty to you?

229
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:02,715
Of course not.

230
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:18,675
Come in.

231
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:24,555
Yes?

232
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:32,915
I'd like to apologize.
I didn't mean to cause trouble.

233
00:15:34,915 --> 00:15:37,115
What's done is done.
Why bother apologizing?

234
00:15:38,795 --> 00:15:43,395
I didn't expect that
Ms. Han would blame it on you.

235
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:44,595
I...

236
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,675
They believe
I put you to say that, anyway.

237
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,315
I took the blame. Why are you upset?

238
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,715
I'm not upset. I can apologize to her.

239
00:15:54,955 --> 00:16:00,115
Don't cause me trouble, okay?
Get back to work.

240
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:15,904
(Being unique
is the only way to stand out)

241
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,915
(Senior, did I offend Ms. Han?)

242
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:35,995
(Don't be paranoid.
I'm meeting a client. Talk later.)

243
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,315
Bad news. Ms. Han's design was rejected.

244
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:43,435
I just heard from them.

245
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:10,075
Is it that bad?

246
00:17:11,315 --> 00:17:13,035
It may be worse than imagined.

247
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:15,994
I don't think I'll make it
through the probation.

248
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,954
It may even end early.

249
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:20,994
They're kicking you out just because

250
00:17:20,994 --> 00:17:22,555
you criticized their design?

251
00:17:25,035 --> 00:17:28,755
I asked HR. The directors get to rate
my performance during the probation.

252
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:32,875
You're not on her team.
Why does she get to rate you?

253
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,875
She's a director, after all.
She's got the power.

254
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,555
If she insists that I'm no good,

255
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,955
will Mr. Wei stand up for me?

256
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:46,515
Who's going to
offend a colleague for a newcomer?

257
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:53,155
I've been working so hard.

258
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:57,075
There's finally hope. Now I'm doomed.

259
00:17:57,715 --> 00:18:01,275
What's wrong with me?
Why would I say that?

260
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:04,435
Why can't you speak the truth?

261
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:06,915
It's so bad to hear the truth, huh?

262
00:18:07,435 --> 00:18:09,915
Such a person can be a director?

263
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:11,355
Well, she is a director.

264
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:15,435
Fine, whatever.

265
00:18:15,435 --> 00:18:17,835
If they really fire you
for something like that,

266
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,635
there's no point in staying there.

267
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:28,355
Do you think I can be a proper designer?

268
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:33,280
Do you think a designer

269
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,515
should lie to flatter others?

270
00:18:42,115 --> 00:18:46,355
They say that
the workplace is vile. Now I get it.

271
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,435
It's not all about working hard.

272
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,915
What is done is done.

273
00:18:51,915 --> 00:18:53,955
We did nothing wrong.

274
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:56,715
Just be casual like nothing happened.

275
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,995
If they fire you, get another job.

276
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:02,155
Chongqing is full of design companies.

277
00:19:02,155 --> 00:19:04,355
Do we have to work there?

278
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:06,515
I can always sell cakes and support you.

279
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:10,875
Thank you, Madam.

280
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,675
Come on. Let's go.

281
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:15,235
All problems can be solved
with the hot pot.

282
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:17,835
If not, try again.

283
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,784
(Turn the tide. Be blessed.)

284
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:35,635
You drank all night?

285
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:40,675
I didn't drink much. We went to
the KTV and then had breakfast.

286
00:19:41,635 --> 00:19:42,675
All you do is play.

287
00:19:44,035 --> 00:19:45,715
Where are you going? Working overtime?

288
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,795
What for? I'm getting fired.

289
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:53,275
Because of
what happened yesterday? Chill.

290
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,995
Just get her a gift.
She's a middle-aged lady.

291
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,595
Get her some pricy creams or tonics.

292
00:20:00,595 --> 00:20:02,235
She can't be mean to you.

293
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:05,115
Save it. Wash up and sleep.

294
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:06,275
Where are you going?

295
00:20:07,155 --> 00:20:08,515
I'll see some apartments.

296
00:20:08,515 --> 00:20:11,395
What's the rush?
Aren't you getting fired?

297
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:14,235
Not yet. See you.

298
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:20,275
Look, I'll show you three apartments.

299
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:22,675
All of them are studios.

300
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:27,035
One of them has just been renovated
and is being rented for the first time.

301
00:20:27,035 --> 00:20:30,075
Under one condition.
The landlord wants a six-month payment.

302
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:33,875
Six-month?

303
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:38,555
Let's see it first and discuss it later.

304
00:20:38,555 --> 00:20:42,155
All three of them are fine.
Everything is ready.

305
00:20:42,155 --> 00:20:44,475
It's perfect for couples like you.

306
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,435
I live nearby. He'll be living alone.

307
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:50,435
That's even better.

308
00:20:50,435 --> 00:20:52,715
The king-size bed will be super cozy.

309
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:54,235
Let's take a look.

310
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:55,915
- Let's go.
- Okay.

311
00:20:55,915 --> 00:20:56,704
Let's go.

312
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:11,035
It was too dark inside.
We need the light on

313
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,515
during the day.

314
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:18,275
Miss, apartments with great sunshine
are costly in Chongqing.

315
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,995
It's hard to find something like that
with your budget.

316
00:21:22,635 --> 00:21:25,355
But it's okay. Let's try the next one.

317
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:28,555
That one is much brighter
and it's nearby.

318
00:21:29,515 --> 00:21:31,675
Shall we just visit the renovated one?

319
00:21:33,155 --> 00:21:33,955
Let's see both.

320
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,755
- Yeah.
- Okay.

321
00:21:35,755 --> 00:21:41,875
You could use some options. This way.

322
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,435
Come on in.

323
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:52,555
Here's the kitchen,
the living room and the balcony.

324
00:21:53,235 --> 00:21:54,595
And here's the bedroom.

325
00:21:54,595 --> 00:21:55,515
Take a look inside.

326
00:21:56,075 --> 00:21:57,875
Here's the bathroom.

327
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:02,035
It's quite big.

328
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,235
This is the bedroom.

329
00:22:11,795 --> 00:22:13,915
The renovation looks nice.

330
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,875
It's well-designed and very neat.

331
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:17,555
This is not bad.

332
00:22:18,355 --> 00:22:20,275
And it's much brighter.

333
00:22:21,835 --> 00:22:24,275
I'd say this one is the best.

334
00:22:24,275 --> 00:22:27,035
We have people visiting
in the next few days.

335
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:30,275
This place will get rented in no time.

336
00:22:31,595 --> 00:22:35,195
It's a fine place,
but the six-month payment is too much.

337
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:38,515
How about a three-month payment
with a one-month deposit?

338
00:22:38,515 --> 00:22:41,315
We're not leaving in just a year.

339
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:44,275
So you want it, right?

340
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:45,875
This place is fine.

341
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:49,195
Okay, let me talk to the landlord.

342
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,755
May I ask what you do for a living?

343
00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:54,635
I work in a design company.

344
00:22:55,195 --> 00:22:57,675
A designer? Impressive.

345
00:22:58,755 --> 00:23:00,635
And your girlfriend is...

346
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:03,835
I'm...

347
00:23:03,835 --> 00:23:04,795
She's a researcher,

348
00:23:06,995 --> 00:23:11,115
working on sustainable development
of human bioenergy.

349
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:17,075
T-That's impressive.

350
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:21,155
We're getting this one.

351
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,475
Alright, I'll contact the landlord.

352
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:27,395
You can pay the deposit if it's settled.

353
00:23:28,355 --> 00:23:29,115
- Okay.
- Okay.

354
00:23:29,115 --> 00:23:31,115
Look around. I'll contact the landlord.

355
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:31,995
Thank you.

356
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:32,544
No problem.

357
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:37,555
I make dumplings. "Human bioenergy"?

358
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,795
We have to eat
and obtain energy, don't we?

359
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:40,915
You're full of nonsense.

360
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:43,555
- Another one.
- Smells nice.

361
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:47,715
Take me with you
when you're looking for houses.

362
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:49,955
Otherwise, they may scam you
because you're young.

363
00:23:50,515 --> 00:23:52,235
I'll check the contracts

364
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:53,475
and title deeds for you.

365
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,995
Uncle, those are licensed agencies.

366
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:58,435
Some of them may be frauds,

367
00:23:58,435 --> 00:24:01,435
trying to...
Oh no, the soup is coming out.

368
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,035
When are you moving?

369
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:06,315
If they accept a three-month payment,

370
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:07,515
I can move right away.

371
00:24:08,195 --> 00:24:09,875
You'd better run away from Chen Guangpu.

372
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,315
Have you tried the cookies?

373
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:12,835
Yeah.

374
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:13,755
Are they nice?

375
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:15,115
Of course.

376
00:24:15,115 --> 00:24:17,995
We should start a pastry.
We'll be loaded.

377
00:24:18,795 --> 00:24:21,515
Save it. I'm completely broke.

378
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:22,955
I don't know what to do with that house.

379
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:26,795
Just wait. The whole complex
is not going to disappear.

380
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,315
Listen, once someone takes over,

381
00:24:29,315 --> 00:24:31,755
you'll get the apartment
and pay the mortgage.

382
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:33,395
Be grateful. Isn't it easier when you

383
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:34,635
don't have a mortgage?

384
00:24:34,635 --> 00:24:35,835
Weird logic.

385
00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:36,515
You know I'm right.

386
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:42,595
Leave it. It's bad for digestion.

387
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:43,475
It's okay.

388
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:44,955
That's me. Who is it?

389
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:48,995
Tomorrow morning? Okay.

390
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:52,355
Contract. ID. Hukou registration.

391
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:54,235
Yeah, I got them.

392
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,155
Alright, thank you so much.

393
00:24:56,155 --> 00:24:56,995
What's wrong?

394
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:00,115
Dad, the real estate company called.

395
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,675
A company took over the complex

396
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:05,315
to build serviced apartments.
We can get our money back.

397
00:25:05,315 --> 00:25:05,915
We can?

398
00:25:05,915 --> 00:25:06,995
- Really?
- Yeah.

399
00:25:06,995 --> 00:25:08,315
That's great!

400
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:08,955
That's great.

401
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:10,715
I thought there was no hope.

402
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,875
And they suddenly called us.

403
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,955
You brought luck by just mentioning it.

404
00:25:14,955 --> 00:25:15,955
I should talk more.

405
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:17,395
Wait, wait.

406
00:25:17,395 --> 00:25:19,715
They're giving us cash, right?

407
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:20,715
Yeah.

408
00:25:20,715 --> 00:25:23,195
But someone took over the complex.

409
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:24,875
Should we just keep the house?

410
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,715
No, Godfather. It's unbuilt.

411
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:27,915
Who knows what's going to happen?

412
00:25:28,435 --> 00:25:30,035
Get the money back.

413
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:31,955
You can get a ready-built house.

414
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,235
Get the money back first.

415
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:36,075
Yeah, get the money at hand.

416
00:25:36,075 --> 00:25:37,875
Yeah, get the cash.

417
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:40,355
Que, I'll go with you tomorrow.

418
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:43,515
No need. You have work. I can go alone.

419
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:44,755
I'll call you if I need you.

420
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:48,835
Alright, this is great news.

421
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:51,035
Shall we celebrate a bit?

422
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,315
- Want a drink?
- Come on.

423
00:25:52,315 --> 00:25:54,915
Don't encourage him. It's not allowed.

424
00:25:54,915 --> 00:25:56,635
Fine. Just dig in.

425
00:25:57,475 --> 00:26:01,115
Uncle, let's toast with soup.
It's just the same.

426
00:26:01,115 --> 00:26:02,195
- Yeah.
- Godfather, cheers.

427
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:03,315
Cheers.

428
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,835
Cheers.

429
00:26:05,635 --> 00:26:06,304
Cheers.

430
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:20,035
You scared me. What's wrong?

431
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:21,995
There's a new restaurant.

432
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:24,915
They offer a discount and free drinks.
Let's order together.

433
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:26,755
Alright, then.

434
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:29,235
Why are you so nervous?

435
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:33,835
I'm so scared that
someone may get me to their offices.

436
00:26:35,155 --> 00:26:36,915
You're scared you'd be fired?

437
00:26:37,475 --> 00:26:39,595
I won't even make it
through the probation.

438
00:26:39,595 --> 00:26:41,835
But you have to.

439
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:44,155
Then you can get
compensation for being fired.

440
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:47,035
Actually, the probation period
is only three months.

441
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:48,555
It's six months on rare occasions.

442
00:26:48,555 --> 00:26:50,995
Three months? So it's almost due.

443
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:52,355
Yeah, that's right.

444
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,235
I'm just about to rent a place.

445
00:26:58,355 --> 00:27:01,595
Don't be so pessimistic.
Nobody's telling you to leave yet.

446
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:03,195
You're safe as long as
Mr. Wei wants you.

447
00:27:04,875 --> 00:27:06,395
Does he though?

448
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:10,115
He hasn't told you to leave yet.

449
00:27:10,635 --> 00:27:13,555
Anyway, stay quiet
and work harder. Who knows?

450
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,195
Which restaurant? Lunch is on me.

451
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:27,915
I got the money back. Guess how much.

452
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:28,595
How much?

453
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:30,035
Eight hundred grand!

454
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:32,195
I feel so rich now!

455
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,035
Keep it down, silly.

456
00:27:34,035 --> 00:27:36,555
I'm not silly. I have 800 grand.

457
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:39,835
I thought we were doomed
and we couldn't get the money back.

458
00:27:39,835 --> 00:27:42,675
Now that I have the money,
it's like winning the lottery.

459
00:27:42,675 --> 00:27:44,355
It's your money in the first place.

460
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:46,315
You actually lost the interest.

461
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,235
I don't care.
It feels like winning a lottery.

462
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,915
I wired you the surgery fee.

463
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:51,995
No need.

464
00:27:51,995 --> 00:27:55,355
I have to give you my dad's surgery fee.

465
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:56,595
You can pay for my surgery.

466
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:59,195
Nonsense. There is no surgery.

467
00:27:59,835 --> 00:28:01,555
The rich lady is taking you to lunch.

468
00:28:02,475 --> 00:28:03,795
I already had lunch.

469
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:05,395
So early?

470
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:09,875
Huang Xiaolv wanted to
order takeout so I joined her.

471
00:28:10,595 --> 00:28:11,595
You did?

472
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:13,715
It was my treat.

473
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,395
You're already buying her lunch?

474
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:21,795
She's the only one who speaks to me now.

475
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:23,555
We're brothers in hardship.

476
00:28:24,275 --> 00:28:26,595
Right, the agency called me.

477
00:28:26,595 --> 00:28:29,475
The landlord agreed.
I can sign the contract and move in.

478
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:31,275
Alright, let's sign the contract.

479
00:28:31,275 --> 00:28:33,675
After that, we can get some furniture.

480
00:28:33,675 --> 00:28:37,395
Alright, you already
sound like a rich person.

481
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,195
That's right.

482
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,235
So generous.

483
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:50,315
Like a bosslady.

484
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:51,595
This way please.

485
00:28:51,595 --> 00:28:52,555
Wave the flag.

486
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:53,155
This way.

487
00:28:53,155 --> 00:28:54,875
Come here. Be seated.

488
00:28:55,755 --> 00:28:58,195
Make yourself at home. Don't be shy.

489
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:05,355
Get whatever you want.
Pile up the plates.

490
00:29:06,195 --> 00:29:07,040
Here.

491
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,955
We know that you got your money back.
But you're acting like

492
00:29:10,955 --> 00:29:12,315
you suddenly got rich.

493
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:16,795
Que, will you join me for investment?

494
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:20,555
That's the only way to make big money.

495
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:22,715
It's not a good deal
to get interest from a bank.

496
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:25,435
Your stocks and funds are glowing green.

497
00:29:25,435 --> 00:29:27,195
We don't have the money for that.

498
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:27,755
My...

499
00:29:27,755 --> 00:29:30,715
It suits him on the head. So green.

500
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:36,315
Don't pretend that you're better
when you get drunk, crying every day.

501
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:36,955
I...

502
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,555
Keep drinking.

503
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:41,915
Place the order. The drink is ending.

504
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:45,195
I have to move some things
to the new apartment.

505
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:45,875
Already?

506
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:47,915
Tonight?

507
00:29:47,915 --> 00:29:48,675
We signed the contract.

508
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:53,315
Don't you have a conscience?
For this woman...

509
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:54,115
What about it?

510
00:29:54,115 --> 00:29:55,395
- What about it?
- What about it?

511
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:56,835
What about it?

512
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:02,115
Get everything.

513
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:03,155
This. Sliced beef.

514
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,675
Get anything you like.

515
00:30:04,675 --> 00:30:07,835
My parents came. They're almost home.

516
00:30:07,835 --> 00:30:08,635
Are you going to eat?

517
00:30:08,635 --> 00:30:11,155
Of course not. I have to pack up.

518
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:12,435
My things are there.

519
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,195
I'll pack up my trash.

520
00:30:14,195 --> 00:30:15,155
What trash?

521
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:17,475
We'll wait for you. Hurry.

522
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:18,955
Let's eat.

523
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:19,875
Place the order.

524
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:20,635
Tripes.

525
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:21,275
Yes.

526
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:41,595
Mom, Dad, why did you come?

527
00:30:42,195 --> 00:30:45,355
Why didn't you tell me?
I could have picked you up.

528
00:30:46,035 --> 00:30:48,955
If we had told you,

529
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:51,315
how would we find out
about your brilliant lifestyle?

530
00:30:52,595 --> 00:30:53,355
W-What?

531
00:30:53,915 --> 00:30:56,955
Son, you like wearing this?

532
00:30:56,955 --> 00:31:02,315
No, Mom. It's Lin Tuo's.

533
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:04,075
Remember Lin Tuo? You've met him.

534
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:07,555
He's taller than me. Very handsome.

535
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,915
He got his girlfriend
a birthday gift and left it here.

536
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:14,675
Chen Guangpu,
you're a grown-up and a graduate.

537
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:16,515
Stop messing around!

538
00:31:17,435 --> 00:31:20,075
Your mom and I work hard to make money.

539
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:21,315
And you're messing around?

540
00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:24,355
Who do you think you are?

541
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:29,955
What's this? Yuetian Entertainment?

542
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:32,635
You're visiting that kind of place?

543
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:35,035
No, Dad. It's just an ordinary KTV,

544
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:36,755
not the ones you visit.

545
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:37,355
What?

546
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:43,435
Mom, it's just an ordinary KTV.
That's where we go. Both of us.

547
00:31:43,435 --> 00:31:44,915
It's like a restaurant, right?

548
00:31:44,915 --> 00:31:48,475
Yeah, KTV. I only go to Zhao's.

549
00:31:48,475 --> 00:31:49,435
You know him, right?

550
00:31:49,435 --> 00:31:54,075
Like father, like son.
You're just the same.

551
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:57,195
I'll get back to you.

552
00:31:58,715 --> 00:32:01,315
Just you wait. Step aside.

553
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:05,195
Honey.

554
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,515
High pressure 149 mmHg.

555
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:17,795
Low pressure 102 mmHg.

556
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:20,475
Pulse. Eighty-two per minute.

557
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:22,555
Why is it a bit high today?

558
00:32:23,195 --> 00:32:24,595
Did you skip the pills?

559
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:26,035
I didn't sleep well.

560
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:29,595
Dad, I've been thinking about the house.

561
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:32,515
The money we have

562
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:36,355
can only cover the down payment
of something in the suburbs.

563
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,955
So we can look for second-hand houses.

564
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:43,955
I've been waiting to talk to you.

565
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:47,635
I kind of changed my mind about it.

566
00:32:48,315 --> 00:32:51,715
What's wrong? You got scared
because of what had happened?

567
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:55,435
Not really. I've been thinking.

568
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:59,875
You're working so hard to get money.

569
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,555
And I'm working nonstop.

570
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:04,595
I don't mind living frugally.

571
00:33:04,595 --> 00:33:06,555
But my pretty and sweet girl

572
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:09,075
can barely afford some nice clothes.

573
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:10,955
I see how He Xindi is dressed.

574
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:14,675
It makes me upset to see you
in such plain clothes.

575
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:17,395
It didn't even cross my mind.

576
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:21,915
Seriously. Dad is not a money-maker.

577
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:23,715
Look at me.

578
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:27,435
And Lin paid for my surgery, right?

579
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:35,235
I just don't want you to do odd jobs,

580
00:33:35,235 --> 00:33:39,475
make dumplings, or suffer

581
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:42,395
just for some petty money.

582
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,315
I'm not suffering.

583
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:47,075
That's it. I've made up my mind.

584
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:52,035
We're not going to get a loan again.

585
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:55,955
Right? And you're a lady now.

586
00:33:55,955 --> 00:33:59,315
You'll get married
with Lin sooner or later, right?

587
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:02,235
You'll move out once you get married.

588
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:04,355
You'll have your own place.

589
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:06,995
I can't live in a giant house by myself.

590
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:10,635
Dad, I just can't let you
live in an old house

591
00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:11,514
without an elevator.

592
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:17,435
We're on the second floor.
Why do we need an elevator?

593
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:20,195
Besides, I may have some minor problems,

594
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:23,155
but I can easily climb
12 floors, let alone two.

595
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:24,355
Besides, climbing stairs

596
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,315
is a great exercise for me.

597
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,435
Come on, I know you're a sweet girl.

598
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:36,435
But listen to me, okay?

599
00:34:37,915 --> 00:34:42,155
We've been saving up for quite a while.

600
00:34:43,034 --> 00:34:45,395
It's time to plan for your future.

601
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:50,395
I can't possibly use so much money.

602
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:53,755
Don't you want to open a store

603
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:56,355
to sell coffee and cakes?

604
00:34:57,435 --> 00:35:00,155
Are you telling me to open a store?

605
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:03,635
Do it. It can be your career.

606
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,315
Isn't it trendy? Start your business.

607
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:08,875
And you like it. Isn't that wonderful?

608
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:11,115
What if I lose money?

609
00:35:12,475 --> 00:35:16,555
Then we'll save up again.

610
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:19,035
It's not like we can't make money.

611
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:25,435
Miss An Zhique.

612
00:35:25,435 --> 00:35:27,755
Even an old man like me is not scared.

613
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:30,555
Why are you scared?

614
00:35:30,555 --> 00:35:33,675
Young people must be ambitious.

615
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:37,715
You've got to have
that kind of spirit and determination.

616
00:35:37,715 --> 00:35:39,395
Otherwise, you won't make it.

617
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:43,315
Besides, who says you'll lose money?

618
00:35:44,195 --> 00:35:46,595
You're An Zhique, my daughter.

619
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:49,635
You're pretty, smart, and a money-maker.

620
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:52,795
You know, we may become super rich.

621
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:56,235
We won't be looking for apartments.

622
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:57,475
We'd go for villas.

623
00:35:58,275 --> 00:36:00,075
And we'll make a lump sum payment.

624
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,235
The bank is not going to
get any interest.

625
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:06,155
With one store, we'll get a villa.

626
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:07,360
If you open ten stores,

627
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,075
imagine the extravagant life
I'm going to live.

628
00:36:11,075 --> 00:36:11,795
Come on. Chill.

629
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,675
Extravagant.

630
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:15,635
Let me make it work first.

631
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:23,520
(Conference Room 3)

632
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:31,355
Hey, Lin Tuo.

633
00:36:32,475 --> 00:36:34,595
Bo, w-what's wrong?

634
00:36:35,115 --> 00:36:38,515
Don't be nervous. It's good news.
You're made an employee. Go to the HR.

635
00:36:39,835 --> 00:36:40,435
I am?

636
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:42,595
I'm employed?

637
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:47,195
Yeah, I have the signatures.
Come to me for the paperwork.

638
00:36:51,515 --> 00:36:52,635
Thank you.

639
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:07,035
Come in.

640
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:15,235
Thanks, Leader.

641
00:37:18,275 --> 00:37:19,072
Why?

642
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:21,235
I'm officially hired.

643
00:37:21,235 --> 00:37:22,016
(Lin Tuo)

644
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:23,595
Oh yeah?

645
00:37:25,715 --> 00:37:27,355
I thought you wouldn't sign.

646
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:30,115
Because you offended someone?

647
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:35,395
How do you become a designer
if you dare not

648
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:37,075
speak your mind?

649
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,795
Do your job as an official employee.

650
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:44,355
Make some proposals for the next month.

651
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:48,480
Okay.

652
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,075
What are you waiting for?

653
00:37:56,075 --> 00:37:57,555
A glass of champagne?

654
00:37:58,395 --> 00:38:01,955
No, thank you, Leader.
I'll get back to work.

655
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,115

Okay.

697
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,280
(Plan One)

698
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:20,155
I prepared four plans this time,

699
00:40:20,155 --> 00:40:22,475
targeting different apartments,

700
00:40:22,475 --> 00:40:25,675
focusing on living rooms,
bedrooms, dining rooms,

701
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:28,355
and balconies.
Let's start with the living room.

702
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:29,515
Here's my first plan.

703
00:40:30,115 --> 00:40:33,315
Here, I adopted a Chinese style.

704
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:35,555
Why would you do that?

705
00:40:35,555 --> 00:40:37,635
My career is picking up
and you're leaving?

706
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:40,995
We have so many orders for the pastries.

707
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:42,275
Why open a physical store?

708
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,755
You know how pricy it is
with the rent and employees?

709
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,035
It's going to be costly.

710
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:48,235
Why don't you invest in me
and work with me?

711
00:40:48,235 --> 00:40:52,195
Look at me. Do I look like a streamer?

712
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:55,195
That's what you like. I don't like it.

713
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:57,955
We're just making money.
It doesn't matter.

714
00:40:58,995 --> 00:41:01,475
Yeah, I did want to make money.

715
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:04,395
I wanted to pay the mortgage
and renovate the apartment.

716
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,675
But now I want to make money

717
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:08,475
by doing something I like.

718
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:09,875
Look at Lin Tuo.

719
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:14,355
He decided
to be a designer as a freshman.

720
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:17,760
And it hasn't changed
after all these years. Isn't that cool?

721
00:41:19,488 --> 00:41:21,675
What a sudden change.
Aren't you going to get by?

722
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:24,515
I changed my mind, okay?

723
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,355
How about this? Let's do it together.

724
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,395
Find a place and open your cafe.

725
00:41:33,395 --> 00:41:36,075
Spare me some space
as my livestream studio.

726
00:41:36,075 --> 00:41:37,555
We can share the rent.

727
00:41:37,555 --> 00:41:41,595
And we can help each other out.
It's a win-win.

728
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:43,475
Alright, we'll count on ourselves.

729
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:44,795
Make money.

730
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,395
Build a career.

731
00:41:47,235 --> 00:41:48,035
So deal?

732
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:48,755
