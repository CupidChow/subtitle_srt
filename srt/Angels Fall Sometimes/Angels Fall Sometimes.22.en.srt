What is the first thing?

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,740
To be a designer.

What about the second one?

like a prince marrying a princess,
holy and magnificent.

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,740
But today I don't think that matters.

157
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,820
and we have discussed his condition.

159
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:27,060
that he hopes we can follow up
on the ALS drug project.

160
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,780
It's just that we currently
lack actual patient cases.

161
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,900
In researching the causes of ALS
and new drug development,

162
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,780
we lack case samples.

163
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
If it's possible,

164
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,500
I'd love to be a part of this team.

165
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,580
That's great. I'll show you around.

166
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,660
This chat group is full of patients
and their family members.

167
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,500
It was supposed to be a platform

168
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,780
for pep talk or treatment experiences.

169
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,980
And it can serve to transfer
breathing machines or sputum aspirators.

170
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,860
Now we need to collect cases,

171
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,820
so we need a lot of help from patients.

172
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,940
I do have a suggestion.

173
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,860
Go ahead.

174
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,220
I studied Internet Big Data Analysis
in college.

175
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,520
The most effective way

176
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,048
is to build a big data platform,

177
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,520
like developing WeChat mini programs
and making some scales.

178
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,600
Then we'd ask the patients
to fill in all their questions

179
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,280
on the scale.

180
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,720
So that we can get the information
that is timely and accurate.

181
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,760
This is really convenient,
saving us time to ask them one by one.

182
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,680
That doesn't build scale.

183
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,000
But this task requires
someone professional.

184
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,680
I can do it.

185
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,720
You can't do this alone.
It takes a team.

186
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,840
But a team requires funding.

187
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,240
Funding is the biggest problem now.

188
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,760
I have a piece of information.

189
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,280
There's an entrepreneur
who also had this disease.

190
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,560
Maybe we could approach him.

191
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Who is it?

192
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,360
Dr. Lin, sorry. Mr. Gao is a bit busy.

193
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,280
Please wait a moment.

194
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,040
Okay.

195
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,680
I don't have time on this project.

196
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,080
You work out a solution
and then report back to me.

197
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,720
Okay. That's it.
I'll come over Sunday afternoon.

198
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
You are quite busy.

199
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,760
Take a seat.

(Beitong Group)

201
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,960
Alright, Xu. You go get busy.

202
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,680
Okay.

203
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,400
My right hand
is a bit difficult to move now.

204
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,560
I'm having a hard time
holding a glass these few days.

205
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,840
W-Why do you still have a full schedule?

206
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,560
I have no choice. There's a lot of work
to do at the company.

207
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,479
Director Zhou asks me to hospitalize.

208
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,560
I'm afraid if I hospitalize,
I might not be discharged.

209
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,840
You have to get
as much rest as possible.

210
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,600
I've heard about your son.

211
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,320
He's not in good state,
and has already been hospitalized.

212
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,880
He had an episode
just a couple of days ago.

213
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,720
He's so young. It must break your heart.

214
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,080
I didn't even dare
to tell my mom about my illness.

215
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,880
She's 86. I'm afraid she can't take it.

216
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,120
Enough with the sad stuff.

217
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Dr. Lin, you came to me today
to talk about the big data scale, right?

218
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,960
Yes, here is the proposal.
Please take a look.

219
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,200
It's about the procedures
for the data acquisition platform

220
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,200
and the fund establishment.

221
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:26,920
(Closed)

222
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,400
This matter helped me
figure out what I should do next.

223
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I'm sure a lot of people will say,
"What are you guys?"

224
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,000
"Do you really think
you can conquer ALS?"

225
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,280
But I think
what the senior said is right.

226
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,400
We should at least try.

227
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,960
Even if it is only a little progress,
it is still a progress and hope.

228
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,560
Previously, Dr. Wu also said
that there was a pair of parents abroad

229
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,000
whose kid got this disease.
After they tried everything,

230
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,680
finally they really developed a drug.

231
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
I'm not sure what we will achieve.

232
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,440
But I want to try.

233
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,840
Right. Human makes miracles.

234
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,320
A hundred years ago, we couldn't have
imagined such high technology today.

235
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,160
I have confidence.

236
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,720
W-What have you done to be so confident?

237
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,880
With your educational level,

238
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,000
you have confidence in your career,
but your career doesn't.

239
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,800
Chen Guangpu, what do you mean?

240
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,264
But I have confidence in you
because you are my wife.

241
00:19:27,264 --> 00:19:27,920
Really?

242
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,680
This is what I think about this matter.

243
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,920
If there's no trouble, we go forward.

244
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,960
If there are troubles, we overcome them
and keep going forward.

245
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,480
What? You even couldn't find your bed.

246
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,400
I-It's to solve this problem.

247
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,680
But I have a problem now.

248
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,680
I may not be able to focus on HW.

249
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm here. HW has me.

250
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,120
Que, that's what we wanted
to talk to you about today.

251
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,440
HW has Bao, I, and Chen Guangpu,
so you don't need to worry.

252
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,880
Chen Guangpu and I will
take care of the rent and utilities.

253
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,600
The HW's monthly income is for you,

254
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,960
except for Bao's salary.

255
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,320
I can reduce my salary.

256
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,840
No. As long as you work hard,
your salary won't be reduced.

257
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,320
T-Then I'll take money for nothing?

258
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,160
What do you mean?

259
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,560
Our livestreaming needs a place.

260
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,200
Without HW, we have
to go out and rent a place.

261
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,640
It makes no difference.

262
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Exactly. We don't discuss with you,

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
but just to inform you.
It's settled then.

264
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,840
You just go do your great cause.

265
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,280
We three will take good care of HW,
make money and support you.

266
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,152
Consider it a contribution
to the great cause.

267
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:37,720
Exactly.

268
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,440
We want to be great too.

269
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,560
Right.

270
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,760
I never thought
I'd do such a great thing,

271
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,720
I feel so proud of myself now.

272
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,640
Don't be too proud.

273
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,400
I thank you for Lin Tuo.

274
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,800
And I thank you for other ALS patients.

I know I'm being sentimental.

276
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,800
But I really mean it.
Thank you, thank you.

- Not at all.

284
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,720
I've had a lot of meetings
and made a lot of important decisions.

285
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,320
But it never occurred to me

286
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,520
that meetings would involve my life.

287
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,552

until the doctor declared my condition.

290
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,760
It was as if death had come to me.

291
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,760
The doctor told me to rest,
hospitalize and get treatment.

292
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,960
But I refused all these because I knew
I didn't have much time left.

293
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,600
I have so many things to do.

294
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,600
Later, Dr. Lin found me.

295
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
He gave me hope again.

296
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,400
He told me that he has given up his life

297
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,880
to save his child.

298
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,160
He told me that if there is no hope,
we should make hope.

299

If one year is not enough,
then we'll make it ten.

it will save many more lives.

306

What a patient wants most
is to be surrounded by his family.

Uncle Guo, what's wrong?

310
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,560
A patient was deteriorating so fast
that he had to get tracheotomy,

311
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,316
but he's given up.

312

He's given up?

313
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,000
Once someone has a tracheotomy,
his life is basically over.

314

So some choose to do it,
but others refuse.

There really aren't many people
who can stay by the patients.

00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,280
It's good, Uncle Guo.

354
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,280
I will sing more for you another day.

355
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,600
Okay, Uncle Guo.

356

Uncle Guo, it's 10 o'clock.
Time to get up for rehab.

and some savings to Dong Dong.)

He has helped everyone in this group.)

(This group will not disband.)

369
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,040
(I will continue to serve everyone
with Uncle Guo's spirit.)

370
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
(May Uncle Guo rest in peace.
From Lin Tuo.)

She used to be a ballet dancer,

378
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,680
but diagnosed this disease
when she's about to get married.

379
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,680
Her fiance took care of her
for a year and then broke up.

380
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,160
She is a loner
and does not like to talk to others.

381
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,000
She has a personal caregiver
taking care of her.

382
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,440
No wonder she looks so elegant.

383
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,200
A ballet dancer must find it hard
to accept being in a wheelchair.

Are you a caregiver here?

391
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,080
No. I am a family of a patient here.

00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,360
The guy in the bed next to you,
he is my boyfriend.

393
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,960
Boyfriend?
You've been taking care of him?

394
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,880
Not really. There are other people.

395
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,440
I really envy he has a nice girlfriend.

396
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,400
Were you living
on the third floor before?

397
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,680
Uncle Guo saved me before.

398
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,000
I wouldn't be here
if he hadn't saved me that day.

399
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,040
For the past two months,
Uncle Guo has been visiting me

400
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,440
and talking to me.

401
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
I saw in him the strength of a person.

402
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,800
I am really grateful to him.

403
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,920
The flowers in the ward
were kept by him.

404
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,440
Now that he's gone,
I'll take care of the flowers.

405
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,720
I hope he can see it.

406
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,079
Yes, he can. Welcome to our ward.

407
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,280

Tomorrow. I heard Yan telling
Dong Dong's dad on the phone.

412
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,760
Is it his 3-year-old birthday?

413
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,880
I wonder
if we can give Dong Dong a birthday.

414
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,640
Sure, no problem.

415
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,760
Don't spend it in the ward.

Director Zhou found this
during the case screening this week.

436
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,360
Dong Dong didn't have enough tests.

437
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,520
He hasn't had a genetic test.

438
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,200
A lot of kids this age

439
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,992
get SMA because of a genetic problem.

then it can be cured.

444
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,600
Dong Dong might be able
to get SMA shots.

445
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,320
Dong Dong might be cured.

for Dong Dong?

457
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,720
That's not a small amount.

458
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,160
I've been thinking about this
these past few days.

459
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,960
Dong Dong's dad works in Guangzhou
and doesn't earn much.

460
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,920
His mom works at the hospital
as a cleaner and earns even less.

461
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,280
They can't even pay for
Dong Dong's hospitalization fees now.

462
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,680
It's hard for them
to pay for the surgery.

463
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,040
What can we do to help him?

464
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,280
Uncle, I wonder if our fund
can cover the cost.

465
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,360
The fund's money

466
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,240
can only be used
to maintain routine data collection.

467
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,280

468
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,600
I heard that his condition
is progressing rapidly.

to raise the money on our own.

and us, the relatives and friends.

The patients in the ward and the group

482
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,170
are very excited to know this.

483
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,610
Many of them voluntarily
want to donate to Dong Dong.

484
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:29,770
But considering
that everyone has a heavy burden now,

485
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,610
so we won't ask them
to donate large amount of money.

486
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,776
It's the thought that counts.

487
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:40,290
Dad, I'll leave the fund to you.

488
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,792

according to the formal procedures.

worried about Tuo's mood.

Yes, me too.

513
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:46,490
I'm afraid that after Uncle Guo dies,
he can't get over it.

514
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,330
I didn't expect him
to take over Uncle Guo's work so soon,

515
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,250
and get busy
with the group's matters all day.

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,730
Simple and practical.

525
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,690
There are two reasons.

526
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:43,210
First, given my current situation,

527
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:46,970
I really cannot
do something too complicated.

528
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,490
Second, considering
the practical market value,

529
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,370
I want to make some popular designs,

530
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,890
which are suitable for young people with
low income in terms of price and use.

531
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,770
The company launched a new theme
this quarter, focusing on youth.

532
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,410
I think Lin Tuo's design
is very suitable.

533
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:08,850
Not just focusing on youth,
I'm targeting office workers this time.

534
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,530
The idea is very practical,
but what is the goal?

535
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,210
Then I'll be straight with you, Leader.

536
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,810
Just get to the point. Say it.

537
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:22,090
Dong Dong in my ward
needs money for medical treatment now.

538
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:25,530
I want to make some money
with my designed products to help him.

539
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,210
That's a good thing.

540
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,730
Well, I'll review
your design plan first,

541
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,090
and choose the products
suitable for Ji Jia.

542
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:44,290
You need to perfect the parts
that require modification, okay?

543
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,650
I can contact some small manufacturers

544
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:48,850
to see if they have any needs.

545
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,050
I also know some manufacturers.

546
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,650
I'll sort it out
and send it to you later.

547
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:56,850
Thank you.

548
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,250
What for? It's not like
you're getting money for nothing.

549
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,930
You work and I pay.

550
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:05,850
Don't expect me to show mercy
if your designs don't qualify.

551
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:07,970
