You're so early.

I just came back
from the exhibition in Guangzhou.

I'll forward it to our HR.

43
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,972
Alright, thanks, senior.

44
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:00,492
No problem.

And you, Guangpu? Want to give it a try?

46

No, thanks. That's not my major.

47
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:10,052
I'm not much of a designer.

48
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,652
I'll just stick to funds management.

49

I heard you had
a family business to take over.

50
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,812
No, no.

51
00:03:17,812 --> 00:03:21,172
Our wholesale business
doesn't make money.

52
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:24,212
I'm just going to stay home
and get allowances from my mom.

53
00:03:24,212 --> 00:03:25,812
It's nothing like your family business.

54

My family business
doesn't match my major.

55
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:30,132
I prefer the job I'm doing.

56

where you work?

57
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:38,052

I can ask them. Why?

61
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,172
Alright, if there is a vacancy,

62
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:49,252
can you hand in another resume?

00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,172
- Are you hurt?
- Are you okay?

186
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:53,892
Is it bad?

187
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,052
Just a sprain. It's okay.

188
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,052
Take a break.

189
00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:56,732
No need.

190
00:09:56,732 --> 00:09:57,532
Are you okay?

191
00:09:57,532 --> 00:09:58,492
Can you go on?

192
00:09:58,492 --> 00:09:59,852
- Yeah.
- Can you move?

193
00:09:59,852 --> 00:10:00,732
It's okay.

194
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:01,532
- Okay.
- Can you get up?

195
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:03,092
Go on.

196
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:04,172
Be careful.

197
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:04,892
I got rusty.

198
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:05,492
You sure?

199
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:06,016
I'm okay.

200
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:07,392
You sure?

201
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:13,252
Lin Tuo, are you okay?

202
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:14,492
I'm fine.

203
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:18,612
Oh, come on.

204
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:20,892
So sweet.

205
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:28,772
Here, let me toast you.

206
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:36,372
He Xindi, can you stop
pulling a long face?

207
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:38,976
We tied with them today.
You know what it means?

208
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,252
We wiped out the humiliation.

209
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:44,452
Stop bragging
like you're the one who scored.

210
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,732
So ignorant. I passed the ball.
That's the key, isn't it?

211
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:50,492
Yeah.

212
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:54,652
She's just upset because
she didn't talk to the senior.

213
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,012
It took me two hours
to put on the makeup.

214
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:02,572
He didn't even see me. What a waste.

215
00:11:03,812 --> 00:11:07,732
Lin Tuo, it's been a year.
I know I can't count on you.

216
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,812
How come I just can't get his WeChat?

217
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,852
I talked to him but he said no.

218
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:14,132
Just send me his WeChat name card.

219
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,052
T-That's inappropriate.

220
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,532
Don't give him a hard time.
He's too good to be honest.

221
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:22,932
Let me make it clear.
Our senior is really popular.

222
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,412
Thousands of girls want his WeChat.

223
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:29,212
But they can't have it.
Why would he give it to you?

224
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,132
Forget it. He's way out of your league.

225
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,892
Chen Guangpu,
if you didn't just say that,

226
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,572
I wouldn't mind not having his WeChat.

227
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:43,012
But you did,
so I have to make it happen now.

228
00:11:43,532 --> 00:11:45,692
If I add him on WeChat

229
00:11:45,692 --> 00:11:47,412
and become his friend,

230
00:11:47,412 --> 00:11:49,772
you'll buy me grills for a month.
Fair deal, right?

231
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:54,492
Be friends? You made it
even tougher. Okay. Deal.

232
00:11:54,492 --> 00:11:55,852
Where is he working again?

233
00:11:55,852 --> 00:11:58,652
I'll send them my resume
and be his colleague.

234
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,692
Ji Jia Design.
It's a leader in the industry.

235
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:05,212
Que, Senior said that
he'd forward our resumes.

236
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:06,692
Alright.

237
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,052
Forward mine as well.

238
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:11,252
Yeah, forward hers.
Make her sell beds and bedsheets.

239
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:14,052
What does it
have to do with you? Shut up.

240
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,572
Rest assured. Once I get into Ji Jia,

241
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,212
I'll introduce him to you.

242
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:21,252
That's my girl.

243
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,932
Have you told him that we're together?

244
00:12:25,932 --> 00:12:27,532
No, he didn't ask.

245
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,572
Don't tell him.

246
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:30,732
Why not?

247
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,772
Office romance is not allowed.

248
00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:34,292
They won't get a couple.

249
00:12:34,292 --> 00:12:37,372
If we want to get enrolled,
we have to keep it a secret.

250
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,572
Is it necessary?

251
00:12:39,572 --> 00:12:43,012
Totally. It's common sense.
You have to keep it a secret.

252
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,520
We'll see.

253
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,132
Okay.

254
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:57,172
Senior.

255
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:00,292
- Senior.
- Senior.

256
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:02,772
Dinner is on me.

257
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,932
Senior, come and sit here.

258
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:07,572
Thanks.

259
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,292
Senior, have some meat.

260
00:13:09,292 --> 00:13:10,332
He doesn't eat beef.

261
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:12,812
He doesn't?

262
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:14,932
I'll just have the green.

263
00:13:15,652 --> 00:13:18,372
No, waiter. Take away
all the meat dishes.

264
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:23,532
We want the meat. What's wrong with you?

265
00:13:23,532 --> 00:13:25,012
Get lost if you have a problem.

266
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,012
Y-You don't have to bother.

267
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,056
I'm fine with seafood and greens.

268
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:32,672
No, it's my treat.
I decide what we're having.

269
00:13:33,172 --> 00:13:34,292
It's her call.

270
00:13:34,292 --> 00:13:37,052
Dinner is on me. That was the deal.

271
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:38,572
I just got delayed.

272
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:39,584
You're so sweet.

273
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:45,092
Well, now that we've met,
we're friends now, right?

274
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:47,424
Yeah.

275
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:49,772
Let me add you on WeChat.

276
00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:53,612
Senior, your QR code.

277
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:54,368
Okay.

278
00:14:00,932 --> 00:14:01,664
Done.

279
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,132
Dinner is on you.

280
00:14:06,132 --> 00:14:06,892
Fine.

281
00:14:06,892 --> 00:14:08,852
Waiter, two more servings of seafood.

282
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:10,812
You're so nice.

283
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,492
Senior, it's nothing. Just dig in.

284
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,532
This one is so good.

285
00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:24,412
It's a bit cold.

286
00:14:24,412 --> 00:14:27,904
Why is it so bad?
Should we go to the hospital?

287
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,692
No need. I just sprained my ankle.
No big deal.

288
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,372
Does it hurt?

289
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:36,132
Not so much.

290
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:44,212
Seriously? Don't be so soft.

291
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:48,132
Soccer players fall all the time.
I played half a game with broken bones.

292
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,692
No wonder you are kind of crippled.

293
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:52,652
I bet it's from the injury.

294
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:55,212
He's injured here, not on the legs.

295
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,452
You're humiliating the host, huh?

296
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:01,532
Don't I deserve some respect?

297
00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,492
Why would you say that?

298
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:04,692
He said...

299
00:15:04,692 --> 00:15:06,812
What about him?

300
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:07,532
Whatever.

301
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:10,572
He texted me.

302
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:16,640
Lin Tuo, I sent our HR your resumes.

303
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:19,612
They want to interview
both of you tomorrow.

304
00:15:19,612 --> 00:15:20,732
Wait for the messages.

305
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:23,852
Check your text messages.

306
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:26,652
I'm going to rent a huge apartment.

307
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:30,372
It's a job interview.
You're not enrolled yet.

308
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:37,012
Morning.

309
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:37,612
Morning.

310
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:43,252
Morning, Big Monster.

311
00:15:43,852 --> 00:15:45,812
Morning, Kiddo.

312
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,252
Alright.

313
00:15:50,252 --> 00:15:51,252
Alright, let's go.

314
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:55,412
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

315
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,676
(Chongqing Houses)

316
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,032
(Chongqing Houses)

317
00:16:10,172 --> 00:16:11,452
Nice building.

318
00:16:15,412 --> 00:16:16,252
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

319
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,892
Hello, we're here for the interview.

320
00:16:30,412 --> 00:16:31,092
Come with me.

321
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:40,412
Please wait here.

322
00:16:40,412 --> 00:16:42,372
Someone will come and pick you up.

323
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,772
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

324
00:16:44,576 --> 00:16:45,440
(Qian Hong, Wei Haiyang, Han Yuxi)

325
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:49,852
It's quite pretty.

326
00:16:53,532 --> 00:16:54,052
Senior.

327
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,652
(Qian Hong, Wei Haiyang, Han Yuxi)
I got you coffee.

328
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:57,472
Thank you.

329
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,852
Don't be nervous. Just be casual.

330
00:17:01,892 --> 00:17:03,932
I have a meeting. Catch up later.

331
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:04,772
Alright, see you.

332
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:09,452
Right, add me on WeChat
just in case you need something.

333
00:17:09,452 --> 00:17:09,972
Okay.

334
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:11,732
Your QR code.

335
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:12,480
Okay.

336
00:17:16,692 --> 00:17:19,012
Okay, let's stay in touch.

337
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:20,331
- See you.
- Bye.

338
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,331
- Bye.
- Thank you.

339
00:17:23,131 --> 00:17:25,292
They're my juniors.
Please look after them.

340
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,104
I know. You've said it many times.

341
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:29,332
- Afternoon tea is on me.
- Okay.

342
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:31,012
I'm leaving. Bye.

343
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:31,692
Bye, Senior.

344
00:17:33,132 --> 00:17:33,692
Lin Tuo.

345
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:36,132
Come with me.

346
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:36,972
- Okay.
- Wait.

347
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,732
Wait.

348
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:42,572
- Go ahead.
- See you.

349
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:43,200
Go.

350
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,448
I smell something amazing
from the corridor.

351
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:06,732
Dad, wash your hands. Dinner is ready.

352
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:09,172
Hello, Uncle.

353
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:11,732
Lin, you cooked those?

354
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:15,892
I can tell from the smell.
It can't be takeouts.

355
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:16,852
And it can't be from you.

356
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,212
I'm still making the soup.

357
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:20,252
Okay, thanks.

358
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:20,812
No problem.

359
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:24,412
We have a chef.

360
00:18:25,732 --> 00:18:26,932
So happy.

361
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,132
The soup is ready.

362
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,772
Sit down.

363
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,652
Try and see if you like it.

364
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:37,532
I don't even have to try it.
Check out the green, the meat,

365
00:18:37,532 --> 00:18:41,612
the plating, and everything.
It's absolutely perfect.

366
00:18:41,612 --> 00:18:42,492
Try it, Dad.

367
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:44,012
Alright.

368
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:44,892
- It's amazing.
- Okay.

369
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,372
Is it nice?

370
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:54,972
It's amazing. It's way better
than the Mi...

371
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:57,572
- Michelin.
- Yeah, that's right.

372
00:18:57,572 --> 00:18:59,572
This is amazing.

373
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,052
Have you ever dined there?

374
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,612
No, I haven't. But I've heard about it.

375
00:19:04,612 --> 00:19:06,972
- Uncle, try the soup.
- Okay, thanks.

376
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:11,252
Stay with us
and I'll cook for you every day.

377
00:19:15,172 --> 00:19:17,372
Lin, that's so sweet of you.

378
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:21,692
I'm deeply moved. Seriously.

379
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:25,472
Here.

380
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:36,732
Be careful.

381
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:43,972
My goodness. Come on.

382
00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:49,012
What are these?

383
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:50,932
Our place is tiny.

384
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,812
How are we going to move around?

385
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:59,572
Quit looking for a job.
Join me and be a streamer.

386
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:07,252
I'm talking to you.
Why are you staring at your phone?

387
00:20:07,252 --> 00:20:10,012
I'm waiting to see
if there's a second interview.

388
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:11,052
What did you say?

389
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:15,372
I said you should
forget about finding a job.

390
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,572
Join me as a streamer.

391
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:19,412
You know how hard I tried
to get into live commerce?

392
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:20,892
I don't have viewers.

393
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,172
The brands only gave me products

394
00:20:22,172 --> 00:20:23,452
thanks to the MCN staff.

395
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:25,412
I have everything set up.

396
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,852
This is a nice spot. Let's clean it up.

397
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,572
And we'll livestream here.

398
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:32,892
No way.

399
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,012
Why? Let's start a business together.

400
00:20:36,012 --> 00:20:40,572
You're starting your business alone.
I can help you but that's it.

401
00:20:41,132 --> 00:20:43,812
Besides, you have to pay me
if I part-time for you.

402
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:46,252
Otherwise, I get nothing.
That makes the difference.

403
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:47,132
Don't try to trick me.

404
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:49,852
What a fox.

405
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:51,132
I'm just broke.

406
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:54,572
(Valuable items)
Let me unpack.

407
00:20:58,212 --> 00:21:02,732
It's been two days.
Why haven't they contacted me?

408
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,296
(Balloon Convenience Store)

409
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:21,292
What's wrong?

410
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:24,612
Good news.

411
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:25,532
What is it?

412
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:27,932
Ji Jia informed me
of the second interview.

413
00:21:27,932 --> 00:21:29,772
Really? That's great!

414
00:21:30,612 --> 00:21:33,612
I'm going to meet the director tomorrow.

415
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:36,692
That's great.

416
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:41,892
No message for you?

417
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,452
Check it again.

418
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:47,692
I did. There was nothing.

419
00:21:48,452 --> 00:21:49,852
Let me ask Senior.

420
00:21:49,852 --> 00:21:52,892
Let it be. He's not the boss.

421
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,452
I obviously failed the interview.

422
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:59,012
Not necessarily.
We applied for different departments.

423
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:00,372
The procedure may be different.

424
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:04,532
Yeah, meet the director.

425
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,612
I can do a part-time job
in the study room.

426
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:10,132
I can also help He Xindi
with her livestreaming.

427
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:12,532
I have many things to do.
I'll look for another job.

428
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,812
But I want to go to work with you.

429
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:25,852
Me too. I can send you
to work and pick you up.

430
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:29,852
At least one of us
should have a decent job.

431
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:32,452
It's better to be you.

432
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,532
Then I'm going to take advantage of you.

433
00:22:36,652 --> 00:22:37,332
Good point.

434
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:40,292
Have the noodles. It's ready.

435
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:42,372
Alright.

436
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:46,172
I added bamboo shoots
with pickled pepper.

437
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:46,772
Let me try it.

438
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,024
This way.

439
00:22:57,972 --> 00:23:01,092
Ms. Qian is having a meeting.
Please wait here.

440
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:02,012
Okay, thank you.

441
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:02,932
Want some water?

442
00:23:05,532 --> 00:23:07,372
It's okay. I got this. Thank you.

443
00:23:07,372 --> 00:23:09,052
The pantry is just on the corner.

444
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,572
I'm from the Design Department Team 3.
I sit by the window.

445
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:15,332
Call me if you need me.
Right, I'm Huang Xiaolv.

446
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:17,772
I'm Lin Tuo. Thank you.

447
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:30,852
Have you prepared
the material for Dahong?

448
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:31,892
I'll dispatch it tomorrow.

449
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:35,572
Okay, the client doesn't like this.

450
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,332
The color is too dull.

451
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,612
He wants us to offer more options.

452
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:44,252
Confirm it with him. This and that...

453
00:23:44,252 --> 00:23:46,852
They're in different sizes.

454
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:49,332
Change it, okay?

455
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:02,252
Huang Xiaolv.

456
00:24:03,612 --> 00:24:05,852
Lin Tuo, you know how to use this?

457
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:09,292
I haven't tried it before.

458
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:15,212
Will the capsules do?

459
00:24:15,212 --> 00:24:15,892
Yeah.

460
00:24:15,892 --> 00:24:16,772
Let me help you.

461
00:24:16,772 --> 00:24:17,292
Thanks.

462
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:21,212
Let me. Put it down.

463
00:24:44,132 --> 00:24:45,212
Where is the coffee?

464
00:24:45,772 --> 00:24:47,412
Coming. Last one.

465
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:48,852
Hurry. We're almost wrapping up.

466
00:24:48,852 --> 00:24:51,852
Okay, please take these
to the conference room.

467
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:02,172
(Qian Hong)
Here is our financial statement.

468
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,264
(Annual analysis)
I always say

469
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:06,092
that design and capital
should be integrated.

470
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:09,372
We're no longer a workshop.

471
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,652
As our core designers,

472
00:25:11,652 --> 00:25:14,252
you can't simply
focus on your artistic pursuit.

473
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,372
Study the market and look for capital

474
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:20,652
to integrate design with capital, right?

475
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:24,972
Overall profits for the quarter
retained a steady upward trend

476
00:25:25,572 --> 00:25:28,412
but the increase slowed down
compared to the previous quarter.

477
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,452
I assume you're aware of the key factor.

478
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:37,092
The current rise
in commodity material prices

479
00:25:37,092 --> 00:25:38,492
led to a higher cost.

480
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:42,092
So we have to highlight our projects

481
00:25:42,092 --> 00:25:43,612
with a new design.

482
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:44,852
Get me a latte.

483
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:46,052
High-consumption design...

484
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:48,452
(Wei Haiyang)
Extra sugar.

485
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:50,252
Okay.

486
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:37,692
Thank you.

487
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:59,972
Who made coffee here?
Why don't they clean up?

488
00:26:59,972 --> 00:27:01,772
There's water everywhere.

489
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:04,572
Sorry, Auntie. I did that.
Let me clean it up.

490
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,252
Alright, I'll get the trash.

491
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:08,412
Sorry, I was in a rush.

492
00:27:08,412 --> 00:27:12,372
Young people are pampered.
You never had a tough day in your life.

493
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:16,652
Back then, we wouldn't
even dream of this.

494
00:27:26,532 --> 00:27:29,212
Look at that. So much coffee left.

495
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:33,052
There's coffee left in every cup,
all going to waste.

496
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:35,412
Let me clean up, Auntie.

497
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:37,012
- Sorry.
- You're new here?

498
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,572
Yeah, I made a mess here.

499
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:41,332
Go ahead. I'll clean the table.

500
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:42,092
Thank you.

501
00:27:50,932 --> 00:27:53,012
Auntie, wait.

502
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:56,452
Let me do it. It's too heavy for you.

503
00:27:56,452 --> 00:27:57,452
Thank you, kid.

504
00:27:57,452 --> 00:27:57,972
It's okay.

505
00:27:57,972 --> 00:28:02,492
What a nice kid. You're one of a kind.

506
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,492
Thank you.

507
00:28:04,492 --> 00:28:05,012
No problem.

508
00:28:33,692 --> 00:28:36,172
You're new?
Which department are you from?

509
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:38,812
No, I'm here for an interview.

510
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,252
Lin Tuo.

511
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:43,328
Yeah.

512
00:28:44,172 --> 00:28:44,972
I'm Qian Hong.

513
00:28:46,652 --> 00:28:47,692
Ms. Qian.

514
00:28:48,212 --> 00:28:51,732
Good for you. You found work to do
before you got enrolled.

515
00:28:52,452 --> 00:28:54,092
Leave it. Come with me.

516
00:28:59,132 --> 00:29:01,212
Time is tight. I have a dinner meeting.

517
00:29:01,212 --> 00:29:03,092
So let's cut to the chase.

518
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:06,092
We're starting a new design group. Sit.

519
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,572
So we're looking for
an assistant for the designer.

520
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:13,052
Theoretically,
we want someone with experience.

521
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:17,092
But I think you got this.
Six-month probation, okay?

522
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:18,212
I got this.

523
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:21,492
I ran out of chocolate.

524
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,932
You'll work for him
during the probation.

525
00:29:24,932 --> 00:29:26,932
Director Wei Haiyang
from Design Department Team 3.

526
00:29:28,452 --> 00:29:29,132
Hello, Director.

527
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:31,972
He came for an interview.
I'm assigning him to you.

528
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,532
Interview?

529
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:34,848
Yeah.

530
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:36,652
You got me coffee.

531
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:38,532
Yeah.

532
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:42,252
Making coffee
has become part of the interview?

533
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:43,932
I was in the meeting.

534
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:46,132
He worked in the pantry
the whole afternoon.

535
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:49,172
So he should be a janitor.
Why is he working for me?

536
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:51,612
You're always so mean.

537
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,772
I can tell he's a hardworking one.

538
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:57,772
And that's our standard
for designers now?

539
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:01,572
I find him handsome, okay?

540
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:05,772
I don't care. He's yours.

541
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:08,932
You'll decide whether to keep him.

542
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:13,972
Lin Tuo, you'll work for
Director Wei Haiyang.

543
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:16,092
He's our best designer here.

544
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:19,212
Only he gets to decide if you can stay.

545
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:21,532
Understood.

546
00:30:22,332 --> 00:30:25,292
I'm not going to the dinner.
I have to visit the factory.

547
00:30:26,652 --> 00:30:27,812

548
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:30,652
That's right. Thanks for the chocolate.

549
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:38,332
So, Ms. Qian, am I enrolled?

550
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:38,892
It's a probation.

551
00:30:40,692 --> 00:30:41,412
Thank you.

552
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:44,736
Save it. It's just a probation.
He can kick you out at any time.

553
00:30:45,412 --> 00:30:48,052
Alright, sign the contract with HR now.

554
00:30:48,052 --> 00:30:49,812

I hope you can hang in there.

I'd like to introduce myself.

562
00:31:13,252 --> 00:31:13,812
No need.

I can do for you now?

703

Get out of my office.

704
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:00,532

You just got there. Are the others busy?

712
00:40:20,892 --> 00:40:23,852
Yeah, nobody talked to me at all.

713
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:27,252
Only the girl on probation period

714
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:28,132
showed me around.

715
00:40:31,692 --> 00:40:33,452
You already met a girl?

716

when I came for the interview.

717
00:40:37,172 --> 00:40:39,652
I helped her with the coffee, remember?

718
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:41,572
You're so warm-hearted?

719
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:43,772
Just a small favor.

720
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:45,892
I was thinking that
maybe we'd be colleagues.

721
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,462
And look happened?

722
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,372
She showed me around the office.

723
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:51,412
Is she pretty?

724
00:40:58,976 --> 00:40:59,648
(Another day full of energy!)

725
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,196
(Last day in October)

726
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,852
Alright, you can be friends.

727
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:13,052
Why?

728
00:41:13,052 --> 00:41:14,452
She looks kind.

729
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,772
Got any messages on the interview?

730
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:24,576
Not yet.

731
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:27,372
It's been too long. I guess I failed.

732
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,172
I applied to some other companies.

733
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:33,012
I have an interview
with the new media department

734
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:34,692
of a real estate company tomorrow.

735
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,892
No rush. I found a job, anyway.

736
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,172
I can support you.

737
00:41:40,172 --> 00:41:41,652
Alright, thank you, sir.

738
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:43,492
No problem.

739
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:50,532
Hey, there.

740
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:51,212
All set?

741
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:53,092
Yeah, done with the paperwork.

742
00:41:53,092 --> 00:41:54,292
Ms. Qian signed the papers.

743
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:56,332
Lunch is on me.

744
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:57,372
Thanks, then.

745
00:41:57,892 --> 00:41:59,242
Ms. Qian likes the kid.

746
00:41:59,242 --> 00:42:00,732
She even checked out his resume.

747
00:42:01,972 --> 00:42:03,532
She won't regret it.

748
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:05,212
Right, what about the girl?

749
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:09,572
I was about to tell you.
New media only has one headcount.

750
00:42:09,572 --> 00:42:11,732
Their leader has someone in mind.

751
00:42:11,732 --> 00:42:12,892
So there's no vacancy.

752
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:14,852
I see.

753
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:20,732
Do you have any recommendations?

754
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,732
You're too sweet to your juniors.

755
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:25,972
You're assigning them jobs?

756
00:42:25,972 --> 00:42:27,132
Not entirely.

757
00:42:27,812 --> 00:42:31,132
Alright, I'll forward her resume
to some other companies.

758
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:32,932
Alright, thanks.

759
00:42:34,572 --> 00:42:36,332
Murder Mystery Games this weekend?

760
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:39,902
I-I have plans.

761
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,920
Rain check. It's on me. See you.

762
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,688
Alright.

763
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:52,322
I'll send you a resume.

764
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:53,572
Forward it to the headhunters.

765
00:42:57,092 --> 00:43:01,476
