(So What Else And What Next)

15
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,259
Tuo, what's going on?

16
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:10,028
Que.

17
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:12,628
I'm here. What's up?

18
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:17,147
I had a nightmare
that a monster was coming to eat me.

19
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:21,868
I fought with it all night.

20
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,148
Finally, I drove the monster away.

21
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:31,068
I didn't have it eat me,
and I'm still alive.

22
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,868
It's okay now. I'm here.

23
00:04:55,148 --> 00:05:01,708
Tuo, what's wrong? What happened?

24
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:04,748
What's the matter?

25
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:09,188
Are you sick? You're talking nonsense.

26
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:15,188
Why is there so much water
on the floor? Did you do this?

27
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,348
Tuo, don't scare me.

28
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:22,588
I'm a bit tired
after fighting the monster all night.

29
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:25,308
I want to go inside
and rest for a while.

30
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:23,868
This is the prescription
I made for you yesterday.

31
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,428
The Riluzole

32
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:31,068
is one of the drugs
proven to be effective

33
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,948
in delaying
the development of this disease.

34
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,788
Besides this drug,

35
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:38,148
you can also take antioxidants
like vitamin E, vitamin C,

36
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,268
and Coenzyme Q10.

37
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,268
What effect does it have?

38
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:48,028
This drug will not cure the disease,

39
00:06:48,748 --> 00:06:54,708
but it can effectively
slow the disease progression.

40
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,548
So this drug is very important to you.

41
00:07:28,908 --> 00:07:32,868
(Tuo, I wonder what's wrong with you.)

42
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,388
(Nor do I know how to comfort you.)

43
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:41,948
(But don't hide anything from me.)

44
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:47,828
(I will always be here
for you and love you, Que.)

(HW Cafe)

46
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,588
Hello, how much is the bill
for table five?

47
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:12,868
Just scan the code and pay.

48
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:15,428
Please come again.

49
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:25,148
(Que, let's break up.)

50
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:45,308
Lin Tuo, open the door.
It's me, open the door.

51
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:52,668
Lin Tuo, open the door.
Lin Tuo, get the door open.

52
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,388
I know you're there. Open the door.

53
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:57,108
Be gentle. I'll make a call.

54
00:08:59,308 --> 00:08:59,988
Hurry up.

55
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:14,788
Nothing. He's not there.

56
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:17,868
Okay, I'll call the locksmith now.

57
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,908
I have to open this door.

58
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:21,948
It's illegal. You're not the landlord.

59
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:24,068
The resident is inside,
and you're picking the lock.

60
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:28,188
What? He's cheating on Que.
Why isn't he against the law?

61
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:31,508
Cheating isn't against the law,
but trespassing is.

62
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,976
Fine, you're on his side.

63
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:35,520
I...

64
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,468
You must know something.

65
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,108
Chen Guangpu, tell me what you know.

66
00:09:38,108 --> 00:09:39,228
Tell me now.

67
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:40,828
Can you calm down?

68
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:43,948
Isn't it normal for a couple
to have a fight and break up?

69
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,588
What's all the fuss about?

70
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:47,748
Did you see Lin Tuo cheating?

71
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,668
- What did you say?
- What are you doing?

72
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:52,468
Hitting you is the evidence.

73
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:53,348
- Shut up.
- Don't hit me.

74
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:54,668
Don't hit me.

75
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:57,216
Stop. Don't lift my leg.

76
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:59,788
- Let me go.
- Calm down.

77
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,432
It's normal for a woman to hit a man.

78
00:10:06,432 --> 00:10:06,948
Get lost.

79
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:07,828
W-What?

80
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:11,108
A floral shirt too?

81
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,388
Watch out for men in floral shirts.

82
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:15,268
They're all no good.

83
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:17,908
What's wrong?

84
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,108
I'm wearing a plaid shirt.

85
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:43,388
Chen Guangpu might really
not know about this.

86
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,148
I pinched his arm as hard as I could.

87
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:46,868
He's such a coward.

88
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,428
He'll spill the beans
if I scare him a bit.

89
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:51,812
This time, I even
ruined a pair of sneakers.

90
00:10:51,812 --> 00:10:53,508
H-He kept saying
he doesn't know anything.

91
00:10:53,508 --> 00:10:56,228
Why did you scold Chen Guangpu?

92
00:10:56,228 --> 00:10:58,388
This has nothing to do with him.

93
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:00,640
I can't find Lin Tuo,
so I was just anxious.

94
00:11:03,628 --> 00:11:05,308
Maybe you stay at my place
for a couple of days.

95
00:11:05,308 --> 00:11:07,744
I'll ask Chen Guangpu to leave,
so I'll spend more time with you.

96
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:11,948
No. You go on with your work.

97
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:43,456
An.

98
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:45,668
Guo, business seems good.

99
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:46,268
Yes.

100
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,748
Quite a few people.
Go handle your business.

101
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:49,408
Alright.

102
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,450
Waiting for me?

103
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,290
What else?

104
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:15,850
I'll drink some.

105
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,650
No way.

106
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:22,810
Let's go home.

107
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,770
Let me drink some.

108
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,490
Lin Tuo.

109
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,610
I know you are there.

110
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,210
He Xindi almost tore me apart
because you broke up with Que.

111
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,210
You didn't tell me anything about it.

112
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,690
How can I help you with that?

113
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,130
Fine, if you don't want to tell me,
that's okay.

114
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,930
You should at least
offer Que an explanation.

115
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,690
Did she do anything wrong,

116
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,050
so you wanted to break up with her?

117
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,730
You didn't ask to break up in person.
That's too much.

118
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,952
We know Que well, right?

119
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,090
Has she tried to reach out to you?

120
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,130
No. She hasn't said anything,

121
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,410
and just waited for you
to explain everything to her.

122
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,890
You understand what I mean, right?

123
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,530
It's up to you. I'm leaving now.

124
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,770
I'm really leaving. Call me.

125
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,970
She was already here when I got here.

126
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,530
I wonder if she even left last night.

127
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,090
She did. She had a video call with me
when she got home.

128
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,010
Can't she just go to his company?
Tuo has to go to work.

129
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,410
Don't mention Lin Tuo.

130
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,010
Okay.

131
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,090
She's still waiting.

132
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:21,970
Lin Tuo has to come
to find her to explain.

133
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,810
She told me not to look for Lin Tuo.

134
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,170
She's so upset.

135
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,930
There must be something between them
that we don't know about.

136
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,770
Of course. So we can only
sit and watch her now.

137
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:36,770
Welcome.

138
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,170
Don't mention Lin Tuo.

139
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,170
Leader.

140
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,810
You...

141
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,688
It's okay.

142
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,370
It's not ALS, right?

143
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,450
It's diagnosed as ALS.

144
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,210
I mean, I'm fine now.

145
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,770
Let's get to work, Leader.

146
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,130
No. You have the day off
and I'll go to the hospital with you.

147
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,570
No, it's already been diagnosed.

148
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,650
I don't need the day off.

149
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,210
Why are you still going to work?
Is working important now?

150
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,050
Leader,
I don't have much time left to work.

151
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,250
Lin Tuo, your cafe
has launched a new product.

152
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,530
Is this Honey Peach Coffee sweet?

153
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,770
I haven't tried this.

154
00:15:58,450 --> 00:15:59,970
Haven't you even tried your new product?

155
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,170
I've been too busy to try it.

156
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,170
Why can't the dining table
be placed in the prime spot?

157
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:13,850
Its order volume is just average.
Why should I put it in the prime spot?

158
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,730
Now you have to talk about
sales volume, right?

159
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,490
Who's been telling me
sales volume are the most important?

160
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,890
What's wrong with you now?

161
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,250
Different approaches
for different products.

162
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,970
Do you have to be that persistent?

163
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:28,090
Wei Haiyang, are you crazy?

164
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:32,210
You insisted not to let Lin Tuo attend
the Young Designers Exhibition before.

165
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,530
And now you insist on
putting his work in the prime spot.

166
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,970
Have you lost your mind?
What do you want?

167
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,210
I have lost my mind. The dining table
must be put in the prime spot.

168
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,410
This dining table matters now.

169
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,490
It matters to Lin Tuo or the company?

170
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,690
It matters to me.

171
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,490
Bao, where are they?

172
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,890
One is inside, and the other goes out.

173
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,930
Okay. If Que asks about me
when she comes back,

174
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,210
just tell her that I have
already been here, okay?

175
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,010
I'm leaving.

176
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,890
Chen Guangpu, come back here!

177
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,690
Can you... Can you let me go?

178
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,930
Why are you running?

179
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,690
Can't you have them solve the problem
between the two of them?

180
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,770
Don't come to me.

181
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,890
Did you see him or not? Tell me.

182
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,530
I didn't see him.

183
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,450
We are not like you.

184
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,890
If my buddy has a problem,
he solves it himself.

185
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,410
It's not like you who
have to team up and fight.

186
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,410
- You two went to the restroom together.
- We are all adults.

187
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,130
You must've seen him.

188
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,130
Let's keep some distance.

189
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,170
You've seen him, right?

190
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:38,810
We are different.

191
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,490
Are you lying to me?

192
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,330
You've seen him.

193
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,450
We don't talk about everything.
It's his own business...

194
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:42,970
Chen Guangpu.

195
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,890
Que.

196
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,770
Wait here.

197
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,130
Here are the earphones for him.

198
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,530
And some bread for breakfast.

199
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:10,530
I-I really didn't see him.
I've been quite busy.

200
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,090
It's okay.
Just give them to him when you see him.

201
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,010
I'll take the day off
to take care of something.

202
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,930
Chen Guangpu.

203
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,650
Tell Lin Tuo that I'll wait for him
at HW Cafe tonight.

204
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,664
Okay.

205
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,192
It's okay.

206
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,304
Come on.

208
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,776
Which one do you like?

209
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,450
I like this one.

210
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,856
Why?

211
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,410
It's practical and cost-effective.

212
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,010
There aren't so many fancy things
in the materials and design.

213
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,250
Good. You've learned well
and grasped the essence of it.

214
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,970
Are these all your drawings?

215
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,136
They were designed years ago
and not perfect.

216
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,570
Do you want to improve them together?

217
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,970
Are you giving me these,
so I can just use them?

218
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,650
I'm not that great.

219
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,490
Why would I give you my drawings?

220
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,930
You are my assistant.

221
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,730
It's your job to help me improve.

222
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,250
It's not time for you
to categorize them.

223
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,890
Lin Tuo, there's still time, right?

224
00:20:04,992 --> 00:20:05,600
Yes.

225
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:06,970
Then don't waste it.

she'll wait for you at HW Cafe tonight.)

Ye, any news?

235
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,050
Not yet.

236
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,010
Maybe not so soon. Don't worry.

237
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,970
I'll go to the hospital first.
Call me if there's news.

238
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,250
Okay.

239
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,930
Your dad has been waiting.
He has called several times.

240
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,770
The health bureau is inspecting
the hospital, so he can't leave.

241
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,290
This inspection matters much to him,

242
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,050
concerning your dad's promotion
to director.

243
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,552

244
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,250

to work overtime today.

It hurts.

How about here? Better, right?

260
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:21,970
Yes.

261
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,690
That means the drug is working.

Keep taking it.

263
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,850

the former director is here.

264
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,490
Okay. Rest well.

265
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,016
Okay.

266
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,610
His dosage remains unchanged for now.

267
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,770
Keep an eye on the indicators,
especially the protein biomarkers.

268

Okay.

contrast imaging as soon as possible.

Come and find me if there's any problem.

from the family.

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,970
Why hasn't my brother texted back?

305
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,250
I'll go home.

306
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,890
Sit down.

307
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:10,890
Stay here and wait.

308
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:16,650
You're only going to
make things worse by going back.

309
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,050
Can my brother convince my dad?

310
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:20,890
Definitely not.

311
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,010
No one can't convince your dad.

312
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,090
Then what's the point of me
waiting here?

313
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,530
Just stay here.
Your brother knows what he's doing.

314
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,410
What are you doing?

315
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,770
You guys are so thoughtless.

316
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,690
Why hide such a significant matter
from us?

317
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,210
Where is he? Tell him to get back here.

318
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,770
Dad, can you listen to me?

319
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,290
What do you want to say?

320
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:59,090
Do you expect us to accept it?
In your dreams.

You two are so bold.

322
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,490
Your mom and I have worked so hard
to cultivate you two.

323
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,890
You didn't listen to us,

324
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,970
and even colluded with Ye.

325
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,210
You just made your decision
on such a big matter? How dare you!

326
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,610
Dad, have you really
worked hard to cultivate us?

327
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,530
Did you really do
what's best for us all these years?

328
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,570
Have you ever cooked for us
or washed our clothes?

329
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,584
Have you ever chatted with us?

330
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:31,250
Do you know what we like?

331
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,770
Do you know what we're allergic to?

332
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,250
Do you know when we get sick?

333
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,330
You don't know anything.

334
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,210
You're a doctor, yet you don't
even know both of us are sick.

335
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,170
You don't know that Ye has depression.

336
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,090
He's only 18
and he doesn't want to live anymore.

337
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,890
He wanted to jump off a building.
Do you know it?

338
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,410
What?

339
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:50,688
Tuo.

340
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,250
You're busy with everything
at the hospital.

341
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,330
You like the hospital,
your career, and being a director.

342
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,330
So you want all of us
to work in the hospital,

343
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,730
where you like.

344
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:11,050
Dad, have you ever loved Mom?
Have you ever loved us?

345
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,170
Mom, have you ever loved us?

346
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,490
I don't allow you
to talk to us like this.

347
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:28,370
- Don't.
- I...

348
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,410
- Come on.
- Don't.

349
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,890
Hit me! If hitting me

350
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,610
would make you agree Ye
to attend the art academy,

351
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,250
then I'll stand right here
and let you hit me

352
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,170
until you are satisfied.

353
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,530
Ye won't go to medical school,
or retake the exam.

354
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,330
He must go to art academy.

355
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,610
I won't have Ye jump off a building.

356
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,130
I want him to live.

357
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,530
To live the life he wants.

358
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,810
Fine. Your sons have grown up,
and are truly beyond control now.

359
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,210
You've got the nerve. Just leave.

360
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,690
Both of you leave.
I don't need sons like you.

361
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,770
Tuo.

362
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,090
It's okay. Don't worry.

363
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:32,570
Just stay at my place.
I can take care of both of you.

364
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,210
Is grandpa asleep?

365
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:15,840
Yes.

366
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,112
Ye.

367
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,490
You stay at grandpa's place.

368
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,930
Dad won't calm down that soon.

369
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,472
When I went to college,

370
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,810
he was silent towards me for a year.

371
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,970
No one can handle his temper.

372
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:40,530
I know it.

373
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,850
But you have to apologize to Mom.

374
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,690
It hasn't been easy for her
to raise you all these years.

375
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,410
We can run away from home,
but she can't.

376
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,290
Dad will take
all his anger out on her alone.

377
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,050
She's the one who's hurting the most.

378
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,970
She loves you the most,
and you know that.

379
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,490
Stay with grandpa until school starts.

380
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,690
The school is not far
from downtown Chongqing.

381
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,250
Que and I went to see it specially.

382
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,610
It's nice and there's a couple of
snack streets around.

383
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,210
You two have seen it?

384
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,770
Que insisted.

385
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,370
She said you'd definitely get in.

386
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,290
Is she doing well?

387
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,250
Yes.

388
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:56,210
Even we break up one day,
you can still go to see her.

389
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,170
She always thinks about you.

390
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,490
Why would you two break up?

391
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,930
Just saying that.

392
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,450
I'll take care of your tuition
and living expenses.

393
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,570
Grandpa gave me some,
and I've saved some.

394
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:19,490
I have spent some
on a health check-up recently.

395
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:23,490
If it's not enough,
I could figure it out.

396
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,209
What's wrong with you?
Why did you get a health check-up?

397
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,930
Just a regular check-up.
A bit expensive.

398
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,730
Then when school starts,
I'll come to you.

399
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,450
We'll see then. Let me know in advance.

400
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,672
I might be on the business trip.

401
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:58,090
Alright, go to sleep. I have to
get up early tomorrow morning.

402
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,210
I have to go back to work.

403
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:05,050
Brother, thank you.

404
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,080
Go to sleep.

405
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,876
(Conference Room 3)

406
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,410
Where's Lin Tuo?
Why is Lin Tuo taking leave again?

407
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,170
He has always taken leave recently.

408
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,490
Unlike us, his girlfriend runs a cafe.

409
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:40,450
If my girlfriend runs a cafe,
I won't come to work either.

410
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,170
We don't get much salary left
after paying the insurance.

411
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,410
I notice Lin Tuo has not been
looking well recently.

412
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,890
Last time, I noticed a hospital bag
in his backpack.

413
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,730
Maybe he is sick.

414
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,890
Sick? If he was sick, he'd resign.

415
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,090
How come he still works?

416
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,290
Without Lin Tuo,
no one even makes coffee.

417
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,090
Can't you make coffee on your own?

418
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:08,770
Bring me the shoe.

419
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,170
What's wrong with you?

420
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,530
Gossiping behind one's back.

421
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:31,570
How dare you
hand me a proposal like this!

422
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:34,970
Redo it.

423
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,450
Before Lin Tuo gets sick,
he'll get sick first.

424
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:44,810
I was scared too.

425
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,210
You should have at least told me first.

426
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:14,530
All I ever worried about
was what if you didn't attend it.

427
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,170
I never thought it would be like this.

428
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,090
Mom, I really don't want
to attend medical school.

429
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,770
Attending medical school

430
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,450
is unbearable for you brothers.

431
00:37:43,232 --> 00:37:44,384
(HW Cafe)

432
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,250
How is Ye?

433
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,450
He got into the art academy.

434
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:31,930
That's great.

435
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,930
Right.

436
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,730
Why are we being like this now?

437
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,850
I just don't know how to face it.

438
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,370
So...

439
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:03,210
So you broke up with me
via a Wechat message?

440
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:07,810
It was my fault.

441
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,450
Which part?

442
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:17,090
The breakup or Wechat message?

443
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,770
I should have told you face to face.

444
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:25,690
Face to face?

445
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,650
Why do you want to break up?

446
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,130
Nothing special.

447
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,410
Lin Tuo, did something happen to you?

448
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,152
No.

449
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,970
Do you think I don't know you
after all the time we've been together?

450
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:58,130
You've seemed distant lately.

451
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:02,650
You got injured in the face,
and you came here to break up with me.

452
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,090
Did you owe someone money
or get into a fight?

453
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,290
What's going with you?

454
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:11,570
I'm an adult.

455
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:14,090
I don't have to explain
everything to you.

456
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:19,090
I can't explain either.
It's nothing to do with you.

457
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,170
What do you mean?

458
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:24,170
Lin Tuo, it has something to do with me.

459
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,850
There's no way I break up with you

460
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,290
without knowing anything.

461
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:34,170
Do you love someone else
and don't love me anymore?

462
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,770
Or are you going to immigrate abroad?

463
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,930
Or did you get caught up in the trouble?

464
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,210
At least give me one reason.

465
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,090
I find it tough.

466
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:04,010
There's no way to be with you anymore.

467
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,010
I can't imagine a future
with you at all,

468
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,610
so I don't want to be with you anymore.

469
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:22,610
I hope you can break up with me.

470
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:34,176
We agreed not to force each other.

471
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:38,770
Just like we did when we were together.

472
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,650
Don't hesitate when we break up, okay?

473
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,810
Okay.

474
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,250
Let's break up.
I won't do anything to force you.

475
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:25,490
