- Thank you.
- Alright, take care.

(Hospital Mall, Neurology Department)

20
00:02:58,283 --> 00:02:59,603
Grandpa called me today,

21
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:02,203
asking when we would go back
for the Spring Festival.

22
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:05,843
This is exactly what I'm worried about.

23
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:07,483
What should we do about it?

24
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,003
If we don't even go back
for the festival,

25
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:14,323
Grandpa will definitely overthink.

26
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:16,843
But with the current situation,

27
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,323
how can we get back?

28
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:22,123
Should we just tell Grandpa the truth?

29
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:25,003
After all, we can avoid
seeing him forever.

30
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:26,560
I've tried to persuade your brother,

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,043
but he just doesn't agree

32
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:30,203
and says Grandpa mustn't know about it.

33
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,283
So what do we do?

34
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:37,443
Your brother

35
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:39,683
lied to us before too, didn't he?

36
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:41,723
He said he had broken his arm,

37
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:43,803
and I didn't suspect him.

38
00:03:43,803 --> 00:03:45,683
I really thought he had broken it.

39
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:47,283
He and Chen Guangpu had broken

40
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:49,883
their arms and legs

41
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:50,883
when playing football before.

42
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:53,763
Are you suggesting

43
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:55,123
we tell Grandpa

44
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:56,643
my brother has broken his leg?

45
00:03:58,163 --> 00:03:59,443
We have no other choice.

46
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:03,723
Okay.

47
00:04:04,363 --> 00:04:06,144
Then let's just tell Grandpa

48
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,523
my brother and I fell off bikes.

49
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,803
I'll pretend to be injured as well.

50
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,163
That way, Grandpa won't doubt it.

51
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:12,243
Okay.

52
00:04:22,403 --> 00:04:23,264
Will this work?

53
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:26,683
I've helped you put on
the gauze and the splint already.

54
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,083
There shouldn't be any problems.

55
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:30,843
Later on, I'll put this on my arm too.

56
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:34,363
Anyway, if it's a motorcycle fall,
it's normal to see serious injuries.

57
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,963
I'll also fake some injuries on my face

58
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,323
to make it more true.

59
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:40,403
You've put it on backwards.
How can you not give it away?

60
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:43,043
No worries. No rush to put it on now.

61
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,483
I've informed

62
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,003
your parents.

63
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,163
I said you fell and broke both your leg

64
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,043
and arm when riding a motorcycle.

65
00:04:53,203 --> 00:04:53,883
Okay.

66
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,643
As long as Grandpa
can't tell, it's okay.

67
00:04:56,643 --> 00:04:57,443
Just leave it like this.

68
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:01,443
Que,

69
00:05:02,963 --> 00:05:03,883
Spring Festival is coming.

70
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:05,963
Go home and have a look.

71
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:43,363
Still angry?

72
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,003
Why would I be angry?

73
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:50,723
Whom would I be mad at?
I couldn't even see you.

74
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:51,963
W-W-What would I be angry about?

75
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:54,443
Well, wasn't I busy?

76
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,123
Then why are you back?

77
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:58,816
I hurried back as soon as I was done.

78
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,763
I need to mend our relationship.

79
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:05,323
Is a relationship so easily mended?

80
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,203
You left the home so decisively.

81
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,683
H-H-How can it be mended?

82
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:14,443
I was waiting for you
to calm down, okay?

83
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:16,523
So I could come back
and apologize to you.

84
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:19,603
You...

85
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:21,443
What did you do wrong?

86
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,443
I made you sad.

87
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:25,643
You know you made me sad.

88
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:26,523
An Zhique,

89
00:06:26,923 --> 00:06:28,643
I never thought
you could be so heartless.

90
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:30,483
I raised you with so much effort.

91
00:06:30,803 --> 00:06:32,203
You fell in love and then left me.

92
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,683
Isn't it true that you don't have
your dad in your heart at all?

93
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,563
How could it be possible?

94
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,443
You are my father,
and I am your daughter.

95
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,683
No matter what,
I should be filial to you.

96
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:42,643
Besides,

97
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,083
I knew a long time ago
that you weren't mad at me.

98
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:48,243
You had He Xindi send
things to me many times

99
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,203
without telling me they were from you,

100
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,523
but I could tell right away.

101
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:53,843
Isn't that so?

102
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:58,723
How can I be mad at you?

103
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:00,763
You're my daughter and my son-in-law.

104
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:02,443
How could I be angry with you?

105
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,363
Dad,

106
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:08,603
from my childhood to now,

107
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:11,563
I haven't really done
anything too crazy.

108
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,163
This matter

109
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,403
might be the biggest thing in my life.

110
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:20,203
I hope

111
00:07:20,963 --> 00:07:22,163
you will still support me

112
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:24,163
when I want to do something,

113
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:25,523
just like before.

114
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:27,883
I promise

115
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:30,243
I will not let myself be mistreated.

116
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,763
When I need you,

117
00:07:33,643 --> 00:07:35,203
could you still stay by my side?

118
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:42,603
Haven't I always been by your side?

119
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,323
Actually, when I first
learned about Tuo's illness,

120
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,683
I was stunned.

121
00:07:50,163 --> 00:07:51,163
I'm quite regretful now.

122
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:52,563
Haven't I added to your burden

123
00:07:53,403 --> 00:07:54,523
by arguing with you?

124
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:56,963
Taking care of a patient
is quite exhausting.

125
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,003
I-I-I made you

126
00:07:58,483 --> 00:08:00,283
have to take it alone.

127
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:01,603
Don't worry, Que.

128
00:08:02,403 --> 00:08:03,523
From now on, I will be with you.

129
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,963
I won't ever let you suffer alone, okay?

130
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:08,643
I won't let you get tired.

131
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,243
I can manage on my own now.

132
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:11,683
You're my dad.

133
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:12,723
Don't worry.

134
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:14,243
When I need you,

135
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:15,683
I will go to you directly.

136
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:23,843
Well,

137
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,323
h-h-how is Tuo now?

138
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,603
He is not

139
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,003
in a very good condition.

140
00:08:37,243 --> 00:08:40,403
The doctor says it can be
actually considered optimistic,

141
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:42,363
and that the time period is not short.

142
00:08:44,643 --> 00:08:45,443
His left arm...

143
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,763
His left arm is still quite functional.

144
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:51,963
His legs aren't very nimble.

145
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,843
But his feet can still exert strength.

146
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:58,643
We plan to visit his grandpa
this Spring Festival.

147
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:02,923
I-I-If the old man sees him
like this now...

148
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:04,363
We will deceive him,

149
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:07,363
saying he got injured
riding a motorcycle.

150
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:09,003
Alright then.

151
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,563
So you mean to say,

152
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:16,563
you'll all celebrate
at Tuo's home this year, right?

153
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:19,923
Am I not discussing it with you?

154
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:22,483
What's there to discuss?

155
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:23,923
If you want to go, just go.

156
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,163
Besides, if I didn't let you go,
could I stop you?

157
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:28,643
If you don't want me to go, I won't.

158
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:29,523
No.

159
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,003
Just go.

160
00:09:32,283 --> 00:09:34,763
While Tuo's health is still okay,

161
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,883
have a good Chinese New Year.

162
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:41,163
Don't worry about me.

163
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,563
I have many friends.

164
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:45,763
I will

165
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:46,883
play poker

166
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:48,283
and Fight the Landlord.

167
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:49,883
I-I-I'm telling you, without you,

168
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:52,563
I can still have fun
during the Spring Festival.

169
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:57,283
Thank you, Dad.

170
00:10:24,643 --> 00:10:25,363
Grandpa.

171
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:27,483
Grandpa, we're back.

172
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:28,483
Grandpa.

173
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:29,763
Grandpa.

174
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,403
You got hurt so badly on a motorcycle?

175
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:45,363
What happened?

176
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,203
Do you want me to make a dish?

177
00:10:59,203 --> 00:11:00,963
No need. Go take a rest.

178
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,843
Dad, don't busy yourself with it.

179
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:03,843
We'll cook today's meal.

180
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,003
You guys go ahead.

181
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:06,283
I was saying

182
00:11:06,803 --> 00:11:08,763
I'd been feeling uneasy all along.

183
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,563
You can ask Ye

184
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,643
how many calls I had him make.

185
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,083
Why was there no news from you?

186
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:17,403
I made a video call,
and you didn't respond to me.

187
00:11:18,203 --> 00:11:19,403
See, there was an accident, right?

188
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:20,483
I figured something was up.

189
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:23,003
I told you all about it,
but you didn't believe me.

190
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,603
W-W-Well, you see it now, don't you?

191
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,683
Riding a motorcycle in the winter?

192
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,723
You're dressed so warmly with a hat.

193
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:33,523
Your vision isn't clear, is it?

194
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,683
For sure, you were wearing earphones.

195
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,123
How dangerous that is.

196
00:11:38,363 --> 00:11:39,283
No, Grandpa.

197
00:11:39,723 --> 00:11:41,843
It's just that I wasn't careful
when turning and took a fall.

198
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:44,283
You took a fall.

199
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,283
And you, Ye!
I've told you so many times.

200
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:49,443
Don't walk with headphones.

201
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:50,243
What if you

202
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:51,243
bump into things?

203
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,443
How dangerous that is.

204
00:11:53,323 --> 00:11:55,163
Such a grown person,
still making me worry.

205
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:56,843
Grandpa, we just got back.

206
00:11:56,843 --> 00:11:58,523
Scold them later. Don't be angry.

207
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:00,923
Que, I'm quite happy that you've come.

208
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,683
I wanted them to invite you here

209
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:05,723
for Spring Festival.

210
00:12:05,923 --> 00:12:07,443
But I felt it was inappropriate

211
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:09,043
to let your dad be left alone

212
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:10,083
at home.

213
00:12:10,323 --> 00:12:13,083
No, my dad will spend
the festival with his colleagues.

214
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,003
It's not easy for him
to get a break this year.

215
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:16,683
He doesn't want me to be at home

216
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,363
so that he can enjoy his drinks.

217
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,363
He should come here to drink.

218
00:12:20,363 --> 00:12:21,483
I've got plenty of good wine.

219
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:23,123
Any day during the holiday works.

220
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:23,923
We have rooms for him.

221
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:24,643
Alright.

222
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:25,883
Then, okay.

223
00:12:29,443 --> 00:12:31,203
Your arm is injured like this,

224
00:12:31,203 --> 00:12:32,163
and so is your leg.

225
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:35,723
Ye,

226
00:12:36,403 --> 00:12:37,883
how come you injured your left face

227
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,443
while he hurt
his right arm and right leg?

228
00:12:40,723 --> 00:12:41,843
How did you fall?

229
00:12:42,843 --> 00:12:44,763
Come on, show me.

230
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,443
You were sitting behind your brother.

231
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:48,283
He was in front and saw an obstacle.

232
00:12:49,123 --> 00:12:50,283
It fell to the right, right?

233
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:51,963
You hurt your right arm and leg.

234
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,083
H-H-How did your left face get injured?

235
00:12:55,803 --> 00:12:56,363
Grandpa,

236
00:12:56,883 --> 00:12:57,843
it happened so suddenly.

237
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,683
Who would care about
how we fell at that moment?

238
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:02,163
Yeah, I got panicked and I jumped off.

239
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:03,643
I fell on that side when I jumped off.

240
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,283
No, no, when you jumped off, you see,

241
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:07,123
the inertia would take you to the right.

242
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:09,243
But you scraped your left face.

243
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:10,243
Was it a magic motorcycle?

244
00:13:10,243 --> 00:13:12,483
Grandpa, you're reconstructing
a crime scene now.

245
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,083
You've been watching
too many crime dramas.

246
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:15,203
I...

247
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:15,763
Grandpa,

248
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,043
have you ever guessed
the murderer correctly?

249
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,843
You forgot the reason why you
switched to watching idol dramas?

250
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,523
Right, exactly.

251
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:22,363
There was a TV show.

252
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:24,083
Grandpa didn't know
who the killer was even at last.

253
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:24,883
I told him,

254
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:26,763
but he kept insisting
that there would be a twist.

255
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:29,363
I've never really guessed
who the murderer was.

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,243
Grandpa, you see?

257
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,483
They look down on us, don't they?

258
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:34,243
Let's watch a mystery film today

259
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:34,963
and take a guess.

260
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:36,483
No, I'm not going to watch.

261
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,403
I'll never be able
to guess who the murderer is.

262
00:13:42,403 --> 00:13:43,203
You're so badly injured.

263
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:44,923
Don't ride a motorcycle anymore.

264
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:46,843
Got it.

265
00:13:46,843 --> 00:13:48,403
Sell it. Don't ride that thing.

266
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:51,283
Alright, I won't ride it anymore.

267
00:13:54,763 --> 00:13:55,683
Worrying.

268
00:14:12,803 --> 00:14:13,363
What?

269
00:14:15,243 --> 00:14:15,883
What is it?

270
00:14:17,683 --> 00:14:19,643
You've been in trouble again?

271
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,483
How is that possible? I haven't.

272
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:23,443
What's wrong?

273
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,323
The warehouse manager said

274
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,363
you'd been unloading goods
every day these past few days.

275
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:30,563
Some are missing?

276
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,243
I only unloaded the goods
into the warehouse.

277
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:34,323
I never touched them.

278
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:36,403
Who said you touched the goods?

279
00:14:37,603 --> 00:14:38,403
Do you need money?

280
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,963
I don't need money. I've earned money.

281
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:43,403
Mom, this is for you.

282
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:46,283
For me?

283
00:14:52,288 --> 00:14:53,843
It's even a gold necklace.

284
00:14:56,003 --> 00:14:56,723
Is it really gold?

285
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,083
It's copper. Take it or leave it.

286
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:01,683
Who talks like that?

287
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:03,683
It was bought by our son.

288
00:15:03,883 --> 00:15:05,003
It must be real.

289
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,123
And it's a golden ox.

290
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:08,563
Why is it an ox?

291
00:15:08,763 --> 00:15:09,803
My mom was born in the Year of Ox.

292
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:14,243
No, the Rabbit.

293
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:18,443
My dad was.

294
00:15:19,203 --> 00:15:20,163
I was born in the Year of Pig.

295
00:15:20,163 --> 00:15:21,283
I'm going to take a bath.

296
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:26,563
You were born
in the Year of Ox. You take it.

297
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:27,923
No, the Pig.

298
00:15:27,923 --> 00:15:29,803
♪Don't break my heart♪

299
00:15:30,603 --> 00:15:32,363
♪Be gentle once again♪

300
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:34,563
♪I don't want to see♪

301
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,083
Bao.

302
00:15:40,843 --> 00:15:41,883
Mr. An, you're here.

303
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,003
What's up?

304
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:44,224
You're not going home?

305
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:46,283
My home is too far away.

306
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,443
No direct flights,
and I couldn't snag a train ticket.

307
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:49,723
So I'm going back later.

308
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:51,963
You're here alone?

309
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,563
Yeah, Xindi and Guangpu
have to do a live streaming.

310
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,323
It's Spring Festival. Few customers.

311
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:57,203
I can manage by myself.

312
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,963
I want to earn as much
as possible for Que.

313
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,723
No wonder people say
you have a good heart.

314
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:02,963
Bao,

315
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,483
Que has gone to Tuo's home

316
00:16:05,483 --> 00:16:06,523
to celebrate Spring Festival.

317
00:16:07,323 --> 00:16:08,163
I am also alone.

318
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:09,883
If you don't mind,

319
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,843
let's spend the festival together.

320
00:16:12,043 --> 00:16:13,083
Alright.

321
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:14,483
Come to my place
to eat my dumplings then.

322
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:15,563
I can make the wrappers.

323
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:17,043
I'm pretty good at making the filling.

324
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:19,723
What are you doing? I can help you.

325
00:16:19,923 --> 00:16:20,723
N-N-No need.

326
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:22,603
I'm just about to get
the cake I just baked.

327
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,283
Try it and see
if it's different from Que's.

328
00:16:24,323 --> 00:16:25,443
Alright. Just give me a little.

329
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:26,203
Okay!

330
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:27,083
Just some of it will do.

331
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:44,763
Tuo.

332
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:53,440
Que.

333
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:56,352
Can you take some pictures
of me with Grandpa?

334
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,083
How about we go out for a walk with him?

335
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:00,403
Alright.

336
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:01,763
Grandpa.

337
00:17:04,203 --> 00:17:05,963
Grandpa, let's go out
for a walk, shall we?

338
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:07,003
Good.

339
00:17:07,523 --> 00:17:09,163
I have a gateball match coming up.

340
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,003
It's the last match of the year.

341
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:12,403
We'll go with you.

342
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:13,563
To cheer you on.

343
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:16,403
Where are you going? I want to go too.

344
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:18,602
OK. Let's change
our clothes and go together.

345
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:20,443
I'll go change my clothes.

346
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:34,843
No. 9.

347
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:35,563
Gate 1.

348
00:17:36,643 --> 00:17:38,523
I can't understand
this little ball game.

349
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:40,064
Me neither.

350
00:17:40,064 --> 00:17:41,603
I know nothing related to ball games.

351
00:17:42,683 --> 00:17:43,363
My little grandson.

352
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:43,883
So handsome.

353
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:44,483
My grandson.

354
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:47,483
The beautiful girl in the back
is my granddaughter-in-law.

355
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:50,243
- She's so pretty.
- There are three gates on the field.

356
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:51,523
One ball per person.

357
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:53,163
Each goal scored is worth one point.

358
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:55,683
Hitting the middle pole
scores two points.

359
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:57,163
Five points per round.

360
00:17:57,163 --> 00:17:58,363
At the end of the game, the one

361
00:17:58,363 --> 00:17:59,283
with the higher score wins.

362
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:00,443
How do you know it?

363
00:18:01,443 --> 00:18:02,603
I often played with them as a kid.

364
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,323
Do you know?

365
00:18:04,323 --> 00:18:06,443
My brother used to join Grandpa
in dancing at the square.

366
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:08,883
It was not dancing.

367
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:10,043
That was a senior choir.

368
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,683
You were dancing there with a fan.

369
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:13,803
Have you forgotten?

370
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,643
You were dancing
with a fan while singing?

371
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:18,763
Yeah, in the center position.

372
00:18:18,763 --> 00:18:19,643
It was the Phoenix Dance.

373
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:20,443
Really impressive.

374
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:22,363
Don't laugh at me.

375
00:18:22,923 --> 00:18:24,523
Didn't I do that to make him happy?

376
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:27,523
Hit No. 6.

377
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,203
Had I known it back then,

378
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:32,163
I would have danced with him more.

379
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:39,443
Ye,

380
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,403
spend more time with him in the future.

381
00:18:44,763 --> 00:18:45,843
He likes playing gateball,

382
00:18:46,483 --> 00:18:47,123
singing,

383
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:48,843
watching idol dramas

384
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:50,443
and grocery shopping.

385
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:54,683
He always says

386
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,003
it's quite comfortable to be alone.

387
00:18:58,363 --> 00:18:59,683
But look how happy he is

388
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:01,643
when we're back.

389
00:19:02,243 --> 00:19:03,283
He talks on and on,

390
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,883
having endless words to say.

391
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:07,563
No. 1.

392
00:19:08,923 --> 00:19:09,723
It's them.

393
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,163
No. 1.

394
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:11,963
No. 1.

395
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:12,963
Okay.

396
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:13,443
It's my time.

397
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,243
It's Grandpa's turn.

398
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,163
Grandpa, come on, Grandpa!

399
00:19:17,163 --> 00:19:17,923
Grandpa, you're cool!

400
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:25,323
No. 1.

401
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:26,403
Three points.

402
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:29,603
Come on.

403
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:31,003
- Grandpa.
- Come one, Grandpa.

404
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:42,203
Well,

405
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:43,963
people spend

406
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,403
their whole lives growing up,

407
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:48,576
getting married

408
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:50,403
and having kids.

409
00:19:52,323 --> 00:19:53,952
After their children grow up

410
00:19:55,043 --> 00:19:56,123
and start their own families,

411
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,683
they toil to raise their grandchildren.

412
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:02,683
Then their grandchildren go to school

413
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,043
and fall in love.

414
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:06,243
And in the end,

415
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,723
they're all alone again.

416
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:12,043
After I fell ill,

417
00:20:14,403 --> 00:20:16,203
I just couldn't stop
worrying about my grandpa.

418
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:19,443
Every time I think

419
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:22,883
I might not see him again in the future,

420
00:20:29,683 --> 00:20:30,963
I really can't get him off my mind.

421
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:44,523
Don't worry.

422
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:47,683
Ye and I will take good care of Grandpa.

423
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:55,323
Come on, Grandpa!

424
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,203
Go for it, Grandpa!

425
00:21:10,163 --> 00:21:11,803
Grandpa, you're amazing!

426
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:13,043
Grandpa, you're great!

427
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,763
- So cool.
- Grandpa, you're awesome.

428
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:25,683
- Good!
- Bravo.

429
00:21:26,323 --> 00:21:27,283

Grandpa,

442
00:23:04,923 --> 00:23:06,203
if you are tired, let's take a break.

443
00:23:07,443 --> 00:23:09,003
You ran too fast just now.

444
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:11,203
If it weren't for my regular exercise,

445
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,643
I couldn't have kept up with Ye.

446
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:15,232
Let's take a break.

447
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:16,203
Take a break.

448
00:23:28,064 --> 00:23:28,803
Actually,

449
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:30,763
I'm actually fine.

450
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:33,523
I'm in high spirits.

451
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:35,363
Now,

452
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:37,883
I often drink my homemade health tea.

453
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:39,523
It works.

454
00:23:40,523 --> 00:23:41,763
My blood pressure has stabilized.

455
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:43,843
I also made some

456
00:23:45,603 --> 00:23:47,163
for your dad to cool down his temper.

457
00:23:49,523 --> 00:23:50,723
He should drink more of it.

458
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:53,643
Haven't you noticed?

459
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:54,323
It works.

460
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:56,483
These past few days,
your dad hasn't been angry.

461
00:23:56,963 --> 00:23:58,043
He has a smile on his face.

462
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:00,960
And he even does chores.

463
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:04,083
He gave me a big surprise this morning.

464
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:05,683
He was sweeping the yard.

465
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:10,843
You should have had

466
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:12,843
him drink your tea earlier

467
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,443
so that I'd have got less scolding.

468
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:17,723
Yes.

469
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:19,403
Your dad has gotten old.

470
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:23,363
Now he's too old to scold you guys

471
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:26,003
and hit you.

472
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:29,843
After one gets old,

473
00:24:30,763 --> 00:24:32,123
they get less picky

474
00:24:33,683 --> 00:24:34,763
and less courageous.

475
00:24:36,523 --> 00:24:37,603
They say when one gets old,

476
00:24:38,003 --> 00:24:39,203
there's not much time left.

477
00:24:40,843 --> 00:24:42,083
Time is numbered.

478
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:44,683
Actually, I feel

479
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,563
once a person gets old,

480
00:24:48,523 --> 00:24:50,323
time seems
to stretch on especially long.

481
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,123
Guess what I'm thinking.

482
00:24:52,923 --> 00:24:54,723
I keep thinking about
when Spring Festival will come,

483
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:57,056
when you get holidays

484
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:59,363
and when you will come to see me.

485
00:25:01,683 --> 00:25:02,683
Once a person gets old,

486
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:06,043
they feel

487
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:09,963
time just goes by slower and slower.

488
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,163
But

489
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:16,003
don't worry about me.

490
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:19,043
I've lived a worthwhile life.

491
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,176
I married your grandmother,

492
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,203
the woman I loved.

493
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:25,312
I also worked

494
00:25:26,003 --> 00:25:27,923
as a carpenter, a job I enjoyed.

495
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:30,880
I raised a daughter,

496
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:33,323
who has never caused me
any worry in my lifetime.

497
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:35,883
She's filial.

498
00:25:37,723 --> 00:25:38,883
So are my grandsons.

499
00:25:39,643 --> 00:25:41,883
And my granddaughter-in-law
is filial too.

500
00:25:46,923 --> 00:25:47,643
I've gotten old,

501
00:25:48,243 --> 00:25:49,123
but I have my house,

502
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:51,163
live a comfortable life

503
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:55,043
and have a big family.

504
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,363
See?

505
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,243
Others get old and suffer from dementia,

506
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,923
but my mind isn't muddled at all.

507
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:01,883
Now,

508
00:26:03,043 --> 00:26:03,883
I often think of

509
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,963
your grandmother when she was alive,

510
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:09,403
she would fill the yard
with vegetables and flowers

511
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:10,763
and such.

512
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,443
You were riding a little wooden horse

513
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:17,643
around the whole yard.

514
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:18,923
"Grandpa,

515
00:26:19,723 --> 00:26:20,963
when I grow up,

516
00:26:21,203 --> 00:26:23,843
I will take you to some grasslands
to ride a big horse."

517
00:26:24,243 --> 00:26:25,243
You even said

518
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:27,283
that you'd buy me the grasslands.

519
00:26:35,323 --> 00:26:36,043
In a flash,

520
00:26:36,883 --> 00:26:37,723
you've grown up.

521
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:42,203
Child,

522
00:26:58,003 --> 00:26:58,843
I...

523
00:27:00,083 --> 00:27:01,443
I don't need you to buy some grasslands,

524
00:27:04,443 --> 00:27:06,403
nor do I need you to visit me every day.

525
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:10,603
I just want you to be healthy,

526
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:13,083
safe and sound.

527
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:15,123
Let me know

528
00:27:15,803 --> 00:27:18,363
you are well every day.

529
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,403
That's enough.

530
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:37,603
I'm fine.

531
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:38,563
Grandpa.

532
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:40,043
G-G-Good.

533
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:40,883
I've been doing fine.

534
00:27:41,123 --> 00:27:41,683
That's good.

535
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:45,643
Good.

536
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:51,043
Good.

537
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:54,083
That's good.

538
00:27:57,003 --> 00:27:57,803
That's good.

539
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:08,763
How come you're back?

540
00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:10,083
Where should I go?

541
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:11,803
Didn't you go back to your home?

542
00:28:12,763 --> 00:28:14,163
I went back to fulfill my filial duties.

543
00:28:14,563 --> 00:28:15,763
I didn't hit the mark.

544
00:28:17,883 --> 00:28:18,963
Isn't it not the Year of Ox?

545
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,643
I think at least one of them

546
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:23,323
should be born in the Year of Ox.

547
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,363
When I was a kid,
we had a bronze ox statue.

548
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:27,243
Why did they buy it
if it was not the Year of Ox?

549
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:30,003
What can you remember?

550
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:31,763
You don't even remember
your parents' age.

551
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,083
You messed it up, right?

552
00:28:33,603 --> 00:28:34,763
At least it's gold.

553
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:35,643
Oxen are seen

554
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:36,523
as a good omen.

555
00:28:37,403 --> 00:28:38,523
Why did you buy these things?

556
00:28:38,923 --> 00:28:40,160
Isn't it Spring Festival?

557
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,883
I need to get
some festive things for our place.

558
00:28:42,163 --> 00:28:43,392
What does this mean?

559
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,563
H-H-Hang this over there.

560
00:28:47,003 --> 00:28:47,723
What is this?

561
00:28:47,723 --> 00:28:49,683
Do you plan to get married
during Spring Festival?

562
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:51,043
The wedding decorations?

563
00:28:51,483 --> 00:28:52,963
The seller must have sent
the wrong item.

564
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:54,603
He Xindi, let me tell you.

565
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,443
You have to cut this thing yourself.

566
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:58,883
Find a piece of red paper
and a pair of scissors.

567
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,723
Sit by the window, looking outside,

568
00:29:01,003 --> 00:29:03,523
and cut out the sorrow
of not getting married piece by piece.

569
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:06,112
This seller is crazy. I don't want it.

570
00:29:06,923 --> 00:29:08,683
Don't do this. It's unlucky.

571
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:10,243
Keep it for now.

572
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:11,803
You'll get married eventually.

573
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:12,803
Hang it up later.

574
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:14,723
Aren't you going home this year?

575
00:29:14,723 --> 00:29:15,923
Going home? I have no home.

576
00:29:16,283 --> 00:29:16,803
I'll stay here.

577
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:19,083
Where should I stick this?

578
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:19,923
On the door?

579
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,083
This large "Fu" character.

580
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:23,923
Hang it there, on that wall.

581
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:25,283
- There?
- Yes.

582
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:29,803
Move it to the center, to the right.

583
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:30,643
Yes.

584
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,843
- Is it okay?
- A little higher.

585
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:47,323
Coming.

586
00:29:47,323 --> 00:29:48,363
Try this.

587
00:29:48,363 --> 00:29:49,056
Add a little to it.

588
00:29:49,056 --> 00:29:50,083
I can't beat him.

589
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:50,803
I can't.

590
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:52,363
How can they still run away?

591
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:53,123
Use less salt.

592
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,008
You're such a noob.

593
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:56,283
Stop playing games. Eat something.

594
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:57,603
Wait. I'll finish this round soon.

595
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:58,403
Get him some food.

596
00:29:58,403 --> 00:29:59,443
Have some water.

597
00:30:09,243 --> 00:30:09,963
Coming!

598
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,403
Hello, your delivery.

599
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:17,403
Wish you a pleasant meal.

600
00:30:17,403 --> 00:30:18,083
Happy New Year.

601
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:19,523
Happy New Year, thank you.

602
00:30:23,723 --> 00:30:24,843
- Why are you back?
- Give me.

603
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:25,883
Go change your clothes.

604
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,603
Change your shoes.
I just mopped the floor.

605
00:30:27,603 --> 00:30:28,403
Change your clothes.

606
00:30:28,963 --> 00:30:29,883
Why should I do it?

607
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:30,483
Go to my home.

608
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:32,723
Why?

609
00:30:32,723 --> 00:30:33,563
To have dinner.

610
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:35,923
I've just ordered some food.

611
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:36,803
Come on.

612
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,003
Eating takeout today?

613
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:39,603
Hurry up. Change your clothes.

614
00:30:40,563 --> 00:30:41,403
No need for that, right?

615
00:30:41,403 --> 00:30:43,003
Well, it's okay,
but at least change your shoes.

616
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:45,123
- Your family...
- Cut the small talk.

617
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:47,603
How could I leave you alone
at home to eat takeout for real?

618
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,563
Hurry up. My parents are waiting.

619
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:50,723
Go.

620
00:30:51,203 --> 00:30:52,483
I need to put on some makeup.

621
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:53,683
Why? It's not a blind date.

622
00:30:54,203 --> 00:30:55,283
Hurry up.

623
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:57,483
Wait a moment.

624
00:30:57,883 --> 00:30:58,723
I'll bring your mom cosmetics.

625
00:30:59,003 --> 00:30:59,643
Wait a moment.

626
00:31:00,523 --> 00:31:01,283
Hurry up.

627
00:31:03,763 --> 00:31:05,283
Change your shoes!
I just mopped the floor.

628
00:31:12,283 --> 00:31:14,163
What are they singing?
Why can't I hear it clearly?

629
00:31:14,843 --> 00:31:15,723
It's a live band.

630
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:16,563
All about the atmosphere.

631
00:31:17,163 --> 00:31:18,843
C-C-Can they be called a band?

632
00:31:19,243 --> 00:31:20,363
Without a touch of rock at all.

633
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:22,643
Mr. An, you even listen to rock?

634
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:24,832
What do you mean by "even"?

635
00:31:24,832 --> 00:31:26,363
I'm an old rocker, you know?

636
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:27,803
Rock.

637
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,603
Like...

638
00:31:28,963 --> 00:31:29,923
Like this...

639
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:30,803
Good.

640
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:33,083
Irritable.

641
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:36,363
Wait.

642
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:37,203
What's wrong, Mr. An?

643
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:38,443
I-I-I'm a bit confused.

644
00:31:38,483 --> 00:31:39,163
Want some water?

645
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:40,563
I got excited. It's nothing.

646
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:41,056
Do your thing.

647
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:42,603
Come on.

648
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,283
This Spring Festival

649
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:45,923
is meaningful

650
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,576
because we have
a new family member, Que.

651
00:31:49,483 --> 00:31:50,083
And next year,

652
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,083
there'll be one more,

653
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:52,803
my great-grandchild.

654
00:31:55,523 --> 00:31:57,683
Cheers. Let's wish everyone good health.

655
00:31:57,683 --> 00:31:58,403
Happy New Year.

656
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,683
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

657
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:34,683
You seem uncomfortable.

658
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:35,443
Who's uncomfortable?

659
00:32:37,283 --> 00:32:38,483
Guangpu says you're a Northeasterner

660
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:39,963
and eat dumplings
during Spring Festival.

661
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:41,443
Mr. Chen, you made this?

662
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:43,283
Thank you.

663
00:32:43,283 --> 00:32:44,083
Where's your mom?

664
00:32:44,243 --> 00:32:45,043
Call her out for dinner.

665
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:46,563
Mom!

666
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,123
I'm coming!

667
00:32:50,723 --> 00:32:51,483
Move aside.

668
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:54,283
He,

669
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,123
Guangpu didn't even give a heads-up.

670
00:32:57,923 --> 00:33:00,363
We didn't prepare anything.

671
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:03,243
Consider this a meeting gift.

672
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,563
Look, it has a diamond.

673
00:33:07,283 --> 00:33:08,443
A real diamond.

674
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:10,816
Mom, isn't it too valuable?

675
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:12,643
Mrs. Chen, this is too expensive.
I can't accept it.

676
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,363
What's so expensive about it?

677
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:16,483
It's his first time

678
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:17,963
bringing a girlfriend home.

679
00:33:18,083 --> 00:33:19,203
No, Mom.

680
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:20,963
Mrs. Chen,

681
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:22,803
Guangpu and I are not...

682
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:23,843
Just keep it for now.

683
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:25,243
As long as you don't find it ugly.

684
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:27,683
Her taste

685
00:33:27,683 --> 00:33:28,683
has always been not so great.

686
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:30,763
What good taste is needed?

687
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:31,803
Diamonds

688
00:33:32,203 --> 00:33:33,083
just need to look good.

689
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:34,083
Guangpu,

690
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:35,483
put it on for her.

691
00:33:36,123 --> 00:33:37,123
No, Mrs. Chen,

692
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:38,603
this is too expensive.
I can't accept it.

693
00:33:38,603 --> 00:33:39,523
I really can't take it.

694
00:33:39,763 --> 00:33:40,803
Just put it on as she said.

695
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:41,843
It's pretty good.

696
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:43,203
Try it on.

697
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:51,963
It looks good.

698
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,043
It's like it was
specially bought for you.

699
00:33:55,683 --> 00:33:56,763
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Chen.

700
00:33:56,923 --> 00:33:57,483
You're welcome.

701
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:00,643
Thank you.

702
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:03,648
We are a family.
Let's not talk about money.

703
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:06,603
Chen Guangpu is unreliable.

704
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,283
If he argues with you,

705
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:09,363
you teach him a lesson.

706
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:10,843
If you can't handle him, just tell me.

707
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,603
I'll make him behave with beatings.

708
00:34:13,024 --> 00:34:13,642
Okay, Mr. Chen.

709
00:34:15,003 --> 00:34:16,242
Let's eat.

710
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:17,283
Let's eat.

711
00:34:18,003 --> 00:34:18,563
Have a drink?

712
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:19,202
Yes.

713
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:21,323
Dad, you can't outdrink her.

714
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:22,202
- Hey.
- What?

715
00:34:22,202 --> 00:34:23,483
I said you can't outdrink her.

716
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:24,443
I'll drink with you today.

717
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,043
Mr. and Mrs. Chen, I toast to you.

718
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:27,162
Cheers.

719
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:28,003
I'll finish this glass.

720
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:31,963
- Look.
- Happy New Year.

721
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:32,843
Look.

722
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:37,763
Dumplings are here.

723
00:34:38,083 --> 00:34:39,523
Hurry, eat while it's hot.

724
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,440
Here you go, Mr. An.

725
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:42,682
Drink.

726
00:34:42,682 --> 00:34:43,443
Okay.

727
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:45,843
Okay, let's eat.

728
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:47,162
L-L-Let's have a drink first.

729
00:34:48,563 --> 00:34:49,162
It's Spring Festival.

730
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:50,843
Bao, Happy New Year.

731
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:52,403
Happy New Year.

732
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:53,963
Wishing you good health,

733
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:54,883
good luck and happiness.

734
00:34:54,883 --> 00:34:55,682
May you make a fortune.

735
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:56,603
Make a fortune.

736
00:34:58,283 --> 00:34:59,003
Right, let's...

737
00:34:59,403 --> 00:35:00,283
let's first

738
00:35:00,283 --> 00:35:01,963
give Que a video call on WeChat

739
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:03,923
to say "Happy New Year".

740
00:35:06,483 --> 00:35:07,243
My dad is calling.

741
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:08,083
Come on.

Say "Happy New Year".

744
00:35:10,043 --> 00:35:11,563
Dad, Happy New Year.

745
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:13,376

00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:27,243
he doesn't drink much.

753
00:35:27,456 --> 00:35:28,608
Que's dad,

754
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,443
I've saved some good wine for you here.

755
00:35:30,443 --> 00:35:32,243
Come to my place
during the festival to drink with me.

756
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:34,963
Sure, I'll come over and drink with you.

757
00:35:35,603 --> 00:35:37,083

This hand. Hold tight.
Use some strength.

787
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,803
You know about this disease.

788
00:38:23,803 --> 00:38:26,203
It goes from one part to another part.

789
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:27,603
It develops gradually

790
00:38:27,923 --> 00:38:28,843
over time,

791
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:32,043
from the upper limbs
and then slowly to the lower limbs.

792
00:38:32,883 --> 00:38:34,603
Slowly from the right side to the left.

793
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:36,003
His strength will worsen.

794
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:38,723
His muscles will atrophy more and more.

795
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,603
Eventually, it may affect

796
00:38:41,883 --> 00:38:43,323
like speaking,

797
00:38:43,963 --> 00:38:44,563
swallowing,

798
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,080
breathing, and so on.

00:38:47,563 --> 00:38:48,864
Even now,

800
00:38:49,643 --> 00:38:51,523
it's still difficult to fully control

801
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:52,603
and reverse it.

802
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:55,603
We can only try to delay
its progression as much as possible.

803
00:38:57,083 --> 00:38:58,483
So in terms of nutritional support,

804
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:00,483
respiratory management

805
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:02,243
as well as mindset control,

806
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,163
one must do their best

807
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,603
to potentially slow down the progression

808
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:08,563
of this disease.

have to worry anymore.
