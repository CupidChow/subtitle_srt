Wait. You stayed up all night.

Why are you still going to the company?

for me for a meeting.

Xu, your craftsmanship
is truly commendable.

94
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,268
It's made with meticulous precision
and keen attention to detail.

95
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,668
Wei, I really can't take
all the credit for this.

96
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:01,348

Look at the sample. It's made
perfectly straight and even.

that it's the work of a trained apprentice.

100

This isn't something learned in school.

101
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:17,508
One look and you can tell
that his potential

102
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:18,908
comes from making things in workshops.

103
00:09:19,668 --> 00:09:23,108
No wonder, Wei.

104
00:09:23,628 --> 00:09:28,748
Congratulations, you've got yourself
another excellent young carpenter.

105
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:32,788
Right, no problems
with the finished products, I hope?

106
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:34,908
No problems, better than I expected.

107
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:37,388
Mr. Xu is the best we have here.

108
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:43,828
Xu, deliver the first batch to Pengyu,

109
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,708
and Ji Jia will take the second batch.

110
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,108
We'll need to clear
some space over there.

111
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:49,668
Alright, I'll go make arrangements.

112
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:50,432
Thank you.

113
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:51,868
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

114
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:01,148
I never went to university. I started
working in the factory when I was 17.

115
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,508
Back then in my hometown,

116
00:10:05,308 --> 00:10:07,828
my master used to make square tables.
Everything is integrated

117
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:08,868
with digital control now,

118
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,548
but back then, it was particularly
demanding of skill. Purely handcrafted.

119
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:17,508
If you didn't apply even force by hand,
a board would be ruined.

120
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:19,308
If a board was wasted,
we would get beaten.

121
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,428
Couldn't have meals that day.

122
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:25,228
Later on, my master told me
that he was getting old.

123
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:28,188
But the craft of square tables
had to be passed down.

124
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,028
Back then, I really didn't
want to stay in my hometown.

125
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,508
I felt quite capable myself.

126
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,348
I want to try my luck,
and fight for my dreams.

127
00:10:33,348 --> 00:10:36,308
To do something big, to become
a great designer and make money.

128
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:37,428
I didn't want to stay there.

129
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,068
Every day I couldn't even
get enough to eat.

130
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,748
So I borrowed 2,000
and went to Shenzhen.

131
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:44,668
I joined a furniture factory.

132
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:46,868
Did you become a designer?

133
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,828
I wish. No, I was a salesperson.

134
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:57,388
Every day, I'd carry a bag
and sell furniture.

135
00:10:57,388 --> 00:10:59,188
For every deal, I got a 1% commission.

136
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:03,148
For that 1%, I had to drink heavily.

137
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:06,788
A bottle of liquor with each meal,
until my stomach bled.

138
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,148
Later, I finally closed a big deal.

139
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,668
A commission of 60,000 yuan.

140
00:11:14,748 --> 00:11:16,000
But my boss wouldn't pay up.

141
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:21,828
So I smashed his office and was detained
for five days because of fighting.

142
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:26,348
Thinking about it now,
all those years were wasted.

143
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:31,068
Afterward, I took the money I had saved
and went to study design.

144
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:33,268
One must learn.

145
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:37,628
Otherwise, I would have been
a nobody, a drink-pourer.

146
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,988
The past was really too harsh.

147
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:46,668
That's why I want to have
something sweet every day now.

148
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,988
When we founded Ji Jia,
there were only three of us.

149
00:11:51,988 --> 00:11:54,508
We worked from Shenzhen
to Guangzhou and then to Chongqing.

150
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:58,788
We made money,
but almost lost our crafts.

151
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:03,908
Seeing you reminds me of the time

152
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:06,988
when I wholeheartedly
wanted to be a designer.

153
00:12:06,988 --> 00:12:09,748
When I was earnestly
making things in the factory.

154
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:17,508
The original aspiration
can't be retained anymore.

155
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:25,908
Now I always think of my master.

156
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,828
The old man passed away in the workshop.

157
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:36,668
He was 76, passed away
holding a square table.

158
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:41,868
I let my master down.

159
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:46,988
I can no longer make the square table.

160
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,188
Leader, let me treat you to HW Coffee.

00:12:56,908 --> 00:13:00,788

00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:53,828
You look like a movie star.

175
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:55,428
This is my boyfriend.

176
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,468
Keep it down.

177
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,588
I'm embarrassed.

178
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:01,188
Hanging this up
is for others to see, isn't it?

179
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:03,268
Look at the product.

180
00:14:03,268 --> 00:14:04,708
Oh, I'll go check out my little table.

181
00:14:08,908 --> 00:14:14,028
It looks really nice,
but isn't it a bit small?

182
00:14:15,348 --> 00:14:16,068
Small?

183
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:17,068
A little.

184
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:17,748
Just wait.

185
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:22,788
How is it?

186
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:24,788
Not bad, this is a Transformer.

187
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,548

Hello, everyone.

226
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:52,588
Today, I will recommend
a dining table to everyone.

227
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,308
This isn't something
I sell in my livestream,

228
00:16:54,308 --> 00:16:55,748
but I strongly recommend it.

229
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:58,388
This is not an advertisement.
Please rest assured.

230
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:00,748
Let me show you this dining table.
It opens like this.

231
00:17:00,748 --> 00:17:02,428
Is she promoting the table
on her own initiative?

232
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:04,587
It transforms from a small table
into a big one.

233
00:17:04,587 --> 00:17:07,628
See? One table, two people,
three meals, four seasons.

234
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:11,148
This is the warmth of returning home
that is missing nowadays, friends.

235
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:13,188
She's really good at boasting.

236
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:16,748
In this case, give her
a microphone in a salesroom,

237
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:18,880
and selling 100 sets
wouldn't be a problem.

238
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,587
Is she getting a commission?

239
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:22,708
What commission?

240
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,788
When I bought it, there was
only a staff discount of 15% off.

241
00:17:25,788 --> 00:17:26,508
You bought it?

242
00:17:26,508 --> 00:17:27,067
Yeah.

243
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,988
As the designer, doesn't Lin Tuo
get one for free?

244
00:17:29,988 --> 00:17:30,948
No.

245
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,428
Why is Ji Jia so stingy?

246
00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:35,828
So, Mr. Chen, do you want to buy one?

247
00:17:37,228 --> 00:17:38,548
Didn't you give it to us?

248
00:17:38,548 --> 00:17:40,988
Right, then why not buy
another set for your parents?

249
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:43,708
Isn't your family relationship
a bit tense now?

250
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,588
Or do you really want
to cut all ties with them?

251
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:47,348
No, I won't.

252
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:49,988
Our family has such a big business,
and I am the only child.

253
00:17:49,988 --> 00:17:51,668
If I sever ties, who will inherit it?

254
00:17:51,668 --> 00:17:54,588
Exactly, so hurry up and buy a set.

255
00:17:54,588 --> 00:17:57,508
It might make your parents happy
and fix your relationship.

256
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:00,348
It makes sense.

257
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,028
Yes, indeed.

258
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,508
It's not expensive either,
so I can buy it.

259
00:18:03,428 --> 00:18:05,548
Alright, I'll go buy it in a bit.

260
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,588
Help me ask her for leave,
or she'll deduct my pay again.

261
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:09,348
No problem, hurry up and go.

262
00:18:09,348 --> 00:18:10,228
Thank you.

263
00:18:10,228 --> 00:18:10,908
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

264
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:14,548
It's at the Ji Jia's store.
You have to go get one.

265
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:16,788
Surprise your beloved home
with a beloved dining table.

266
00:18:16,788 --> 00:18:18,628
And have a meal with your loved ones.

267
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:11,098
Doctor,

268
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:13,536
(Rheumatology Specialist, Dr. Zhang Yucheng)
my condition is getting worse.

269
00:19:13,788 --> 00:19:15,348
My right-hand fingers
are already inflexible.

270
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:17,828
My arm is not as strong
as it used to be.

271
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,828
Sometimes I can't lift it.

272
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:22,628
Its height is limited.

273
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:26,668
For now, it's just
the right hand and arm, right?

274
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:31,268
Right, my left hand and legs
are not much affected.

275
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:37,228
I'm afraid that there might be
an issue with the neurons.

276
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:41,988
You can go to the neurology department
and look for Director Zhou Fumeng.

277
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:43,388
He is an authority in this field.

278
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,188
Neurology department.

279
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:49,108
Lift your arm up.

280
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:52,548
Okay, put some strength into it.
It's weak on this side.

281
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:57,868
Some strength here.

282
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:06,428
Good, now touch the tip of your nose,
back and forth.

283
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:15,108
Okay, relax.

284
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:23,148
Alright, stand up and walk a bit.

285
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:25,788
Good, turn around.

286
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:32,428
Walk on your tiptoes, come on.

287
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,788
Try walking with your heels, like this.

288
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:42,148
Can't lift your right foot?

289
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:44,428
A little.

290
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:46,628
Alright.

291
00:20:48,228 --> 00:20:50,268
It's been several months.
Why didn't you come earlier?

292
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,508
I didn't think it was serious before.

293
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:58,748
I thought I spent too much time
painting, and hurt my wrist.

294
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,028
Plus, I've always been
playing soccer all along.

295
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,188
I often have leg injuries as well.

296
00:21:04,868 --> 00:21:06,144
You young people

297
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:08,420
are so neglectful of your health.

298
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:11,188
What do you do?

299
00:21:11,908 --> 00:21:12,748
Furniture designer.

300
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,908
Are you exposed
to any special substances?

301
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,588
Heavy metals like lead and mercury?

302
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:22,508
No, I haven't.

303
00:21:25,428 --> 00:21:30,348
In that case, you need to be
hospitalized for further examination.

304
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:33,988
Do I have to be hospitalized now?

305
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,108
Doctor, what exactly is wrong with me?

306
00:21:40,028 --> 00:21:41,028
It's hard to say right now.

307
00:21:41,908 --> 00:21:43,188
The main purpose of hospitalization

308
00:21:43,188 --> 00:21:46,548
is to investigate the cause
of your symptoms.

309
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:50,468
Only by identifying the cause
can an accurate diagnosis

310
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,668
and appropriate treatment be possible.

311
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:54,868
Right away?

312
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:56,828
Do you want to delay it further?

313
00:22:00,588 --> 00:22:01,948
This is the hospital admission notice.

314
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:04,828
Wait for a phone call within three days
to process the admission.

315
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:07,348
You'll probably need
to stay for about a week.

316
00:22:09,228 --> 00:22:10,988
Does your family
know about your condition?

317
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:12,068
No, they don't.

318
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:16,668
Alright. Get hospitalized
for the examination first.

319
00:22:17,428 --> 00:22:21,308
Try not to be too nervous about it.

320
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:23,348
Maintain a positive mindset, okay?

321
00:22:24,068 --> 00:22:26,108
Okay, then I'll take a leave.

322
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,268
One week off?

323
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:30,628
What are you up to?

324
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:33,188
I need to go back home.

325
00:22:34,468 --> 00:22:36,788
You've just made some progress,
and now you're asking for a leave?

326
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:40,588
No, there's something at home.

327
00:22:41,268 --> 00:22:43,828
Personal matters, and I must go back.

328
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:50,848
Make sure to hand over
the Pengyu project well.

329
00:22:51,388 --> 00:22:52,468
I'll approve your annual leave.

330
00:22:53,028 --> 00:22:55,360
But it's only three days since you've been
on the job less than a year.

331
00:22:55,948 --> 00:22:57,148
So take another two days.

332
00:22:57,148 --> 00:23:00,188
Okay, thank you, Leader.
I'll come back as soon as I'm done.

My classmate has been abroad.

336
00:23:30,468 --> 00:23:33,348
He's come back for his wedding
and will stay for just a week.

337
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:37,108
So we thought we'd hang out together.

338
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:39,708
Who knows when we'll meet again?

339
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:40,508
Which classmate is it?

340
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:44,588
Xu Tianhai. You haven't met him.
He's been studying abroad.

342
00:23:57,108 --> 00:23:58,948
How about I go with you?

343
00:23:58,948 --> 00:24:00,308
I can also visit Grandpa
while I'm there.

344
00:24:01,428 --> 00:24:02,788
He's getting married on Wednesday.

345
00:24:02,788 --> 00:24:05,108
The shop is busy, so you should stay.

346
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:05,748
Alright.

347
00:24:13,268 --> 00:24:14,228

00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,108
Why are you using hands? Put it here.

350
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:40,468
Don't get hurt. Leave it there.

351
00:24:42,308 --> 00:24:44,228
Have you been too tired lately?

352
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:46,628
Maybe I didn't rest well.

353
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:50,548
I won't be staying home this time.

354
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:55,548
If my parents knew,
I'd have to stay home.

355
00:24:55,548 --> 00:24:56,868
Then I couldn't hang out with them.

356
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,908
I'll just go quietly
without telling my grandfather.

357
00:25:00,428 --> 00:25:02,908
I'm afraid I won't have time
to visit him and he'd have to wait.

358
00:25:03,988 --> 00:25:04,960
So where will you stay?

359
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:08,388
At Xu's place, and then we'll go
have fun at an Airbnb.

360
00:25:08,388 --> 00:25:09,228
I'll come straight back.

361
00:25:10,828 --> 00:25:11,388
Really?

362
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:13,948
Or what? Why would I lie to you?

363
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:15,948
Don't tell Grandpa.

364
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,948
Otherwise,
I won't be able to explain it.

365
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:19,788
I know. I'm not stupid.

366
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:21,028
How much do you plan to give him?

367
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:24,548
Oh, the gift money.

368
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:25,308
Right.

369
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:28,628
Two thousand.

370
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,868
Two thousand would be fine.

371
00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:32,588
Why don't you ask how much
they are all giving?

372
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:35,468
Don't give too little or too much.
It's a delicate matter.

373
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,508
Okay.

374
00:25:37,508 --> 00:25:38,388
I'll take out the trash.

375
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:42,468
Que.

376
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:46,748
Finish work early today, okay?

377
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:49,148
Okay, what's up?

378
00:25:50,388 --> 00:25:52,428
I've been too busy recently
to spend time with you.

379
00:25:52,428 --> 00:25:53,468
Let's go on a date today.

380
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:58,028
Have a meal, go shopping, watch a movie,
and buy you some new clothes.

381
00:25:58,028 --> 00:25:59,188
Sounds good.

382
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:01,588
Didn't you say a couple of days ago
that you wanted to sing karaoke?

383
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:02,388
Let's go tonight then.

384
00:26:04,028 --> 00:26:05,468
Why not invite those two as well?

385
00:26:07,668 --> 00:26:08,868
Okay, let's invite them along.

386
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:11,008
I'll take out the trash.

394
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:09,668
I won't.

395
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:11,552
(Lin Tuo is a pig)

396
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:17,908
What, who are you calling a pig?

397
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,108

Do it again.

404
00:28:01,908 --> 00:28:02,748
This is my mouth.

405
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:15,908
What are you drinking today?
It's all on me.

406
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:18,548
Red, white, beer, foreign drinks.
Drink whatever you like.

407
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:20,068
I'm not drinking today.

408
00:28:21,068 --> 00:28:22,348
What's going on?

409
00:28:22,348 --> 00:28:25,108
Why come to the karaoke bar and not
drink alcohol? Watermelon juice?

410
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:27,748
No, I'm leaving early in the morning.

411
00:28:28,308 --> 00:28:30,908
So what? A few bottles won't hurt.

412
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,468
Besides, you're not the one
getting married.

413
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:35,028
My stomach hurts.
I'm really not drinking.

414
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:38,188
Your stomach hurts, and my heart hurts.
Have a drink to ease it, will you?

415
00:28:39,188 --> 00:28:41,468
That's disgusting. You heard him.

416
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:43,200
If you make him drink today,
I'll knock you down.

417
00:28:45,188 --> 00:28:47,588
Does your stomach hurt?
I'll go buy you some medicine.

418
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:48,548
It's okay. I'll be fine.

419
00:28:49,108 --> 00:28:50,708
Alright, don't force him.

420
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:53,268
Chen Guangpu, I want
the special Little Bear mix.

421
00:28:53,268 --> 00:28:55,348
No way, too expensive. Let's have beer.

422
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,348
Agreed, one bottle of Little Bear each.

423
00:29:02,348 --> 00:29:04,068
Let's go, let's go.

424
00:29:04,068 --> 00:29:05,268
I want to drink now. Buy it now.

425
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:06,208
- Hurry.
- Fruit-flavored tea?

426
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:29,028
Guangpu.

427
00:29:30,388 --> 00:29:34,028
I'm going home tomorrow.
Please take good care of Que for me.

428
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,828
You're going back
to be the best man, not the groom.

429
00:29:38,828 --> 00:29:40,028
Aren't you coming back?

430
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:43,148
I am, but I'm leaving for a week.

431
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:46,628
Is there something going on?

432
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:51,868
What?

433
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:00,348
You've been acting strange all day.

434
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:03,308
You're not drinking,
like a wilted cucumber.

435
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:08,028
Is something up?
Did Gao Xinyao come back?

436
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:12,708
Are you crazy?
That's been over for so long.

437
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:16,188
Anyway, suddenly going home
for a week is not normal.

438
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:17,548
Is there something up?

439
00:30:20,188 --> 00:30:21,068
If there is something,

440
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:23,904
you'll be the first to know.

441
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:25,868
Of course. Let's go.

442
00:30:28,324 --> 00:30:30,020
(D2 Admission and Discharge Office)

443
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,080
Hi, I'd like
to check in for hospitalization.

444
00:30:45,824 --> 00:30:48,416
(Inpatient Department: Floors 5-16
Please take the C-D area elevator)

445
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:56,388
(I've arrived.
Don't worry, I'll call you later.)

446
00:30:59,268 --> 00:31:01,108
(Alright, have fun!)

447
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:19,844
(Patient Name: Lin Tuo)

448
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:41,108
(Mom, what are you doing?)

449
00:31:55,584 --> 00:31:57,056
(My dear old baby)

450
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,708
Grandpa, what are you doing?

451
00:32:07,108 --> 00:32:10,308
I'm fine, just missing you, that's all.

452
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:17,444
(HW Cafe)

453
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:35,364
(Have a meal with your beloved at home
Enjoy a cup of coffee here)

454
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:43,868
Senior, what are you doing here?

455
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,548
I was just nearby for a meeting,
so I came over for a piece of cake.

456
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,228
There's a new product.
I'll let you try it.

457
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:50,148
Take your time.

458
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:53,548
Let me tell you, the dining tables
designed by Lin Tuo are selling great.

459
00:32:53,548 --> 00:32:55,108
The big boss even asked about it today.

460
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:56,748
Really?

461
00:32:56,748 --> 00:32:57,388
Of course.

462
00:32:57,388 --> 00:32:59,388
Now even the big boss knows Lin Tuo?

463
00:32:59,388 --> 00:33:02,228
There's such an outstanding
young designer in the company.

464
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:03,908
It would be hard
for the big boss to not know.

465
00:33:03,908 --> 00:33:08,148
So, has he officially
become a designer now?

466
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:09,760
I didn't have the nerve
to ask him before.

467
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,428
I was worried it would be sensitive.

468
00:33:12,068 --> 00:33:13,668
Of course, he's a designer now.

469
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,268
Although he is still
the design assistant to Director Wei.

470
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:17,948
But he should soon
be able to become a designer.

471
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:19,428
Alright, that puts my mind at ease.

472
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:26,428
Lin Tuo's path as a designer
is getting smoother.

473
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:27,668
Your little shop is doing quite well.

474
00:33:28,628 --> 00:33:29,628
When are you getting married?

475
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:33,188
He's already told you?

476
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:38,708
Sorry, when I first sent in my resume,

477
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:42,508
I was afraid the company wouldn't allow
office romance, so I didn't tell you.

478
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,148
You could have told me.

479
00:33:46,908 --> 00:33:49,628
The two of us haven't even
discussed marriage yet.

480
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:54,948
Anyway, there's no hurry.
We'll strive for a few more years.

481
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,828
Sorry for taking up your time.
I'll get you a cake.

482
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:58,468
It's okay.

483
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:00,348
Please, have a seat.

484
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:05,188
- Chen Guangpu, hurry up.
- Coming.

485
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:07,188
- I told you to come early.
- Walking up the stairs is tiring.

486
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:09,548
Senior? What are you doing here?

487
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,548
Why didn't you give me a heads-up?

488
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:13,068
I almost couldn't make it today.

489
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:14,227
I was in the area.

490
00:34:14,227 --> 00:34:18,388
Wake up, He Xindi. He came to see me.

491
00:34:18,388 --> 00:34:19,588
Sorry about that, Senior.

492
00:34:19,588 --> 00:34:22,348
She's like this when she sees
an exceptional young man.

493
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:26,068
Chen Guangpu, really?

494
00:34:26,068 --> 00:34:27,548
I'm talking to him.
Mind your own business.

495
00:34:28,348 --> 00:34:31,748
Then let me kindly remind you
that you're not wearing makeup today.

496
00:34:33,428 --> 00:34:36,788
No, Senior, don't look at me.
This is not the real me right now.

497
00:34:36,788 --> 00:34:39,627
Just give me ten minutes
and I'll be right out. Wait.

498
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:41,108
My apologies. Senior. Please sit.

499
00:34:42,268 --> 00:34:44,028
Please roll up your sleeve a bit.

500
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,308
Okay.

501
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:46,508
Let's proceed with a checkup.

502
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:51,308
Alright, relax.

503
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:56,308
Push against my hand.

504
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:58,188
This finger, push against my hand.
Good, that's it.

505
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,148
Now we'll do the electric test.

506
00:35:48,788 --> 00:35:51,108
Alright, we've completed
the nerve conduction test.

507
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,148
Okay, let's continue.

508
00:36:24,828 --> 00:36:25,348
Que.

509
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:28,988
Why is there such a big echo?
Where you are?

510
00:36:30,428 --> 00:36:32,668
They're inside drinking, and it's noisy.

511
00:36:32,668 --> 00:36:33,828
I'm in the stairwell.

512
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:36,028
Drink less. Don't be hungover tomorrow.

513
00:36:36,788 --> 00:36:40,068
I know. I won't drink.
I'm going to sleep soon.

514
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:41,188
I must get up at five tomorrow.

515
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,268
Isn't the wedding in the afternoon?

516
00:36:45,668 --> 00:36:48,828
I mean the morning ceremony,
the ritual at the bride's home.

517
00:36:51,508 --> 00:36:53,308
Are there any pretty bridesmaids?

518
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:55,268
Don't worry, not a single one.

519
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:57,068
Moreover, they all have boyfriends.
None are single.

520
00:36:58,348 --> 00:37:00,388
You've asked about it, huh?

521
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,948
Why would I ask about that?
They told me.

522
00:37:02,948 --> 00:37:03,868
I don't know any of them.

523
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:07,348
I can't talk now. They're calling me.

524
00:37:07,948 --> 00:37:09,188
Okay, go ahead.

525
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,148
Rest early. Love you.

526
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:13,108
What are you doing. Smoking?

527
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:16,988
No, I was on the phone. I don't smoke.

528
00:37:16,988 --> 00:37:19,308
You have tests tomorrow.
Hurry back to the ward.

529
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:26,756
(Chongqing Baihui Hospital
Outpatient Department)

530
00:37:38,948 --> 00:37:40,308
Is your family in Chongqing?

531
00:37:42,148 --> 00:37:46,828
No, they're not. If there's anything,
you can tell me directly. It's fine.

532
00:37:49,988 --> 00:37:51,588
Really, it's okay.

533
00:37:56,068 --> 00:38:01,388
Then I'll tell you directly.
From the current examination results,

534
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:06,828
your diagnosis might be
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

535
00:38:09,108 --> 00:38:13,908
This disease often starts
with muscle weakness and atrophy.

536
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:17,668
It gradually spreads to other areas.

537
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:25,188
It is popularly known as 'ALS'.

538
00:38:31,508 --> 00:38:33,908
But if we are
considering this possibility,

539
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:39,548
we'll further confirm
whether it is genuine or not.

540
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:43,588
The cause of genuine ALS
cannot be found.

541
00:38:44,868 --> 00:38:48,068
False ALS is due to other reasons,

542
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:51,908
including tumors, endocrine,
or immune causes.

543
00:38:53,268 --> 00:38:55,348
So, there are still some results,

544
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:57,504
especially some regarding tumors
that haven't come back yet.

545
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,028
We need to wait a bit longer.

546
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:05,468
But overall, you need
to be mentally prepared.

547
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,468
Son.

548
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:39,708
Could I trouble you?
You see, I want to take a taxi.

549
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,348
I've been trying to hail one for ages,
but no luck.

550
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:44,588
Can you help me call one?

551
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:46,428
Alright.

552
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:47,136
Thank you.

553
00:39:48,708 --> 00:39:49,348
Where to?

554
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:53,948
Xingfu Sanli Community, North Gate.
The inexpensive type.

555
00:39:54,748 --> 00:39:55,308
Alright.

556
00:39:59,616 --> 00:40:00,640
(Chongqing Baihui Hospital EMG Report)

557
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:13,708
Son, you're not suffering
from ALS, are you?

558
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:18,668
Possibly.

559
00:40:22,828 --> 00:40:25,308
You're so young.
That shouldn't be the case.

560
00:40:27,428 --> 00:40:28,108
Is it confirmed?

561
00:40:30,548 --> 00:40:32,268
The doctor said more tests
are needed to rule out

562
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:34,148
the possibility of a tumor.

563
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:38,908
Well, it's not yet confirmed, right?

564
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:43,588
Diagnosing this disease
is quite troublesome.

565
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:46,028
I've seen a few misdiagnosed cases.

566
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:48,108
Among them, there were
actually cases of tumors.

567
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:51,508
What if it turns out to be a tumor?

568
00:40:51,508 --> 00:40:53,828
Nowadays, the medical care
is so advanced.

569
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:56,388
Tumors can be treated,
so don't frighten yourself.

570
00:40:59,028 --> 00:41:00,068
But what if it is confirmed?

571
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:03,988
Even then, it's not a problem.

572
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:09,708
Look at me. I've been diagnosed
with this illness for over a year.

573
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:12,748
I can walk and do everything else
without any issues now.

574
00:41:13,868 --> 00:41:17,068
You asked for Director Zhou, right?

575
00:41:18,428 --> 00:41:20,668
I was also diagnosed by Director Zhou.

576
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:24,188
Director Zhou is an
authoritative expert in this field.

577
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,408
As you can see, except for the fact
that I can't move this hand,

578
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:31,040
walking and such is not a problem.

579
00:41:31,588 --> 00:41:34,868
This illness is mainly
about one's mindset.

580
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,228
With a good mindset,
you're halfway to recovery.

581
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:39,508
Let's add each other on WeChat.

582
00:41:43,748 --> 00:41:46,068
Add me on WeChat.
My name is Yang Qiuguo.

583
00:41:47,108 --> 00:41:48,708
Everyone calls me Uncle Guo.

584
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:54,148
Son, it really doesn't matter
even if it is confirmed.

585
00:41:54,868 --> 00:41:58,308
If there's anything you don't know,
just message me on WeChat.

586
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:02,208
I've learned everything.
Long illness makes a good doctor.

587
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:05,948
It's nothing.
