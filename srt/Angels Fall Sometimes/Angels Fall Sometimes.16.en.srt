Dad.

15
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,590
You're still up?

16
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,150
I'm going to bed.

17
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,870
Is the sofa too small?

18
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,430
Sleep in the bedroom.

19
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,070
No.

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,070
It's fine.

21
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,310
I got up for some water.

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,310
Let me fetch it.

23
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,070
No need.

24
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:21,790
Look.

25
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,310
I know you like this.

26
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,830
So I got it for you.

27
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,470
But you got home late.

28
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,550
I'm worried it may

29
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,350
go bad in the fridge.

30
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,070
So I'm drinking it.

31
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:33,990
Is it nice?

32
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,150
Not bad.

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,430
A bit too sweet.

34
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,070
Let me try it.

35
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:47,870
It's too sweet.

36
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,430
It's with full sugar.

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,150
We get 30% sugar.

38
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,070
No wonder.

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,470
- Sit and have a chat?
- Sure.

40
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,552
Let's go.

41
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,510
Have it.

42
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,630
- It's too sweet for me.
- Okay.

43
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:25,910
Tuo.

44
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,710
I've always wanted to ask you something.

45
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,470
Did you sign up for a medical university

46
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,350
as one of the options?

47
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,310
Yes, I did.

48
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,150
But I scored too low.

49
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,750
So I lied and said I never applied.

50
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,470
But I would have gone
to a medical university if I had

51
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,270
scored high enough.

52
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,110
Y-You know what?

53
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,590
Back then,

54
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,790
I went through

55
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,830
so much to enter

56
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,869
the medical university.

57
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,710
I had to bike for two hours

58
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,790
to the cram school

59
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,990
after class every day.

60
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,470
It was so cold in the winter

61
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,590
I couldn't take it.

62
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,670
In the end, I set up

63
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,830
a bed in the storage room

64
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,270
in my classmate's house

65
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,630
in the county

66
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,110
and slept there.

67
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,910
The winter nights were freezing.

68
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,670
I dared not take off my shoes

69
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,870
or my hat.

70
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,270
It was so tough.

71
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,470
But I devoted myself

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,590
to the medical university
despite all that.

73
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,430
Because it had always been my dream.

74
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,550
My ambition.

75
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,950
Soon after I got enrolled,

76
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,190
I met your mom.

77
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,710
We didn't meet at school.

78
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,430
She was at the nursing school.

79
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,390
The medical university

80
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,270
changed my life.

81
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,350
It offered me love, marriage,

82
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,710
a job,

83
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,550
a family,

84
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,150
and two sons.

85
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,870
You've never mentioned it.

86
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,550
You've been

87
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,190
way too busy.

88
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,310
It's not because of that,

89
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,030
but my negligence.

90
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,950
Over the years,

91
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,510
I neglected your mom,

92
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,310
Ye and you.

93
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,350
I've seen too much

94
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,990
life and death at the hospital.

95
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,590
I really thought of myself as a savior.

96
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,470
Seeing the patients in agony,

97
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,270
I thought I could do more.

98
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,510
I wanted to be a chief physician,

99
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,190
a head of the department,

100
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,470
a professor, and even

101
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,390
a hospital director.

102
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,950
I was occupied

103
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:41,070
and forgot that I was also a husband

104
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,750
and a father to two kids.

105
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:47,790
Tuo,

106
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,270
I'm not a decent father.

107
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,710
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,750
Dad.

109
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,270
No.

110
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,830
Tuo.

111
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,830
I owe you an apology, too.

112
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,110
Mom.

113
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,270
My son.

115
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,430
Mom.

116
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,870
I'm the one who should apologize.

117
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,190
Dad.

118
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,630
Mom.

119
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,150
I'm dying young

120
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,070
and can't take care of you.

121
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,350
I should apologize.

122
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:00,950
Sorry.

123
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,750
We won't give up on you.

124
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,470
Son.

125
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:33,829
Don't give up on yourself, okay?

126
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:37,230
Let's hang in there, okay?

127
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,830
Let's not talk about

128
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,830
my problem in the next few days.

129
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,870
Just stay with me for the week.

130
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,870
Just stay with me

131
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,990
like in my childhood, okay?

132
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,230
- Just like in your childhood.
- Okay.

- Did you drive here?
- Yeah.

But you just arrived.

I'm not here for something.

139
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,390
And I don't

140
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,350
have work today.

141
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,830
Where did you park?

142
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:41,910
Are we heading

143
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,630
the same way?

144
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,510
Yeah.

145
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,070
Senior, are you going to play soccer

146
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,430
this weekend?

147
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,710
Yeah, it's a friendly match.

148
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,790
I told Chen Guangpu that

149
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,950
Que and I would go.

150
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:01,910
He said

151
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,150
it would be awkward

152
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,870
with Lin Tuo there.

153
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,950
I was trying

154
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,310
to make them see each other.

155
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,950
They broke up for no reason.

156
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,150
Both are stubborn.

157
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,390
Que can't let him go,

158
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,830
but she doesn't admit it.

159
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,190
Neither of them backs down.

160
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,590
It's going to be the end of it

161
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,310
unless we help them out.

162
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,070
What do you think?

163
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,830
Lin Tuo texted me that
he wouldn't make it

164
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,830
and asked for a week off from work.

165
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,750
What happened?

166
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,030
His parents came.

167
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,310
His parents came?

168
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,070
We have kitchen utensils,

169
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:46,950
furniture,

170
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,030
- and everything you need at home.
- So pretty.

171
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,270

173
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,870
My son is so handsome.

174
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,150
- I designed it.
- Really?

175
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,360
It's called "Let's Eat Together".

176
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,910

00:12:28,152 --> 00:12:34,291
♪I think even the wind

193
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:43,584
♪Listen to the care it brought by♪

194
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:51,618
♪There's still time.
What a beautiful phrase♪

195
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:59,129
♪But can the years ever stop♪

196
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,990
Don't break my heart.

197
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,910
You're home so early?

198
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,550
Why aren't you in the store?

199
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,230
Are you feeling unwell?

200
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,110
Let's not cook

201
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,390
if you're tired.

202
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,310
Let's eat out.

203
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,990
O-Otherwise,

204
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,030
let me get a take-out for you, okay?

205
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,030
What'd you like?

206
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,990
River snails rice noodles,

207
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:35,870
okay?

208
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,550
Okay, river snails rice noodles.

209
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,470
I'm getting it now.

210
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:54,710
We got this.

211
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,510
We got this.

212
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,550
We got this.

213
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,110
Hello.

214
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,110
Hello.

215
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,390
Senior.

216
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,990
I thought you weren't coming.

217
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,030
I had a plan

218
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,550
but I was done with it.

219
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,190
Would you like to play?

220
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,750
No, thanks. My arm is still injured.

221
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,590
And you? Are you playing?

222
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,190
No.

223
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,230
Why not?

224
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,950
I've gained too much weight.

225
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,190
So you can't play?

226
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,870
Keep working out.

227
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,510
Senior.

228
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,710
Senior, we're here.

229
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,710
Senior, I got a fruit tea
to cheer for you.

230
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,510
There are lychee, passionfruit,

231
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,470
and peaches.

232
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,710
I got it just for you.

233
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,830
Good luck.

234
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,550
- Thanks.
- No problem.

235
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,470
Lin Tuo, you're in the mood

236
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,670
for a soccer match?

237
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,670
What about your parents

238
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,790
and fiance?

239
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,590
- Whose fiance?
- His fiance.

240
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,750
Senior, don't listen to her.

241
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,950
Stay quiet or walk away.

242
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,110
Don't spread rumors.

243
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,190
I'm not here for you.

244
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,510
Shut up.

245
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,390
Everyone's here.

246
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,230
I'm going to get ready.

247
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,190
- Wait for me.
- Go.

248
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,870
Go for it.

249
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:10,830
All ready?

250
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

251
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,310
- Alright.
- Where are you going?

252
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,030
- Come on.
- Just stay.

253
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,230
We're here

254
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,430
for the senior.

255
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,710
Sit.

256
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,910
Go for it, Senior.

257
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,230
I thought he wouldn't come.

258
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,990
Senior told me he wouldn't come.

259
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,710
Or I wouldn't get you here.

260
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,110
Who knew he'd come?

261
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,630
Isn't it awkward for me to be here?

262
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,750
My goodness.

263
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:42,830
What?

264
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,710
You have to avoid him forever?

265
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,190
Why don't you move to another planet?

266
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,190
You can't possibly

267
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,670
avoid him.

268
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,270
Besides, you did nothing wrong.

269
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,750
Why are you awkward? Just sit tight.

270
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,630
He's the guilty one.

271
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,230
Want to leave?

272
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:03,590
We can leave.

273
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,790
- I'll text Senior.
- Let's stay.

274
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,790
Go for it, Senior.

275
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,110
Nice!

276
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,150
I won't get to watch soccer...

277
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,870
Go for it, Senior.

278
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,710
Keep going!

279
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,190
and see Que very often.

280
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,430
Nice!

281
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,910
- Go for it, Senior.
- Defend!

282
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,910
Nice, Senior!

283
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,910
- Nice!
- Pass it.

284
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,830
Go, Senior.

285
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,070
Pass the ball.

286
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,150
Defend!

287
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,510
Go for it, Senior!

288
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,150
This way.

289
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,990
Go forward. Defend!

290
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,990
Jiang Chucheng, go for it.

291
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,670
Pass the ball.

292
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,790
Run!

293
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:55,990
Back to defense!

294
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,630
Go for it, Senior.

295
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,990
Nice, Senior.

296
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:02,432
Pass the ball.

297
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,349
Shoot. Scored!

298
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,790
Nice!

299
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,310
After further systematic examination,

300
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,710
the possibility of immune-mediated

301
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:22,109
pseudo-ALS
can now be completely ruled out.

302
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,830
Meanwhile, the symptoms

303
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,790
have gotten worse for Lin Tuo.

304
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,910
So, you should be prepared.

305
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,110
You always praise your job as a doctor.

306
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,310
What's so great about it?

307
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,630
Our son is ill.

308
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,510
Can you cure him?

309
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,550
Tell me.

310
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,910
Think of something.

311
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:32,390
It's not an ordinary disease
with an easy cure.

312
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,830
What we should do

313
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,430
right now

314
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,910
is to get ready for the worst.

315
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,150
Like what?

316
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,470
What should I get ready for?

317
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,590
For the death of my son?

318
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,470
Do you hear yourself?

319
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,590
It's not something you can change.

320
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,990
You've worked in the hospital for years.

321
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,910
You've seen life and death, too.

322
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,510
Do I have to
explain to you how it works?

323
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,830
How is that the same?

324
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,270
That's my son.

325
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,830
I gave birth to him and raised him.

326
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,430
- He's only 23.
- Isn't he also my son?

327
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,190
You're the only one in pain?

328
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,750
Am I the one to blame?

329
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,310
Aren't you, Lin Shouzheng?

330
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:34,390
Have you looked after them?

331
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,910
You only care about your job.

332
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,270
You call it a career.

333
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,590
You've forgotten

334
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,110
that you have a wife and two sons.

335
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,590
You kept urging them
to enter the medical university.

336
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,430
Have you smiled at them?

337
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,550
Have you hugged them?

338
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,870
Have you shown affection?

339
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,790
You're not a proper father.

340
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,590
(We take countless tests, growing up.)

341
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,470
(We have to be good students at school)

342
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,550
(and good staff at work.)

343
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,790
(Tests are fair.)

344
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,110
(We get kicked out once we fail.)

345
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,190
(But there are no tests
for potential parents.)

346
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,110
(Children do not get to)

347
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,190
(choose their parents.)

348
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,750
(They're born to accept their fate.)

349
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,470
(This test is missing.)

350
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:05,150
(So it's not fair.)

351
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,190
(How many parents
have truly assessed themselves?)

352
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,110
(They may love their children,)

353
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,310
(but there's no excuse
to fail as parents.)

354
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,150
(Tuo.)

355
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,310
(Your mom and I love you so much.)

356
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,510
(But we've failed)

357
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,030
(this test.)

358
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,110
Move.

359
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:48,950
Hey.

360
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,870
What are you doing?

361
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,550
He Xindi.

362
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,110
It's taken. Sit in the back.

363
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,790
What's your problem? Get off.

364
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,830
What's your problem?

365
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,390
Well,

366
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,710
someone has a problem and he knows it.

367
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,390
Watch your mouth, He Xindi.

368
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,310
Where is Que?

369
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,430
She went back.

370
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,390
Come on, Sister.

371
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,870
It's a buddy's night. Leave us alone.

372
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,910
What?

373
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,710
We're no longer buddies because

374
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,990
they broke up?

375
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,630
You're not my buddy.

376
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,510
It's not like I want to be.

377
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,510
Well, relax.

378
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,350
I just want to

379
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,830
see what you guys do every day.

380
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,830
Senior, let's go.

381
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,390
Let's go.

382
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,070
What's this?

383
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,630
It's good.

384
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,750
Let me get you some.

385
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,190
What's that?

386
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,070
Mushroom?

387
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,190
I don't know what it is.

388
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,070
Won't you let us eat?

389
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,150
There is nothing you like?

390
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,390
Get something you like.

391
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,310
No, thanks.

392
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,230
It's a lot.

393
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,750
I don't have much appetite.

394
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,150
Why are you staying?

395
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,870
Just leave.

396
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,390
I'm training myself

397
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,430
to recognize

398
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,390
cheaters.

399
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,030
- Who is a cheater?
- He.

400
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,710
Did you get something wrong?

401
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,590
Not at all.

402
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,510
He cheated.

403
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,270
Cheater.

404
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:38,830
Lin Tuo, do you swear that

405
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,430
you've never cheated on Que?

406
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:41,910
Do you?

407
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,070
Let's make things clear today.

408
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,590
Lin Tuo, if I've wronged you,

409
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,230
explain it.

410
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:00,910
There's nothing to explain.

411
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,030
So you admitted.

412
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,310
Lin Tuo, did you cheat on Que?

413
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,350
Did you?

414
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,470
Lin Tuo, say it!

415
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,430
Let go.

416
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,790
I need a word with you.

417
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,230
What? I'm not done.

418
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,150
Are you done? Come with me.

419
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:18,350
- Chen Guangpu, let go!
- Come.

420
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,070
Guangpu.

421
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,670
Stay. I'll talk to her.

422
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,430
Let's go.

423
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,910
Chen Guangpu, let go!

424
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,030
Let's talk out there.

425
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,030
Chen Guangpu, let go.

426
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,990
You're hurting me.

427
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,390
I wasn't done! What are you doing?

428
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,390
What's wrong with you?

429
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,550
It hurts! What's your problem?

430
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,350
He Xindi, I've been putting up with you.

431
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,310
Listen.

432
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,430
Lin Tuo didn't

433
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,430
cheat on An Zhique.

434
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,590
I won't let you off

435
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,430
if you ever

436
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:46,550
slander him again.

437
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,990
Get lost.

438
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,430
Was she telling the truth?

439
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,910
So why did you break up with Que?

440
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,390
Why did she say that?

441
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,390
And why are you asking for days off?

442
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,350
How did you get hurt?

443
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,030
What's going on?

444
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,630
Just stop, Senior.

445
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,270
He got ill.

446
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:29,670
His right hand is failing.

447
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,470
Guangpu.

448
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,350
His right hand is failing.

449
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,150
Like this.

450
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:39,870
Like this.

451
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,350
Chen Guangpu.

452
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,110
Why are you still trying to hide it?

453
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,070
Seriously?

454
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,630
When are you going to

455
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,230
tell them the truth?

456
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,750
When your left hand

457
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,910
fails as well?

458
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,710
When you're in a wheelchair?

459
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,390
Do you enjoy being misunderstood?

460
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,392
Have some water.

461
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,350
Have some water.

462
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,230
Senior.

463
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:42,710
Do you think

464
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,910
there are gods in the world?

465
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,150
If...

466
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,190
If there are,

467
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,910
take me to worship them

468
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,270
and ask them to save Lin Tuo.

469
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,070
Only a human can save Lin Tuo.

470
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,190
No matter how bad

471
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,630
or difficult it is,

472
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,510
we have to help him.

473
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,230
You hear me?

474
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,070
Anybody?

475
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,510
Please.

476
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,390
Please save my buddy.

477
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,870
Save Lin Tuo.

478
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,590
I beg you.

479
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:46,110
I beg you.

480
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,950
Sister, what's wrong with them?

481
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,230
Isn't it obvious? They're fighting.

482
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,750
Are they in a relationship?

483
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,190
Do you think it's possible?

484
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,110
I think

485
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,150
Guangpu kind of likes Xindi.

486
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,510
Xindi likes Senior.

487
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,350
Senior likes you.

488
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,270
How did you figure it out, kiddo?

489
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,550
What's so hard about it?

490
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,870
Isn't it obvious?

491
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,590
Don't say that it's dramatic.

492
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,550
It's very common among friends.

493
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,990
You're attracted to each other.

494
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,990
Tell you what.

495
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,630
We have a circle here.

496
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,070
It's the same in that restaurant.

497
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,430
The chef likes the waitress,

498
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,190
who likes the manager,

499
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,190
who has a wife.

500
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,430
How do you know?

501
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,630
We talk when we take the trash out.

502
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,190
Who do you like?

503
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:18,190
Don't tell anyone else.

504
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:24,350
I kind of like the girl
from the lemon tea place.

505
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,030
No wonder you always get things there.

506
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,230
You should have told me.

507
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,870
I know her. Let me introduce you.

508
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,430
No rush.

509
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,110
It has to happen naturally.

510
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,550
Good luck.

511
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,190
He Xindi.

512
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,750
Why did you delete my game account?

513
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,390
How dare you?

514
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,950
Stand there. Explain it.

515
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,310
They'll end up together.

516
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:45,470
You'll see.

517
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,990
Mom, Dad.

518
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,030
I know you're thinking about
retiring early

519
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:10,510
to look after me.

520
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,790
I totally understand.

521
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,190
But it's going to be a lengthy progress.

522
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,710
I don't want to live like a dying man

523
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,070
when I'm still able
to take care of myself.

524
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,190
I hope you can
treat me as a normal person.

525
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,790
If I need someone

526
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,670
to look after me one day,

527
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,230
you can take over from there.

528
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:40,870
Right?

529
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,270
I'd like to savor the rest

530
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,270
of my healthy days.

531
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,950
I'd like to keep working.

532
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,070
It's not time to give up yet.

533
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,830
That's right.

534
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,110
You're a grown man. So act like one.

535
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,270
That's right.

536
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,350
Do whatever you want.

537
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,310
Your mom and I will support you

538
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,030
and respect you.

539
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,030
We are

540
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:16,910
going back tomorrow.

541
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:19,870
Call us if you need something.

542
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,150
Go back.

543
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,750
I'll stay a bit more.

544
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,430
He's a grown man.

545
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,230
He's alright.

546
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,190
He got this.

547
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,230
Come with me tomorrow.

548
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,310
Are you serious?

549
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,750
Don't you see his right arm?

550
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,310
He can't even get dressed.

551
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,150
I won't disturb you.

552
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,550
You can go to work.

553
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,790
I'll just cook for you.

554
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,710
Mom.

555
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,110
My left hand is still working.

556
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,190
I won't starve.

557
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,910
Yeah, that's it.

558
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,790
We'll go home tomorrow morning.

559
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,870
Dig in, Mom.

560
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,750
Isn't it the semi-finals

561
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,870
of the Champions League?

562
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,830
- Yeah.
- Dig in.

563
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:57,470
Hurry up.

564
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,310
Chen Guangpu.

565
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,670
What's going on?

566
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:11,950
You're leaving?

567
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,990
Listen.

568
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,990
I signed the contract for a year.

569
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,230
Am I going to pay the rent

570
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,070
by myself?

571
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,310
When did I say I was leaving?

572
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,270
But you...

573
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,230
What's that for?

574
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,230
Why do you care?

575
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,030
Who are you to me?

576
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,350
I'm your roommate

577
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,390
and business partner.

578
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,750
How come you forgot that

579
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,270
when you deleted my account?

580
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,710
Chen Guangpu.

581
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,950
You're turning against me
for a stupid game?

582
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,390
Remember how you
dragged me out in front of Senior?

583
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,510
How am I going to face him?

584
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,070
You started it.

585
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,790
He Xindi.

586
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,270
Let me be clear.

587
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:49,870
He doesn't like you.

588
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,950
He likes An Zhique.

589
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,790
It's pointless for you to be so sticky.

590
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,310
Wake up.

591
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,190
Who says I like him?

592
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,990
I just admire him, okay?

593
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,390
Who says I want to date him?

594
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,510
We're just friends.

595
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,790
Fine, move away.

596
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,350
Get all your stuff. Get out of here.

597
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,270
- But you're still paying the rent.
- I...

598
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,950
I'm going on a date.

599
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,150
You know I have many pursuers, right?

600
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,150
Yeah.

601
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:41,990
No, I don't.

602
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:42,670
I didn't.

603
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,470
But now I do.

604
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,190
Good.

605
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,990
I'm never in need of a boyfriend.

606
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,830
All my pursuers
are either rich or handsome.

607
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:52,910
I'm single only because

608
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,390
I'm too busy building

609
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,430
my career.

610
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,550
That's why I'm not seeing anyone.

611
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,590
You get it?

612
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,030
Y-Yeah.

613
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,190
Good for you.

614
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,510
Que just broke up.

615
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,510
She's not ready to see anyone.

616
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:09,030
Both of us are staying single for now.

617
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,830
We won't get married before 30.

618
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:20,709
Alright, I'm leaving.

619
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:23,990
- Please step aside.
- Okay.

620
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,310
Have a nice time.

621
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,790
- Bye.
- Bye.

622
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,830
What's wrong with her?

623
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,910
I don't know what happened to her.

624
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,030
She came in and said

625
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:40,390
she'd stay single

626
00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:41,749
with me forever.

627
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,229
All guys are untrustworthy.

628
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,870
She fought with Guangpu.

629
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,870
That's a sign of them falling in love.

630
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,709
Ignore her. She's always like that.

631
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,030
What would you like?

632
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,269
An Iced Americano. Takeaway.

633
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,230
- Okay, just a second.
- Thanks.

634
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,750
- Mom.
- Did you have breakfast?

635
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:13,950
Not yet.

636
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,950
I'll have breakfast

637
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,870
with Senior.

638
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,350
Alright.

639
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,390
Thank him for me.

640
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,470
Got it.

641
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,190
I'll go wash up.

642
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,590
Wait, your dad is coming.

643
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,470
It's our son.

644
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,750
Alright, go ahead.

645
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,550
Dad.

646
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,670
- How's it going?
- So far so good.

647
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,470
I-It's raining here.

648
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,470
How's the weather in Chongqing?

649
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,390
It's not raining.

650
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,670
Just cloudy.

651
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,790
- Get an umbrella with you.
- Okay.

652
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,070
- Morning.
- Senior.

653
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,390
Let me.

654
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,990
You sure you won't tell Que?

655
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,270
Yeah, I'm sure.

656
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,510
It's only a matter of time.

657
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,270
The later the better.

658
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,590
Maybe after she starts dating

659
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,150
someone else.

660
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,830
Even if she finds out then,

661
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,790
it'll be over.

662
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,950
How do you know
she wouldn't accept your illness?

663
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,230
It's me who can't accept my illness.

664
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,430
And I hate to implicate her.

665
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:56,190
It's just dating after all.

666
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:58,110
Why should I force her, in her 20s,

667
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,870
take care of a sick person like me?

668
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,030
But she deserves to know.

669
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:06,950
At least, she gets to choose,

670
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,350
unlike what's happening now.

671
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,670
She thinks you've

672
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:12,950
abandoned her.

673
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:16,830
How is she supposed to accept that?

674
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,150
Senior.

675
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,230
Think about it.

676
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,630
What should Que do

677
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,350
once she finds out?

678
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,870
If she chooses to stand by me,

679
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,750
she'll have to
take care of a disabled man.

680
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,470
If she chooses to leave,

681
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,470
she'll be burdened with the guilt
of abandoning me.

682
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,190
It's a disaster for her no matter what.

683
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,990
I've thought about it carefully.

684
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,750
I've also considered finding an excuse

685
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,630
to break up with her more naturally.

686
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,670
But she's going to get hurt anyway.

687
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,790
I'd rather keep it simple,

688
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,870
like what I'm doing now.

689
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,670
