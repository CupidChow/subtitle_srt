When will it stop raining?

The rain won't stop for a while.

What do you want to do?

20
00:02:18,548 --> 00:02:20,788
I want to take you to ride the horse,

21
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:23,068
take a plane, and climb mountains.

22
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:27,108
And I want to take you
on a big ship in the Pacific.

23
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:29,228
Okay, I will be waiting.

Waiting for you to grow up

25
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:32,308

climb mountains, take a plane,

27
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:36,748
and sail in the Pacific Ocean

00:02:37,228 --> 00:02:37,708
Okay.

(Let's Meet In Heaven)

00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:10,548
(Tuo wants to go to the nursing home.)

31
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,628
He's getting worse and worse.

32
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:16,108
He can't even move a mouse
with his left hand.

33
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:18,708
Going to the toilet
has become a problem too.

34
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:21,988
I don't know if I should send him there.

35
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:24,308
At this stage,

36
00:03:24,428 --> 00:03:26,388
the probability of an accident

37
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:27,628
is not particularly great.

38
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:29,988
But he does need

39
00:03:30,148 --> 00:03:31,508
the full-time care.

40
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:33,108
And he

41
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:35,428
might collapse.

42
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:38,188
Sometimes there would be depression.

43
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:40,388
So please brace yourselves

44
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,788
for this new phase.

45
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:47,108
Alright.

46
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:55,108

They're all works I really like.

00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,308
Some are just drafts
that aren't finished yet.

50
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,148
I have nothing to leave Ji Jia

51
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:23,908
but these.

52
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:28,628

55
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:41,308
I'll do a good job on my last day.

56
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,188
Okay.

57
00:04:57,508 --> 00:04:58,628

152
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,508
Do you know each other?

153

You have been working here
as a caretaker?

159
00:12:16,428 --> 00:12:18,508
Not really. I came here
to be a volunteer

160
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:19,948
and learn some nursing knowledge.

161
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:22,308
It's not that easy to be a caretaker.

162
00:12:24,108 --> 00:12:25,308
Then you chat with Uncle Guo.

163
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:26,468
I'll go do the paperwork.

164
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:28,948
- I'm off.
- Go ahead.

168
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:44,228
to study nursing.

169
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:45,868
That's rare.

170
00:12:47,828 --> 00:12:49,348
I didn't even know about that.

171
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:52,228
I've been

172
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:53,908
a burden to her.

173
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,668
You are a family.

175
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:01,428
we would be a burden to each other.

176
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:03,708

This is Dong Dong and Dong Dong's mom.

189
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:25,708
Just call her Yan.

190
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:27,588
Hello, Yan.

191
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:28,388
Hello.

192
00:13:28,388 --> 00:13:29,188
This is my son.

193
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,308
Dong Dong, say hello.

194
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:31,668
Hello.

195
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:32,228
Hello.

196
00:13:33,148 --> 00:13:34,548
Let's go have some water.

197
00:13:35,308 --> 00:13:35,828
Look.

198
00:13:36,468 --> 00:13:37,748
It's fate for us

199
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,228
to live in the same ward.

200
00:13:39,748 --> 00:13:42,668
It's lively now, right?

201
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:44,468
I'll

202
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:46,148
show you around

203
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:47,828
and make some introduction.

204
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:52,028
Lin.

205
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,468
Join our group.

206
00:13:54,748 --> 00:13:55,508
Light of Hope.

207
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:56,748
They're all patients here.

208
00:13:57,948 --> 00:13:58,868
Every day,

209
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:02,428
(Light of Hope Group Chat)
we share nursing and treatment info,

210
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,068
and things to take note.

211
00:14:04,268 --> 00:14:06,028
It's so useful.

212
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:07,628
Que.

213
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:09,868
Help Lin join our group later.

214
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:11,508
Okay, I'll do it.

215
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:15,908
Dong Dong is really well-behaved today.

216
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,068
What are you eating?

217
00:14:18,508 --> 00:14:19,108
Noodles.

218
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:20,868
Noodles.

219
00:14:21,148 --> 00:14:22,548
They look very delicious.

220
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:23,588
Eat well.

221
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:24,828
Eating properly

222
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:26,548
can make you grow up fast.

223
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:28,028
Have you eaten?

224
00:14:28,348 --> 00:14:28,948
Yes.

225
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:30,308
I just ate.

226
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:34,068
Xiao from the first floor took a fall.

227
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,548
He was making a fuss.

228
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,268
I just went to talk to him.

229
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,868
He vented his anger to his wife,

230
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:42,348
making her so mad.

231
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:44,228
Alas.

232
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,148
Having a wife

233
00:14:46,348 --> 00:14:47,708
to take care of him

234
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:49,548
is such a great blessing.

235
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:50,908
Yet, he's still not satisfied.

236
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,028
Later

237
00:14:52,268 --> 00:14:53,268
I'll go and talk to him again.

238
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:56,788
Have you two eaten?

239
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:58,028
Not yet.

240
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,188
Hurry and go get some.

241
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:01,948
- There is food in the canteen.
- Okay.

242
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:03,308
Today's dishes are good.

243
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:04,668
Alright, I'll go later.

244
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:06,308
Uncle Guo.

245
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:08,668
I need you!

246
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,308
Who is it?

247
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:10,948
Coming.

248
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,388
Can you help me with this ventilator?

249
00:15:20,108 --> 00:15:21,228
Uncle Guo speaks

250
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,548
like a host in a training session.

251
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,628
Thanks to him.

252
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:27,428
When people here can no longer hold on,

253
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:28,868
it's Uncle Guo who soothes them.

254
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:31,668
Uncle Guo's illness doesn't
seem to be very serious.

255
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:33,228
With such good spirits.

256
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:36,028
He's been like this for three years.

257
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:37,388
His right hand can still move.

258
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:39,868
The doctor said he has a strong will.

259
00:15:40,228 --> 00:15:41,228
Sometimes,

260
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:42,468
I think he's healthy.

261
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,508
He's so energetic.

262
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:47,908
Mom, I don't want to eat anymore.

263
00:15:47,908 --> 00:15:49,668
Just a few more bites.

264
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:51,904
Finish it and you'll grow taller.

265
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,348
Baby, be good.

266
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,548
How can you grow taller

267
00:15:57,828 --> 00:15:59,068
or get better if you don't eat?

268
00:15:59,748 --> 00:16:01,148
Dong Dong, look.

269
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:02,268
What is this?

270
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,032
A lollipop.

271
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:05,828
You have to finish eating.

272
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,908
And then we can have the lollipop, okay?

273
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:09,028
Eat up.

274
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:12,028
Come on, take a big bite.

275
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:14,148
Good.

276
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,708
Thanks, Que.

277
00:16:18,628 --> 00:16:19,148
Another bite.

278
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:29,548
I've put the water by your bedside.

279
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:32,188
If you need anything,
just tell the caregiver.

280
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:33,708
She makes rounds every night.

281
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,428
Just call me if you need anything.

282
00:16:40,188 --> 00:16:40,748
Que.

283
00:16:41,228 --> 00:16:42,388
Just go.

284
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,308
I would take good care of Lin

285
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:45,948
for you.

286
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:47,788
Thank you, Uncle Guo.

287
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,428
Don't mention it.

288
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:52,188
I'm leaving then.

289
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:53,548
I'll come see you tomorrow.

290
00:16:54,028 --> 00:16:54,828
You go with your work.

291
00:16:55,108 --> 00:16:56,028
Come after you finish.

292
00:16:58,588 --> 00:16:59,168
Good night.

293
00:16:59,168 --> 00:16:59,908
Good night.

294
00:17:00,548 --> 00:17:01,068
I'm leaving.

295
00:17:01,868 --> 00:17:02,508
Goodbye, Uncle Guo.

296
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,827
Goodbye, be careful on the road.

297
00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:05,347
Okay.

298
00:17:05,587 --> 00:17:06,228
Bye.

299
00:17:31,748 --> 00:17:32,388
Yan.

300
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:33,588
Que.

301
00:17:33,588 --> 00:17:34,508
You are still working?

302
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,148
Right. Dong Dong just fell asleep,

303
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:37,268
so I can get the work done.

304
00:17:37,548 --> 00:17:38,068
Leaving?

305
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,068
Tuo is moving in today.

306
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,588
Please take care of him if you can.

307
00:17:43,108 --> 00:17:44,468
Sure thing. Don't worry.

308
00:17:44,828 --> 00:17:45,508
Be careful.

309
00:17:45,668 --> 00:17:46,628
Alright, I'm off.

310
00:17:47,308 --> 00:17:48,268
Sorry I would step on it.

311
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:49,188
It's okay.

312
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:50,188
Careful. It's slippery.

313
00:17:50,188 --> 00:17:50,948
Goodbye, Yan.

314
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,548
Bye.

315
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:10,188
Lin Tuo.

316
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,068
Keep your voice down.

317
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:12,428
We are here.

318
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:12,908
Lin Tuo.

319
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:16,748
This place is nice.

320
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:17,788
It's bright and tidy.

321
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:19,788
Cut the crap.

322
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,108
If you like it, stay the night.

323
00:19:21,588 --> 00:19:23,428
I don't want
to waste the public resource.

324
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:24,948
Where's Que?

325
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:26,908
She's out for shopping.

326
00:19:27,348 --> 00:19:29,908
Tuo, this is a ward for three people?

327
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:31,068
Any single ward?

328
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,188
All single wards
are intensive care units.

329
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,268
Intensive care units?

330
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,188
Let's get one too.
How much does it cost?

331
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:38,588
That's for special care.

332
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:40,428
Not like first class
where you can pay for it.

333
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:42,028
It's for those with serious conditions.

334
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:43,308
He's doing fine now.

335
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:45,588
Right. Well,

336
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:46,508
regular care is fine.

337
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,388
It's lively then.

338
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:50,308
Is Que coming to stay overnight?

339
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:54,228
There's no spare bed here,
so she can't stay.

340
00:19:56,748 --> 00:19:57,788
And I don't want her to stay.

341
00:19:59,668 --> 00:20:01,748
This bed of yours is quite fancy.

342
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:02,668
It can raise up

343
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:03,548
like a Transformer.

344
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:04,188
Indeed.

345
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:05,788
It's bouncy. Give it a try.

346
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,268
Really?

347
00:20:07,588 --> 00:20:09,348
I think this mattress'
made of natural latex.

348
00:20:09,348 --> 00:20:10,188
- Right.
- Comfortable.

349
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,388
I think it's nice.

350
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:13,988
It's good.

351
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,428
The soccer match, do you...

352
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:18,988
Your senior? What did he say?

353
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:20,896
Didn't catch that.

354
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:21,868
Hear it again.

355
00:20:22,068 --> 00:20:23,148
Want some fruit? I'll wash some.

356
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:25,628
And the yogurt.

357
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:26,588
Y-Y-Yogurt.

358
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,548
I'll get you a yogurt.

359
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:29,508
Open that yogurt.

360
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,360
(You'ai Rehabilitation Nursing Home)

361
00:20:41,028 --> 00:20:42,028
Time to eat.

362
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:45,748
I'm not hungry.

363
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,068
You should eat some.

364
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:50,828
Don't want to eat.

365
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:56,068
Do you find it boring here?

366
00:20:57,908 --> 00:20:58,428
No.

367
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:02,468
Lin.

368
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,148
Uncle Guo.

369
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:04,948
Want to watch the game?

370
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,400
Yes.

371
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:08,108
Come on, Uncle Guo.

372
00:21:08,108 --> 00:21:08,628
Okay.

373
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,068
What are you watching?

374
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:13,548
World Cup qualifiers.

375
00:21:14,548 --> 00:21:15,588
China vs. Philippines, right?

376
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:16,268
Yes.

377
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:17,668
Can you see it?

378
00:21:17,668 --> 00:21:18,268
Yes.

379
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:20,228
I'll go get some water for you.

380
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,708
Header.

381
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:23,988
What's the score?

382
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:26,308
One to zero.

383
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:30,228
Run!

384
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:31,268
Pass the ball! Pass...

385
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,228
If I could...

386
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:36,628
Good.

387
00:21:37,268 --> 00:21:38,148
Got penalized again.

388
00:21:38,148 --> 00:21:38,880
Oh my.

389
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,028
Bao, what time is it?

390
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:15,588
It's almost 11.

391
00:22:15,788 --> 00:22:16,388
11 o'clock.

392
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:18,188
I have to go deliver food.

393
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,988
Isn't there a caregiver over there?

394
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,668
I can't let Tuo think he's left alone

395
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:24,228
just because he's in the nursing home.

396
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:25,028
Right?

397
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:26,548
Yes.

398
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:27,508
I'm leaving.

399
00:22:27,828 --> 00:22:28,628
Take care.

400
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:29,428
You go ahead.

401
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:37,228
Hello, Auntie.

402
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:35,188
Dad.

403
00:23:37,856 --> 00:23:38,388
Dad.

404
00:23:47,508 --> 00:23:48,028
Uncle.

405
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:49,948
Tuo.

406
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:55,068
Come say your goodbyes.

407
00:23:57,428 --> 00:23:58,588
What happened?

408
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,868
He suddenly fainted
while playing gateball this morning.

409
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,828
He has a heart condition
that he kept from you.

410
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:09,708
During the resuscitation,

411
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:12,668
he kept calling your name.

412
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:44,828
Grandpa.

413
00:24:47,348 --> 00:24:49,828
Tuo and I are here to see you.

414
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:53,188
Grandpa.

415
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:20,508
Grandpa.

416
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,388
It's me, Tuo.

417
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:32,628
Grandpa.

418
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:06,948
(To Tuo)
(Grandpa.)

419
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:10,068
(I thought I would
be the first to leave.)

420
00:26:11,588 --> 00:26:12,748
(I've thought about it.)

421
00:26:13,468 --> 00:26:14,788
(If I were the one to leave first,)

422
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:17,308
(how would I say goodbye to you?)

423
00:26:20,668 --> 00:26:22,308
(From the first day
I learnt of my illness,)

424
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:24,988
(I've rehearsed it
countless times in my mind.)

425
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:28,228
(But no matter
how many times I rehearsed,)

426
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:30,828
(I still can't be prepared.)

427
00:26:34,828 --> 00:26:36,548
(I thought this life would be long,)

428
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,268
(but never expected
to face death so soon.)

429
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:44,268
(Grandpa.)

430
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:46,228
(It won't be long.)

431
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:47,788
(Just wait for me.)

432
00:26:49,628 --> 00:26:50,188
(Let's)

433
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:52,508
(meet in heaven.)

434
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:25,824
Auntie.

435
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:27,628
Hasn't he eaten?

436
00:27:28,868 --> 00:27:29,908
He's been sleeping.

437
00:27:40,468 --> 00:27:41,308
Tuo.

438
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:45,388
Tuo.

439
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:49,548
Auntie.

440
00:27:50,388 --> 00:27:51,748
Just let him sleep for a while.

441
00:27:56,028 --> 00:27:57,228
I'll stay here.

442
00:27:57,868 --> 00:27:59,148
His dad has gone to the hospital.

443
00:27:59,868 --> 00:28:00,988
You go back and rest for a bit.

444
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:03,068
I'll go to the hospital as well.

445
00:28:03,068 --> 00:28:04,828
Then please stay here
and keep Tuo company.

446
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:05,708
Okay.

447
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,432
I'm leaving.

448
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:07,148
Go on.

449
00:28:37,268 --> 00:28:38,868
(Grandpa passed away so suddenly.)

450
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:41,268
(Tuo must be unable to take it.)

451
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,388
This is really adding insult to injury.

452
00:28:46,668 --> 00:28:48,268
His condition will surely be affected.

453
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,388
Let's give him some time.

454
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:54,108
He's been holding it together

455
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,588
since then.

456
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,708
I'm worried
he wouldn't make it this time.

457
00:29:02,268 --> 00:29:03,108
Once

458
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:05,668
the mind collapses,

459
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,188
the body can't take it anymore.

460
00:29:11,308 --> 00:29:11,988
Don't worry.

461
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:14,468
I am right there with him.

462
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:17,668
Thank you.

463
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:18,788
Not at all.

464
00:29:22,988 --> 00:29:24,668
Because of grandpa's death,

465
00:29:24,668 --> 00:29:26,148
Tuo's mom has been crying

466
00:29:26,748 --> 00:29:27,788
these few days.

467
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:29,708
But she can't show her sadness

468
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:32,108
in front of Tuo.

469
00:29:35,068 --> 00:29:36,388
But she's quite...

470
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:39,296
Uncle.

471
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,388
Keep her good company.

472
00:29:42,068 --> 00:29:44,108
None of us can collapse at this point.

473
00:29:45,788 --> 00:29:47,828
Right. We can't break.

474
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,628
None of us can.

475
00:29:52,828 --> 00:29:53,668
Are you kidding?

476
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:55,108
I can't be hospitalized.

477
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:57,668
Is this diagnosis correct?
I don't accept it.

478
00:29:58,468 --> 00:29:59,908
Enough. I'm going to find the director.

479
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:03,868
I'm sorry, Director Zhou.

480
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,704
We'll meet next time.

481
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:07,068
Mr. Gao. Wait for me.

482
00:30:08,588 --> 00:30:09,696
Let's go inside.

483
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:18,748
Many patients
have this psychological reaction

484
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:20,028
after hearing the diagnosis.

485
00:30:21,268 --> 00:30:23,108
He'd deny it, hoping it's wrong.

486
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:24,628
Lin Tuo

487
00:30:25,228 --> 00:30:26,988
was the same
when the diagnosis first came out.

488
00:30:27,228 --> 00:30:28,868
This is all normal.

489
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:32,468
This happens all the time in hospitals.

490
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:34,548
Let alone ordinary patients,

491
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:35,188
even I...

492
00:30:35,828 --> 00:30:36,868
After Tuo fell ill,

493
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,588
I wish every day

494
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,108
it was a misdiagnosis.

495
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:42,308
I understand.

496
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,748
Director Zhou.

497
00:30:44,228 --> 00:30:45,948
Ever since Tuo got sick,

498
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:48,068
my classmates and teachers
from medical school

499
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:49,788
have been running around for me,

500
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:51,588
looking for experts
and gathering information.

501
00:30:52,148 --> 00:30:53,988
And they also put me in touch

502
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:55,468
with a few neurology experts.

503
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:58,068
They recommended some meds

504
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:00,268
and some complementary treatments.

505
00:31:00,388 --> 00:31:01,628
Please check if we can use them.

506
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:04,896
Some of them do make sense,

507
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:08,588
but more of them are theoretical.

508
00:31:09,148 --> 00:31:11,868
We need a further study

509
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:13,868
based on
the patient's specific situation,

510
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:15,308
alright?

511
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,228
How's Lin Tuo doing?

512
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:19,628
Has he entered the nursing home?

513
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,268
Yes.

514
00:31:21,668 --> 00:31:23,988
But he might not be used
to living there just yet,

515
00:31:24,188 --> 00:31:25,508
so he's not in a good mood.

516
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,268
Moreover, his grandpa
has sudden passed away.

517
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:30,668
He couldn't take it right away.

518
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:32,308
So he's not doing good recently.

519
00:31:33,188 --> 00:31:34,908
He wasn't particularly optimistic

520
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:37,228
the last time he did the check-up.

521
00:31:37,948 --> 00:31:40,308
So you might need to prepare

522
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,228
for what's next.

523
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:45,828
What do you mean?

524
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:48,388
I didn't mean what you think.

525
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,148
The disease

526
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,268
goes to the next level
after a certain time.

527
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:54,948
In the meantime,

528
00:31:55,232 --> 00:31:57,440
the patient's mood will fluctuate.

529
00:31:58,028 --> 00:31:58,868
So you need

530
00:31:59,588 --> 00:32:02,108
to try to get him used to this phase,

531
00:32:02,108 --> 00:32:04,628
and appropriately divert his attention.

532
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:08,068
Especially to give him an outlet
to vent his depression out.

533
00:32:08,388 --> 00:32:10,628
Don't keep holding it together.
Do you understand?

534
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,228
Yes.

535
00:32:23,188 --> 00:32:23,868
You must be hungry.

536
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:27,788
Tell my mom to go back.

537
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:31,108
At least eat something.

538
00:32:31,108 --> 00:32:32,188
Otherwise, she won't go back.

539
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:34,628
Guangpu,

540
00:32:35,108 --> 00:32:37,388
Xindi and your senior
are waiting outside.

541
00:32:37,788 --> 00:32:39,268
They are quite worried about you.

542
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:43,228
Tell them to go back.

543
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:46,388
I want to be alone.

544
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:51,588
Okay.

545
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:15,388
Que.

546
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:16,828
How is he?

547
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,828
How is he?

548
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,672
He doesn't want to talk or eat.

549
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:22,428
He is not in a good mood.

550
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,308
Alright, I'll go and check on him.

551
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:26,348
Hey.

552
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:27,868
You know him.

553
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:31,388
His body is okay right now.

554
00:33:31,548 --> 00:33:32,788
Just let him take his time.

555
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,268
You guys go back.

556
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:36,868
Can he keep going without eating?

557
00:33:37,508 --> 00:33:39,228
But I can't force him to eat.

558
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,188
His grandpa has suddenly passed away.

559
00:33:42,468 --> 00:33:43,588
No one can take it.

560
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,468
It happened so suddenly.

561
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:49,788
I'll go talk to him.

562
00:33:50,588 --> 00:33:51,628
Stop.

563
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:52,348
What can you say?

564
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,388
His mood is definitely not good now.

565
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:55,868
Let's come back tomorrow.

566
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:58,988
Just leave him alone.

567
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:01,068
He can't listen to anything now.

568
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:06,988
Don't be too upset.

569
00:34:08,788 --> 00:34:09,828
Call me if you need me.

570
00:34:10,588 --> 00:34:11,268
Okay.

571
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:11,828
It's fine.

572
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:13,988
Let's go.

573
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:14,868
Then we'll leave.

574
00:34:15,268 --> 00:34:16,448
Just go.

575
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:17,627
Bye.

576
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,748
Well,

577
00:34:52,308 --> 00:34:54,187
would Lin Tuo get over it this time?

578
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:57,868
What do you mean?

579
00:35:00,388 --> 00:35:02,308
I'm afraid he can't get over it

580
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:03,628
and does silly things.

581
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:10,388
Let's be realistic.

582
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:12,268
Given Lin Tuo's current situation,

583
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:15,108
if he wants to do something silly

584
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:16,068
like that,

585
00:35:16,788 --> 00:35:17,828
he couldn't do it either.

586
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,024
Indeed.

587
00:35:22,348 --> 00:35:22,988
He can't move,

588
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:26,148
so he can't do anything
he wants to, right?

589
00:35:26,348 --> 00:35:27,668
Definitely.

590
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:30,188
But now he doesn't eat.

591
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:31,468
Is he trying to starve himself?

592
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:33,788
Wait. Can't you think of anything good?

593
00:35:33,788 --> 00:35:35,028
Don't talk nonsense.

594
00:35:35,628 --> 00:35:37,428
You're the one who said
Lin Tuo couldn't get over it.

595
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,628
You started it.

596
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:39,628
Now you're blaming me?

597
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,388
Alright, sorry.

598
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:44,108
I am scared.

599
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:47,108
Maybe tell Que about it?

600
00:35:48,628 --> 00:35:49,268
Please don't.

601
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:51,348
Don't scare Que.

602
00:35:51,628 --> 00:35:52,708
Can't Que think of anything

603
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:53,868
you can come up with?

604
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:55,788
She's now staying at the nursing home.

605
00:35:56,508 --> 00:35:57,828
In case something really happens...

606
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:02,468
The nursing home
could respond immediately.

607
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:03,988
Indeed.

608
00:36:05,908 --> 00:36:07,424
Luckily, he's at the nursing home.

609
00:36:08,148 --> 00:36:09,708
Don't put our phones on mute.

610
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,348
Be ready to respond to any situation.

611
00:36:11,668 --> 00:36:13,348
Don't sleep too soundly, hear me?

612
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,148
Just make sure
you don't sleep too soundly.

613
00:36:16,068 --> 00:36:17,228
Like a pig.

614
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:19,028
How old are you?

615
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,268
How come you snore?

616
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:21,868
I'd be surprised if you get a wife.

617
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,508
I-It runs in my family.

618
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,068
My dad snores too.

619
00:36:27,068 --> 00:36:29,308
Then I'll have to marry someone

620
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:30,948
who can get used to my snoring.

621
00:36:38,388 --> 00:36:39,228
Did you just look at me?

622
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,468
D-Don't you dare!

623
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:42,828
How dare you!

624
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:44,828
I'm telling you,
I can't get used to your snoring.

625
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:46,788
Keep your eyes on the road.

626
00:37:00,708 --> 00:37:01,708
Come on, Tuo.

627
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:04,108
Have some water.

628
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:14,948
Your dad is going to Beijing soon.

629
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:16,868
I'm leaving.

630
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:18,828
My classmate in Beijing

631
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:21,068
works for an authoritative
neurology department,

632
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,348
and he has made the contact.

633
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:24,068
I need to pay a visit.

634
00:37:25,588 --> 00:37:27,828
Besides, I've already
talked to the director.

635
00:37:28,388 --> 00:37:30,588
There are several new drugs

636
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:31,948
and new treatment methods

637
00:37:31,948 --> 00:37:33,388
that need

638
00:37:33,388 --> 00:37:34,788
further study.

639
00:37:36,348 --> 00:37:37,428
Don't you need to work?

640
00:37:40,148 --> 00:37:40,748
I've taken leave.

641
00:37:41,748 --> 00:37:42,588
So has your mom.

642
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:44,388
So she can spend some time with you.

643
00:37:45,548 --> 00:37:46,348
I am staying here.

644
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:49,308
You two should go back to work.

645
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:50,708
I'm fine.

646
00:37:54,868 --> 00:37:57,504
Okay. I'll go back tomorrow.

647
00:37:59,108 --> 00:37:59,628
Tuo.

648
00:38:00,868 --> 00:38:01,948
Cheer up.

649
00:38:04,068 --> 00:38:05,828
For the sake of us,

650
00:38:06,188 --> 00:38:07,392
your grandpa,

651
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:08,908
and Que,

652
00:38:10,708 --> 00:38:11,348
don't give up

653
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:12,948
and eat well.

654
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:15,388
Wait for me.

655
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:17,708
I'm off.

656
00:38:19,268 --> 00:38:19,828
Dad.

657
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:25,788
This disease of mine can't be cured.

658
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:31,908
I know better than you

659
00:38:32,428 --> 00:38:33,308
what to do.

660
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:35,828
Bye.

661
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:24,308
The soup is here.

662
00:39:24,908 --> 00:39:26,588
Hurry, serve it up.

663
00:39:27,628 --> 00:39:29,028
Look how well this soup has been stewed.

664
00:39:29,748 --> 00:39:30,548
It smells good.

665
00:39:33,308 --> 00:39:33,828
Que.

666
00:39:34,428 --> 00:39:35,668
Don't overthink it.

667
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:37,668
It's normal to not have an appetite.

668
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,348
With such a thing happened,

669
00:39:39,348 --> 00:39:41,148
no one could have an appetite.

670
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,828
Right?

671
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,988
When your mom fell ill,

672
00:39:43,988 --> 00:39:45,548
she didn't wanna eat either.

673
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,108
What did I do? I made her soup.

674
00:39:47,308 --> 00:39:48,748
Soup is really good.

675
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:51,148
It's flavorful and nutritious.

676
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:52,548
B-But your mom

677
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:54,560
didn't want to eat the soup either,

678
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,108
so I forced her.

679
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:56,508
Why? Your mom needed to drink more.

680
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:59,200
I even tried to make all kinds of soups.

681
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,028
Vegetables, fruits, milk, and yogurt...

682
00:40:02,028 --> 00:40:03,148
Anything that could be juiced,

683
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:04,268
I juiced it all up for her.

684
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:05,668
It's nice.

685
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:09,108
Dad, you had a hard time
taking care of my mom, right?

686
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:12,268
Well,

687
00:40:12,908 --> 00:40:13,824
I didn't mind it.

688
00:40:15,268 --> 00:40:16,548
But I felt so sorry for her.

689
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,468
Tuo is now particularly
rejecting everyone's care.

690
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:25,628
Today, he even drove his mom away.

691
00:40:26,108 --> 00:40:27,508
I told him

692
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,536
I'd bring him your cooking.

693
00:40:29,908 --> 00:40:31,308
He said no.

694
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:32,988
He doesn't even allow us
into his ward now.

695
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:35,552
He doesn't even listen to us.

696
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:40,828
Well,

697
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:42,308
you have to understand him.

698
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:43,468
Right?

699
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,748
If it were me,

700
00:40:45,748 --> 00:40:47,948
I wouldn't want
to be surrounded by people

701
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:49,468
taking care of me, right?

702
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:51,788
It feels like I'm a waste
and a burden on others.

703
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:53,668
His self-esteem can't take it.

704
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:55,424
Dad.

705
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:58,548
How can he come to accept reality?

706
00:41:01,748 --> 00:41:02,788
Reality

707
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,308
is easy to accept.

708
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:06,428
But it's hard

709
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:08,468
to face it.

710
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:10,908
Que.

711
00:41:11,548 --> 00:41:13,668
If you can't even understand him,

712
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,188
then you can't take care of him.

713
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:18,348
Dad, I understand him, I really do.

714
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:20,908
Every day I say to myself,

715
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:23,028
"Don't be discouraged."

716
00:41:23,428 --> 00:41:25,508
"Don't be annoying. Don't be upset."

717
00:41:26,468 --> 00:41:29,188
But every day I watch him
getting worse and worse,

718
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:31,708
I get more upset.

719
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:34,628
I get scared when my phone rings.

720
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:37,388
Whenever the phone rings, I'd worry
that something has happened to him.

721
00:41:37,388 --> 00:41:39,308
I-I feel so anxious.

722
00:41:39,508 --> 00:41:41,308
And I feel worried.

723
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,108
Que.

724
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,768
Tell me the truth.

725
00:41:54,308 --> 00:41:55,028
Do you regret it?

726
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,148
No.

727
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,148
Alright.

728
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:03,748
If you don't regret it,
then you made the right choice.

729
00:42:04,868 --> 00:42:06,788
You have to work hard
for the choice you've made.

730
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,308
You don't have to go to war.

731
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:12,148
But once you go,
you cannot be a chicken.

732
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:14,508
An Zhique,

733
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,988
when I tried to stop you,
you didn't listen.

734
00:42:18,188 --> 00:42:20,672
But if you want to quit or run away now,

735
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,388
I don't allow it.

736
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,188
Don't worry.

737
00:42:24,868 --> 00:42:26,828
We never run away.

738
00:42:27,508 --> 00:42:27,948
Okay.

739
00:42:28,788 --> 00:42:30,308
For your courage,

740
00:42:30,308 --> 00:42:32,068
I reward you to finish the soup.

741
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:33,548
I'll get you a bowl.

742
00:42:33,548 --> 00:42:34,068
Thank you.

743
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,068
Get two and we'll eat together.

744
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:39,108
Okay.

745
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:50,828
- Que, you are here.
- Yan.

746
00:42:50,828 --> 00:42:52,268
Why didn't Lin come back with you?

747
00:42:53,148 --> 00:42:54,468
Isn't he inside?

748
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:55,188
No.

749
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:56,708
I didn't see him
in the Rehabilitation Room.

750
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:58,188
I thought you went out with him.

751
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:02,144
Wait.

752
00:43:03,908 --> 00:43:04,748
