Dad.

17
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:42,819
The new table has arrived,
so why are you still eating here?

18
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:45,019
Why not eat there?

19
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,619
What if that nice table gets scorched?

20
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:52,379
What? Isn't the table meant for eating?

21
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,859
Afraid of scorching it?
Are you looking down on the designer?

22
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:57,499
It's also not easy
to clean if it gets dirty.

23
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:00,459
It was designed by my son-in-law.
We should cherish it, right?

24
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:03,379
How's your accounting going?
Making any money?

25
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,579
Not bad. We should be able
to break even this way.

26
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:07,179
That's good then.

27
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:09,019
What about Lin Tuo?

28
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:12,419
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

29
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,819
(I've arrived home. Too tired.
I'm going to sleep now.)

30
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:23,779
(Let's talk tomorrow.)

31
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,419
How tiring can it be to make a call
after you're already back?

32
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,059
What did you do to be so tired?

33
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,379
Isn't he busy? He did reply to
your WeChat messages, didn't he?

34
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,379
Why be so fussy?

35
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,819
I'm not replying. So pissed.

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
(Alarm Clock)

37
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:56,059
Why did you sleep on the sofa
without changing your clothes?

38
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,139
I was too tired
and didn't want to go to bed.

39
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:02,739
What time is it?
Aren't you going to work?

40
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:04,544
Yes.

41
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,619
We haven't seen each other for a week,

42
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:14,579
but I can't see
the eager anticipation in your eyes.

43
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,259
It's on my mind.

44
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,499
What's that smell on your clothes?

45
00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:24,979
A smell of hospital disinfectant.

46
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:30,099
Really? I've just changed.

47
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:30,659
Yes, there is.

48
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:34,579
I'll go clean up.

49
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,779
How's your business these past few days?

50
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,779
It is doing pretty well.

51
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,419
We've released a new product now.

52
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,899
It's on sale at half price,
and the reviews are especially good.

53
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:49,219
There are also so many delivery orders

54
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,659
that sometimes, I can't even attend to
the customers in the store.

55
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,619
I'm preparing to hire someone now.

56
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,299
And your buddy,
Chen Guangpu, is really clumsy,

57
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:01,059
making Xindi even busier.

58
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:03,899
Right, I interviewed
a kid the other day.

59
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:06,379
I found him particularly cute.
I quite liked him.

60
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,059
Curly-haired. He's called Bao.

61
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:20,299
This is the Pengyu project book.

62
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:21,779
All six products have been completed.

63
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:23,859
Once you sign, I'll file it.

64
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:28,419
OK. Somebody from Jingtian
will visit today. Have a meeting with them.

65
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,619
Get an idea of what they want,
and you'll be in charge.

66
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,339
Leader, I have something to tell you.

67
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:38,944
Go ahead.

68
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:45,819
I might not be able
to be a designer in the future.

69
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:52,619
The reason?

70
00:06:56,619 --> 00:07:00,779
My right hand might not be able
to draw anymore.

71
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,696
(Open For Business)
The basic situation is like this.

72
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,899
This menu lists some
of my coffee-making tips and recipes.

73
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,019
Right now, there are
four basic types of coffee.

74
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,819
That is, Americano, latte,
pour-over, and cold brew.

75
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:27,339
Just make them with the normal ratios.

76
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:32,059
There are also two seasonal drinks
that we change regularly.

77
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:35,379
It's coconut
and soy milk pudding this month.

78
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:38,419
Feel free to bring up your ideas
and discuss them with me.

79
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,008
Okay.

80
00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:44,059
Although the shop is small,
there's actually quite a lot to do.

81
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,699
Previously, my friend helped me.

82
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,339
But now she's too busy
with her live-streaming work.

83
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:51,699
We work together, so the division
of work might not be very clear.

84
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:55,259
I can do anything.
Drinks, coffee, cakes.

85
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:57,379
I'm also very good at cleaning,
and I'm strong.

86
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,699
All right, then welcome to HW Cafe.

87
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:00,539
Thank you, boss.

88
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,459
You don't have to call me boss.
Just call me Que.

89
00:08:03,459 --> 00:08:06,699
You're 22, one year older than me,
so I'll call you Miss Que.

90
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:07,379
Okay, boy.

91
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,579
Welcome to HW Cafe.

92
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:10,659
Welcome.

93
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:11,699
What would you like to order?

94
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,179
Is it confirmed?

95
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:23,299
The screening results aren't out yet.

96
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:27,699
The doctor said it was hard
to diagnose my condition directly.

97
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,459
We have to rule things out one by one.

98
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,419
That means, it could be a tumor.

99
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,419
Who would have thought that one day,
they would hope to have a tumor?

100
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:51,779
But now, I'm even eagerly hoping

101
00:08:53,619 --> 00:08:57,179
it's a tumor or cancer.

102
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,659
That way, there might still be hope.

103
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,779
It's just your right hand
that's not working well, right?

104
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:05,459
You still can move it.

105
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:08,064
Anyway, if it doesn't work,
there's still the left.

106
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:14,099
If one day...
We'll get a lot of projects.

107
00:09:14,099 --> 00:09:15,739
Our team will get a lot of projects.

108
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:17,859
Even if you can't draw anymore,
you can do other things.

109
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:18,848
What do you want to be?

110
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:24,899
Your assistant.

111
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,139
I still have my left hand, don't I?

112
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,819
Right, being an assistant would be good.

113
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,499
I especially need a good assistant.

114
00:09:36,499 --> 00:09:39,299
You'll be the assistant
and continue working. What's the issue?

115
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:43,579
Thank you, Leader.

116
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,739
Let's go to the meeting.
Get back to work.

117
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:57,299
Leader, can you do me a favor?

118
00:09:59,059 --> 00:09:59,659
Go ahead.

119
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,699
I haven't told anyone about my illness.

120
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,739
You're the first one.

121
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,459
Can you keep it a secret for me?

122
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,920
Huo Sheng, you'll be in charge of
the Jingtian project.

123
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,579
Okay.

124
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:28,352
Lin Tuo, set aside what you're handling

125
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:30,080
and work with me on the Yaoshi project.

126
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,299
This afternoon, the people from Jingtian
are coming for a meeting.

127
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,219
Huo Sheng, Peng Qianfan,
you'll be in charge.

128
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:38,459
Lin Tuo,
get the Yaoshi project book done.

129
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:40,320
Okay.

130
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,659
Lin Tuo, why are you doing
an assistant's work again?

131
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,779
Is it because you're too prominent?

132
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:58,099
No, I asked the team leader

133
00:10:58,659 --> 00:10:59,699
to mentor me more.

134
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,899
I begged him for a long time
before he agreed.

135
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:04,899
I knew it. He isn't that kind of person.

136
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:06,579
What's for lunch?

137
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:08,339
I'll order in a bit.

138
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,899
The exhibition
is such a good opportunity.

139
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:23,139
I went to apply for it specifically.

140
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:26,259
Why are you stopping him from going?
I didn't ask you to go.

141
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:27,259
I'm the boss of my team.

142
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,379
Wei Haiyang,

143
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,779
Don't tell me
you are afraid that Lin Tuo

144
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,739
will outshine you.

145
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:37,219
Am I that kind of person?

146
00:11:37,219 --> 00:11:39,099
What are you actually thinking now?

147
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:44,059
If he wins an award,
it will benefit the firm.

148
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:46,819
You're aware of how many orders
are placed at the exhibition each year.

149
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,979
Even if he doesn't win,

150
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:52,459
what's wrong with a newcomer
getting some experience?

151
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:56,259
Our team is too busy.
Let's change the person.

152
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:01,219
Besides, just because a green young man

153
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:03,819
designed a few small products
that sold well,

154
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:05,779
is it necessary
to put him on a pedestal?

155
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:08,979
I'm gonna temper him
before he gets too cocky.

156
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,939
He is an assistant now, not a designer.

157
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:11,899
I have the final say.

158
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,699
You're just narrow-minded.

159
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:17,859
See? That is the epitome
of being narrow-minded.

160
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,739
You think you're broad-minded?

161
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:24,139
I'm more broad-minded than you.

162
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,779
Ms. Qian, this is the new design draft.
Please have a look.

163
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:04,288
(Lin Tuo)

164
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:19,939
Here, coffee beans.

165
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,339
May I have another pack?
I'm going to an exhibition next week.

166
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,019
Alright. Bao, another bag
of coffee beans.

167
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,939
Alright.

168
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,019
An exhibition? Where is it?

169
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,019
The Young Designers Exhibition
in Shanghai.

170
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,339
When can Lin Tuo attend it?

171
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,019
He was supposed to go this time.

172
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:41,219
I just called him to talk about this.

173
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:42,659
He didn't answer.

174
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:45,312
Why didn't he go? Was he not allowed?

175
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:47,739
It seems that their team leader
didn't let him go.

176
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,659
And Lin Tuo wasn't promoted
to designer this time.

177
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:52,299
I just went to Ms. Qian's office

178
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,499
and heard them talking about it.

179
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,099
I don't know if Lin Tuo is aware.

180
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:58,819
Did he offend
their team leader or something?

181
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,459
But he has a good relationship
with his leader.

182
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,259
He often comes here for coffee.

183
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,339
I've never heard him say that.

184
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,819
I'm not too clear on the specifics.

185
00:14:09,859 --> 00:14:12,299
Maybe their team have other plans.

186
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:14,379
They are working on
a lot of projects now and have to

187
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:15,219
work overtime every day.

188
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,179
Yes. Now you're off work
and he is still busy.

189
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,299
Aren't Guangpu and your bestie here?

190
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,059
They'll be back soon.

191
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:26,219
Miss Que, it's ready.

192
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:26,880
Okay.

193
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,139
Here, coffee beans.

194
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:30,859
Okay, thanks.

195
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:31,539
Not at all.

196
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,899
After I come back,
let's have a meal together with Lin Tuo.

197
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:34,819
- Sure.
- I'm off.

198
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:35,419
- Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:36,019
Take care.

200
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,252
(ALS)

201
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,179
Tuo.

202
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,939
You're at home.
Why didn't you drop by the cafe?

203
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:09,379
After I finished work, it was too late.
The cafe was already closed.

204
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:11,459
I still had some documents to look up
so I went home first.

205
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,459
Have you eaten yet?

206
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:13,819
I'm not hungry.

207
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:21,019
Tuo, did something
happen to you at work?

208
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,659
No, what's wrong?

209
00:15:25,539 --> 00:15:29,579
Why didn't your leader let you
attend the Young Designers Exhibition?

210
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:32,579
Who told you that?

211
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:36,739
Your senior came to buy
coffee beans and mentioned it today.

212
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:40,219
He said you were supposed to go,
but then you weren't allowed. Why?

213
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:43,859
How does he know that?

214
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:47,979
He said he overheard it
in Ms. Qian's office.

215
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:51,739
I'm asking you. Do you know about that?

216
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:53,299
Are you still kept in the dark or what?

217
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:55,859
No.

218
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,899
No? He has heard about it.

219
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,139
Did they not notify you at all?

220
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,219
Did you not get promoted
to designer either? Why?

221
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,499
Can't you stop prying
from others all the time?

222
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:10,139
They don't even know what happened.

223
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,299
What do you mean by "others"?
Am I "others" too?

224
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:15,699
Why don't you tell me anything anymore?

225
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,339
Those are my work matters.
What do you want me to tell you?

226
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,259
You're not my boss.
Do I have to report my work to you too?

227
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:24,139
Wait, what do you mean by "report"?

228
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,499
Am I not even allowed
to ask about your work?

229
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,739
Well, what do you want me
to say about my work?

230
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,219
Lin Tuo, are you silly?
You've been fooled by your leader.

231
00:16:33,219 --> 00:16:34,499
Can't you see that?

232
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:37,219
It's clear that your design
has made you stand out,

233
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:39,379
but your leader
doesn't want to see that.

234
00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:42,379
You should already be a designer.
Why didn't they promote you?

235
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:44,699
Just like before, still doing
odds and ends as an assistant.

236
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,739
Are you foolish or what?

237
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,139
I don't want to be a designer.
It has nothing to do with my leader.

238
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:50,739
I don't want to attend.

239
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,179
Why?

240
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,459
Why? Why must I be a designer?

241
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,099
Won't it work
if I don't become a designer?

242
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:00,659
Does it mean I can't live on?

243
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,339
What do you mean by this?

244
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,979
Haven't you always wanted
to be a designer since you were young?

245
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:07,018
Didn't you go to Ji Jia
to become a designer?

246
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:09,298
Now you're telling me
you don't want to be a designer?

247
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:10,419
Are you sick or something?

248
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:14,379
Yes, I must be sick.

249
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:18,379
Lin Tuo, what are you doing?

250
00:17:22,899 --> 00:17:25,979
Can we two not argue over
this matter right now?

251
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:29,459
Did I come here to argue with you?

252
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:32,499
I worry that you've been badly treated
in the office.

253
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:35,099
You mean I ran over here
to have an argument with you?

254
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,859
No, that's not what it was.

255
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,899
I mean, I have my own work plans.

256
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:40,339
I know what I'm doing.

257
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:42,259
Can't I just further develop
and improve myself?

258
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:44,779
Why are you trying to dictate
my choices over this matter,

259
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:46,579
forcing me to do as you say?

260
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,819
Do I have to tell you everything
and do what you want?

261
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:51,419
Now you're even questioning me
because I don't want to be a designer.

262
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:53,699
The work has made me tired and crazy.

263
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,539
I worked overtime all day
and didn't even get to eat.

264
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:57,299
But you are now confronting me
with your assumptions.

265
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,459
What exactly do you want from me?

266
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,379
You feel so aggrieved?
Why didn't you say so?

267
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,219
Where are you going?

268
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,059
None of your business.

269
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:41,939
He hasn't called you?

270
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,019
No.

271
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:45,179
Not even a WeChat message?

272
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:46,336
No.

273
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:49,539
How dare he?

274
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:51,739
The designer title has gone to his head?

275
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:55,219
What designer? He hasn't become one yet.

276
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,019
He told me he was not going
to be a designer anymore.

277
00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:00,859
I don't know what's wrong with him.

278
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,219
Sit.

279
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:06,739
Lin Tuo wasn't like this before.

280
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:07,819
Could he have been set up?

281
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:10,939
I'm telling you, it's dangerous
for newcomers to stand out.

282
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:12,699
How long has he been in the firm?

283
00:19:12,699 --> 00:19:14,859
With his big poster hung up,
surely someone's jealous.

284
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,019
His leader looks like a sly old fox.

285
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,019
Didn't he offend an old woman last time?

286
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:22,579
They are the leaders.

287
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,779
They wouldn't let
a green man call the shots.

288
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:25,619
They would target him.

289
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:27,379
That's exactly what I said to him.

290
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:29,339
He got mad with me

291
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,579
and said I was the one with issues
and conspiracy theories.

292
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,819
Lin Tuo is just naive.

293
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:37,419
He can't discern
people's intentions at all.

294
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,184
Look at Chen Guangpu.

295
00:19:41,924 --> 00:19:43,499
Still holding the phone
with a silly smile.

296
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:47,819
He told me he was chatting up a girl
who just returned from abroad

297
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,019
and spoke four languages.

298
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:52,179
I asked him, "What does she do?
A tour guide? What can you talk about?"

299
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:56,339
Right after they met,
he got dragged to a shopping mall

300
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,099
and bought her
a limited edition perfume.

301
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,739
Look at him,
still grinning there. Idiot.

302
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,299
I can tell at a glance
she's not a good girl.

303
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,179
He's to be duped.

304
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:10,099
Could there be something else
going on with Lin Tuo?

305
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:12,339
What?

306
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,459
Lin Tuo has such a good temper.

307
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:16,219
Did he really fight with you before?

308
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:17,499
Is the work issue

309
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,779
really the reason?

310
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,099
I don't know.
He's been distracted lately.

311
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:30,499
Last night, as soon as I entered,
he closed the lid of his tablet.

312
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,059
That's it. He's having an affair.

313
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,859
Impossible.
Lin Tuo can't be having an affair.

314
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,539
Really? Check his phone.
There must be something.

315
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,779
It's most likely the one
working with him,

316
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,139
the one named Hong, Lv, or something.

317
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,019
Huang Xiaolv often comes.

318
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:46,179
I know her. She's really nice.

319
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:47,219
I believe Lin Tuo.

320
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:50,659
You're stupid. Hopeless.

321
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:54,880
I'd like some juice
to replenish vitamins.

322
00:20:55,539 --> 00:20:57,059
Download an anti-fraud app

323
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,259
to prevent pig-butchering scams.

324
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,219
What? Who is a pig?

325
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,979
Who else could it be? You.

326
00:21:02,859 --> 00:21:06,019
I just... You...

327
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:12,379
Slow in the head and speech. Idiot.

328
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:35,699
Miss Que, I've finished cleaning inside.
We can lock up now.

329
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:38,379
You can leave. I'll lock up in a bit.

330
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,499
Okay, I'm off. See you tomorrow.

331
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,139
See you tomorrow, bye.

332
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,452
(Word)

333
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:15,979
I'm coming.

334
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,419
Let me stay at your place for a while.

335
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:29,939
Hey, shoes.

336
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:31,659
I'm too tired to change them.

337
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:34,539
What's wrong?

338
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,859
He Xindi keeps nagging me at home.

339
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,099
She's so annoying,
even more than my mom.

340
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,379
She said I got myself a scammer

341
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:47,859
and sent me lots of scam cases
she found online.

342
00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:49,939
Is it possible she's hit
menopause early or something?

343
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,339
It's about the girl you just met?

344
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,499
We are just communing normally.

345
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,280
She's introduced by a friend
and she's a good person.

346
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,419
We're having pretty good chats.

347
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,939
But I didn't say we were going to date.
What's Xindi's problem?

348
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:05,579
Does He Xindi have a thing for you?

349
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:09,019
Right, she likes to mess with me.

350
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:11,979
She's so anxious
because you're chatting with that girl.

351
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:13,819
Isn't that just jealousy?

352
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:16,699
Jealousy? She just wants
to see my downfall.

353
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,499
Didn't she get cheated on
by Chen Xuan before?

354
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,579
I made fun of her. You remember, right?

355
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:24,019
So she held a grudge, wanting revenge.

356
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:27,019
She'd love nothing more than
to see me swindled by a woman.

357
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,419
That would make her over the moon.

358
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:31,899
I don't think so.

359
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,619
Do you know her better than I do?

360
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,539
She can't find a boyfriend
so she hassles me every day.

361
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,899
Talk about bad luck for me
to co-rent and partner up with her.

362
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:42,819
Staying together 24 hours a day.

363
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:44,539
I can't return anymore.

364
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:47,259
Tonight I'll stay at your place.
Que won't come, right?

365
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:52,960
No.

366
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:56,499
You two haven't made up yet?

367
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,059
Is it that serious?

368
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:06,339
After being together for so long,
you still hold grudges from a fight?

369
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,939
I've also been pretty busy
these past few days.

370
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,539
Yes, I know you're busy,
but you can't ignore your girlfriend.

371
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:15,179
You cheat on her?

372
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,179
What are you talking about?
Is it possible?

373
00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:18,699
Then you shouldn't be doing this.

374
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:21,139
Still giving the silent treatment?
We're adults now.

375
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,659
Do you have any idea
how many girls end up

376
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:25,579
in someone else's arms because
of their boyfriends' silent treatment?

377
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:26,144
Impossible.

378
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:29,659
If you're so confident, go ahead
and keep up the silent treatment.

379
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,499
You might as well break up with her.

380
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:32,379
Start dating new ones.

381
00:24:32,379 --> 00:24:33,979
I've got a party today
with girls. Wanna join?

382
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,499
Are you crazy?
Who said anything about breaking up?

383
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,619
I just got impulsive and argued.
What are you even saying?

384
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:44,032
Leave. You came
to my house this late to nag me.

385
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:45,379
I'm going to sleep.

386
00:24:50,379 --> 00:24:52,419
You wouldn't admit your mistake
if I didn't provoke you.

387
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,059
Your hand still hasn't healed?

388
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:58,059
Do you want to see
a traditional Chinese medicine doctor?

389
00:24:58,059 --> 00:24:58,944
No need.

390
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,259
(Copybook)
What is this stuff?

391
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,979
Is it written
with your feet? It's so ugly.

392
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:24,379
(Que did nothing wrong. It's my fault.)

393
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,739
45 yuan received.

394
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:36,819
Please come again.

395
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:37,504
Okay, goodbye.

396
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:42,659
Welcome.

397
00:26:00,939 --> 00:26:01,819
Excuse me.

398
00:26:01,819 --> 00:26:03,179
Order whatever you want yourself.

399
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,459
I want to order something
that would make my girlfriend not angry.

400
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,139
Figure it out yourself.
We don't have such a thing

401
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:16,779
that can help inconsiderate,
heartless and crabby boyfriends.

402
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:20,419
So, that's why I brought it myself.

403
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,139
"Seeking Forgiveness" Milk Tea flavor.
It's new.

404
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:26,139
No way.

405
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:30,859
And "Wanting You Back" Strawberry one.
It's new too.

406
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:33,299
No way.

407
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:44,419
Then pick one.

408
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:48,739
With so many flavors,
there must be one that's right for you.

409
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:51,939
Did you buy out that store or what?

410
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:54,379
If other men make
their girlfriends angry,

411
00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:57,179
at least they'd buy them a lipstick.

412
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,739
But you're giving me just lollipops.

413
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:01,699
Are you having financial difficulties?

414
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:03,699
Actually, no.

415
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,272
It's just that my salary card is
with my girlfriend. I can't ask for it.

416
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:07,979
Get it back.

417
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:09,899
Things given to a girlfriend
must never be asked back.

418
00:27:11,819 --> 00:27:15,019
The love given to a girlfriend
can't be taken back even if wanted.

419
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:19,259
That's so cheesy.
Where did you learn that?

420
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,379
I just saw it online.

421
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:24,859
In the days without me,
did you feel you got sloppier?

422
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,139
A total collapse, body and soul.

423
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:29,179
So I hurried over to fix it.

424
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,339
Have you recognized your mistake?

425
00:27:31,339 --> 00:27:32,259
Yes, fully.

426
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:34,859
Didn't cheat?

427
00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:39,019
I'll own up to my mistakes,
but I can't accept defamation.

428
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:41,312
I suppose you wouldn't have the nerve.

429
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,379
You're bold now, arguing
and giving me the silent treatment.

430
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:46,019
Are you going to break up with me next?

431
00:27:46,019 --> 00:27:46,699
I will never do it.

432
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,739
Alright, I'll forgive you
since it's your first time.

433
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,819
I give you a reprieve.
Prove yourself in the future.

434
00:27:52,819 --> 00:27:55,099
I will mend my ways and start anew.

435
00:27:55,099 --> 00:27:56,179
Today, you do the cleaning.

436
00:27:56,819 --> 00:27:57,536
Yes, ma'am.

437
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,259
Come closer. Let me have a look.

438
00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:02,779
You've lost weight.

439
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:04,499
Have I?

440
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,779
You have. Let me feel
if your abs are still there.

441
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:11,419
Well, I've lost weight,
but my abs are still there.

442
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:11,979
Really?

443
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:12,579
12 packs.

444
00:28:12,579 --> 00:28:15,059
Let me feel. I'm counting 13 now.

445
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:17,699
One extra even.

446
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,539
Why are you making coffee for me again?

447
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,939
I don't necessarily need this stuff.

448
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:40,779
Don't do it for me again.

449
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:44,459
Besides, if I want some,
I can order delivery.

450
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:46,939
I'm a VIP at HW Cafe.

451
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:48,699
I'm not disabled yet.

452
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:52,419
Who said it? I just don't want
to drink that much.

453
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,899
I can take care of these things.

454
00:28:57,699 --> 00:29:01,059
Let me make a few more
for you while I'm still capable.

455
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:10,619
Alright, just add less sugar.
I don't want to get diabetes.

456
00:29:12,099 --> 00:29:13,459
I'm too nice to you.

457
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:16,699
Fine, I'll take it.

458
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:24,219
It's too sweet. Let's go.

459
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,579
I want to visit
my grandfather this weekend.

460
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:32,979
I'll go back with you.

461
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:36,259
It's so busy in the shop on weekends.
Can you manage to get away?

462
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:40,819
That's why I'm thinking of hiring
another person, but that will cost more.

463
00:29:40,819 --> 00:29:43,099
Although my business is doing okay now,

464
00:29:43,099 --> 00:29:44,659
it'll still take a while
to recover the costs.

465
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:48,659
Take your time. There's no rush.

466
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:51,259
Hiring one more person
might just bring in more earnings.

467
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:55,099
Exactly, if I do hire another one,

468
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,859
I might be able to go back with you.

469
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:02,859
Alright. My grandpa is getting on
in years and not in good health.

470
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,659
I'd like to spend more time with him
on weekends when I'm free.

471
00:30:06,459 --> 00:30:09,339
Although my parents are with him,
they are too busy.

472
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:11,819
And Ye is busy
with the college entrance examination.

473
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:13,939
Actually, he is still alone.

474
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,819
How about bringing him over
to live with us?

475
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,659
Okay, I'll go back
and ask him this week.

476
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,859
If he agrees,
I'll bring him over directly.

477
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,859
Sure, I'll tell him
on the phone as well.

478
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,699
When you go back, talk to Ye more.

479
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,979
I feel that he's too repressed
being around your parents.

480
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:33,379
It'd be great if he could really come
to Chongqing to study music.

481
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:39,099
I want to encourage him
to study music and do what he likes.

482
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,659
But how do you persuade your parents?

483
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:49,299
I don't know.
Maybe one day they'll understand.

484
00:30:54,099 --> 00:30:55,179
Let's go.

485
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:56,032
Let's go.

486
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,579
Tuo.

487
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:07,899
Grandpa, did you miss me?

488
00:31:11,219 --> 00:31:11,979
And Que?

489
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:15,419
She's too busy with the cafe
on weekends to come over.

490
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,339
I thought the two of you
would come back together.

491
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:21,659
I have rejoiced too soon.

492
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:24,779
What do you mean by that?

493
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:26,979
You don't care about me now, it seems.

494
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,739
You were lying
when you said you missed me?

495
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:35,019
I did miss you, but I also miss Que.

496
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,459
I'll be happy if both of you
are by my side.

497
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:40,939
Let me help you.

498
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,459
Que let me tell you
to come over to our place.

499
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:47,339
Stay with us for a few days,
just like a vacation.

500
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,099
What vacation? I used
to go to your place often.

501
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:54,659
But now both of us are there, right?

502
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,259
We have a big house
over there and you're free.

503
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:00,019
Just stay for a few days.
It won't be a big deal.

504
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:02,499
But who will water my flowers?

505
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:07,139
My mom or Ye can do it, can't they?

506
00:32:08,099 --> 00:32:10,099
Are these flowers
more important to you than I am?

507
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:13,779
I have a gateball match next Monday.

508
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:15,939
What kind of match is that?

509
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:18,419
Just grandpas playing gateball.
You can play it after you come back.

510
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:23,259
It's not like that. We are
an organized and disciplined team.

511
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:27,219
Those folks from the University
for the Aged are sore losers.

512
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:28,659
We must beat them.

513
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:31,299
Let me think about it
after I finish the match.

514
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:34,739
I'll take it as your agreement, okay?

515
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:38,619
Come over after the match.
Call me and I'll pick you up.

516
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,299
No need to pick me up.
I can go by myself.

517
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:43,379
Does your mom know you're here today?

518
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:46,139
I told her I'd stay with you tonight

519
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:46,939
to let her rest assured.

520
00:32:47,779 --> 00:32:51,299
Alright, we will go eat hotpot tonight.

521
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,459
Let's enjoy ourselves.

522
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:54,219
I'll go change my shoes.

523
00:32:54,219 --> 00:32:54,944
Okay.

524
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,260
(Luzhou Tongxin Hospital)

525
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:11,179
Come in.

526
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:16,736
Dad.

527
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:19,579
How come you're here?

528
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,299
I came back to see Grandpa.

529
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:27,339
Does your mom know?

530
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:29,299
I told her.

531
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:32,899
She said you were on duty today,
so I came to check on you.

532
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,019
You need me?

533
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:47,059
No. I just haven't been here
for a long time.

534
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,819
Has the first floor been renovated?

535
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:53,539
Yes, it's just been renovated.

536
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,299
They've built
a new inpatient department at the back.

537
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,339
Your mom works there now.

538
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,099
Not in the ED?

539
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:10,939
That's good.
It is too exhausting in the ED.

540
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:24,739
Dad, the dining table I designed
has already sold a lot.

541
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,699
They even gave me a bonus.

542
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,859
It's just a dining table?

543
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:34,658
Yes.

544
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:37,578
Your hand?

545
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:41,859
It's nothing, just a sprain.

546
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:50,259
Vice Director Lin, consult at bed six.

547
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,379
Okay, I'll go right away.

548
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:01,259
Go back.

549
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:04,499
I'll go pick up Ye.

550
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:05,888
Okay.

551
00:35:31,899 --> 00:35:32,739
How come you're back?

552
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,179
Can't I come back to my own home?

553
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:37,419
Did you come back alone?

554
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:42,499
Wait, why do all of you ask about Que
as soon as you see me?

555
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:44,099
You broke up?

556
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,619
Nonsense!

557
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:52,739
I just came back to see Grandpa
and to check on you by the way.

558
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,219
What's there to check?

559
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:00,099
To see if you're skipping
class again and fooling around.

560
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:03,339
Yes, I am, so what?

561
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:12,539
Ye, go study music.

562
00:36:16,739 --> 00:36:18,579
Did you pass
the music academy exam before?

563
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:23,259
What's the use even if I passed?
I can't attend anyway.

564
00:36:27,499 --> 00:36:28,739
So you did pass, right?

565
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,219
When the time comes,
just put the music academy on your list.

566
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:38,379
Once your scores meet the requirements
and the admission letter arrives,

567
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:39,219
they can't do anything.

568
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:43,659
Easier said than done.

569
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:47,259
Do you think they would let me attend?

570
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:49,739
Dad would tear up my admission letter
and tell me to go repeat the year.

571
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:54,459
They won't pay

572
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,459
for my music education.

573
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:01,019
I'll do it. I've saved money.

574
00:37:02,259 --> 00:37:04,419
I'll cover all your expenses
including tuition and living costs.

575
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:11,899
And then? We cut off
our relationship with them

576
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:15,859
just like you did back then,
letting them down.

577
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:21,899
Watching Mom crying
and Dad smashing things at home.

578
00:37:25,259 --> 00:37:26,539
I've had enough of that.

579
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:32,219
I've been thinking about
changing my application,

580
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,459
but I don't want to see Mom cry.

581
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:48,819
I will persuade Mom and Dad.

582
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:52,499
Trust me. Go apply for
the university you want to attend.

583
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:57,979
I'll talk to them. I won't make Mom cry.

584
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:07,059
(Chongqing Houses)
Leader, I wanna ask for leave.

585
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:08,699
What's wrong?

586
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:11,059
I'm going to get the test results today.

587
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:12,779
I'll go with you.

588
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:14,499
No need. I can go by myself.

589
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:17,779
I want to go alone.

590
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:23,779
Okay, no problem. You...

591
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:26,939
You can go straight home
and rest for the day after that.

592
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:29,699
Thank you.

593
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,739
Lin Tuo, it's okay.

594
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:49,739
I still suggest
you listen to the test results

595
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:52,939
and the treatment plan with your family.

596
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:55,059
Can't I do it alone?

597
00:38:56,539 --> 00:38:58,019
It's best to be with your family.

598
00:39:01,259 --> 00:39:01,979
I don't want to.

599
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:08,539
Okay, I understand.

600
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:12,779
So, the current test results

601
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:20,459
exclude the possibility
of a false ALS caused by other reasons,

602
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:23,099
including tumors.

603
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:29,579
That means
your muscle weakness and atrophy

604
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:36,419
will gradually develop and spread.

605
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:47,859
This time it's my right hand.
What about next time?

606
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:56,899
It's uncertain. Maybe your left hand,
or maybe your right hand will get worse.

607
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,699
And then step by step
to the whole body, right?

608
00:40:02,459 --> 00:40:06,939
Yes, it will also affect your speech

609
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:11,619
swallowing and even breathing.

610
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:20,419
But you'll remain conscious.

611
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,779
That is, I'll be unable to speak, right?

612
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:32,219
Yes.

613
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:36,779
And also unable to eat, right?

614
00:40:38,179 --> 00:40:44,939
Yes, but all this
will not happen suddenly.

615
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:54,019
What happens in the end?

616
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,899
I will die, right?

617
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:04,139
Yes.

618
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:20,099
How long will it take me to die?

619
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,099
If a normal lifespan is this long,

620
00:41:26,419 --> 00:41:29,019
this disease will greatly shorten it.

621
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:38,099
Is there a possibility of a cure?

622
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:44,139
So far, there is no cure,

623
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:48,800
but there are some medications

624
00:41:49,344 --> 00:41:50,816
that can delay its progression.

625
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:02,659
I still can't believe
that my hand has become like this.

626
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:06,939
I feel that when I wake up the next day,

627
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:09,939
my hand will be able
to move freely like before.

628
00:42:11,059 --> 00:42:13,859
Director Zhou,
could it be a misdiagnosis?

629
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,179
I've always been in good health.

630
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:18,499
My pre-employment examination results
showed no issues.

631
00:42:22,419 --> 00:42:26,899
I still suggest you tell your family.

632
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:30,539
You can't face this alone.

633
00:42:31,899 --> 00:42:34,899
You don't know
what this illness means for you.

634
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:44,192
I can't promise you'll live for three
or five more years, or even longer.

635
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,019
But it's not too late now.

636
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:52,819
Lose no time and get treatment.

637
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:57,179
Everyone's life is finite.

638
00:42:58,939 --> 00:43:01,819
But the attitude towards life
is even more important.
