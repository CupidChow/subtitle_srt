I... I thought you would
come over in the afternoon.

15
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:24,287
I got something later.

16
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:25,527
So I came early.

17
00:02:25,887 --> 00:02:26,887
How about I...

18
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:27,727
- It's okay.
- I'll leave.

19
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,447
I... I'm done here.

20
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:44,047
I'm sorry.

21
00:02:44,687 --> 00:02:45,647
You broke up with me.

22
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:47,087
So don't say sorry to me.

23
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,527
I've been thinking these days

24
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,727
about where I went wrong exactly.

25
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:56,367
Later on, I figured it out.

26
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,287
Actually, I didn't do anything wrong.

27
00:03:01,007 --> 00:03:03,927
It's not
that only the long-term relationship

28
00:03:04,487 --> 00:03:05,807
is a good kind of love.

29
00:03:07,047 --> 00:03:10,127
Getting off halfway just means
the journey has changed.

30
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:14,087
It's not like we are going to be
in love just once in our lives.

31
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:17,647
Maybe there are many more breakups
waiting for us.

32
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:41,647
I'm taking this away.

33
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,247
After all, our relationship
was pretty good until it ended.

34
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:14,807
I'll walk you out.

35
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,447
Since we've already broken up,

36
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:20,767
you should act like it.

37
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:23,967
I can face it. Goodbye.

(Mom, I'm Sick)

39
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:14,127
Inside this suitcase

40
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:16,567
are things that can be used regularly.

41
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,687
Like band-aids,

42
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:18,927
cold medicine,

43
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,047
and a set of sheets and quilt covers.

44
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:22,407
That suitcase

45
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:23,727
is filled with clothes.

46
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,567
You are like my mom now.

47
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,527
It's good to be prepared, right?

48
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:32,007
Anyway, the items in that suitcase
will all come in handy.

49
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:33,567
If your classmates need anything,

50
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,487
give it directly to them

51
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,967
and be nice.

52
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,807
By the way, the school usually provides
bed sheets and quilt covers.

53
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,407
But the quality of those is not good.

54
00:05:40,647 --> 00:05:41,687
Just switch to your own.

55
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,607
If you need anything, call me.

56
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:44,847
I don't lack anything.

57
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,647
I don't need these things.

58
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:47,527
Take them.

59
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:50,487
Just listen to Que.

60
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,247
She has the experience of college life.

61
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:54,967
Once you're there,
you'll know if you need them or not.

62
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:55,727
That's right.

63
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:58,167
Grandpa,

64
00:05:58,767 --> 00:05:59,887
Ye will go to college tomorrow.

65
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,167
Why not stay a few more days?

66
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,247
What's the rush to leave?

67
00:06:03,207 --> 00:06:04,967
You make me sound utterly idle.

68
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,287
I'm busy.

69
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:07,607
The gateball competition

70
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,247
offers points and a bonus this year.

71
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,247
A bonus? How much is it?

72
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,527
No, it's a 380-yuan
assorted grain gift pack.

73
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:16,287
- It's so expensive?
- It's a huge pack.

74
00:06:17,647 --> 00:06:18,687
I just came to see you guys.

75
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:20,727
I'm just glad you guys are doing well.

76
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:22,607
I'll come when I have time.

77
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:24,127
Okay.

78
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:25,407
Then, when you come,

79
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:27,367
let me know, so I can pick you up.

80
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,207
No need. I can come by myself.

81
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:32,367
It's so late.

82
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:33,887
Why isn't Tuo back yet?

83
00:06:36,367 --> 00:06:38,207
He's been working overtime frequently.

84
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:39,407
You should go to sleep.

85
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:41,767
You should go to sleep too.

86
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,167
You need to get up early.

87
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:44,007
Go wash up now.

88
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,607
It's still early.

89
00:06:46,127 --> 00:06:47,167
Hurry up.

90
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,167
Hurry up.

91
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:49,607
- Wash first.
- Hurry up.

92
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:51,167
Let me finish this part.

93
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:52,447
I'll be with you.

94
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,647
Go back.

95
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,127
You still have work to do.

96
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:04,047
Just stay.

97
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:05,447
We'll see you off.

98
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:07,607
I'm not senile.

99
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:08,767
I don't need it.

100
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:10,807
Hurry back.

101
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:12,447
Take care of yourself.

102
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:14,487
Take good care of Ye, okay?

103
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:16,567
Don't worry, Grandpa.

104
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:19,687
Goodbye, Grandpa.

105
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:20,847
Let us know if you arrive.

106
00:07:22,247 --> 00:07:25,007
- Take care.
- Let's go.

107
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:35,607
Did Xu Tianhai get married?

108
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,807
Did Xu Tianhai get married
and then divorce?

109
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,487
Or did he never marry at all?

110
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:54,087
He said his mom was pressuring him
to get married in Moments last week.

111
00:07:55,687 --> 00:07:58,447
If you haven't seen that post,
you can check your phone right now.

112
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:00,487
Lin Tuo,

113
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,647
whose wedding ceremony
did you go to attend?

114
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,087
Say something.

115
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:07,807
What have you done on those days?

116
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,807
Why did you have to lie to me like this?

117
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:11,767
You came back and broke up with me.

118
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,607
Where on earth did you go?

119
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:20,407
We have already broken up.

120
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,167
Is this the reason for the breakup?

121
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:26,927
He Xindi is right.

122
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:30,127
No wonder you can't explain it to me.

123
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:32,006
No wonder you are so resolute.

124
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:33,646
I wondered

125
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:35,727
if there was some
misunderstanding between us,

126
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,327
if I didn't do well enough

127
00:08:37,487 --> 00:08:38,407
and I had neglected you,

128
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:39,807
and if I should try to win you back.

129
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,367
I now feel like I overthought.

130
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:47,687
Lin Tuo, you can break up with me.

131
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:49,887
But you lied to me,

132
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:51,767
and let me down.

133
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:42,207
- Stop.
- What's up?

134
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,167
Come here and sit down.

135
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:46,567
What's up?

136
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,727
I have to ask you something. Sit down.

137
00:09:54,967 --> 00:09:56,192
What's up with Lin Tuo?

138
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:57,247
What do you mean?

139
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,487
Chen Guangpu, tell me the truth.

140
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,207
What exactly happened to Lin Tuo?

141
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:05,007
What are you talking about?

142
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,967
Fine, you're not telling, right?

143
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:10,647
Listen, Chen Guangpu.

144
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:11,847
I've figured this thing out.

145
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,247
What do you mean?

146
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:18,967
You may fool Que, but you can't fool me.

147
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,567
I saw through the coldness and warmth
of life in my teens.

148
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:22,847
My mom got married twice.

149
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,247
My dad got married three times.
I've been in so many relationships.

150
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,407
I understand men too well.

151
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:29,207
There's no such thing
as breaking up for no reason.

152
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:31,287
I'm telling you, I have the evidence.

153
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:33,527
Evidence?

154
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:34,927
What is it?

155
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,367
I told Que

156
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:39,967
to think properly

157
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:43,327
if Lin Tuo has had any unusual behavior
and if he's disappeared recently.

158
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:45,207
She told me

159
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,607
Lin Tuo had been
in his classmate's wedding ceremony

160
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,447
for a few days.

161
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:49,687
I told her

162
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,287
there's something fishy about it.

163
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:52,887
Guess what?

164
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,687
That classmate is abroad.

165
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,327
He doesn't even have a girlfriend.

166
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,887
So Lin Tuo got caught right away.

167
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,767
No secrets are safe in this world.

168
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,687
So what was Lin Tuo doing
during those days?

169
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:06,007
He went home
for a blind date, didn't he?

170
00:11:06,407 --> 00:11:07,567
And he found the match, right?

171
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:08,927
After that,

172
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,567
he came back and broke up with Que.

173
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,207
He Xindi,

174
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:14,727
you're really wasting your talent
doing live streaming.

175
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,327
You should write movie scripts.

176
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,327
My analysis is right, isn't it?

177
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:22,167
I'm truly impressed.

178
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,207
He Xindi, I underestimated you before.

179
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,407
You're not ordinary.

180
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,487
Hurry to the hospital.

181
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:30,967
Get treatment early.

182
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:33,727
Alzheimer is now
affects younger individuals.

183
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:34,447
What?

184
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,407
Stop the gibberish.

185
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,127
Chen Guangpu.

186
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,007
I just got it correctly.

187
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,487
(The situation is starting to get bad.)

188
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:40,687
(You need to be mentally prepared.)

189
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,104
(Mom)

190
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:02,967
Mom.

191
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:04,247
What's wrong?

192
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,087
I have to do ward rounds right away.

193
00:13:06,407 --> 00:13:08,207
By the way, has Ye gone to college?

194
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:09,567
Yes, he has.

195
00:13:10,047 --> 00:13:10,607
That's good.

196
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:12,807
You should visit Ye
more on the weekends.

197
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,487
It's his first time leaving home.

198
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:15,807
Now he

199
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,727
still has bad feelings
towards me and your dad.

200
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,407
I wanted to take him to college,

201
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,487
but he wouldn't let me.

202
00:13:21,207 --> 00:13:22,367
I'll see him next month.

203
00:13:22,647 --> 00:13:23,167
Mom,

204
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:28,767
I'm sick.

205
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:34,407
It's ALS.

206
00:15:23,367 --> 00:15:25,967
Mom, it's okay.

207
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:27,447
Look at me.

208
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:28,927
Except for my right hand,

209
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,007
other part is fine, right?

210
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:32,967
Look at my legs.

211
00:15:33,687 --> 00:15:35,727
I can stand and walk.

212
00:15:36,887 --> 00:15:37,407
I'm fine.

213
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:39,247
I can also lift my legs high.

214
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,047
Although a bit slower,

215
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,287
my left hand is quite skilled now.

216
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,607
I can cook and write with it.

217
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:48,967
By the way,

218
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:51,767
let me show you
what I've written with my left hand.

219
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,487
Here. Take a look.

220
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:57,127
Not bad, right?

221
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:04,007
Anyway, it's legible.

222
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,407
Why are you crying again, Mom?

223
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:13,687
It's okay.

224
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:22,887
You've always been like this.

225
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:25,407
You never talk about anything.

226
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,287
You won't tell us where you're going

227
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,247
or what you're going to do.

228
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Faced with such a big issue,
you still wouldn't tell us.

229
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:37,167
Haven't I

230
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:39,607
already told you?

231
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:41,407
Why didn't you say it earlier?

232
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,527
Why didn't you say it right away?

233
00:16:47,327 --> 00:16:48,967
Are you a child without a family?

234
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,967
Don't you have parents?

235
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:02,167
Are you silly?

236
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:04,927
I do have a family, Mom.

237
00:17:07,086 --> 00:17:09,367
And that's why
I couldn't tell you about it.

238
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:16,127
Mom,

239
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:20,086
If I didn't tell you,

240
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:24,007
I wouldn't be able to hug you again.

241
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,046
Tuo,

242
00:17:31,607 --> 00:17:32,287
don't be afraid.

243
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:34,687
Don't be afraid.

244
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:37,687
I'm here.

245
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,807
I'm right here.

246
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:44,527
Don't be afraid.

247
00:18:05,967 --> 00:18:06,527
Dad,

248
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,287
weren't you on a business trip?

249
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,447
Where are your medical records?

250
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:19,847
Medical records?

251
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:23,927
They're in the box
under the coffee table.

252
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:28,887
The password is 1105.

253
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:34,816
(Medical Record)

254
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:39,825
(Riluzole tablets)

255
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,367
Wash your face and brush your teeth.

256
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:48,687
I bought breakfast.

257
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,327
Have something first.

258
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,247
Lin Tuo, I bought you...

259
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:58,207
Guangpu,

260
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:00,647
they are my parents.

261
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:03,167
Hello.

262
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:05,967
This is my classmate in college

263
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:07,767
and my good friend, Chen Guangpu.

264
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,887
In case something happens to me...

265
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,527
He knows the password here.

266
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:17,847
I'm here to pick him up for work.

267
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,727
You shouldn't go to work now.

268
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:25,207
Let's go to the hospital.

269
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,647
Dad, I'm still doing okay now.

270
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:27,887
I can continue to work.

271
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,687
There's no use going to the hospital.

272
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,367
I'm taking the medicine.

273
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,127
Which hospital and which doctor?

274
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:38,647
Neurology Department of Baihui Hospital.

275
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:39,927
Dr. Zhou Fumeng.

276
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,607
He is the chief physician.

277
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,327
Leave it to me.

278
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,447
- Is it too tight?
- It's fine.

279
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:00,567
Why is

280
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:02,727
your dad still so harsh?

281
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:05,327
You're ill, and he still doesn't
treat you kindly.

282
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:11,567
When my mom gave birth to me and Ye,

283
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:13,087
my dad was on business trips.

284
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,247
My mom went to the hospital

285
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,967
and went back home alone
after giving birth.

286
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:20,847
Although my mom worked at the hospital,

287
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:23,207
she told me she felt

288
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:24,927
particularly helpless,

289
00:20:25,887 --> 00:20:27,647
and felt like she married the wrong guy.

290
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,447
When Ye and I were sick back then,

291
00:20:31,967 --> 00:20:33,887
it was always my mom
who held both of us,

292
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:35,487
running up and down in the hospital.

293
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:38,847
In my memory,
my dad hardly ever took care of us.

294
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:43,807
This is the first time I've seen

295
00:20:43,807 --> 00:20:45,487
my dad come back
in the middle of a business trip.

296
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:49,487
His eyes are bloodshot.

297
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:54,247
He definitely didn't sleep all night.

298
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:02,687
Thankfully, both your parents
are doctors.

299
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:03,847
They know a lot.

300
00:21:05,327 --> 00:21:06,967
If this happened to me,

301
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,167
my parents would probably
do nothing but cry.

302
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:15,327
Even the doctors

303
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,087
can't help with my illness.

304
00:21:20,167 --> 00:21:22,487
Don't talk nonsense. Do you hear me?

305
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:27,407
Let's go to work.

306
00:21:29,407 --> 00:21:30,407
Grab my hand tightly.

307
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:33,527
This side.

308
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:35,447
Tightly.

309
00:21:37,367 --> 00:21:39,167
Not bad. There hasn't been much change.

310
00:21:39,887 --> 00:21:41,607
You need to adjust your condition.

311
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:43,447
Especially,

312
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,807
get your eating and sleeping
in order, okay?

313
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:47,767
Take the medicine.

314
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,367
(Neurology Department, Specialist Clinic,
Zhou Fumeng)

315
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:52,287
Okay, that's it.

316
00:21:52,607 --> 00:21:53,447
Thank you, Dr. Zhou.

317
00:21:59,167 --> 00:21:59,767
Director Zhou,

318
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,567
I am Lin Tuo's father.

319
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,687
Do you have time right now?

320
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:05,967
Please come in.

321
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,127
You weren't in your seat,

322
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:29,007
so I thought you are here. What's wrong?

323
00:22:30,127 --> 00:22:30,727
It's nothing.

324
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:32,287
I just came out for fresh air.

325
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:34,607
Your arm hasn't healed?

326
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:36,967
Such an injury usually
takes months to heal.

327
00:22:38,967 --> 00:22:42,807
By the way, my friend's club
has a soccer match this weekend.

328
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:44,687
They are friends I usually play with.

329
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:46,607
If you're free, come along with Guangpu.

330
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:49,927
With my current condition,
I can't play soccer.

331
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:52,887
Come as a substitute.
I'll introduce you to some friends.

332
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:53,927
They are all designers

333
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,687
and some business partners.

334
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:56,927
Get to know them.

335
00:22:57,207 --> 00:22:58,687
We can play soccer when your arm heals.

336
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:01,647
- You haven't played for a long time.
- That's right.

337
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,287
I've looked over
Lin Tuo's medical records.

338
00:23:06,327 --> 00:23:09,127
I've collected some other case studies.

339
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:11,247
Look, there are even some from abroad.

340
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:12,527
These are cases of ALS

341
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,207
and some related papers.

342
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,687
I'm not sure if they are useful or not.

343
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,687
I can understand how you feel.

344
00:23:21,127 --> 00:23:23,327
But as for Lin Tuo's diagnosis,

345
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:25,887
it's been over half a year.

346
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,807
We've conducted all sorts of tests,
including blood tests,

347
00:23:29,567 --> 00:23:30,807
lumbar puncture, cerebrospinal fluid,

348
00:23:31,447 --> 00:23:32,007
MRI,

349
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,127
and even CT scans.

350
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:34,967
We've also

351
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:36,847
done EMG twice.

352
00:23:37,367 --> 00:23:38,727
So there shouldn't be anything wrong

353
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,007
with the diagnosis.

354
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:42,287
But I've heard

355
00:23:42,607 --> 00:23:46,167
that Guillain-Barre syndrome
can be easily mistaken for ALS.

356
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,887
If it's Guillain-Barre,

357
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:49,927
there's still a chance for a cure.

358
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:54,367
Yes, there are some similarities
in the clinical presentation of them.

359
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:57,287
It's also a key point of attention
in our diagnosis.

360
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:59,567
During our examination,

361
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:02,727
the phenomenon of protein cell
separation in the cerebrospinal fluid

362
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,247
was not present at all.

363
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,997
So the EMG's
electrophysiological examination

364
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:09,247
showed it is completely inconsistent
with Guillain-Barre syndrome.

365
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,407
Therefore, it can be ruled out.

366
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,727
What about the case from abroad?

367
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:22,647
Are there any good treatment
and diagnostic methods available abroad?

368
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:26,207
Under the current conditions,

369
00:24:26,407 --> 00:24:28,527
there is no much difference
between overseas and domestic ones.

370
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:30,567
The internet information exchange

371
00:24:30,727 --> 00:24:32,287
is essentially synchronous.

372
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:35,767
We have some patients
who went abroad for medical treatment.

373
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:36,607
But in the end,

374
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,007
our peers abroad suggested
they come back for treatment.

375
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,927
I have been practicing medicine
for almost 30 years

376
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:55,567
and have seen
too many incurable patients.

377
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:58,527
But when it comes to myself,

378
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:01,847
I truly cannot accept my own child...

379
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:09,047
Then, Director Zhou,

380
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:12,047
do you have any good advice?

381
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:39,232
Why is the senior sending you messages?

382
00:25:40,687 --> 00:25:42,367
Why are you peeking at my phone?

383
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,007
I'm not peeking.

384
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:45,087
I'm looking openly.

385
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:46,927
You could just get a privacy film.

386
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:49,167
I'd need to install
an entire privacy screen.

387
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:51,407
Tell me. What does
the senior want with you?

388
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:53,207
To play soccer on the weekend.

389
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:55,287
Play soccer? I'm going too.

390
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:57,207
You know how to play?

391
00:25:57,687 --> 00:25:58,367
I know how to watch.

392
00:25:58,727 --> 00:25:59,727
Do I need you to watch?

393
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:00,727
I'm not watching you.

394
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:02,407
He Xindi,

395
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:03,767
when we play soccer,

396
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:05,807
why do you always meddle?

397
00:26:06,927 --> 00:26:07,567
I'm doing it

398
00:26:07,727 --> 00:26:08,647
for Que.

399
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:10,607
Isn't Lin Tuo also going to play soccer?

400
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:12,647
What are you up to this time?

401
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:16,007
Creating opportunities for them
to get back together.

402
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:17,167
He Xindi,

403
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:18,447
I'm begging you.

404
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:19,927
Mind your own

405
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:20,967
business.

406
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,527
They have broken up.

407
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:24,327
And yet you want to force them together.

408
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,127
Why are you so malicious?

409
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:27,967
What?

410
00:26:29,007 --> 00:26:31,200
Our friends have broken up.
Are you just watching them for fun?

411
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:32,607
I get it.

412
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:34,727
Is Lin Tuo going to bring along a girl?

413
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,480
Are you afraid we might get in the way?

414
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:37,967
- He Xindi.
- What?

415
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,887
If there was really a demon,

416
00:26:41,207 --> 00:26:43,007
it would only be you and no one else.

417
00:26:43,287 --> 00:26:43,807
You demon!

418
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:44,727
Your family is a demon.

419
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:45,407
Go away.

420
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:47,287
Que! Que!

421
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,240
They're playing soccer this weekend.
Let's watch it.

422
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:50,967
I'm not going.

423
00:26:52,967 --> 00:26:53,967
Why is that?

424
00:26:54,247 --> 00:26:55,647
Let's go together. It's no big deal.

425
00:27:01,127 --> 00:27:01,927
You deserve it!

426
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:03,607
Your family is a demon.

427
00:27:08,966 --> 00:27:14,580
(Ji Jia Design)

428
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:20,607
Mom, why are you here?

429
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,087
I thought it is about time.

430
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,727
So I came to pick you up to go home.

431
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,047
There's half an hour left.

432
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,247
Come in.

433
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:30,407
Take a look at where I work.

434
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,527
Is that okay?

435
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:34,247
- I'm almost off work. It's okay.
- Okay.

436
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,389
(Ji Jia Design, inventiveness craft)

437
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:39,767
This floor is where I work.

438
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:41,647
It's the Design Department Team 3.

439
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:43,487
These are all my colleagues.

440
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,247
- This is my mom.
- Hello, Mrs. Lin.

441
00:27:46,607 --> 00:27:48,087
- Hello.
- Hello, Mrs. Lin.

442
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:49,527
Mrs. Lin.

443
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:51,047
Hello, everyone.

444
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,327
This is my seat.

445
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:56,367
What would you like to drink?

446
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:57,327
I'll get it for you.

447
00:27:57,527 --> 00:27:58,367
Don't mind me.

448
00:27:58,567 --> 00:27:59,847
Our pantry has everything.

449
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:01,687
No need. Go about your business.

450
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:03,607
Hello, Mrs. Lin.

451
00:28:05,247 --> 00:28:07,087
I'm Wei Haiyang, Lin Tuo's leader.

452
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:08,487
Hello, Mr. Wei.

453
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:09,207
Hello.

454
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:10,407
Sorry to disturb your work.

455
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,047
We're almost off work. It's fine.

456
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:14,607
- You're welcome to visit at any time.
- Thank you.

457
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:20,327
Is Lin Tuo working hard here?

458
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,687
He's not only working hard
but also extraordinarily talented.

459
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,047
He's a rare talented designer.

460
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:33,687
Mrs. Lin, how about

461
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,327
you come to my office for some tea?

462
00:28:35,487 --> 00:28:36,127
Let's have a chat.

463
00:28:37,287 --> 00:28:38,127
Come this way, please.

464
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:38,727
Okay.

465
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:43,607
Come on, Mrs. Lin.

466
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,287
- Thanks.
- Sorry for the delay.

467
00:28:46,527 --> 00:28:47,047
Thank you.

468
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:51,527
Lin Tuo was originally going
to be promoted to Designer.

469
00:28:52,287 --> 00:28:53,847
He told me about his situation.

470
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:55,887
He wants to keep working.

471
00:28:56,247 --> 00:28:56,927
I support him.

472
00:28:58,607 --> 00:28:59,367
Thank you.

473
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,167
Lin Tuo

474
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:05,127
told you about this first.

475
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:08,167
It means that he really trusts you.

476
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:13,327
I only found out yesterday.

477
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,007
His father was on a business trip.

478
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:18,047
He came over overnight
after finding out.

479
00:29:20,007 --> 00:29:20,727
Actually,

480
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:23,047
we were not mentally prepared.

481
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,807
However, both his dad and I
work at the hospital.

482
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,407
We do have some understanding
of this disease.

483
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:32,967
I also brought him
to meet pharmaceutical experts.

484
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,247
We learned about the current
medical development for this disease.

485
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,047
They have done related research.

486
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:43,927
Lin Tuo has caused you
quite a bit of trouble.

487
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:46,327
Not at all.

488
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:48,367
He has always been strong.

489
00:29:49,367 --> 00:29:50,327
If he still wants to work,

490
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:52,167
there will always
be a position for him here.

491
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:55,607
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

492
00:29:57,487 --> 00:29:59,607
His father went to the hospital today

493
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,367
to see his chief physician.

494
00:30:02,047 --> 00:30:04,687
We want to have him re-examined.

495
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:08,207
So I'm asking for a few days off
on his behalf.

496
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,007
No problem.

497
00:30:09,327 --> 00:30:10,687
Go ahead and get the examination done.

498
00:30:11,127 --> 00:30:12,327
And cooperate with the treatment.

499
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:14,087
I'm waiting for your return.

500
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:41,647
You are back.

501
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,327
Hurry and wash your hands to eat.

502
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:45,527
You're on time.

503
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:51,287
- Change shoes and wash your hands.
- Okay.

504
00:30:58,007 --> 00:30:59,296
I haven't cooked for a while.

505
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:01,127
I'm not sure how it tastes. Try it.

506
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,967
- You try it too.
- Okay.

507
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:15,527
- Is it a bit bland?
- No, it's not.

508
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:17,167
- It's good.
- It's tasty.

509
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:26,207
Dad, Mom,

510
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:28,887
before we eat,

511
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:31,367
I want to tell you something first.

512
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:38,207
I broke up with Que.

513
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,447
She doesn't know I have this disease.

514
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:45,447
I don't want to burden her.

515
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,247
Nor do I want Grandpa and Ye to know.

516
00:31:49,727 --> 00:31:50,607
Grandpa is getting old.

517
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:51,687
He has a weak heart.

518
00:31:52,047 --> 00:31:52,967
I fear he can't endure it.

519
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,127
Ye has just started college.

520
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:59,647
I want him to go to college happily.

521
00:32:01,647 --> 00:32:03,047
Let's tell him
when there's a chance later.

522
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:07,647
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

523
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:09,767
Let's skip it for now.

524
00:32:14,527 --> 00:32:15,327
You all know

525
00:32:16,487 --> 00:32:17,727
how my illness will turn out.

526
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,767
But it won't
become critical immediately.

527
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,807
I can still take care of myself now.

528
00:32:24,247 --> 00:32:25,727
Don't worry too much about me.

529
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:27,407
Once you're finished, go back to work.

530
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,287
I can take care of myself.

531
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:33,527
Your dad and I have discussed it.

532
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,567
We want to take you back with us.

533
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:37,607
It's more convenient
to seek treatment back home.

534
00:32:37,807 --> 00:32:38,847
And we can take care of you.

535
00:32:39,087 --> 00:32:41,207
Mom, you know about my illness.

536
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:42,607
There's not much to do about it.

537
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,767
It's not the kind that requires
medication or hospitalization.

538
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:48,407
But how can you manage alone?

539
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:50,007
I'm not alone.

540
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:52,207
Guangpu drives me to work
and back every day.

541
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:53,527
He also looks after me.

542
00:32:54,087 --> 00:32:55,287
I got my leader at the company.

543
00:32:55,687 --> 00:32:57,687
They've assigned me quite simple tasks.

544
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,087
I'm just be an assistant.

545
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,527
And my colleagues
are very kind to me as well.

546
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,887
I want

547
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:09,167
to spend more time at work
while I still can,

548
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:11,607
and be with everyone a bit more.

549

There will be plenty of days ahead
to be looked after by you.

550
00:33:19,327 --> 00:33:20,127
I don't want

551
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:24,447
to stay at home
like a useless one right now.

552
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:29,807
Before that day comes,

553
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:33,447
please treat me as a normal person.

554
00:33:36,287 --> 00:33:39,687
- Will you?
- Okay.

555
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:45,687
Let's do as Tuo says.

556
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,447
That's all? Let's eat.

557
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:05,567
Eat more.

558
00:34:35,126 --> 00:34:35,727
Sir,

559
00:34:38,087 --> 00:34:39,567
could you give me a cigarette?

560
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,767
- Sure.
- Thank you.

561
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:49,287
Are you alright?

562
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:51,567
It's been a while since I last smoked.

563
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,407
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

You're welcome.

No thanks needed between us.

568
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:45,047
I can take care of him.

Please rest assured.

00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:48,567

- Okay.

Dad, you're drinking?

608
00:38:27,447 --> 00:38:28,447
The two of us can drink some.

00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,367
Alright, two bottles.

- You are drinking too?
- Yes.

613
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:46,407
Dad, do you remember back
when I was in high school?

614
00:38:47,207 --> 00:38:48,407
It's the birthday of my classmate,

615
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:50,207
and we sneaked out to drink.

616
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:51,967
We ended up getting really drunk.

617
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:54,367
The shop owner called an ambulance,

618
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:55,887
which took us to your hospital.

619
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:00,247
You rushed into the room
and kicked the bed over.

620
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:02,327
I sobered up instantly from fear.

621
00:39:03,327 --> 00:39:04,687
You were a high school student.

622
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,087
Sneaking out to drink
behind your parents' backs

623
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,287
was outrageous.

624
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:09,760
You ended up being hospitalized.

625
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:11,087
How could I tolerate that?

626
00:39:13,887 --> 00:39:14,967
After that time,

627
00:39:15,807 --> 00:39:17,087
I drank again in my sophomore year.

628
00:39:17,696 --> 00:39:19,136
I didn't dare to take a sip
at gatherings

629
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:20,447
after the college entrance exam.

630
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,287
Que is good at drinking.

631
00:39:23,727 --> 00:39:25,287
She drinks a little
with her dad every day.

632
00:39:26,007 --> 00:39:27,087
I'm quite envious of her.

633
00:39:27,647 --> 00:39:28,447
I always think

634
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:35,127
about the day when I can also
drink with my dad.

635
00:39:42,407 --> 00:39:43,456
Come on.

636
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:51,247
Mom.

637
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:18,167
Dad.

638
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:29,247
Mom.

639
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:30,207
Thanks.

640
00:40:41,527 --> 00:40:43,807
Look, isn't my left hand
getting quite skilled?

641
00:40:44,247 --> 00:40:44,967
It's pretty nimble.

642
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,167
You favored
using your left hand to eat before.

643
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,807
I even thought
you would become a left-hander.

644
00:40:57,407 --> 00:40:59,687
They say left-handers are smarter.

645
00:41:00,007 --> 00:41:00,727
Is that true?

646
00:41:01,687 --> 00:41:02,247
It's false.

647
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,327
There's no scientific basis for it.

648
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:07,200
Left-handers and right-handers
are the same.

649
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:09,687
It's merely a matter of habit.

650
00:41:32,687 --> 00:41:34,927
They ordered a peach oolong smoothie.

651
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:38,167
I might have remembered it wrong.

652
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:39,887
Let me make another one.

653
00:41:40,087 --> 00:41:41,447

654
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:42,647
It's okay. I'll do it.

655
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:43,767

She's upset. I'll call her for you.
