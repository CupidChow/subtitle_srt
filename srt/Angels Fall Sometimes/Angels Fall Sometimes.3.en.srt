There's no rush for that.

Mr. Zhu, rest assured.

I'm not quite sure

56
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,144
of this English word's meaning.

57
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:47,819
It's not my field of expertise.

58
00:04:48,448 --> 00:04:49,419
What is your major?

59
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:50,304

Well,

64
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:13,379
what does that guy

65
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,739
majored in track and field think?

66
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,139
He came for an interview

67
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,579
at an internet company.

68
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,499
What did he want?

69
00:05:19,299 --> 00:05:20,640
When I went for the interview today,

70
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,779
I sent several packages
at the front desk.

71
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:24,499
And the people at that company

72
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:26,739
all thought I was the new delivery guy.

73
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,459
The HR manager even told me

74
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:30,899
to wait for a notice.

75
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:32,739
Maybe it's a notice
for me to pick up packages.

76
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:33,539
Then just go.

77
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,019
At least that's a job found, isn't it?

78
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:37,179
I'm a designer.
Why would I deliver packages?

79
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:38,859
I have a clear goal.

80
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,832
I am aiming for the best design company.

81
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,048
Don't sway me.

82
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,915
Then you sway me.

83
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:46,515
Now I'm okay with any job.

84
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:47,475
I want to make money.

85
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:49,195
I want to earn enough money
for my renovation

86
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:50,275
and hire you to do it.

87
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:53,835
Renovation is different
from designing furniture.

88
00:05:54,075 --> 00:05:55,635
Isn't all design interrelated?

89
00:05:57,195 --> 00:05:59,555
Then I can only
start learning renovation now.

90
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,835
What kind of home do you want?

91
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,475
I want...

92
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:08,715
I want that kind

Come in.

111
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,915
You have quite a lot of stuff.

112
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:37,307

Godfather.

114
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:40,307
Wait.

115
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:42,187
What... what happened?

116
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:46,107
Chen Xuan, that big scammer,
he cheated on me.

117
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:49,867
Well then, don't be with him anymore.

118
00:07:50,227 --> 00:07:50,827
For such a person,

119
00:07:51,027 --> 00:07:52,547
you don't have to
waste your time on him.

120
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:53,667
He said

121
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:54,867
I could stay at his place

122
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,427
before I find a new place.

123
00:07:57,547 --> 00:07:59,587
I couldn't let those two toads
look down on me.

124
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,187
So I just packed my things and left.

125
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:02,507
I'd rather stay in a hotel.

126
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:03,267
Right.

127
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:04,627
Then go stay at a hotel.

128
00:08:05,587 --> 00:08:06,427
Hotels are so expensive.

129
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,387
I'm not stupid.

130
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:10,107
So that's why you came here
to stay for free.

131
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,307
Your place is just like
my place, isn't it?

132
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,027
Right, godfather?

133
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:14,867
You can stay.

134
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,347
Stay as long as you want.

135
00:08:16,587 --> 00:08:17,027
It's okay.

136
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,507
Have you eaten?

137
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:21,787
I was too busy arguing
to have time to eat.

138
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:22,907
Alright then.

139
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:24,267
I'll make something for you.

140
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:25,707
Thanks.

141
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:33,187
I've told you so many times,

142
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,746
Chen Xuan is just not reliable.

143
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:35,827
You never listen.

144
00:08:37,907 --> 00:08:39,307
Everyone misjudges every now and then.

145
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:42,746
You've misjudged eight times
in your four years of college.

146
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,467
I've figured it out.

147
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:50,107
I will never again
date someone who cheats.

148
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:51,947
I'll be self-reliant

149
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:53,267
and rely on myself.

150
00:08:58,387 --> 00:08:59,267
Won't it be a bit crowded

151
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,227
if we two sleep on the sofa?

152
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:01,987
You can go stay somewhere else.

153
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:04,347
I can sleep holding you.

154
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,507
I just broke up.

155
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:07,827
Can't you comfort me a little?

156
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,547
Alright, stop crying.

157
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:11,827
I've been cheated on.

158
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:22,827
Lin Tuo, the ball.

159
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:25,504
This way.

160
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:27,787
New sneakers, huh?

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,067
An Zhique bought them?

162
00:09:30,427 --> 00:09:30,947
Yeah.

163
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:35,067
Not a single thing to be happy about.

164
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,547
Where has everyone gone?

165
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,667
No enough people even for a soccer game.

166
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:41,747
What are they doing?

167
00:09:41,987 --> 00:09:42,707
So unreliable.

168
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,507
All've gone for job interviews.

169
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:46,467
Job interviews?

170
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:52,907
Well, the world changes fast.

171
00:09:54,147 --> 00:09:55,067
Do you think all happiness

172
00:09:55,347 --> 00:09:56,307
is gone after graduation?

173
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:58,507

174
00:09:58,747 --> 00:09:59,936
at this ivory tower for the last time?

175
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:04,067
What to do after this?

176
00:10:05,427 --> 00:10:05,987
Date.

177
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:07,467
Not again.

178
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:09,920
Why do you still date?
You've been together for a long time.

179
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,547
Envious?

180
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:11,587
Come on.

181
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,547
(Tomorrow we graduate.)

182
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:18,147
(We'll leave here.)

183
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:19,747
(We've grown up.)

184
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:21,027
(No need to grow up.)

185
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:22,867
(Just stay by my side.)

186
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:24,107
(I'll protect you.)

187
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:25,347
(You can be a kiddo.)

If you have any problems,

275
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:47,987
go to the developer.

276
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,947
By blocking the way here,

277
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,227
you won't solve any problems.

00:14:51,227 --> 00:14:52,587

what will happen to my money.

The police said just now

285
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,627
we need to negotiate
with the developer about this.

286
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:16,907
We are the victims.

287
00:15:17,187 --> 00:15:18,227
If it doesn't work, we'll sue.

288
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,147
But where is the developer?

289
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,187

290

Here is the address.

291
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:28,867
I will go look for them. Don't worry.

all of my and my father's savings.

296
00:15:37,147 --> 00:15:37,987
Now they tell me

297
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:38,947
that my money is gone,

298
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:39,827
and so is my condo.

299
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,187

to have a lawyer boyfriend.

305

No. It would be better
to have a rich boyfriend.

306
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,067
It's better to be rich yourself
than to have a rich boyfriend.

307
00:16:48,227 --> 00:16:48,907
That's even harder.

00:17:04,827 --> 00:17:07,307
that your boyfriend's father
is a lawyer, right?

314
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,347
Well, the truth is,

315
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,426

It's his stepdad.

This is Mr. Xu,
our project department's head

351
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,187

We've already made an explanation

about Sunrise Home's issue.

356
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:08,187
The construction contractor's person
in charge took the money and ran.

357
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:10,227
We've already paid them
according to the contract

358
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:12,187
for the construction costs.

359
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,707
The one who's defaulted now
is the construction contractor,

360
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,307
not us.

361
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:19,427
The construction contractor

362
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,067
was the other party
who signed a contract

363
00:20:21,307 --> 00:20:22,827
and undertook
the construction of this project.

364
00:20:23,699 --> 00:20:24,659
And we, as the homeowners,

365
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:27,779
signed the purchase contract with you.

366
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,899
That is to say,
the 'other party' of yours

367
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,179
hasn't signed any contract with us,

368
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,819
neither are they related to us.

369
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:35,699
So,

370
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,739
no matter
which construction contractor it is,

371
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,259
it can't affect our rights
to this property, right?

372
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:46,379
Then you can choose
to back out of the purchase.

373
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:47,699
Mr...

374
00:20:55,779 --> 00:20:56,339
Mr. Xu,

375
00:20:57,659 --> 00:20:58,339
the thing is,

376
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,019
your strategy of encouraging backing out

377
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:02,379
might be targeted at those owners

378
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,699
who have no understanding of the law.

379
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:06,539
We are quite clear

380
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:08,099
that in other words, backing out

381
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,379
means we unilaterally give up our rights

382
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:12,579
and you won't refund our down payment,

383
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:13,939
let alone giving us compensation.

384
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,739
As the last to benefit
of this entire chain,

385
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,819
those who back out

386
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,379
can only receive an IOU

387
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,339
and become passive debtors.

388
00:21:24,019 --> 00:21:25,059
So,

389
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:27,939
are you asking me to refund
the down payment to you now?

390
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:34,539
Not just the down payment.

391
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:38,259
Although the property
is facing abandonment now,

392
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:40,059
the mortgage we have with the bank

393
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,299
has been established for a year.

394
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,899
The bank won't
terminate the mortgage with us

395
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:45,699
because the property is abandoned.

396
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:47,419
As long as we don't repay the loan,

397
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:48,939
our credit will be affected,

398
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,619
and the bank also
has the right to sue us,

399
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:54,219
demanding that we pay
the entire loan at once.

400
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:56,579
You are surely very aware
of these issues

401
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,099
So, our demand

402
00:22:02,579 --> 00:22:05,059
is the return of the down payment
and the mortgage payments already made,

403
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:05,888
including the interest,

404
00:22:06,219 --> 00:22:07,584
the termination
of the purchase contract,

405
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,979
and the cessation of the bank mortgage.

406
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,376
Then speak with our company's
legal department.

407
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:14,619
Yeah, we can.

408
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:17,659
If we can't

409
00:22:17,699 --> 00:22:19,819
reach a settlement on this matter,

410
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:22,499
we'll just go straight to court

411
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,019
to apply for property preservation

412
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:25,699
and sue your company.

413
00:22:26,699 --> 00:22:28,339
After we get the complaint document,

414
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,139
we can apply for enforcement

415
00:22:30,499 --> 00:22:32,059
to be prioritized
for the right to compensation.

416
00:22:33,379 --> 00:22:34,019
In this way,

417
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,299
whether you

418
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:37,499
auction this property off
or keep it in the company,

419
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:38,899
as long as you have the money,

420
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,779
it will go directly
into our bank account.

421
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:44,259
That's awesome, alright?

422
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,339
I've never heard him
use so many technical terms.

423
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:47,936
He's been practicing for days.

424
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,259
He used me for practice every day.

425
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,499
Is it solved like that?

426
00:22:51,699 --> 00:22:52,499
Can you get the money?

427
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:53,899
No.

428
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:55,539
They won't give us the money so easily.

429
00:22:56,979 --> 00:22:58,779
If the contractor really ran,

430
00:22:58,848 --> 00:23:00,224
they have a lot
on their plate to handle.

431
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:02,099
They won't resolve our issues first.

432
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:03,939
And the lawyer also said

433
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:05,376
if we apply for property preservation,

434
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,136
we'll have to
go through legal procedures

435
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:08,699
and settle the bank loan issues first.

436
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:12,219
Does your Godfather know it?

437
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,899
I wouldn't dare tell him.

438
00:23:13,979 --> 00:23:15,739
If he found out, he would be furious.

439
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:17,299
That's true.

440
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:21,939
Hello?

441
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:23,939
That's me.

442
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:27,259
Alright. I'm on my way now.

443
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:28,379
What's wrong?

444
00:23:28,379 --> 00:23:29,152
My dad is in the hospital.

445
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,059
What?

446
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:30,979
What happened?

447
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:31,459
Hurry!

448
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:32,859
Slow down.

449
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:34,459
Guangpu, my bag.

450
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:39,040
I just sent Old An to the hospital.

451
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:40,019
Not a big problem.

452
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:42,419
I'll be right over as soon
as I'm done here. Don't worry.

453
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:44,059
Okay. Bye.

454
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:46,899
Mr. Jin,

455
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:49,059
how did my dad find out about the condo?

456
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,819
A few people from our team

457
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:52,099
also bought condos there.

458
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:53,579
We were talking about it just now.

459
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,379
Your dad's blood pressure
shot up instantly.

460
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:56,819
He fainted on the spot.

461
00:23:57,259 --> 00:23:58,779
Thankfully, we called the ambulance.

462
00:23:58,939 --> 00:23:59,699
And it brought him here.

463
00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:00,659
The doctor says

464
00:24:01,219 --> 00:24:02,059
it's not a big issue now.

465
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:03,339
Okay.

466
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:03,979
Que,

467
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:05,739
what exactly are you planning

468
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:07,259
to do with the condo you bought?

469
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:08,739
We're working on it.

470
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:10,739
We've spoken to the developer.

471
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:12,419
That's good.

472
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,579
That condo

473
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,299
has consumed
your father's lifelong efforts.

474
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,099
If both the condo
and the money are gone,

475
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:18,419
he won't handle it.

476
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,859
You need to handle it well.

477
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:21,059
I know.

478
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:24,819
Go about your business.
I've got this under control.

479
00:24:25,219 --> 00:24:26,059
Then I'll be on my way.

480
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:26,659
Go ahead.

481
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:27,859
Call me anytime if you need anything.

482
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:28,459
Okay.

483
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:29,419
Thanks, Mr. Jin.

484
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:30,059
Hello?

485
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:32,339
- Alright, I'm on my way.
- Doctor,

486
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,139
what's the situation with my dad now?

487
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:35,099
He's stable now,

488
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,019
but needs a comprehensive examination.

489
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,619
By the way, your father

490
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:41,259
doesn't merely have high blood pressure.

491
00:24:41,376 --> 00:24:42,752
Based on our preliminary assessment,

492
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
it should be coronary heart disease.

493
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:45,979
Coronary heart disease? Is it serious?

494
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,872
He needs to be hospitalized.

495
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:49,259
We need the examination results

496
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:50,979
to find out more.

497
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,019
- Okay.
- Okay.

498
00:24:52,579 --> 00:24:53,859
The patient needs to rest now

499
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:55,259
and cannot take any stress.

500
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:56,899
You need to pay attention
to his emotions.

501
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:57,899
Okay.

502
00:24:58,899 --> 00:24:59,659
Thank you very much.

503
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:04,179
How's your father?

504
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:06,259
He should be okay now.

505
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:07,539
Why don't we go and see?

506
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:08,139
Okay.

507
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:26,259
Dad.

508
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:26,819
Mr. An.

509
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:31,819
What happened to me?

510
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:33,179
Nothing serious.

511
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,299
You just fainted
due to high blood pressure.

512
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,659
- Here.
- High blood pressure?

513
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:37,179
Yes.

514
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,779
No wonder my head was hurting so much.

515
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:40,059
By the way,

516
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:42,379
how did the condo matter turn out?

517
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,819
There's no big deal with the condo.

518
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:44,739
We'll solve it.

519
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:47,339
What can kids like you solve anyway?

520
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:48,939
It's such a big deal.

521
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:50,139
Why didn't you tell me?

522
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:52,379
It's not such a big deal.

523
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:54,379
We spoke with the developer.

524
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:55,859
They've agreed to pay compensation.

525
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:56,739
Don't worry.

526
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,539
Don't lie to me. It's a lot of money.

527
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:00,339
How could they just pay compensation?

528
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:01,219
Wait.

529
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:02,459
Tuo, you tell me.

530
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:03,779
Mr. An,

531
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,019
let's talk about it

532
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:08,459
after you're discharged.

533
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:11,680
Given my condition,

534
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:13,659
I can't be discharged soon.

535
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,339
You're talking nonsense again.

536
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,739
You just fainted
from high blood pressure.

537
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:20,619
You'll be fine
after lying here for a few days.

538
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:21,979
No. Listen,

539
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:23,979
if you don't make things clear to me,

540
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,419
I can't just lie here.

541
00:26:25,739 --> 00:26:26,939
I still have things to worry about.

542
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:28,059
Mr. An,

543
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:30,379
we've consulted a lawyer

544
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:31,739
and we've talked to the developer.

545
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,179
We're waiting for the procedure.

546
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,259
We can definitely get this money back.

547
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:36,099
Don't worry.

548
00:26:37,339 --> 00:26:38,099
Consulted a lawyer?

549
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:38,699
Yes.

550
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:40,339
Consulting a lawyer...

551
00:26:42,579 --> 00:26:43,539
Wait,

552
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:45,219
won't that cost money?

553
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,619
Dad, focus on your recovery.

554
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:48,339
It's nothing.

555
00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:49,419
- It's okay.
- Godfather.

556
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:50,739
Godfather.

557
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:51,859
Quick, let me have a look.

558
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:53,339
Godfather, are you alright?

559
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,299
How come you fainted when you were fine?

560
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:55,899
How's it?

561
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:56,739
It's nothing.

562
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,899
You scared me to death.

563
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:01,539
This is for you.

564
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,539
Why did you buy flowers?

565
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,699
That's such a waste of money.

566
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,299
It's for appearances.

567
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:07,779
Every other patient's room has flowers.

568
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:09,619
These are lilies.

569
00:27:09,819 --> 00:27:10,899
I wish you a speedy recovery.

570
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:11,779
Thank you.

571
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:12,979
It seems that you're fine.

572
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:14,179
You can just smell their fragrance.

573
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:19,179
Chen Guangpu,
what are waiting for? Put them up.

574
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:22,779
Mr. An,

575
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,059
I'll put the flowers here for you.

576
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:27,219
I hope you can...

577
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:27,859
No, stop that.

578
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:28,859
Stop.

579
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:30,139
You don't need to bow.

580
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,579
I'm afraid you'll bow me 'away'.

581
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:32,419
Alright then.

582
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,379
Go over there.

583
00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:38,339
Are...

584
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,899
Are you two dating?

585
00:27:40,579 --> 00:27:42,019
Me? Dating him? No.

586
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:43,699
At most, he has a crush on me.

587
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:46,739
Don't talk nonsense.

588
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:48,819
Mr. An, let me explain to you.

589
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,699
I have a girlfriend
who is prettier than her.

590
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,259
Who is your girlfriend?

591
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:54,659
Someone who is not you.

592
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:55,899
Mr. An,

593
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:58,179
here are some fresh fruits for you.

594
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,219
Eat as you like,
and don't shortchange yourself.

595
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:03,219
These green grapes
are very sweet and delicious.

596
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:04,019
I've eaten quite...

597
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,579
Hey, they are for the patient.
Go wash them. Hurry.

598
00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:08,019
Wait a moment, Mr. An.

599
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,659
Bananas don't need to be washed.

600
00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:12,419
Godfather, are you alright?

601
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:14,419
Be gentler.

602
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,219
The needle.

603
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,259
I'm so sorry.

604
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,739
I didn't notice.

605
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,819
Why did you send lilies?

606
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:24,928
They have a good symbolic meaning
and are fragrant.

607
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:26,459
Alright.

608
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,320
(Spring Breeze Rest Area)

609
00:28:39,392 --> 00:28:41,120
(Mom)

610
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:44,099
Sorry, the number you have dialed

611
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,379
is currently in a call.

612
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:52,779
(Mom,)

613
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:54,859
(my job is almost decided.)

614
00:28:55,419 --> 00:28:56,579
(I'm preparing to stay here.)

615
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:58,739
(Could you send me some money?)

616
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:00,259
(I want to rent a place.)

617
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:11,168
Surgery?

618
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,299
What, what surgery?

619
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:14,939
No, I'm not having surgery.

620
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:19,219
The doctor wants you to have surgery.

621
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:21,219
He won't suggest that if you're fine.

622
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,019
Why is he suggesting that?

623
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:24,259
I'm fine now, aren't I?

624
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,379
So you know more than the doctors, huh?

625
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,419
I don't know his thought.

626
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:29,539
I'm not having it.

627
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:30,819
Get me discharged now.

628
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:32,219
I have to work this afternoon.

629
00:29:32,419 --> 00:29:33,739
You are still working?

630
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:35,979
You think having surgery
will get you fired from your job?

631
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:37,659
Wouldn't that just mean
losing two days' wages?

632
00:29:38,299 --> 00:29:39,899
It's not about the money.

633
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:42,259
I just have hypertension, right?

634
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:44,859
Why have surgery
when medication can do the job?

635
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:46,048
Let me tell you,

636
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,059
the meridians
in the human body are connected.

637
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:49,819
Surgery would hurt the vital energy.

638
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:51,419
Can we be a bit more cultured?

639
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:54,419
You don't just have hypertension.
It's coronary heart disease.

640
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:56,059
And hurting the vital energy?

641
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,659
What era are we living in?

642
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,139
It's a minimally invasive surgery.

643
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:01,792
You just need a few days of rest
afterwards and you won't miss a thing.

644
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:03,979
I know you.

645
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:05,419
You are just worried about the money.

646
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,059
It's not about worrying over money.

647
00:30:08,619 --> 00:30:10,019
We don't have money now.

648
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,139
The money for the condo is gone.

649
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:13,459
If we spend money on my surgery,

650
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,539
the two of us will end up on the street

651
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:16,619
with no shelter or food.

652
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:18,099
What nonsense?

653
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,219
We have medical insurance.

654
00:30:19,379 --> 00:30:20,819
It won't cost you that much.

655
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:21,899
No, it's not that.

656
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:22,739
Not what?

657
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,259
Am I not making myself
clear enough to you?

658
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:25,099
Listen.

659
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,659
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

660
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:28,179
I am commanding you.

661
00:30:28,339 --> 00:30:29,219
If you discharge yourself,

662
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:30,379
I won't help if anything happens.

663
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,499
Let's see how much money
it will cost to save you by then.

664
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:43,939
Do you want a banana?

665
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:47,139
Yes.

666
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:49,379
I'll have two.

667
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:49,899
Okay.

668
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:52,979
Hello?

669
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:54,499
Hello.

670
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:00,219
How much money do you have left?

671
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,619
Around more than ten thousand I guess.

672
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:07,379
Even if you give me all of this,
it's still not enough.

673
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:09,699
Have you asked Lin Tuo?

674
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:10,419
Does he have money?

675
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,179
I don't want to trouble him anymore.

676
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:15,299
I don't even know how much money

677
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:17,339
he has forked out because of our condo.

678
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:20,379
Those lawyers charge by the hour.

679
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,259
I can't borrow from him anymore.

680
00:32:24,739 --> 00:32:26,779
Do you know anyone else?

681
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:31,899
Hello? Que?

682
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:33,739
Hello?

683
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,619
Why did you hang up my phone?

684
00:32:37,099 --> 00:32:38,779
To prevent you
from borrowing money everywhere.

685
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,059
Why did you eavesdrop me?

686
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,739
If I didn't, how would I know you were
borrowing money,

687
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:46,859
acting as if you don't have a boyfriend?

688
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:49,059
Get up.

689
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:51,259
What for?

690
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:52,739
Paying for the surgery.

691
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:55,099
I don't need you to pay it.

692
00:32:58,539 --> 00:32:59,339
You don't need me?

693
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,899
Do you plan to perform the surgery
on your dad at home yourself?

694
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:04,939
Hurry up.

695
00:33:05,739 --> 00:33:06,784
I have to go to the study room.

696
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:08,699
Where did you get the money?

697
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,699
There's plenty of money.
Don't worry about it.

698
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:23,739
You used the rent money
for her dad's surgery.

699
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:24,779
What about yourself?

700
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:28,499
That's why I asked you to come over
and help me with my luggage.

701
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:31,499
So that's your purpose.

702
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,219
No wonder you're being so nice today.

703
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:35,739
You even gave me your figures.

704
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,499
So, you want

705
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:41,419
to support your girlfriend
and mooch off of me, right?

706
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:43,099
You won't let me stay?

707
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,280
Don't play that game with me.

708
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:46,619
And now you turn it around on me.

709
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:48,179
When did I ever say you couldn't stay?

710
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:49,979
Didn't I tell you long ago to come over?

711
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:51,299
And you wouldn't do it.

712
00:33:51,619 --> 00:33:53,139
Now, for your girlfriend,
you come to lean on me.

713
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:54,899
That's really...

714
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:56,736
You...

715
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:58,579
Can't you see clearly?

716
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,339
Who in the world
cares about you the most?

717
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:01,899
I see clearly.

718
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:02,779
So I've come to you.

719
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:03,619
Cut the cra...

720
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:06,379
You are just out of options.

721
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:09,419
What if your mom finds out?

722
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:13,739
She won't.

723
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,819
What if

724
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:16,779
she comes over?

725
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:20,219
She's busy with Ye
and has no time for me.

726
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:21,899
Listen, Lin Tuo,

727
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,138
something is off about this.

728
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,058
Your mom is too biased
towards your brother.

729
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:27,499
Not really.

730
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,659
She gave me the rent money
when I asked for it.

731
00:34:30,464 --> 00:34:32,320
My brother is young and has to
take the college entrance exam.

732
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:33,538
She has to take care of him.

733
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,379
Now that I've found a job,
I can rent a place without delay.

734
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:38,939
Are you the Buddha?

735
00:34:38,939 --> 00:34:40,499
Are you here on earth to do charity?

736
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,299
Your mom is so biased,
and you're making excuses for her.

737
00:34:43,618 --> 00:34:44,259
Your brother

738
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:45,659
is heartless.

739
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,299
And you keep spoiling him.

740
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,259
Your girlfriend is always
up to something.

741
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:51,058
So troublesome.

742
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,819
Yet you seem quite pleased with it.

743
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:53,779
Listen to me,

744
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:55,939
I am the only one in this world
who worries about you the most.

745
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:58,539
Yet you don't care.

746
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:01,739
I... I've run out of things
to say to you.

747
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:05,499
Alright, I won't take
the rent money from you.

748
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:07,579
But you must cook

749
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,299
and clean the place.

750
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:08,899
What do you say?

751
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:10,979
No problem.

752
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:13,019
Good.

753
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:14,819
Then when your mom comes over, just say

754
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:16,059
it's a shared rental.

755
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:17,419
Or she'll scold you again.

756
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:18,899
Got it.

757
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,259
Navigate me to the supermarket.

758
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:24,259
Okay. I'll buy some supplements
for Que's dad.

759
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,019
Sir, where's my dad?

760
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:32,019
Your dad just went out.

761
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:33,739
Do you know where he went?

762
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,259
He might've gone out for a walk.

763
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:36,859
Alright, thank you, sir.

764
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:37,499
No problem.

765
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:44,619
Is this Mr. Fang from Carefree Loans?

766
00:35:45,099 --> 00:35:46,080
That's me.

767
00:35:46,459 --> 00:35:47,659
I want to borrow some money from you.

768
00:35:47,739 --> 00:35:49,139
What procedures are required?

769
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:50,659
Just bring your ID card.

770
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:51,979
Just my ID card?

771
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:53,979
Then when can I get the money?

772
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:56,219
In about three days.

773
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,379
Three days?

774
00:35:57,899 --> 00:35:59,299
Should I provide you

775
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,499
with a bank account number or something?

776
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,219
Has your heart condition
spread to your brain?

777
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:06,379
Haven't you watched the news?

778
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:07,739
How can you believe
such deceitful stuff?

779
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:08,939
No.

780
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:10,528
I just...

781
00:36:11,699 --> 00:36:12,339
You just what?

782
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:13,979
You just asked?

783
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,139
About what? The money has all been paid.

784
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:18,419
It's been paid?

785
00:36:19,379 --> 00:36:20,139
Who paid it?

786
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:21,779
Don't worry about who paid it.

787
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:22,899
The wind is so strong here.

788
00:36:23,179 --> 00:36:24,019
Are you here to enjoy it?

789
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:26,059
Wait, I need to know who paid it.

790
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,539
Don't ask since it's been paid.

791
00:36:28,864 --> 00:36:31,136
(Lin Tuo Contact Information)

792
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:36,819
Did you wash my clothes too?

793
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,099
Who are you
that I should wash them for you?

794
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:41,499
Who am I, huh?

795
00:36:42,859 --> 00:36:44,579
Did you hear the question she asked?

796
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:46,659
Don't play deaf and dumb.

797
00:36:47,259 --> 00:36:49,299
This is my place,
and she won't wash them for me.

798
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:52,659
This is lawlessness.
I'm going to call the police.

799
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:55,659
Chen Guangpu,

800
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,019
listen to me.

801
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,419
I'm temporarily
lending Lin Tuo to you now.

802
00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:01,819
If you dare take him
to any bars or nightclubs,

803
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,139
I'll skin you alive.

804
00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:04,979
Sorry.

805
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:06,499
But I regret to inform you

806
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:08,539
that we are now on equal footing.

807
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:09,979
Both of us are noble consorts.

808
00:37:10,179 --> 00:37:12,099
Then I also regret to inform you

809
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,179
that I am to be promoted to the Empress.

810
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,259
There can only be one Empress.

811
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:18,059
Then I regret even more to tell you

812
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:19,539
that history teaches us

813
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,539
there are numerous cases
of dethroned empresses.

814
00:37:21,779 --> 00:37:23,579
And the bloody reality

815
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,219
is that he is now in my place.

816
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:26,139
Why?

817
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:27,219
Because I have a big place.

818
00:37:27,219 --> 00:37:29,059
Because I have money. Cruel, isn't it?

819
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:30,579
It's not cruel at me. Look at me.

820
00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:31,619
Later, when I am rich,

821
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:33,739
I'll rent him a place
even bigger than yours.

822
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:35,259
That will be hard.

823
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:36,699
Do you know what the hardest part is?

824
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:38,099
It's that you need to find a job first.

825
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,979
Are you two being childish or what?

826
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:41,499
Find a job! Find a job!

827
00:37:41,499 --> 00:37:42,659
Find a job, my foot.

828
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:45,659
Hello?

829
00:37:46,939 --> 00:37:47,499
I'm at home.

830
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:49,779
Where? With whom?

831
00:37:50,859 --> 00:37:52,819
Why should an internet celebrity
dine with me?

832
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:54,739
Why should they drink with me, huh?

833
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,099
I hate internet celebrities.

834
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,739
A bunch of artificial faces.
I won't go. Bye.

835
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:02,059
Do you forget that you were
in love with that internet celebrity

836
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:03,979
and said you'd fight
against the whole world earlier?

837
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:04,699
An Zhique,

838
00:38:05,419 --> 00:38:06,379
you're a bit malicious.

839
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:08,339
We agreed not to poke where I hurt.

840
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:10,259
What?

841
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,339
What?

842
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:12,499
I'll give you a hit.

843
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:13,619
Lin Tuo, hit him.

844
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:15,019
What are you doing?

845
00:38:15,779 --> 00:38:16,480
Which side are you on?

846
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:19,259
Lin Tuo.

847
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,299
Cover me.

848
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:37,939
Ye,

849
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:39,219
what happened?

850
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:43,019
Right now?

851
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:45,299
Are you alone?

852
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,739
Send me your location first.

853
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:50,899
Wait there, and don't run around.

854
00:38:52,779 --> 00:38:53,339
All right.

855
00:38:57,659 --> 00:38:58,379
My brother has come.

856
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,299
Why did he suddenly come?

857
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:02,659
I don't know.

858
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:04,379
He doesn't go to school but comes here.

859
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:06,219
There must be something up.

860
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,219
It's fine. You go pick him up.

861
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,539
I'll keep an eye on things here.

862
00:39:12,459 --> 00:39:13,619
It's okay. Just go ahead.

863
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:16,859
Okay, I'll go pick him up first.

864
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:18,219
Let me know once the surgery is done.

865
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:19,819
Okay, let me know
once you've picked him up.

866
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,459
Be careful.

Don't you have class?

876
00:39:50,539 --> 00:39:51,179
I asked for leave.

877
00:39:52,179 --> 00:39:53,059
Do Mom and Dad know?

878
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:55,779
They don't know.

879
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:06,339
What happened?

880
00:40:07,259 --> 00:40:08,459
Nothing happened.

881
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:10,299
Then why did you come here to Chongqing?

882
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:11,739
Running away from home?

883
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:12,819
No.

884
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:14,539
I came here for a reason.

885
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:22,099
You didn't come here
to meet an online friend, did you?

886
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:22,979
No.

887
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:25,099
I came here to take an exam.

888
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:26,699
Exam?

889
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:29,499
What kind of exam?

890
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:33,419
It's a special admission test
for the Art Academy.

891
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:37,859
Art Academy?

892
00:40:39,459 --> 00:40:40,819
Is it an official exam?

893
00:40:43,459 --> 00:40:43,968
Wait.

894
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:47,059
It's not the time
for the college entrance exam yet.

895
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:49,019
Which school?

896
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:50,499
Polaris Art Academy.

897
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:51,819
Not the college entrance exam.

898
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,459
It's an art school

899
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:57,419
for music studies.

900
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:01,099
You should go to Sichuan Conservatory
of Music if you want to study music.

901
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:05,099
You don't want to be a trainee, do you?

902
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:05,939
No.

903
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,419
I can't make you understand.

904
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:11,939
I want to learn music production.

905
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:13,339
Music production?

906
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:17,659
Never mind. You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

907
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:22,819
What is that?

908
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:25,139
Won't Mom and Dad worry
if you don't tell them?

909
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:27,819
You should at least let them know.

910
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:29,459
Don't tell them.

911
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,059
If you tell them, I'll just run away.

912
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,299
Nobody will be able to find me.

913
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,739
Okay, I won't tell them.

914
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:39,819
Come home with me.

915
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:48,419
Come in.

916
00:41:55,499 --> 00:41:56,099
Change your shoes.

917
00:42:10,259 --> 00:42:11,659
Did you rent this place?

918
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:13,939
It's my friend's.

919
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:15,659
His parents are away on business.

920
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,659
I'm staying here temporarily.

921
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,619
What about the rent money Mom gave you?

922
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:24,699
How do you know Mom
gave me money for rent?

923
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,779
I heard it
when Mom and Dad were talking.

924
00:42:27,259 --> 00:42:28,059
Where is the money?

925
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:30,019
Kids shouldn't meddle
in adults' affairs.

926
00:42:30,979 --> 00:42:31,779
Don't tell Mom.

927
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:33,619
Otherwise, I won't help you anymore.

928
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:37,659
Then you keep my secret.

929
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:40,979
Ye,

930
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:41,899
tell me,

931
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,419
how can I keep this a secret for you?

932
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:45,979
Won't Mom and Dad know
if you don't go home at night?

933
00:42:46,299 --> 00:42:47,819
If they can't find you,
won't they call the police?

934
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:49,579
Just tell them

935
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:51,552
I'm staying with you
for a few days, and then I'll go back.

936
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:53,499
Anyway, if they take me back,

937
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,299
I'll just tell Mom

938
00:42:54,379 --> 00:42:56,019
you spent the rent money she gave you

939
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:57,019
and swindled money from her.

940
00:42:57,859 --> 00:42:58,699
You're really something.

941
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:00,419
I can't believe you.

942
00:43:05,696 --> 00:43:07,008
