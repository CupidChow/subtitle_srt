Please do not easily believe

26

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,420
Feels good.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,820
Let's try this one.

50
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,980
You can't just run home and
ask your parents for money every time.

51
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,780
Well, we are married and adults.

52
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,580
Be mature, okay?

53
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,100
But we really don't have money, do we?

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,740
Without money, we can't offer help.

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,860
Can't we just earn money?

56
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,680
We are healthy grown-ups.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,780
And we have jobs.

58
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,700
Though Lin Tuo is ill, he can still
draw design sketches and earn money.

59
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,940
Lin Tuo can do it because he has skills.

60
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,740
He can earn money with his skills.

61
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,780
I have no skills or specialties.

62
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,140
Well, neither do you.

63
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,380
We are useless.

64
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,200
Get up, you're useless, not I.

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,700
I...

66
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,420
I can live stream, that's my skill.

67
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,820
Can it be used for fundraising?

68
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,140
Why not ask netizens to donate money?

69
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,740
That's not impossible.
Come on, massage me.

70
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,340
But we can't be so blunt, right?

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,180
You can't just tell them to donate money

72
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,980
to save a child.

73
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,940
Why would strangers donate money to us?

74
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,340
Then do something meaningful.

75
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,900
Something meaningful?

76
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,780
Ye said he contacted the student union.

77
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,780
They can initiate
a school donation campaign

78
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,020
with authentic medical cases.

79
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,580
I did organize some previously.

80
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,500
I can send him the ones
I have on hand first.

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,792
Alright.

82
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,580
Our project is also ready.

83
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,820
Yes, that's right.

84
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,380
What project is it?

85
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,020
We'll be livestreaming
the Ice Bucket Challenge.

86
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,500
Xindi has contacted
various famous influencers.

87
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,380
They will join our live stream by then.

88
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,980
We've reached an agreement
with the platform.

89
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,180
All profits obtained from the
Ice Bucket Challenge Charity Sale

90
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,140
will be donated to the foundation
for Dong Dong's medical expenses.

91
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,860
There's more, and we've also reached
an agreement with the factory to sell

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,700
at cost price.

93
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,820
Actually, we went to negotiate
with a try-and-see attitude.

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,980
But they were so supportive.

95
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,260
This is all we can do.

96
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,700
This is already pretty impressive.

97
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,620
You two will do this together?

98
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,460
He will.

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,740
I'll be cheering for him.

100
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,060
Honey, you can do it.
Look how strong you are.

101
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,420
Just some cold water, you'll be fine.

102
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,380
No problem, I believe in you.
I love you.

103
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,020
Going to the canteen?

104
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,660
Yes.

106
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,100
Hello, who are you looking for?

107
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,660
Sorry, wrong ward.

108
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,300
Dear netizens, my name is Lin Tuo.

109
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,620
I am a patient with ALS.

110
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,980
The fundraising campaign we've launched

111
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,620
is for a three-year-old child
named Zhang Dingdong,

112
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,300
the youngest ALS patient
in our rehabilitation nursing home.

113
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,380
Dong Dong is unfortunate,

114
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,860
facing doom at such a young age.

115
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,460
But he is also fortunate.

116
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,980
He still has the chance
to receive treatment.

117
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,340
So many people

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,060
are taking care of him,

119
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,500
helping him grow strong and healthy,
defying the odds.

120
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,780
This marks the inaugural event
of the Jianyu Mutual Fund,

121
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,820
where we share a core belief
in the value of life,

122
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,620
stand united in the battle against
disease and death itself,

123
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,300
strive to create this miracle,

124
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,140
and give Dong Dong a second chance.

125
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,180
This is not only Dong Dong's hope,

126
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,060
but also a collective hope for all of us
who suffer from ALS. Thank you.

127
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,660
Guys, our Ice Bucket Challenge
is about to start.

128
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,020
Be generous and donate, please.

129
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,060
Thank you so much.

130
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,340
Let me show you the ice we have here.

131
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,440
(Public Welfare Action Ice Bucket Challenge)
All real ice,

132
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,528
(Public Welfare Action Ice Bucket Challenge)
as everyone can see.

133
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,700
Add lots and lots more ice.

134
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,060
Now, let's welcome our challenger,
my husband, Chen Guangpu.

135
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,500
Thank you, everyone.

136
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Let me check.

137
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,620
Xiao Hutu will donate 200 yuan
for each bucket.

138
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,100
200 yuan. Thank you, Xiao Hutu.

139
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,820
Thank you for your kindness.
You'll be blessed!

140
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,700
Then our challenge officially begins.

141
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,420
Go for it, honey!

00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,180

Anymore? Take it away.

149
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,820
I'll continue.

150
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,140
But I hope everyone can give us
a gift of love, okay?

151
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,300
Please support us, thank you all.

152
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,540

(999 COLD REMEDY)

179
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,460
Honey, how are you? Are you cold?

180
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,740
A little bit.

181
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,620
Come on, honey.

182
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,500
- Drink it.
- Thanks, dear.

183
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,740
57,332 yuan, not bad,
that's a fair amount.

184
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
I think I deserve more.

185
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,900
So many buckets,
I thought it'd be at least 100,000 yuan.

186
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,860
50,000 yuan is a lot of money.

187
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,460
I didn't even expect to have this much.

188
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,180
I've never made this much
in a single live stream.

189
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,060
Alright, it wasn't a waste of effort.

190
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,140
My husband is quite impressive.

191
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,860
Besides that, what else?

192
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,420
You're cool.

193
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,700
I'm good now.

194
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,340
Are you good now?

195
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,660
But I still need something.

196
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
I need a...

197
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
What is that?

198
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,300
It's just...

199
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,380
One more please.

200
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,140
Ji Jia has approved
your four design proposals.

201
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,420
Huang Xiaolv will let you know
the details later.

202
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,940
If you need to make any adjustments,
do it as soon as possible.

203
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,820
Your salary will be based on Ji Jia's
standard for external designers.

204
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,420
Okay, thank you, Leader.

205
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,780
Why thank me
for the fruits of your labor?

206
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,980
No problem, send any good ideas
or proposals to me as soon as possible.

207
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,620
Ji Jia has also organized a fundraiser
to show their support.

208
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,460
On behalf of Dong Dong, thanks.

209
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,660
No worries.

210
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm happy
that you can continue designing.

211
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,580
Alright, that's it,
you should rest early.

212
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,180
I'll come to see you soon.
Give my regards to Que.

213
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,900
Come over for a meal when you have time.

214
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,180
Okay, goodbye.

215
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,220
Bye-bye.

216
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,380
Though only four proposals
were approved,

217
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,220
I'm even more thrilled than
when I designed the small dining table.

218
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,900
This shows that I'm doing well,
I can still design, I can make money.

219
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,740
Come on, you're more than well!

220
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,580
We all raised donations for Dong Dong.

221
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,780
Only you earned money for Dong Dong.

222
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,900
You're the most impressive, come on,
here's a reward for you.

223
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,300
We got enough money for Dong Dong!
We've succeeded!

224
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,860
We've succeeded!

225
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,580
That's great!

226
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,780
We got enough money for Dong Dong!

227
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,980
That's great!

228
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,180
I'll call Dad.

229
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,460
Honey, our baby is saved!

230
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,140
They have raised the money for us.

231
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,816
Please thank them for me, thank you.

232
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:51,460
I will.

233
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,380
Thank them for me.

234
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,140
I will.

235
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,260
Take care, honey. I will thank them.

236
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,980
Dear.

237
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,300
Tuo, Que, Guangpu, Lan, thank you.

238
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,380
Yan.

239
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,260
Come on, get up.

240
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,060
Don't do this.

241
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,260
Please don't do this.

242
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,740
Yan, please get up.

243
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,940
Just get up first.

244
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,660
Just get up.

245
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Dong Dong, we are going to Beijing
for medical treatment.

246
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,820
We'll ride big horse, isn't it good?

247
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,744
Yan, don't cry, what's the matter?

248
00:14:31,744 --> 00:14:32,340
I'm too happy.

249
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,980
Come here, Dong Dong,
you'll ride big horse.

(You'ai Rehabilitation Nursing Home)

251
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,340
Ms. Xu, how come you are here?

252
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,460
Eating so late?

253
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,260
Just finished my work.
Ms. Xu, please come in.

254
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,180
Sorry, the room is too small.

255
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,020
- Sit
- Okay.

256
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,540
It's alright.

257
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,460
The chair might be a little crooked,
be careful.

258
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,580
It's fine.
I bought an outfit for Dong Dong.

259
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,180
You shouldn't have.

260
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,660
It's not expensive, take it.

261
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,540
Thank you.

262
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,580
It's all cold now.
Won't it upset your stomach?

263
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,460
I'm used to it,
haven't had a hot meal in years.

264
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,460
Eat what you have, right?

265
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,300
We tough folks are sturdy.

266
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,420
Not only tough,
you've become superwoman.

267
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,020
If only I could be superwoman.

268
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,620
At least a superwoman
could save her child.

269
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,540
Only a mother can save her child.

270
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,260
Isn't that what you've
always been doing?

271
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,060
To treat Dong Dong's illness,
we've run up a lot of debts.

272
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,540
His dad even went to Guangdong
to make money.

273
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,180
Believe it or not,

274
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,620
together, his dad and I

275
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,700
only spend 300 yuan a month
on living expenses.

276
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,980
I'm staying here in the hospital
with Dong Dong.

277
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,660
Our director is a good person.
He gave me a job as a janitor,

278
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,900
and got me such a good place to stay.

279
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,340
Otherwise,
my child would have been long gone.

280
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,940
Dong Dong's illness has changed
the fate of our whole family.

281
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,020
Yes, let alone you,

282
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,460
Tuo's dad and I both work
in medical services.

283
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,940
It wasn't until our own son
got this illness

284
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,020
that we realized what it means
to be helpless.

285
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,540
We're really helpless.

286
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,620
We gave birth to him.
We've been working hard to raise him.

287
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,260
And then one day...

288
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:20,900
I really dare not imagine

289
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,500
if Tuo...

290
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,740
But isn't he getting better now?

291
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,500
You're about to leave.
Dong Dong is so sweet.

292
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,900

he will surely recover.

a second chance, thank you.

(Ward Five)

320
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,820
Hello, are you here to see Yilan?

321
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,940
I've seen you several times,
why don't you go in?

322
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,780
Are you her fiance?

323
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,140
I've heard her mention you.
You're Xing Kai, right?

324
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,180
It's not that I haven't tried.

325
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,420
When I first found out Yilan was sick,

326
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,820
I told her no matter how much it cost,
I will stay with you to cure it.

327
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,460
I said let's get married.

328
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,900
Yilan wouldn't marry me,
she said her illness could not be cured.

329
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,180
She'll be a burden to me
if we get married.

330
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,740
One time I came home late from work,

331
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,780
I saw her taking sleeping pills.

332
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,740
I made her throw up
and called emergency services.

333
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,900
I just held her tight,
waiting for the ambulance.

334
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,180
I was so scared of something like that
happening again.

335
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,740
So I quit my job
and took care of her around the clock.

336
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,300
But I had to take care of my parents

337
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,180
who are from the countryside
and don't have much money.

338
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,300
If I don't work, I won't have money,

339
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,300
and we won't survive.

340
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,260
I couldn't possibly give up on
my parents, right?

341
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,060
But no matter what, I've let Yilan down.

342
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,620
Later, when I left, Yilan told me

343
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,580
she could never forgive me
in this lifetime.

344
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,980
When I went to see her again,
she was so mad.

345
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,700
After that,
I didn't dare to see her anymore.

346
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,780
Then why did you come back?

347
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:18,580
I'm about to get married
and move to Shanghai.

348
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,940
I want to see her one last time
before I leave.

349
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,940
You're afraid
you'll never see her again?

350
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,060
Is there anything I can help you with?

351
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,380
We can't forgive him on her behalf.

352
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,020
But we can help them fulfill this wish.

353
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,540
Even if they can't forgive each other.

354
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,980
Right.

355
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:13,020
Que, every day, my fear grows,

356
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,580
as does my gratitude to you.

357
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,380
Why are you suddenly saying this?

358
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,300
How many people can truly stand firm
in the face of reality?

359
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,980
Did Xing Kai do something wrong?

360
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,860
Just because
he didn't give up on his own life?

361
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,140
And how many can truly give up?

362
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,340
If it were up to me,

363
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,780
I wouldn't want you
to give up your own life for me.

364
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,300
I would want you to leave me.

365
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,780
But the one making the choice is me.

366
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,980
You have no idea.

367
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,500
It's not that you can't leave me,
but that I can't leave you.

368
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,220
What about your own life?

369
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,060
This is my life now.

370
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,260
Coming. Coming.

371
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,900
Mr. An.

372
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,220
Mr. Lin, what a surprise!

373
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,260
Well, I just wanted
to have a talk with you.

374
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,380
No problem.

375
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:53,980
Is it okay?

376
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,700
Of course, feel free to come by anytime.

377
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,020
Come in, please.

378
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:58,220
Well.

379
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,060
No need to take off your shoes,
please come inside.

380
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,580
Take a seat.

381
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,260
Here, I've just whipped up
a few random dishes.

382
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,140
- Thanks.
- Hope you enjoy.

383
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,180
That's really nice of you.

384
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,620
Dig in.

385
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,340
Come on.

386
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,820
I really didn't expect you
to come here, really.

387
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,740
Mr. An, I've wanted to have a good talk
with you for a long time.

388
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,460
I never had the chance.

389
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,820
I've also wanted to talk to you.

390
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,060
The problem is, as a driver,
I can't reach you...

391
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,380
Not at all. Look.

392
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:41,980
Big brother, you see...

393
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,220
Big brother? Between the two of us,
who is older?

394
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,980
You are. I have asked Que.

395
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,660
You seem to be two years older than me.

396
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,260
I'm a Rat.

397
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:51,980
Tiger.

398
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,264
I was born in March. What about you?

399
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:56,420
End of February.

400
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,984
Then maybe we are both Pisces.

401
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:58,540
Right.

402
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,140
Let's drink to Pisces, cheers.

403
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,620
Come on, let me fill it up for you.

404
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,820
Cheers.

405
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,580
Big brother,

406
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,020
no one knows
what they will face in life.

407
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,660
What do you think?

408
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,180
Yes.

409
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,820
We have lived almost half our lives now.

410
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,660
Who knows what tomorrow will bring,
right?

411
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,420
Regardless,

412
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:36,820
we can drink here today,
we should thank our lucky stars, cheers.

413
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,340
Come on, I don't thank my lucky stars,

414
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,140
I thank you for raising
such a good daughter.

415
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,380
I really do.

416
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,220
You've raised such a good daughter.

417
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,420
Kind, right? She's good to everyone.

418
00:26:56,004 --> 00:26:57,184
It is fair to say that

419
00:26:57,184 --> 00:27:02,860
your daughter gave my son
a second chance at life.

420
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,672
Big brother.

421
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,340
To be honest with you,

422
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,820
when I first learned about
Tuo's illness,

423
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,580
I didn't agree to let Que
take care of him.

424
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,500
Because my wife died of illness.

425
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,980
I took care of her from the time
she got ill until she passed away.

426
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,820
I know what those days were like.

427
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,780
I didn't want Que
to suffer through that.

428
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,140
Big brother, you can

429
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,900
understand

430
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,620
me, right?

431
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,180
But Que

432
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,620
just left home with her suitcase.

433
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,860
At the time, I was thinking,

434
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,060
she won't be able to hold on for long.

435
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,260
Maybe she can't bear the hardship
and will come back soon.

436
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,500
But unexpectedly, she didn't quit.

437
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,820
And she did quite a good job,
didn't she?

438
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,740
At that time, I knew I was wrong.

439
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,980
Why did I stop her in the first place?

440
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,100
I should've just let her go.

441
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,300
In this kind of situation,

442
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,700
shouldn't we all work together
to move forward?

443
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,220
But I was holding everyone back.

444
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,660
No matter how strong or brave
our children are,

445
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,340
they still need parents' support.

446
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,620
Isn't that right?

447
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,380
An, now that you mention it,

448
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,340
I feel ashamed, really.

449
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,420
You do not know
what kind of person I am at home.

450
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,040
I have always been self-righteous.

451
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,660
No.

452
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,260
I have always felt that I am the head
of the household,

453
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,460
and everyone has to listen to me.

454
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,140
You don't know how I usually
treat my children and my wife.

455
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,820
I regret that.

456
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,460
Until my son became so seriously ill...

457
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,460
An, I truly regret it.

458
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,340
What have I been doing all this time?

459
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,380
I've lived for so long,

460
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,060
why did it take me until now
to understand it?

461
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,700
What's the use of all the books
I have read?

462
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,940
I feel like I've failed as a father
and a husband.

463
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,860
Big brother, that's too harsh.

464
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,620
In fact, you love your family so much.

465
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,100
You just haven't expressed it.
I can understand.

466
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,820
We think that men who talk about

467
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,380
love and emotions all day
are too sentimental.

468
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,780
But now, thinking about it,

469
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,260
what's wrong with loving them?

470
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,660
Having a wife and children to love,
that's such a happy thing.

471
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,500
Why wait until it's almost over,
someone's leaving,

472
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,380
to regret not saying it?

473
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,220
I deeply understand this feeling.

474
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,140
When my wife was leaving,
on her deathbed,

475
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,980
she held my hand and said,
'An, I can't accompany you any longer.'

476
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:25,340
At that moment, as I was holding her,
I thought,

477
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,180
why didn't I spend more time with her?

478
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,540
Why didn't I stay by her side at home?

479
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,380
Now that she's gone,
when I think of her,

480
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:37,340
I wonder why I acted that way.

481
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,300
But that's useless, you know.

482
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,840
An.

483
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,220
I really regret it.

484
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,940
You know, life is short.

485
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,420
We are halfway through ours.

486
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,780
If we want to love,
let's love deeply, right?

487
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,060
Yes, sometimes I think

488
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,940
we are all parents, aren't we?

489
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:14,020
But what exactly does it mean
to be parents?

490
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,900
Give it your all, I suppose.

491
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,860
We are parents,
we brought our children into this world.

492
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,380
So we should raise them well.

493
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,100
But once they become adults,

494
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:34,140
they have to venture out on their own,
earn money,

495
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,820
make choices, and live their own lives.

496
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,500
Yes.

497
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,300
So, our greatest purpose is

498
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,780
to be there for them
when they are tired,

499
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,580
to offer a shoulder to lean on
when they are upset,

500
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,980
to be the home they can always return to

501
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,900
no matter what difficulties

502
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,620
they encounter.

503
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,380
That's why we're here.

504
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
Right.

505
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,940
We're here,
so our child feels reassured, right?

506
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,980
An, now I understand.

507
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,820
Que has a good father.

508
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,540
Come on, here's another toast to you.

509
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,208
Come on.

510
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:39,180
You flattered me. I believe

511
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,620
it's fate for our children to be
together and to get to know each other.

512
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,980
So, let's be there for them
and see it through.

513
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,820
No matter who leaves first among us,

514
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,420
the one who remains has to support them,

515
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,020
and help them finish this journey well.

516
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,340
Done, you look pretty.

517
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,540
Take a look, you like it?

518
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,500
My dream was to become a ballet dancer,

519
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,260
with a swan neck like yours.

520
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,900
Forget it, your temperament
would turn ballet into a comic duet.

521
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,260
I can make a joke out of you right now.

522
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,360
My dear, my point is I want to
make you happy for the rest of my life.

523
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,740
Wow, then spin around to cheer me up.

524
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,336
No problem.

525
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,940
The two of you
have such a great relationship,

526
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,660
not inferior to Tuo and Que at all.

527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,380
Compared to others, we're okay.

528
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,060
But to them, there's still a gap.

529
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,220
They're like a movie couple,

530
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,620
while we are more like the most
normal couple in your neighborhood.

531
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,139
We haven't had
any remarkable experiences yet.

532
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,659
But I hope that the two of us

533
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,219
can just continue to live like this.
That would be very fortunate.

534
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,980
Yes, living peacefully
is the greatest happiness.

535
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,940
You ready?

536
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,340
We are. Check it out.

537
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,699
- Let me see.
- A fairy lady.

538
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,340
Pretty, I can at most make myself
look like a maid within an hour.

539
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,179
Nonsense.

540
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,900
What exactly are we dressed up for,
anyway?

541
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:40,420
I've arranged for a photographer
to shoot a free set of portraits for us.

542
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,100
Right.

543
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,580
For free, it would be a waste not to go.

544
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:44,580
Where is it? Is it far?

545
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,300
He's the one calling the shots.
Let's just follow his lead.

546
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,020
Exactly.

547
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,659
- Let's go.
- Go.

548
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,740
We're leaving, let's go.

00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,340
We're leaving now? Where is Tuo?

550
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,139
He's in the car,
and we can go straight away.

551
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,300
- Grab your things.
- Let's go.

552
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,260

Yilan said she would like to meet you.

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,096
Okay.

603
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,780
This is your first solo dance.

604
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,620

perform on stage or dance anymore.

I'm not doing this
to earn your forgiveness.

610
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,540
I don't deserve forgiveness.

611
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,420
I just want to do something for you.

612
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,500
I understand. You're trying to make up
for your inner guilt.

613
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:39,060
Actually, you have nothing
to feel guilty about.

624
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,248

I have good friends of my own.

I want to live well with them.

628
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,140
It's also them who made me understand

629
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,700
that forgiving the unforgivable is
the best reconciliation with oneself.

630
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,060
My life is not just about the stage,
