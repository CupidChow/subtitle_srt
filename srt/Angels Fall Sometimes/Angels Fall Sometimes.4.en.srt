189
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,980
So I haven't changed much
since high school.

190
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,300
Just a bit older.

191
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,340
My hairstyle has changed so much,

192
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,700
but you chose to say I am older.

193
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,296
Do you know

194
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,340
you will suffer a lot
after graduation with this attitude?

195
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,900
And

196
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,700
don't call me Chen Guangpu.

197
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,460
Show me some respect.

198
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,260
Dull.

199
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,100
Peach grapefruit flavor.

200
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
Just like your brother.

201
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,660
What's wrong?

202
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,420
This is my home. My Meco drink.

203
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,300
Can't I drink it?

204
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,140
You also drank it.

205
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,300
So now I want to take
a bite of your Stir-fry Pot.

206
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,500
Did you wash your hands? Go.

207
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,140
You guy.

208
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:40,288
Where's your brother?

209
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,220
I don't know.

210
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,216
Eat slowly. Wait for me.

211
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,980
Make a call.

212
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,940
Tell him to come back!

213
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,500
I've already done it.

214
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,780
He's already grown up.

215
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,940
Already a senior in high school.

216
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,420
And just leaving school

217
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,140
and home without hesitation.

218
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,300
It's outrageous.

219
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,260
Make a call to the school.

220
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,288
I'll call.

221
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:17,020
Don't call.

222
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,340
I'll ask how they manage the students.

223
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,780
He hasn't been to school at all.

224
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,020
Dereliction of duty.

225
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,820
Complete dereliction of duty by all.

226
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,420
I don't know how you discipline our son.

227
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,860
The child isn't sensible,
and neither are you.

228
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,180
How do you usually discipline him?

229
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,940
Have you ever done it?

230
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,060
Don't you know my job?

231
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,380
How could I do that?

232
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,660
Don't you know my job, too?

233
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,860
I've long told you

234
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,060
that you don't have to work.

235
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,900
You just need

236
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,180
to stay at home and take good care
of the child's studies.

237
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:55,620
Come in.

238
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:58,820
Director Lin.

239
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,060
Mrs. Xu is here too.

240
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,580
The consultation for Bed Six...

241
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,740
We can postpone it by half an hour.

242
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,340
No need.

243
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,620
I'll go right now.

244
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,300
Let's talk more at home.

245
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,420
Come on.

246
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,380
Let's have a chat.

247
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,140
What are you thinking?

248
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,740
Nothing.

249
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,500
I mean you should at least discuss

250
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,380
your preferred university
with our parents.

251
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,140
Did you tell them?

252
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,100
Are our situations the same?

253
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,300
How are they not the same?

254
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,500
Why can you study design
and I can't study music?

255
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,700
Did I say you couldn't?

256
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,140
No matter what you want to study,

257
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,060
you still need to discuss it
with our family, don't you?

258
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,980
Do you think Dad would let you

259
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,060
go to an art academy?

260
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,180
Can you really get in?

261
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,100
I'll take the exam first.

262
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,860
If I pass it, they won't stop me,

263
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,700
or I won't go to any university.

264
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,940
I will just stay at home.

265
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,500
Are you two biologically related?

266
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,940
The gap is a bit large.

267
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,660
Shut up.

268
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,300
I'm lecturing him.

269
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,380
You're educating him.

270
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,060
But does he even listen to you?

271
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,660
I have figured it out.

272
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,220
You studied design, right?

273
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,580
So he wants to learn music.

274
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,580
Right, you two are alike,

275
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,940
as for not listening to your parents.

276
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,140
But boy,

277
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,380
here are my words for you.

278
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,180
Not everyone can become a celebrity.

279
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,820
Who wants to be a celebrity?

280
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,180
Don't you want

281
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,300
to be a famous singer?

282
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,540
Don't want to be someone

283
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,300
like those dancing on TV,
an idol or something?

284
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,580
Don't become one of those.

285
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,860
Wearing makeup,
acting effeminate and always saying

286
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,620
"hello" and "goodbye".

287
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,260
I'm telling you. That's not allowed.

288
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,100
What? I want to study music production.

289
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,500
Who says I want to be an idol?

290
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,540
But with your character,
you really don't fit.

291
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,660
Do whatever you like.

292
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,380
Okay, enough of that.

293
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,540
Just tell me right now.

294
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,020
What's your plan?

295
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:09,500
I'm here to take part in the examination

296
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,540
at Polaris Art Academy.

297
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,140
If I pass, I'll apply directly for it.

298
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,340
What if you don't?

299
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,860
I'll just keep trying.

300
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,900
There are so many universities.

301
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,180
I'll apply to any with a music major.

302
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,340
I'll try each one.

303
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,020
What if our parents just don't agree?

304
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,180
Then whatever.

305
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,580
Anyway, if I pass,
I'll attend by myself.

306
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,220
I'll work and earn money on my own.
I don't need their money.

307
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,420
Lin Tuo,

308
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,340
I don't wanna be like you.

309
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,820
You are just obedient to our parents,

310
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,180
as if whatever they say is always right.

311
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,420
If you support me, that's fine.

312
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,220
If not, I'll stay in a hotel by myself.

313
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,860
Do you have money to stay in a hotel?

314
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,460
Earning money on your own?
Have you ever worked?

315
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,580
Do you know how much
it costs to study music?

316
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,060
How can you earn your tuition?

317
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,060
You've never washed
your own socks and underwear.

318
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,300
You can't even make instant noodles.

319
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,380
You can't take care of yourself.

320
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,980
And you're talking about independence?

321
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,220
You think life's gonna go

Without our parents,
can you live a worry-free life?

324
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,540
I have a dream.

325
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,380
I have the right to fulfill my dream.

326
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,660
I'll sleep by myself.

327
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,940
Good, you have a dream.
You're remarkable.

328

before I knew your brother,

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,420
I was even a garbage collector.

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,700
Come work together.

370
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,700
One,

371
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,660
two...

372
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,648
Wash your hands.

373
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:57,460
The hand soap is on that platform.

374
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,140
Say whatever you want to say.

375
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
How long have you been with Lin Tuo?

376
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,660
How can you just call him Lin Tuo?

377
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,860
Shouldn't you call him brother?

378
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,300
How long have you been with my brother?

379
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,460
Show me some respect.
Otherwise, I won't talk to you.

380
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,340
Fine, I won't ask anymore.

381
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,100
It's been over a year, so what?

382
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,820
My parents surely won't
approve of your relationship.

383
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,260
Why not?

384
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,540
Because I sell dumplings.

385
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,300
I'm not the one marrying your parents.

386
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,980
But you two will get married, right?

387
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,660
Even so, that is our own business.

388
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,220
We have a good relationship.

389
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,740
Even if we break up,

390
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,900
it won't be because someone disagrees.

391
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
You should worry about yourself instead.

392
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,504
Did you pass your art exam?

393
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,980
None of your business.

394
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,500
I really don't care about you.

395
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,380
If your brother
hadn't asked me to look after you,

396
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,260
you'd have been wandering
the streets right now.

397
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,580
Don't be cocky. You're underage.

398
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,820
I've tolerated you for a long time.

399
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,700
Let me tell you.

400
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,659
I'm 18 years old.

401
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,899
18 years old.

402
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,220
Aren't you half a year away from that?

403
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,980
Are you still under control and you can

404
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,340
only play games for one hour a week?

405
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,100
What are you doing?

406
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,180
You're cutting quite rhythmically.

407
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,500
Not bad, Ye.

408
00:17:34,688 --> 00:17:35,380
Lin Tuo,

409
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,100
I disagree with your relationship
this woman.

410
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,300
Watch your language.

411
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,460
Show her respect.

412
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,460
Come on, give us a smile.

413
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,860
Come on, boy.

414
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,980
Have some meat.

415
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,020
Thank you.

416
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,620
How come kids are
so well-nourished these days?

417
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,700
So fair-skinned.

418
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,380
I wish I had a brother.

419
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,740
Don't you have one?

420
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,500
We're not close
as we are not related by blood.

421
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:03,140
Boy,

422
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,020
I hear you wanna be a trainee.

423
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,700
Not a trainee.

424
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,180
A music student.

425
00:18:09,472 --> 00:18:10,380
It's pretty much the same.

426
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:12,300
I know a lot of trainees.
I can help you.

427
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,100
They enjoy a group discount
when buying followers.

428
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,220
Chen Guangpu, don't you want to eat?

429
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,340
What's wrong with you?

430
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,140
Stop playing. Hurry up and eat.

431
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,180
Aren't you hungry?

432
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,100
Here you are.

433
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:36,780
Sign here.

434
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,060
Press a fingerprint here.

435
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:49,380
That's it.

436
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,900
Now the house preservation application
is all set.

437
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,740
Next, when we file the lawsuit,

438
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,860
we'll go through the procedures.

439
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,660
You're really amazing, aren't you?

440
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,780
So we can get the money back?

441
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,700
We're not the ones who did wrong.

442
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,660
We must have confidence.

443
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,620
No matter how troublesome,
we must persist.

444
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,660
With you here,

445
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,220
I have confidence.

446
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,260
Come.

447
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,260
Right, the company
I went to for an interview today

448
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,220
has an Internet
and New Media Department.

449
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,540
I brought back
some information. Apply for it.

450
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,060
If we could work at the same company,

451
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,900
that'd be great.

452
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,864
Let me check it out.

453
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,340
Beer. You can't drink.

454
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,060
You two are drinking here
in broad daylight?

455
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,460
Yeah, this is our secret base.

456
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,980
What secret base?

457
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,740
Isn't this just
a run-down convenience store?

458
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,260
You two are just poor.

459
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,100
Right, we are poor.

460
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,340
So, you need to be promising

461
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,220
to support us.

462
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,940
I won't support you guys.

463
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,820
How do you know this place?

464
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,340
Chen Guangpu.

465
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:00,820
Guangpu told me.

466
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,540
Great. How did you get here?

467
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,300
By a shared bike.

468
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,660
Not bad. You've grown up.

469
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,380
You can even get here by a shared bike.

470
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,900
Lin Ye is already 18.

471
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,060
Can you and your parents acknowledge

472
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,700
the fact that he's already an adult?

473
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,700
You should be the first
to acknowledge it.

474
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,300
Don't call me a minor anymore.

475
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,220
Okay, minor.

476
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,020
Give me your phone.

477
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:23,500
What for?

478
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,700
Just give it to me.

479
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,056
Why?

480
00:20:29,056 --> 00:20:30,020
Add you on WeChat.

481
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,020
I've sent you some art exam information
for Polaris Art Academy.

482
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,780
There are a lot of art exam posts
made by art students in there.

483
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,500
It must be helpful to you.

484
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,940
Next time, I'll go with you.

485
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,900
No need.

486
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,060
You want to apply for
an art academy, right?

487
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,540
You must sing really well.

488
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,540
Sing a song, will you?

489
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,300
I won't sing.

490
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,580
Sing a song.

491
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,620
I won't.

492
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,860
Sing a song
and I'll give you some guidance.

493
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,420
Can you? What do you know about it?

494
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,540
I know a lot. I can sing really well.

495
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,540
Come on, sing a song.

496
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,060
The doctor said

497
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,380
from now on,

498
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,780
you need to minimize intake
of fat, sugar, and salt.

499
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,940
Then what can I eat?

500
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,700
Let's focus on recovery first.

501
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,980
Later, whether it's Cantonese,

502
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,420
Zhejiang or Shanghai cuisine,

503
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,580
I'll cook it for you
as long as you wanna eat.

504
00:21:25,056 --> 00:21:26,020
That would be great.

505
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,020
Tuo,

506
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,140
I heard

507
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,420
the surgery fees were paid
by you, right?

508
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,820
That's quite embarrassing.

509
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:35,540
Don't treat me like a stranger.

510
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,500
I'll be your future son-in-law.

511
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,860
I've got to be useful
when it counts, right?

512
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,140
Yes.

513
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,060
We are adults now.

514
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,500
It's time to start taking care of you.

515
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,380
Well, even though you say so,

516
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,100
I'll let Que return the money

517
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,460
to you in the future.

518
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,820
You don't have to worry about us.

519
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,780
Eat up. It's most important
to keep yourself healthy.

520
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,980
But then again,

521
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,180
I keep eating nothing but this stuff.

522
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,060
When will I ever get healthy?

523
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,580
Tuo, how about this?

524
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,580
Can I ask you a favor?

525
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,980
Let's plan an escape.

526
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,300
Can I go out for some noodles?

527
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,460
Spicy food won't do.

528
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,580
Sichuan wontons would be fine too.

529
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:18,820
Thank you.

530
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,580
Okay, tomorrow.

531
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:24,900
That's right, Tuo.

532
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,860
You said your parents
are doctors, right?

533
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,820
Yes.

534
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,700
They're so busy.

535
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,900
Do they know you and Que

536
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,780
are in a relationship?

537
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,420
They do.

538
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:35,980
That's good.

539
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:39,940
Look, you have been dating
for over a year,

540
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:41,180
and you've graduated.

541
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,380
Shouldn't you two

542
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,540
go back to your hometown

543
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,700
and visit your parents?

544
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,340
Yes, that's right.

545
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,220
Okay.

546
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,060
Have you got a job?

547
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,260
Still looking.

548
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,100
Design jobs are hard to get.

549
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,580
I'm just trying one by one.

550
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
There will always be a chance.

551
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:11,380
(Spring Breeze Self-Study Room)

552
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,140
The political papers
are almost driving me crazy.

553
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,140
Me too.

554
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,900
They're different from

(What do you want to eat this weekend?)

571
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,780
(I will make it for you.)

572
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,020
Mom,

573
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,140
I want to eat
the steamed egg with sea fish.

574
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:40,096
(Spring Breeze Self-Study Room)

575
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,060
Mom,

576
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,220
I want to eat
the steamed egg with sea fish.

577
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,980
Ye was cute when he was little.

578
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,260
When he was in kindergarten,

579
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,780
a group of children were dancing.

580
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:57,820
He was in the middle

581
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,060
and fell at first.

582
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,260
He sulked and wouldn't stand up.

583
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,780
The other children were dancing,

584
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:05,700
but he just sat there on the ground.

585
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,820
After the other children
finished dancing,

586
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,100
he stood up

587
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,460
and bowed to the audience.

588
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,900
Then why did he become
so fierce as he grew up?

589
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,620
People grow up.

590
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,860
Everyone changes.

591
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,060
I haven't seen Ye like this

592
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,300
for a long time.

593
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,620
He talks more and smiles more.

594
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:28,859
Maybe the atmosphere
at home is too stifling,

595
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,659
so he doesn't like to talk at home now.

596
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,019
He doesn't even talk to me
when I'm at home.

597
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:37,779
Are your parents

598
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,059
very harsh with you?

599
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:42,699
Not really.

600
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:47,659
My parents

601
00:27:47,979 --> 00:27:49,019
aren't that interesting.

602
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,339
Unlike your dad.

603
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:52,739
He can be your friend.

604
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,019
Would your parents

605
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:59,099
disapprove of us being together

606
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:00,659
and stop us from getting married?

607
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:07,899
It's our own business.

608
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,312
Nobody can interfere with it.

609
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:10,819
As long as I live,

610
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:12,419
I will be by your side.

611
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:14,739
Stop saying

612
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:15,819
ominous words.

613
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:16,619
Don't you believe

614
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,179
we'll live to be 100 years old?

615
00:28:18,579 --> 00:28:20,379
Okay, 100 years old.

616
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:24,699
Sir.

617
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:25,939
Hello.

618
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:26,739
I'll get the door.

619
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,459
Come on, just give it to me.

620
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:30,059
Alright.

621
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:32,659
Give it to me.

622
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay.

623
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:40,219
I really don't know

624
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,179
why you have to carry that chair back.

625
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:44,499
This is my graduation project.
I won a prize.

626
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,139
I'm gonna bring it back for Grandpa.

627
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:48,259
What about us? We'll just take this van?

628
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:49,259
What else?

629
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:50,499
Isn't this to save money?

630
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,219
Pick up those pastries.

631
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,219
You're so old-fashioned.

632
00:28:56,659 --> 00:28:57,739
They're not for you anyway.

633
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:14,259
Grandpa.

634
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:15,739
We're back.

635
00:29:15,739 --> 00:29:16,499
Grandpa.

636
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,059
What is this?

637
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,499
This is my graduation project.

638
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,459
It's called "Grandpa's rocking chair".

639
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:24,779
Please try it, Mr. Xu.

640
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:28,139
You made this?

641
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,499
It's well made.

642
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,499
The sanding is quite good.

643
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,259
The varnish is nice too.

644
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,219
Let me try.

645
00:29:35,699 --> 00:29:36,299
Give it a go.

646
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,139
"Grandpa's rocking chair".

647
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:42,819
How is it?

648
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:46,179
I'm really fortunate.

649
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:47,539
Grandpa, what's wrong?

650
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:49,699
You're dutiful, and I'm happy.

651
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:50,699
I'm happy.

652
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:53,059
Grandpa, that's enough. I'm hungry.

653
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,059
You went to your brother's place.

654
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:57,459
You wanna give up studying?

655
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:58,819
I've taken time off.

656
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,480
My brother asked me to visit him.

657
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:02,059
Yes.

658
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:04,659
Ye was under too much pressure.

659
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:05,739
He came to me to relax.

660
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:12,859
You can fool your parents.

661
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:14,499
No way you can fool me.

662
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,139
There must be something up.

663
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:19,059
You two just make it up.

664
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,259
Let's see how your dad
deals with the two of you.

665
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,259
So we came to you first.

666
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:25,659
Yes, Grandpa, we'll count on you.

667
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:27,339
Counting on me.

668
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:28,779
You come to me

669
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:29,899
every time you make a mistake.

670
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,259
Your parents have been blaming me
for many years,

671
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:33,979
saying I've spoiled you two.

672
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:36,459
I won't teach you a lesson,
but what about your dad?

673
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:37,979
If he hits me when I go home,

674
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:39,259
I'll just come to your place.

675
00:30:39,459 --> 00:30:40,979
I'll just run away from home again.

676
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:42,379
Once is enough.

677
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,459
Don't do it twice.

678
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,459
What's this?

679
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:48,379
Grandpa,

680
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,699
my girlfriend got
these pastries for you.

681
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:53,979
Is it that girl from your phone?

682
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,099
We've been together for over a year.

683
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:57,299
Be nice to her.

684
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,499
I can tell the girl is really into you.

685
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:01,299
Ye,

686
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:03,939
did you see her?

687
00:31:04,499 --> 00:31:05,059
Yes.

688
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,259
What do you think?

689
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,299
Not bad.

690
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:10,699
Not bad.

691
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:13,019
He says "not bad".

692
00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:15,219
Then she must be quite good.

693
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,059
Hungry?

694
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:19,499
Let's eat this first.

695
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:22,939
Really good.

696
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,819
I love eating this.

697
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:36,619
Lin Ye,

698
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:40,219
go over there and sit.

699
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:44,939
It's okay.

700
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:54,819
I'll get some water for you.

701
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:58,659
Didn't you hear me? Sit down.

702
00:32:08,539 --> 00:32:09,779
What did you go to Chongqing for?

703
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:12,339
I asked him to go.

704
00:32:12,699 --> 00:32:13,459
I knew he wasn't good.

705
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:14,539
I didn't ask you.

706
00:32:15,939 --> 00:32:16,544
I...

707
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,139
I went to clear my mind.

708
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:21,259
Clear your mind?

709
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:24,579
A high school senior

710
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,139
went to clear his mind at this time.

711
00:32:26,539 --> 00:32:27,139
Is that right?

712
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,299
You've even learned
to run away from home.

713
00:32:33,699 --> 00:32:34,979
I didn't run away from home.

714
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:36,819
I went to my brother's place.

715
00:32:38,019 --> 00:32:39,219
Is your brother's place a school?

716
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:43,259
Dad, Ye is under too much stress
from studying.

717
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,939
You have to give him some space.

718
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:46,699
The pressure is too much.

719
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:49,499
Aren't all senior-year students

720
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:51,419
under high pressure?

721
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,859
So many students nationwide
in their senior year.

722
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,779
Aren't they all preparing for the exam

723
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:56,939
under pressure?

724
00:32:57,739 --> 00:32:58,579
Only you are stressed?

725
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:00,499
Only you can't take it?

726
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,259
You want to give up the exam?

727
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:04,339
Alright.

728
00:33:04,579 --> 00:33:05,619
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

729
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:07,459
It's a quite tiring trip
all the way here.

730
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,739
Look at your son.
Shouldn't I say that to him?

731
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:11,139
Even tomorrow?

732
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,859
Tiring? Who isn't tired?

733
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:16,779
I performed four surgeries today.
Am I not tired?

734
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:19,339
Say it nicely. Don't be harsh.

735
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:21,619
I'm too good-tempered

736
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:23,259
and have spoiled them like this.

737
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:24,779
Not a single one listens.

738
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:26,259
Then what else do you want me to do?

739
00:33:27,379 --> 00:33:29,139
I listened to you, so I got into
a top high school,

740
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:31,419
took tutoring classes,

741
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,139
and gave up singing.

742
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,339
I can only sleep five hours a day.

743
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:39,219
And I have to skip rope 1,000 times.

744
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,139
You force me to eat so much food.

745
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,899
I'm like a robot

746
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:44,899
living by your orders,
and what do you want me to do?

747
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:46,659
What are you saying?

748
00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:47,939
Am I your only son?

749
00:33:48,099 --> 00:33:49,819
Can you stop
always focusing on me alone?

750
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:50,699
Come back!

751
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:51,939
Lin.

752
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:52,899
Brat.

753
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:54,219
Dad, don't get anxious.

754
00:33:54,739 --> 00:33:55,859
Are you rebelling?

755
00:33:58,219 --> 00:33:59,379
Brat.

756
00:34:02,219 --> 00:34:03,499
Ye has grown up.

757
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:05,179
Why not talk to him nicely?

758
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:06,099
You shut up.

759
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:07,779
Look at

760
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,058
what kind of example you've set for him.

761
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:11,699
He learned it from you.

762
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,459
Do you think you're all grown up
and independent now?

763
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:17,179
Let me tell you.

764
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,419
You are not grown up yet.

765
00:34:23,618 --> 00:34:24,699
Don't you already have a job?

766
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,499
From now on, rely on yourself.

767
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:28,578
Don't come to me

768
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,699
for money anymore.

769
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:34,019
Am I wrong?

770
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,659
Starting tomorrow,
you keep an eye on him.

771
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:37,899
He mustn't go anywhere.

772
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:40,019
Let's see.

773
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:42,819
Listen, Lin Ye.

774
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,179
If you don't attend a medical school,
you'll repeat the year.

775
00:35:07,259 --> 00:35:08,259
Finally back.

776
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:10,939
The smell of the home is just different.

777
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:11,979
It smells comfortable.

778
00:35:12,379 --> 00:35:13,019
Comfortable.

779
00:35:13,019 --> 00:35:15,099
The hospital really
made me feel suffocated.

780
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:16,299
I smell like disinfectant.

781
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:17,859
But you can't take a bath.

782
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:20,459
Wouldn't that make me stink?

783
00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:22,219
I'll get you some hot water

784
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,019
to wipe your body with.

785
00:35:24,299 --> 00:35:26,059
Later, go lie down in the room.

786
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:28,379
Take off those dirty clothes.
I will wash them for you.

787
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:30,339
Lying down again?

788
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:31,659
I've been lying for so long.

789
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:33,979
My body will go to waste.

790
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,979
The doctor told you to lie down.

791
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,259
What did he tell you?

792
00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:39,739
After coming back, you need
to pay attention to your health.

793
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,179
You need to be careful
with all three meals a day.

794
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:44,219
Your diet should be lighter.

795
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:45,659
And what else?

796
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:47,979
Each week, you must

797
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,099
do 150 minutes of aerobic exercise.

798
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,579
You mustn't drink alcohol anymore.

799
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,019
I'm talking to you.

800
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,859
You can't drink alcohol anymore.

801
00:35:56,899 --> 00:35:57,779
Alright, I won't drink.

802
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,659
You have to monitor
your blood pressure every day.

803
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,019
Even slight high pressure
is unacceptable.

804
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,259
If that's the case,
how am I supposed to live?

805
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:07,139
Life will be so dull.

806
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:08,579
To live

807
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:09,859
a happier life,

808
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:12,059
you have to listen to the doctor, right?

809
00:36:12,219 --> 00:36:13,019
Isn't that so?

810
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:21,019
Tuo.

811
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:22,579
Come have breakfast.

812
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:38,979
Mom,

813
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:41,539
don't you think this is too strict?

814
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,499
Ye is almost 18 years old,

815
00:36:43,699 --> 00:36:45,259
but he doesn't even have freedom.

816
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,739
He's forced to study every day by you.

817
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,619
His personality has changed now.

818
00:36:51,699 --> 00:36:53,099
It will lead to psychological problems.

819
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,419
Which parent doesn't force
their child to study?

820
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:58,459
Do those children get into
Tsinghua or Peking University

821
00:36:58,779 --> 00:36:59,739
without any effort?

822
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,379
If one can't get into those,

823
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,339
does that mean they don't have a life?

824
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,139
Did you instill these thoughts

825
00:37:10,419 --> 00:37:11,619
into Ye?

826
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:13,979
Ye isn't stupid.

827
00:37:14,219 --> 00:37:15,579
He has his own thoughts.

828
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:18,899
What kind of thoughts can a child have?

829
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:20,699
Mom,

830
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:22,459
He's nearly 18.

831
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,579
He's an adult now.

832
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,099
He is still a student.

833
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,859
Does being a student mean
one can't have their own thoughts?

834
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,819
Do you want Ye to end up like you,

835
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:36,739
attending an ordinary university,

836
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:37,859
not being able

837
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:39,459
to find a job after graduating,

838
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:42,139
and having to ask us
for money to rent a place?

839
00:37:42,939 --> 00:37:45,019
Lin Tuo, do you think
your life is good now?

840
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:49,339
If you had listened to us back then
and became a medical student,

841
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:51,979
you would work
at our hospital after graduation.

842
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:54,739
We paved the way for you.

843
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,459
How come you can't understand

844
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:59,179
we were doing it for your own good?

845
00:37:59,379 --> 00:37:59,979
Mom,

846
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,019
that's your and Dad's life,

847
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:03,139
Not ours.

848
00:38:03,499 --> 00:38:04,539
Let me tell you, Lin Tuo.

849
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:06,979
Ye cannot repeat your mistake.

850
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,019
Do you know?

851
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:11,059
Could you please not influence him?

852
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:13,059
Leave him to prepare for the exam.

853
00:38:13,379 --> 00:38:14,659
He has to attend a medical university.

854
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:16,819
I'm off to work.

855
00:38:17,979 --> 00:38:19,179
I'll go back today.

856
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,659
Say goodbye to your grandfather
before you leave.

857
00:38:34,899 --> 00:38:35,899
You got scolded, right?

858
00:38:37,379 --> 00:38:38,219
I almost got beaten up.

859
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:41,259
I had expected that.

860
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:43,059
Your dad

861
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,979
is even more stubborn than I am.

862
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:46,819
What century is this already?

863
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,619
He is still using this method
to educate children?

864
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:52,019
Anyway, I am free.

865
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:53,299
I'll stay in Chongqing.

866
00:38:53,859 --> 00:38:55,019
But what about Ye?

867
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:56,419
He doesn't wanna

868
00:38:57,499 --> 00:38:58,459
go to a medical university.

869
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:01,499
He wants to go
to a music academy, right?

870
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,259
He went to you just for that matter,

871
00:39:04,699 --> 00:39:05,339
right?

872
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,619
How do you know everything?

873
00:39:09,899 --> 00:39:11,379
I have lived for a long time.

874
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:14,419
Just a glance tells me
exactly what you think.

875
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:17,019
Back in the day, my dad

876
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,059
didn't want me to become a carpenter.

877
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:21,299
He wanted me to be an electrician
and take over his work

878
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:22,299
at the factory.

879
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:23,659
I refused.

880
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:26,779
I left home for six years
just because of this.

881
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,339
Your mom didn't listen either.

882
00:39:29,819 --> 00:39:31,459
She insisted on being
a med student with your dad.

883
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,659
Your grandma wanted her to be a teacher.

884
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:35,219
But she didn't listen.

885
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:38,819
As parents,

886
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:41,059
we always want to pave
a path for our children.

887
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:43,659
They don't realize
children have their own paths.

888
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,459
One has to make their way

889
00:39:46,459 --> 00:39:48,339
step by step.

890
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:51,899
Just go down the path

891
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:52,859
you chose for yourself.

892
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:55,019
Remember,

893
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,259
there is no life without regrets.

894
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,339
Grandpa, I have money.

895
00:40:06,019 --> 00:40:07,659
Where is it from as you don't get a job?

896
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:11,059
It's not easy to make
a living on your own,

897
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:12,339
and you have a girlfriend.

898
00:40:12,899 --> 00:40:13,819
Spend it frugally.

899
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:15,339
But don't let her suffer.

900
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:23,459
When I'm settled,

901
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:24,779
I'll bring you over.

902
00:40:24,979 --> 00:40:25,739
We'll live together.

903
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:27,539
I'll be waiting.

904
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:30,739
Thank you, Grandpa.

905
00:40:58,099 --> 00:40:59,488
I knew you were hiding here.

906
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:04,539
I talked to Mom today.

907
00:41:05,499 --> 00:41:06,299
It was of no use.

908
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,579
I don't know how to help you.

909
00:41:11,779 --> 00:41:13,259
I can't change our parents' minds.

910
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:16,899
Does one have to rank first

911
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,739
and get into a top university
to have a life?

912
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,259
Is one

913
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:24,259
only considered successful
when they become a doctor?

914
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:28,419
I don't know.

915
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:30,880
I've never ranked first in exams.

916
00:41:31,379 --> 00:41:33,259
I didn't attend a prestigious school
or become a doctor.

917
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:37,179
But now I also have my own life.

918
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,499
That is why I'm annoyed with you.

919
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,979
It's because you've chosen
the path you wanted

920
00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:53,619
that our parents put all the stress

921
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,539
and hopes on me alone.

922
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,379
You've lived the life you wanted.

923
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:05,899
And all I can do is act
to like a puppet.

924
00:42:18,739 --> 00:42:19,899
You can leave. I'm fine.

925
00:42:24,299 --> 00:42:24,819
(Yes.)

926
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:27,139
(I thought)

927
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:28,739
(I had my own life)

928
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,139
(and even wanted to help you.)

929
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,339
(I thought I could.)

930
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:44,859
Did your dad scold you?

931
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,259
No.

932
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:47,859
We had a meal at Grandpa's.

933
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:49,299
After the meal,
we gave them the pastries.

934
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,059
Grandpa asked me to thank you.

935
00:42:51,539 --> 00:42:53,504
What did Shuguang say today?

936
00:42:54,259 --> 00:42:55,859
They didn't say much.

937
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:58,619
They said the money could be refunded,

938
00:42:58,739 --> 00:42:59,539
but it'd take some time.

939
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:00,899
Really?

940
00:43:00,899 --> 00:43:01,499
Yeah.

941
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:02,379
You're clever.

942
00:43:03,099 --> 00:43:03,979
I just knew it.

943
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:05,339
Let's wait longer.

944
00:43:05,739 --> 00:43:06,368
