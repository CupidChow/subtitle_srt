00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:31,131
Okay, lift your arms up.

32
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:32,251
Some strength.

33
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:34,811
You are weak here.

34
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,371
Yes.

35
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:39,811
Come on, let's check your wrists.
Lift them up.

36
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:41,651
Okay.

37
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:43,171
Come on, here.

38
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:44,371
Put some strength.

39
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:47,171
No strength at all.

40
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,211
My muscles in my right hand
have been twitching lately.

41
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,331
It may have something
to do with the disease.

42
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,952
But it also has something
to do with anxiety.

43
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,531
The more anxious you are,

44
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:10,691
the more noticeable
the muscle twitching will be.

45
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:14,051
Overall, it seems
to have progressed slightly.

46
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,331
But emotions may
have something to do with it.

47
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:18,891
Director Zhou.

48
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,691
The Internet said

49
00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,011
TCM might work,

50
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,291
like acupuncture.

51
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:24,971
Acupuncture

52
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:28,211
is helpful for regulating the body.

53
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,611
But there is still a lack of evidence

54
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,171
for controlling this disease.

55
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,331
However, be cautious
about the information online.

56
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:39,091
Some advertisements and promotions

57
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,611
are unreliable.

58
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:42,691
Be alert and discerning.

59
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,851
Such as spirit rituals,

60
00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:46,571
or swallowing live loaches.

61
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,651
These are highly unreliable

62
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:51,051
and might delay treatment.

63
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,731
You need to take medicine at this stage.

64
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,280
And pay attention

65
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,411
to nutrition and breathing, okay?

66
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:02,651
In addition, adjust your mood.

67
00:04:02,931 --> 00:04:04,091
If you're in a bad mood

68
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,331
or couldn't eat or sleep properly,
it has a huge impact on the disease.

69
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,811
Do your parents
know about your condition now?

70
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:13,211
No.

71
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,011
You'd better talk

72
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,290
to your parents, okay?

73
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:45,331
Bao, is Que here?

74
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,011
No.

75
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:47,331
She would be here by this hour.

76
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,611
Did something happen
between her and Tuo?

77
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:50,931
Don't gossip.

78
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:52,051
Go do your work.

80
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:58,451
Are you going out?

81
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:00,371
I'm going to find Que.

82
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:01,651
What's wrong?

83
00:05:04,851 --> 00:05:05,651
She broke up with Tuo.

84
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:07,651
Broke up?

91
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:42,451
I'm here.

00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:45,051

93
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:47,211

94
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:50,491

or phone number.

00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,451
Calling Chen Guangpu.

98
00:07:08,571 --> 00:07:09,131
(What's wrong?)

99
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:11,211

(Hello, I can't hear you.)

103
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,091
(Hey, Lin Tuo!)

104
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:20,011
(What happened?)

105
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,811
Lin Tuo, how are you?

106
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:26,251
Lin Tuo.

107
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:27,571
Are you awake?

108
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,131
It's me.

109
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,691
Guangpu, don't tell anyone.

110
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:32,571
Okay.

111
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:33,691
W-What's wrong with you?

112
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:34,611
Please wait outside.

113
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,091
Don't be scared, Lin Tuo.
I'm right here.

114
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,771
Lin Tuo is really something.

115
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,811
Not a single phone call
or a WeChat message.

116
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:07,651
Why keep his number?

117
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:08,451
Just block him.

118
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,531
What now?

119
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:19,611
You can't let go, right?

120
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,171
Then get up.

121
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,291
An Zhique, get up.

122
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:26,611
We'll go find him.

123
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,411
What can't be said in person?

124
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,051
Get up.

125
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:31,771
I'm not going.

126
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,251
No need.

127
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:42,971
Doctor.

128
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:45,451
Did he break his leg?

129
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:46,851
No.

130
00:08:47,008 --> 00:08:48,211
The condition is stable.

131
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,331
Well...

132
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:51,331
Take some rest and you can go.

133
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,291
I'll leave you to it.

134
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,011
Just tell the nurse if you need me.

135
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,251
Thank you.

136
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:01,011
I told you.

137
00:09:01,731 --> 00:09:03,891
What's the big deal
about falling down the stairs?

138
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,011
You always fell
when we used to play soccer.

139
00:09:09,011 --> 00:09:09,611
Guangpu.

140
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:13,651
I have something to tell you.

141
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,251
You can't just agree to break up.

142
00:09:19,731 --> 00:09:20,491
What can I do?

143
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,171
Kneel and beg him to stay,

144
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:24,571
huh?

145
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:29,131
I told you.

146
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,771
When in love,

147
00:09:32,331 --> 00:09:33,731
no matter how sweet you two are,

148
00:09:34,571 --> 00:09:36,011
you'd get boring over time.

149
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:39,651
He's not what he used to be.

150
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,371
Now he's entered a big company,

151
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,491
become a designer,

152
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:43,968
and even rented a house.

153
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:49,411
I wonder if his parents
don't accept you.

154
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:52,051
Didn't you say
his parents didn't like you last time?

155
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:55,131
Or his family set him up
with a blind date.

156
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:56,480
Someone with matching social status.

157
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,011
No way.

158
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,971
What's his family's social status?

159
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,251
They're just more educated.

160
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:03,891
Doesn't mean they'd raise any good son.

161
00:10:04,091 --> 00:10:05,632
One is being rude,
and another one cheats.

162
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:06,531
- What the...
- He Xindi.

163
00:10:10,016 --> 00:10:10,931
Stop.

164
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,451
Are you hungry? I'll order some food.

165
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:24,051
Thank you, Director.

166
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:24,811
Goodbye.

167
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,040
Director Zhou.

168
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:27,891
Sorry.

169
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:28,491
It's fine.

170
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:30,451
Director, I have something to ask you.

171
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:32,771
I-I am a friend of Lin Tuo,

172
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,171
the one who was just brought in.

173
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:36,731
He said a lot of confusing things.

174
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,451
What exactly is Lin Tuo's disease?

175
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:41,491
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

176
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:42,931
We also call it ALS.

177
00:10:43,411 --> 00:10:45,851
AL... What kind of disease is that?

178
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,811
It is a disease caused by lesions

179
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,491
in the motor nerve cells.

180
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,211
The causes are complicated.

181
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,371
Well...

182
00:10:54,931 --> 00:10:55,531
Excuse me,

183
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:56,851
didn't he just take a fall?

184
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,371
Did he fall on his head,

185
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,091
or fall on his spine?

186
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:02,171
This has nothing to do with it.

187
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:06,131
It's a problem with
his motor nervous system.

188
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,411
Motor nervous?

189
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,331
Wait, Doctor, listen.

190
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,331
He was a forward
in our school soccer team,

191
00:11:12,491 --> 00:11:13,811
and we played soccer together,

192
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:14,731
like every day.

193
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:16,931
He can't have a motor nervous problem.

194
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:18,211
Calm down.

195
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,931
This disease is quite complex.

196
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:21,731
It can't be explained in a few words.

197
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:25,091
He has been sick for several months now.

198
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,211
And we have double-checked it too.

199
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:28,131
So now,

200
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:29,571
the diagnosis is almost done.

201
00:11:29,691 --> 00:11:30,611
What?

202
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:32,731
Wait, when?

203
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:34,931
Wait, what disease is he diagnosed with?

204
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:36,411
I don't understand it.

205
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:37,771
Calm down.

206
00:11:38,171 --> 00:11:40,651
Lin Tuo's disease
is still in its early stages.

207
00:11:41,011 --> 00:11:42,291
His diagnosis and treatment

208
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,251
are also relatively timely.

209
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:46,531
The disease progression

210
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:48,851
is within reasonable limits.

211
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:50,811
So whenever he goes out,

212
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:52,251
get him

213
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,011
a wheelchair.

214
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,251
Wait, Doctor.

215
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:58,451
I mean, just tell me if this disease

216
00:11:58,611 --> 00:11:59,651
is treatable.

217
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:03,691
Yes,

218
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,731
but it cannot be cured.

219
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:10,611
Incurable?

220
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:14,651
You could say so.

221
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:33,891
Guangpu.

222
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:37,571
Chen Guangpu.

223
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:47,971
Are you out of your mind?

224
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:50,811
You think I'm a fool, right?

225
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,811
It's been several months
and you've never told me.

226
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,931
I don't even know what this disease is.
And you tell me you're diagnosed?

227
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:01,611
I need some time to process it.

228
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,731
What's the situation now?

229
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,851
Would you fall, faint,

230
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:08,851
or whatever?

231
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,851
I'll be paralyzed,

232
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:17,131
and even die.

233
00:13:22,371 --> 00:13:24,011
Wait, wait.

234
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:26,851
This...

235
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:29,091
This is a disease.

236
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,691
Just get the treatments.

237
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,131
Right? Just take medicine, have surgery,

238
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,051
or get hospitalized.

239
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,411
Just get the treatments, right?

240
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:38,131
I'll go ask now

241
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:39,131
if you can be hospitalized.

242
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:40,011
I'll check you in.

243
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:41,411
No matter how much it costs,

244
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,651
I'll have you hospitalized now.

245
00:13:42,811 --> 00:13:44,291
Chen Guangpu, calm down.

246
00:13:47,171 --> 00:13:48,331
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

247
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:55,611
Okay.

248
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:59,091
Tell me why you kept it from me.

249
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,291
I don't know how to tell you.

250
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:12,771
Then...

251
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:16,091
If I hadn't found you today,

252
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,131
you would have kept it from me,

253
00:14:19,251 --> 00:14:19,611
right?

254
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:24,771
Guangpu.

255
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,211
Don't tell Que,

256
00:14:30,811 --> 00:14:31,891
or Xindi.

257
00:14:33,216 --> 00:14:34,251
Don't tell anyone.

258
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,691
You couldn't write with the right hand,

259
00:14:43,331 --> 00:14:44,651
so you practiced with your left hand.

260
00:14:47,651 --> 00:14:48,811
You quitted being a designer,

261
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,171
fought with Que,

262
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:51,171
and broke up with her.

263
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:52,571
All because of this?

264
00:14:59,171 --> 00:15:00,491
Your parents don't know either, right?

265
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:15,371
Lin Tuo.

266
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,531
Being sick is nothing to be ashamed of.

267
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:23,731
And you didn't do anything wrong.

268
00:15:24,811 --> 00:15:25,891
You can tell us.

269
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,691
How long will you carry this alone?

270
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:30,931
It's not time yet.

271
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,171
Then when?

272
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:36,331
I don't know.

273
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,571
Why did you get down?

274
00:16:29,411 --> 00:16:31,131
I can't handle this wheelchair.

275
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,851
It's just a cheap, useless thing.

276
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,331
I'll buy you

277
00:16:34,571 --> 00:16:35,891
a new and smart one later.

278
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,011
Let's go upstairs.

279
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:43,131
Can you walk?

280
00:16:43,811 --> 00:16:44,291
Yes.

281
00:16:59,731 --> 00:17:01,411
Grandpa, have some tea.

282
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,330
Your mom came yesterday.

283
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:11,931
My mom came?

284
00:17:12,691 --> 00:17:13,291
When?

285
00:17:14,971 --> 00:17:15,811
When you were asleep,

286
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:17,731
she sat by your bed for a while

287
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:20,610
and left some food and drinks.

288
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:26,571
Your dad is so mad

289
00:17:27,971 --> 00:17:29,411
that he won't calm down soon.

290
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:32,771
Your mom is caught in the middle.

291
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:37,411
My dad is busy getting a promotion,

292
00:17:37,571 --> 00:17:39,091
so he has no time to care about me.

293
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:42,891
Finally?

294
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:43,971
Right.

295
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:46,251
He's been longing for it,

296
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,811
and done everything for this position.

297
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,571
Boring.

298
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:52,931
He doesn't think so.

299
00:17:56,571 --> 00:17:59,411
None of you can live in peace,

300
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:02,491
making me

301
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:04,571
so worried.

302
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:07,611
I have been upset these few days.

303
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,091
Can't sleep well either.

304
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,611
I think something is going to happen.

305
00:18:12,651 --> 00:18:14,051
You feel upset?

306
00:18:14,651 --> 00:18:15,571
Could it be the heart?

307
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:17,331
Maybe I should call my mom.

308
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:18,171
No, no need.

309
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:20,371
It's not about the heart.

310
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:24,291
I just feel upset.

311
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,251
Give your brother a call

312
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:27,451
and tell him

313
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,051
we'll go to his place if he's not busy.

314
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:36,731
This is nice.

315
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:37,891
Look, it can be folded.

316
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:39,291
You can carry it with one hand.

317
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,171
It's electric

318
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,091
with a phone holder for navigation.

319
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,851
It's like an electric car.

320
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:44,931
And you don't need a helmet.

321
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,651
We'll both get one.

322
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:47,451
It's cool

323
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:48,371
to be on the street.

324
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:49,491
How is it? Get one?

325
00:18:50,771 --> 00:18:51,611
It's too expensive.

326
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:54,331
You're not the one paying for it.

327
00:18:54,491 --> 00:18:55,251
I'll buy it for you.

328
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,131
I've been making
a lot of money in funds.

329
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:57,771
Guangpu.

330
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,291
Don't bother.

331
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,291
It's not a bother at all.

332
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:09,531
We need to get everything we need ready.

333
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:10,251
Right?

334
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,691
If you are sick,
just get the treatments.

335
00:19:11,891 --> 00:19:13,411
I just called and checked everything.

336
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:15,611
We'll take a combined approach
of Chinese and Western medicine.

337
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:16,251
It's okay.

338
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:18,611
I'll take you to and from work.

339
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,851
I don't have a job, so I'm free.

340
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,291
I don't want to work with

341
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:24,451
He Xindi anymore.

342
00:19:24,611 --> 00:19:25,571
I can just quit.

343
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:27,291
I'll tell her
I'll come to keep you accompany.

344
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:28,651
I didn't mean...

345
00:19:28,651 --> 00:19:29,811
Of course, I don't do so for you.

346
00:19:29,811 --> 00:19:31,251
I'm not here just to keep you company.

347
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,891
I'll just come live with you.

348
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:34,931
I'll stay here.

349
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:36,731
- I don't want to live with He Xindi.
- Don't.

350
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:40,483
(Naughty Kid)

351
00:19:41,691 --> 00:19:42,771
I don't want to live with you.

352
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,251
Ye.

353
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,531
Hello, Bro.

354
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:53,371
Grandpa said he misses you,

355
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:54,651
wanting to go over and visit you.

356
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,411
I'll come with him.

357
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:56,851
The next few days?

358
00:19:58,251 --> 00:20:00,611
I'm going to Guangzhou
on business tomorrow.

359
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,251
It might take half a month.

360
00:20:03,091 --> 00:20:04,771
Please tell Grandpa about that.

361
00:20:04,931 --> 00:20:06,651
I don't know when I'll be back.

362
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:07,971
Wait till I get back.

363
00:20:09,491 --> 00:20:10,291
Okay.

364
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:12,291
Ye.

365
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:17,211
How are you doing?

366
00:20:17,931 --> 00:20:18,731
I'm alright,

367
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:20,411
staying at Grandpa's house.

368
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,571
Grandpa is doing well, right?

369
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:26,691
He is pretty good.

370
00:20:31,691 --> 00:20:33,051
Then, tell Grandpa about it.

371
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:34,411
I'm still in a meeting.

372
00:20:34,611 --> 00:20:35,491
Let's chat later.

373
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:36,891
I have to go.

374
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:38,131
Bro...

375
00:20:49,571 --> 00:20:50,371
You should

376
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,171
tell your family about it.

377
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:03,371
Business trip?

378
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:07,931
Okay.

379
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,411
You go do your things.

380
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:49,728
(Grandpa)

381
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:55,211
Hello.

382
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,331
Grandpa.

383
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:57,571
Que.

384
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:01,651
Are you busy?

385
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,611
Not at all, go ahead.

386
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,451
It's nothing.

387
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:07,371
I just missed you,

388
00:22:07,971 --> 00:22:09,451
so I called.

389
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:11,091
How's the cafe?

390
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,091
It is doing quite well.

391
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:16,011
We've now hired a new waiter.

392
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:17,451
But the takeaway platform

393
00:22:17,691 --> 00:22:19,451
takes too much commission,

394
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:21,371
so the profit is a bit less.

395
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,091
That's how it is in business.

396
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:25,571
There are gains and losses.

397
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:29,451
You have to take it slow,

398
00:22:29,731 --> 00:22:31,211
just like raising a child.

399
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:33,131
I know.

400
00:22:34,731 --> 00:22:36,651
Is Tuo helping you out?

401
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:40,651
He comes over every day after work.

402
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:46,411
You'll be busy this weekend, right?

403
00:22:46,971 --> 00:22:48,731
Just ask Tuo to help you.

404
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:52,531
He comes here every weekend
as long as he doesn't have to work.

405
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:54,691
He'd work all day without slacking off.

406
00:22:58,851 --> 00:22:59,531
Good.

407
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,331
Then let's talk later.

408
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:04,451
Okay, goodbye, Grandpa.

409
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:17,611
Here.

410
00:23:18,331 --> 00:23:18,891
Be careful.

411
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,811
Here, it's all yours.

412
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:25,531
Eat what you want.

413
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:27,851
- This one is Lao Gan Ma.
- This is Lao Gan Ma.

414
00:23:28,931 --> 00:23:29,571
Pickles.

415
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:30,451
All set.

416
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:31,811
Here, I'll open them.

417
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:33,931
Put some Lao Gan Ma sauce

418
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:35,611
and pickles.

419
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:37,931
Give it a try.

420
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,731
Be careful.

421
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,011
No.

422
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:51,131
I got choked.

423
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:09,091
Look at this.

424
00:24:10,691 --> 00:24:11,571
This is called

425
00:24:11,811 --> 00:24:12,451
Grandma's Greens.

426
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,731
I think this one is pretty nice.

427
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:21,611
You are still here?

428
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:25,771
I'll stay here tonight.

429
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:30,971
Do you think I'm disabled?

430
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:32,251
What?

431
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,771
No. I didn't mean that.

432
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:36,931
I don't want to see He Xindi.

433
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,211
Alright, then I'll go.

434
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,331
Go to bed early.

435
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:42,451
Call me if you need help.

436
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:43,451
I won't mute my phone,

437
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,251
okay?

438
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:44,891
Just go.

439
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:55,931
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

440
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:57,091
You buy me breakfast.

441
00:24:57,851 --> 00:24:58,411
Okay.

442
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:00,211

00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,451
But

562
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,411
I don't really like running.

563
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,091
I-I-I think,

564
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:37,131
let's race-walk.

565
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:38,051
It's nice.

566
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,170
It doesn't hurt the knees.

567
00:34:39,571 --> 00:34:40,891
Let's race-walk in the morning

568
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:42,250
and then have breakfast together.

569
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:43,491
Of course, your treat.

570
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:46,051
And then I'll drop you off at work.

571
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,170
Perfect,

572
00:34:47,411 --> 00:34:48,331
nice,

573
00:34:48,451 --> 00:34:49,091
and healthy.

574
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:50,531
It's settled then, okay?

575
00:35:04,491 --> 00:35:05,251
Que,

576
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:08,411
are you okay?

577
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:09,891
I'm okay.

578
00:35:11,051 --> 00:35:12,011
Business was good yesterday.

579
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:13,411
I can handle this on my own.

580
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:14,611
What do you mean?

581
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:15,811
I don't need to come then?

582
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:17,571
No, I didn't mean it.

583
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:19,291
If you have something else to do,

584
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,091
I can handle it,

585
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:21,251
so don't worry about the cafe.

586
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:23,011
What else could I do?

587
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:24,731
This is the only cafe I have.

588
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,531
Que,

589
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:28,211
I'll make you a sandwich,

590
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:28,971
avocado-flavored.

591
00:35:28,971 --> 00:35:29,931
It's really delicious.

592
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:31,691
I've been working on it these days.

593
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:34,051
I think we could serve
this sandwich with drinks.

594
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:35,211
A new product.

595
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,051
We can make more money.

596
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:37,011
Okay.

597
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:38,691
Making money is more important.

598
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,691
Money secures everything.

599
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:43,211
Then I'll go do it.

600
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:43,811
Okay.

601
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:48,811
Mom, Dad, let's go.

602
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,171
Let's go to the living room.

603
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:52,171
Take a seat.

604
00:35:53,811 --> 00:35:54,851
I have to ship goods today,

605
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,331
and I need to go sign.

606
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:57,851
Can't we talk later?

607
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:58,611
No.

608
00:36:00,011 --> 00:36:00,971
Do you want more money?

609
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:02,051
Your fund lost money?

610
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:03,451
It's not the fund.

611
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:04,731
It's something serious.

612
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:06,011
We have something to do.

613
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,411
How much money do you want?

614
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:08,171
No!

615
00:36:08,211 --> 00:36:09,531
It's something serious, important.

616
00:36:09,731 --> 00:36:10,331
Ten minutes.

617
00:36:10,491 --> 00:36:11,211
Just ten minutes.

618
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:11,891
Go ahead.

619
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:12,531
Go ahead.

620
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:13,971
I am here to listen.

621
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:15,331
Let me make it clear first.

622
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:17,571
This is

623
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:19,931
an important decision I've made

624
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:21,371
for our family

625
00:36:21,651 --> 00:36:22,291
business system.

626
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:23,931
Just say it.

627
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:26,531
We need to open a hospital.

628
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:29,371
What?

629
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,331
A hospital.

630
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:32,091
Hospitals are very profitable.

631
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:32,771
They save lives.

632
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:34,731
Dad, I'm not finished yet.
Where are you going?

633
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:35,411
Chen Guangpu.

634
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:37,691
Do you know
what kind of business we run?

635
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,011
Wholesaling snacks.

636
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:41,011
What does it relate

637
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:41,931
to a hospital?

638
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,051
It's related.

639
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:45,371
You need to think big

640
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:47,011
and open your mind.

641
00:36:47,251 --> 00:36:49,451
How much money can you make
from wholesaling snacks?

642
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:50,851
You and Mom

643
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:52,171
have been at it for so long,

644
00:36:52,371 --> 00:36:53,651
and our financial condition

645
00:36:54,331 --> 00:36:55,011
is just...

646
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:57,051
Our financial condition is not nice.

647
00:36:57,291 --> 00:36:58,251
This house...

648
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:00,051
This house is not good at all.

649
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:00,971
Not good at all.

650
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,171
And m-my used car

651
00:37:03,371 --> 00:37:04,571
is not good at all.

652
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,051
It's not even a new car.

653
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,051
You can't buy me a new car.

654
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:07,771
Son.

655
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:10,331
Were you tricked by someone again?

656
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:12,331
Let me tell you.

657
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,131
Don't get involved in

658
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:15,811
illegal fund-raising.

659
00:37:15,891 --> 00:37:16,731
That's illegal.

660
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:17,771
I didn't.

661
00:37:17,931 --> 00:37:18,771
You don't understand.

662
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:20,171
Can't you open a hospital?

663
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:21,171
Fine.

664
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:23,291
Do you know any medical expert?

665
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,731
H-Have you

666
00:37:25,091 --> 00:37:26,091
lost your mind?

667
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:27,571
No. Do you know any?

668
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:28,531
No.

669
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:30,251
We sell snacks.

670
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:31,491
How can I know any experts?

671
00:37:31,691 --> 00:37:32,811
Not to mention medical experts.

672
00:37:33,011 --> 00:37:34,331
I only know some pedicurists.

673
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:35,411
W-What?

674
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:37,131
I'm talking serious business.

675
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,491
Forget it. Mom.

676
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,480
Can you still get in touch
with that old TCM doctor

677
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,891
who treated my uncle well?

678
00:37:42,891 --> 00:37:44,531
It's been such a long time.

679
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:45,651
No way.

680
00:37:47,251 --> 00:37:48,731
So no TCM doctor?

681
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:51,131
You two have been doing business

682
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:52,291
for years

683
00:37:52,291 --> 00:37:53,131
out there.

684
00:37:53,251 --> 00:37:55,491
When you scold me,
you are so overwhelming.

685
00:37:55,891 --> 00:37:57,211
But now,

686
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:58,411
you don't even

687
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,411
know anyone.

688
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:08,891
I am very disappointed in

689
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,091
you two.

690
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:12,451
Get lost.

691
00:38:13,811 --> 00:38:15,851
What did I do in my past life

692
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,371
to have this ungrateful brat
in this life?

693
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,131
Experts?

694
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:22,131
If I know any experts,
I'd get your mental illness treated.

695
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:23,571
Give me 20,000 yuan.

696
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:24,651
What?

697
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:26,091
20,000 yuan.

698
00:38:26,291 --> 00:38:27,691
What do you need it for?

699
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,091
Can't I even get 20,000 yuan?

700
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:31,131
No hospital,

701
00:38:31,331 --> 00:38:32,131
no doctor,

702
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:33,091
and no 20,000 yuan.

703
00:38:33,331 --> 00:38:34,891
None of the three wishes
can be fulfilled.

704
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:37,371
Do you still love me?

705
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:39,411
Yes.

706
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,171
Come on, let me love you properly.

707
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:42,491
Wait, I...

708
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:43,491
Love? Come here!

709
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:45,651
This is really important.

710
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:47,331
Stop there, you two.

711
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:49,211
Take care.

712
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:50,331
Please come again.

713
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:50,931
Okay.

714
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:53,131
Xindi, you're here.

715
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,371
I'm here.

716
00:38:54,891 --> 00:38:56,171
If I don't come, I'll be broke.

717
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:59,291
Haven't done a single live-streaming
in the last few days.

718
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:00,731
I've almost lost all my fans.

719
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:05,051
Where's Que? Isn't she here?

720
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:06,771
She's here. Went to take out the trash.

721
00:39:09,211 --> 00:39:10,051
Take a seat.

722
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:12,411
Does she look okay?

723
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:14,291
Yes. She acts normally.

724
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,051
The more I think about it,
the weirder it seems.

725
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,131
Why would they just break up?

726
00:39:22,891 --> 00:39:24,211
They are quite peaceful about it.

727
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:27,051
It feels like they really did break up.

728
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,251
But why nothing happens?

729
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:29,691
But that Chen Guangpu

730
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:31,731
acts like he's lost his mind.

731
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,371
Que.

732
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:34,851
I'll get back to work.

733
00:39:35,011 --> 00:39:35,971
Come on. Listen.

734
00:39:37,491 --> 00:39:38,171
Chen Guangpu

735
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:38,891
got drunk last night.

736
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,211
He was a mess.

737
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:41,131
He's hungover.

738
00:39:41,451 --> 00:39:42,611
Isn't he always hungover?

739
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:44,451
No, it's different this time.

740
00:39:44,731 --> 00:39:47,211
I know what he usually does
when he's drunk.

741
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:48,851
But it was completely different.

742
00:39:49,771 --> 00:39:50,611
What happened?

743
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:51,931
He cried.

744
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:53,171
He even cried?

745
00:39:53,651 --> 00:39:54,451
Is it shocking?

746
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,091
He wailed most of the night.

747
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:57,211
Do you know how kids cry?

748
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,651
Wailing out loudly.

749
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:00,651
With a water bottle in hand,

750
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:02,851
he talked nonsense.

751
00:40:03,171 --> 00:40:03,931
I couldn't get it.

752
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:05,211
Why?

753
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,211
I don't know. Why would I know?

754
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,451
Did something happen to Lin Tuo?

755
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:13,411
Impossible.

756
00:40:13,851 --> 00:40:14,651
He cried

757
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:16,091
as if Lin Tuo were dead.

758
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:19,651
I think some girl dumped him.

759
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,091
I told him long ago to
download the anti-scam app,

760
00:40:22,131 --> 00:40:23,611
but he didn't listen. He deserves it.

761
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,691
Your senior just
bought two cups of coffee.

762
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,291
Is he here?

763
00:40:28,491 --> 00:40:28,971
Yes.

764
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:31,251
Why didn't you tell me?

765
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:32,491
Send me a message.

766
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:34,971
When did he leave? Did he just leave?

767
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:49,611
Senior.

768
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:50,131
Are you free?

769
00:40:50,611 --> 00:40:51,171
Yes.

770
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:52,491
Let's talk.

771
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:08,531
Why did you break up?

772
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:13,891
I don't want to continue.

773
00:41:15,731 --> 00:41:16,571
Why?

774
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,571
Nothing special.

775
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,411
It's just that...

776
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:25,691
I want to be alone now.

777
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:29,171
We've had some disputes before,

778
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:30,411
some fights.

779
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,771
But it was mostly my fault.

780
00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:36,771
Yes, Que is pretty nice.

781
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:39,291
It's my fault.

782
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,931
Any external reason?

783
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:51,171
For example,

784
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:52,571
someone else

785
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:53,971
or something.

786
00:41:56,411 --> 00:41:57,171
No.

787
00:41:57,971 --> 00:41:59,011
There's no one else.

788
00:42:00,011 --> 00:42:01,171
Nothing.

789
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:04,931
It's entirely my decision.

790
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,291
This is your personal affair.

791
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:16,771
I understand that everyone
has the right to make their decisions.

792
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:19,731
But we've known each other for years.

793
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:22,851
You're like a little brother to me.

794
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:25,291
But you are handling this...

795
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:34,531
Go ahead.

796
00:42:40,451 --> 00:42:41,251
You shouldn't...

797
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:46,171
You shouldn't just
break up with a girl like that

798
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:48,691
without any substantial reason.

799
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,491
Que is a really nice girl.

800
00:42:51,491 --> 00:42:52,811
You shouldn't treat her like this.

801
00:42:58,091 --> 00:42:58,731
Senior.

802
00:43:05,131 --> 00:43:06,211
You like Que too,

803
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:07,971
