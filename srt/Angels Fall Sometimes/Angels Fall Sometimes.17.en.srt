I've packed your bag.

You're awake now.

17
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,660
Then

18
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
wash up and eat.

19
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,420

(Nobody Taught Me How To Handle Death)

21
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,740
Didn't I tell you to wait for me

22
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,620
while I went to get the wheelchair?

23
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,740
Can't you see how high the steps are?

24
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,660
What if you fall again?

25
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,140
Doc said you should travel
in a wheelchair from now on.

26
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,900
In a wheelchair.

27
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,820
You get it?

28
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,340
Got it.

29
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,300
Sit.

30
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:46,980
Sit down.

31
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,540
Easy.

32
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,420
Is the height okay for you?

33
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:53,940
Let's go then.

34
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,460
That's enough.

35
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,340
Need something?

36
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,620
Leader, I have a favor to ask of you.

37
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,180
Sit.

38
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,100
Doesn't look like official business.
Go ahead.

39
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,420
Lin Tuo needs to use a wheelchair now.

40
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,820
He can walk, though.

41
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,500
The doctor recommended minimal walking.

42
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,540
Can you make some adjustments

43
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,780
to Lin Tuo's work if possible?

44
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,820
Can he work now?

45
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,540
He wants to.

46
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,100
He doesn't want to bother you.

47
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,060
And it's not him who sent me to you.

48
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,020
I just wanted to ask

49
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,180
if he could possibly

50
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,500
keep his job?

51
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,540
I can help him with some things,

52
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,140
or change my seat if necessary.

53
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,780
Then just join Team 3.

54
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:14,780
Okay.

55
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,980
Han Yuxi wouldn't let me

56
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,020
get away with it if you did.

57
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,340
I can apply myself.

58
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,020
Don't.

59
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,860
You know how sensitive Han Yuxi is.

60
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,260
Moreover,

61
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,500
you're the only ace of her group.

62
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,340
I don't want to cause trouble.

63
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,100
Is Lin Tuo doing okay right now?

64
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,060
He's clearly less spirited than before.

65
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,620
This fall has been quite a blow to him.

66
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,060
I'm afraid he won't be able to cope.

67
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,460
Understood.

68
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,100
Tell him

69
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,380
to take care.

70
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,260
I'll take care of his job.

71
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,860
Thank you, Leader.

72
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,340
See you later.

73
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,740
Okay.

74
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,660
Don't ask Han Yuxi to change your group.

75
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,620
Stay there.

76
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,740
Don't cause me trouble.

77
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,500
Got it.

78
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,500
Hello, here's your coffee.

79
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:26,432
Thank you.

80
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:27,140
Thank you.

81
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,660
No sweat.

82
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:35,620
(He Xindi)

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,300
(Saw Chen Guangpu
and Lin Tuo on my way to HW.)

84
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,780
We need a car

85
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,660
to get up this slope.

86
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,740
I'm exhausted.

87
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,700
Is this speed okay, boss?

88
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,780
Sure, as long as you're not tired.

89
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,780
Need to go any faster?

90
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,700
Disabled, right?

91
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,820
Is this the reason for the breakup?

92
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,060
You're quite the liar. Keep lying.

93
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,380
You should find a decent reason.

94
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,820
Que, it's not what you think.

95
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,620
Then what is it?

96
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,380
Enjoying teaming up and deceiving me?

97
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,660
Feeling good, aren't you?

98
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,340
No, we can explain.

99
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,300
No need for explanations.

100
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,540
Get up.

101
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,740
Lin Tuo, get up and say something!

102
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,300
What happened?

103
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,820
What happened to your arm?

104
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,620
You've seen it.

105
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,500
Let's go home and talk.

106
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,260
Que.

107
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,060
Leave us alone.

108
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,980
So, your arm?

109
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,180
It can't move.

110
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,220
Why?

111
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,180
Disease.

112
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,020
What disease?

113
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,060
ALS.

114
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,940
What will happen?

115
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,340
I'll die.

116
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,620
Can it be cured?

117
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,420
No.

118
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,100
That's why we broke up?

119
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,260
Right.

120
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,540
Okay, then I'll tell you now.

121
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,020
It doesn't count.

122
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,340
An Zhique,

123
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,100
don't. You don't need to do this.

124
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,740
I have made it very clear.

125
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,540
My illness is incurable.

126
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,660
I am not joking with you.

127
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,660
Do you think I am joking with you?

128
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,020
You heard me clearly, right?

129
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,300
This illness gives me only
three years to live.

130
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,940
Five years, tops.

131
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,540
Everyone will die, including me.

132
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,300
It's not like that.

133
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,780
Then you tell me what will happen.

134
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,100
Your arm can't move now, can it?

135
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,860
Can it be treated or not?

136
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,900
It's not as simple as you think.

137
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,740
It's not about treating.

138
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,460
It's an incurable illness.

139
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,940
There's no medicine for it.

140
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,940
It's the arm now.

141
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,540
Soon, it will be the whole body.

142
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,820
I'll be paralyzed, worthless.

143
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,220
You want to see me like this?

144
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,820
You should go.

145
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,820
You deserve better.

146
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,980
I mean it.

147
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,140
Please go.

148
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,312
Go.

149
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,020
Just go!

150
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,260
Why are you yelling at me?

151
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Stop playing this tragic love

152
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,140
with me.

153
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,180
Everyone will die one day!

154
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,220
Even if we make it to two hundred,
we will still die.

155
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,660
Then let's separate after death.

156
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,900
Why must we separate while we are alive?

157
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,528
Stop telling me
this is an incurable illness.

158
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:27,940
Get treatment if you are sick.

159
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,300
Aren't you just fine right now?

160
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,180
Aren't you sitting here all well?

161
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,620
Your arm can still move,

162
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
can't it?

163
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,620
I am asking you, yes or no?

164
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:41,740
You can still sleep well and go out.

165
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,380
You can still sit here properly.

166
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,980
Then why are you
trying to drive me away?

167
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,180
Lin Tuo, If I leave,
will your illness get better?

168
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,540
I don't even know what I did wrong.

169
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,060
And you just don't want me anymore.

170
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,460
Lin Tuo, can you please stop
pushing me away?

171
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,500
Can you please stop pushing me away?

172
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,820
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,740
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,420
He Xindi.

175
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,900
He Xindi, open the door.

176
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,500
Stop knocking. I won't open it.

177
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,380
Do you think I want to deceive you?

178
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
Do you think I feel good deceiving you?

179
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,140
I, Chen Guangpu,
have deceived quite a few people.

180
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,380
I've told quite a few lies.

181
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,100
I really wish it was a lie this time.

182
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,100
I wish it was all a lie.

183
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
It can be treated,

184
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,140
but cannot be cured,

185
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,500
says the doctor.

186
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,180
It means

187
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,460
Lin Tuo's illness cannot be cured.

188
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,540
It is a terminal illness.

189
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,860
Lin Tuo is going to die.

190
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,220
Since that day,

191
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,380
it's like I've been living a dream,

192
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,420
watching my buddy

193
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,380
await death,

194
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,100
but I can't help him.

195
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,020
Lin Tuo is my buddy.

196
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,300
He is my family.

197
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,580
I'm sorry and worried for him.

198
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,740
I dare not tell him,
for fear of making him feel bad.

199
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,860
Every day I still have to

200
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,060
pretend that nothing's happened

201
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,940
in front of all of you.

202
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,980
But what about me?

203
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,340
When I am left alone every night,

204
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,500
what should I do?

205
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,180
Does anyone know how much pain I'm in?

206
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,500
My buddy is going to die.

207
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,980
There's nothing I can do.

208
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,380
Lin Tuo...

209
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,700
Lin Tuo is such a good person.

210
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,580
Why does it have to be Lin Tuo?

211
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,900
Why does it have to be Lin Tuo?

212
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,700
That's how it is with this disease.

213
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,900
Is there really no other way?

214
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,620
Up to now,

215
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,500
there has been no way

216
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,380
to cure this disease.

217
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,340
I understand how you feel.

218
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,660
But I still hope

219
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,340
you can understand ALS

220
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,980
more fully and objectively,

221
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,380
not just from a loved one's perspective.

222
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,380
- Dad.
- What are you doing this late?

223
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,460
We need to talk.

224
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,140
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

225
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,620
Tuo is ill.

226
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,780
I know this disease.

227
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,700
When I was taking care of your mom,

228
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,780
I've seen such patients.

229
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,500
It begins with

230
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,460
limb immobility

231
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,819
and eventually causes total paralysis.

232
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:05,900
And after that...

233
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,220
Tuo is not that severe.

234
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,220
It's just that he needs someone
to take care of him now.

235
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:13,819
Who will do that?

236
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,579
You want to do that?

237
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,940
But you don't have experience.

238
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,140
How could you know how?

239
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,180
Well, I can do laundry, cook,
and household chores, you know.

240
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,579
No,

241
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,579
taking care of a patient

242
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,020
is really different from
doing laundry or cooking.

243
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,300
Dad, it's not about doing laundry

244
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,500
or cooking.

245
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,220
It's about Tuo.

246
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,100
Yes, I know it's about Tuo.

247
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,860
That's why I feel bad about it.

248
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,460
How could such a good person

249
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,340
end up with this disease?

250
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,180
He is already there.

251
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,180
There's no point in saying anything now.

252
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,820
So, how sick

253
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,260
is Tuo now?

254
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,140
He's in a wheelchair.

255
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,820
His legs can't move now?

256
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,780
They can.

257
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,500
The doctor insists on no falls,

258
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,340
so, a wheelchair.

259
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,100
Then how is he supposed to live
his life from now on?

260
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,860
That's why I'm thinking
of moving in with Tuo

261
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,140
to take care of him.

262
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,900
In case

263
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,100
he falls again, or something.

264
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,300
He now needs someone by his side.

265
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,300
You go to Tuo's place to take care of...

266
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,980
No, Que, let me tell you.

267
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,380
Tuo's illness, you know,

268
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,700
is nothing like a fracture or fever.

269
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,980
It's not about lending a hand.

270
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,420
It leads to total paralysis

271
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,060
and he'll be entirely immobile,

272
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,300
needing help with everything.

273
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,860
He's so tall. Can you lift him?

274
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,648
- How can you...
- Dad.

275
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,500
So should I just leave him alone?

276
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,540
Didn't you take care of my mom
the same way back then?

277
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,940
I didn't mean that.

278
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,220
You can help in other ways.

279
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,500
And the person I cared for
was your mom, right?

280
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,740
But Tuo is my boyfriend.

281
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,060
He is also my family.

282
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,940
I

283
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,620
love Tuo, just like you love Mom.

284
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,980
When you were taking care of my mom,
did you think about these things?

285
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,820
No, it has nothing to do with that.

286
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,620
Let me tell you, An Zhique,

287
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,300
you must stay calm now,
do you understand?

288
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,180
You can't just do this
in the heat of the moment.

289
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,100
Because I have taken care of your mom,

290
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,340
I know how hard it is
to take care of a sick person.

291
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,380
I won't let you do it.

292
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,540
Don't try to be a hero, okay?

293
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,980
Dad, no, why would I?

294
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,580
Trying to be a hero for what?

295
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,220
I'll be given a medal or something?

296
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,420
When I was not doing well,
Tuo was by my side.

297
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,740
Now he's not doing well,

298
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,860
and he needs someone.

299
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,900
I need to be by his side. He needs me.

300
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,620
Yes, Tuo needs you.

301
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,900
I need you, too!

302
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,820
Then what do you mean?

303
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,420
- I'm your dad.
- What do you mean?

304
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,140
I also need you to take care of me.
I'm sick too.

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,900
So now it's between boyfriend and Dad,

306
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,140
and I can only choose one?

307
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,580
I didn't make you choose, did I?

308
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,540
- I just want you...
- So what do you mean?

309
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,780
What you're saying now

310
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,940
makes me think
you're especially selfish.

311
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:55,900
No, I'm not.

312
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,340
An Zhique, how am I being selfish?

313
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,740
How am I being selfish?

314
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,780
I won't let my girl go down in flames.

315
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,500
Shouldn't I do that?

316
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,020
Shouldn't I prevent my daughter
from suffering?

317
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,060
I am your father, right?
You are my daughter.

318
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,980
Fine.

319
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,940
If I can

320
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,260
stop you by being selfish.

321
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,900
Okay, then I'll be selfish.

322
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,780
I am selfish! I am selfish!

323
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,808
I'm selfish! I'm selfish!

324
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,380
Don't go, okay?

325
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,620
- What are you doing?
- Okay?

326
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,340
Don't go, please?

327
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,020
Okay?

328
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,220
Just don't do it, okay?

329
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,620
Dad, I know you care about me.

330
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,980
You don't want me to go.

331
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,380
And Tuo,

332
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,660
he also doesn't want me
to endure this hardship.

333
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,580
That's why he insists
on breaking up with me.

334
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,820
But have you thought about me?

335
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,940
If I leave today,

336
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,100
if anything happens to him,

337
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,460
do you think I could live with myself?

338
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:07,060
Dad,

339
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,260
I'm going to speak frankly to you now.

340
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,580
If his illness really can't be cured,

341
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,340
he could only live for
another three to five years.

342
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:20,860
Just

343
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,820
let me endure these
for three to five years.

344
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,300
If I run away today,

345
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,620
I'd have to bear this guilt
for a lifetime.

346
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,700
Is that okay?

347
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,180
Dad, please, I'm begging you, okay?

348
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,660
Let me go, Dad.

349
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,260
Please let me go, I beg you.

350
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,580
Please let me go, okay, Dad?

351
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,180
Dad, I'm begging you.

352
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,500
Please, just let me go.

353
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,220
Tuo,

354
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,500
I bought you breakfast.
Remember to eat it.

355
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,100
Que, what are you doing?

356
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,980
I'm going to buy some food.

357
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,580
What would you like for lunch
and dinner?

358
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:55,980
Que,

359
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,860
let's have a talk.

360
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,340
Let's talk when I get back.

361
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,860
Or I'll just pick what's appealing.

362
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,300
- Eat it before it gets cold.
- Que.

363
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,980
Tuo.

364
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,500
Tuo, wake up, it's time to eat.

365
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,500
Tuo.

380
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,820
Generally, I don't cook.

381
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,940
I can't just casually flex my skills.

382
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,260
These ingredients are quite expensive.

383
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,940
I can't bear to see you waste food.

384
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:58,780
Shut your mouth.

385
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,620
Feel free to skip the meal.

386
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,980
Leave me alone.
Go watch TV or something.

387
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,300
Don't affect my performance.

388
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:08,740
Geez.

389
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,900
The ingredients will be wasted,

390
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,020
and your kitchen
could end up a mess too.

391
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,300
Meal is served!

392
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,140
Here you go.

393
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,900
Well, Lin Tuo.

394
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
Give it a try.

395
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,740
How is it?

396
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,860
Delicious.

397
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,300
Isn't it?

398
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,540
Thank you.

399
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,100
You're welcome.

400
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,380
Really?

401
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,980
Eat more.

402
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,020
Have some more.

403
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,220
Did you make this?

404
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,300
Or what?

405
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:07,380
You...

406
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,420
You ordered it in advance
and hid it here, didn't you?

407
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,580
Come on, we came here together.

408
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,060
Did you see me hide anything?

409
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:15,940
He Xindi,

410
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,260
you can't even wash socks properly.

411
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,740
How did you pull off a feast like this?

412
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,216
I don't believe it.

413
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,740
I've been independent since childhood.

414
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,660
I couldn't even survive
without my cooking skills.

415
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,500
These dishes are nothing special,

416
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,060
I'll cook something fancier
for you next time.

417
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,860
For this meal you made today,

418
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,260
I take back my words about you
not being able to get married.

419
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,780
If you could make me dishes
like this every day,

420
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,940
I might marry you.

421
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,700
Forget it.

422
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,540
I'd marry the tree downstairs

423
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,540
before marrying you.

424
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
Also, I won't spend my days

425
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,620
cooking like a maid,
no matter who I marry.

426
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,660
Then you still won't be able to
get married.

427
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,700
So you get married

428
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,460
just to have someone cook for you?

429
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:56,940
For mutual benefits.

430
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,940
She makes delicious food for me.

431
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,980
I earn money to support her.

432
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,140
No problem, right?

433
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,620
Okay, Chen Guangpu,

434
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,740
if you give me
one hundred thousand yuan a month,

435
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,940
maybe I'll consider marrying you.

436
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,580
Then you might as well marry a tree.

437
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,980
Come on, Lin Tuo, eat some more.

438
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,576
(Luzhou Tongxin Hospital)

439
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,300
Ma'am, someone wants to see you.

440
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,100
Let them in.

441
00:28:29,504 --> 00:28:30,260
Auntie.

442
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,460
Tuo

443
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,940
doesn't want you to know.

444
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,780
So at that time,

445
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,020
he broke up with me quite decisively.

446
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,980
That's so Tuo.

447
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,140
He seems obedient
but is very stubborn inside.

448
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,100
What I'm worrying about now is

449
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,620
how to keep it from Dad and Ye.

450
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,540
Ye will be back on vacation.

451
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,220
You can't hide it from Ye.

452
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,580
But Grandpa...

453
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
He is getting old.

454
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,220
His heart isn't good.

455
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,540
He raised Tuo on his own.

456
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,220
We can't tell him.

457
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,780
I understand.

458
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,740
So I came here

459
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,420
to discuss with you
about taking care of Tuo.

460
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,980
I know.

461
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,140
You two love each other.

462
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,980
But it's not as simple as you think.

463
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,180
I'm planning to retire early

464
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,180
or resign

465
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,860
to take care of Tuo.

466
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,620
Auntie.

467
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,740
What I'm thinking is,

468
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,936
Mr. Lin and you are

469
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:53,740
professionals,

470
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,860
so of course you know how
to take care of him better than I do.

471
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,900
But to treat this illness,

472
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,820
we need maybe years,

473
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,460
not just a few months.

474
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,780
The cost of treatment and nursing care

475
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,660
can be quite high.

476
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,100
We can't all just quit our jobs, can we?

477
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,180
What if

478
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,740
we have to go to Beijing

479
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,660
or Shanghai for treatment?

480
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,620
Or what if we have to go abroad?

481
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,060
All of this requires money.

482
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
You two should

483
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,540
just keep working and earning money.

484
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,580
I'll take care of Tuo.

485
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,620
My cafe isn't far from Tuo's home.

486
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,180
I can bring him along when I go to work.

487
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,740
It's okay.
It won't affect my work at all.

488
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,900
Tuo isn't that sick right now.

489
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,740
He can still work.

490
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
Right now, we just need

491
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,780
to give him some confidence.

492
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,460
Tell him everything is fine,

493
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,340
and that he just needs to take care.

494
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,780
Que,

495
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,340
you're only in your twenties.

496
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,900
This is too much for you.

497
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,580
It's not fair.

498
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:08,740
Auntie,

499
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,820
Tuo being sick is fate.

500
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,620
I am his girlfriend.

501
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,780
That's also fate.

502
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,460
Since we've already accepted this fate,

503
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,860
we can't let it defeat us,

504
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,140
can we?

505
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,500
You two love Tuo,

506
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,180
so do I.

507
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,020
We can't give up on him.

508
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,460
Thank you.

509
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,820
- What a coincidence!
- Grandpa.

510
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,500
I just bought some plums, your favorite.

511
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,780
Thank you, Grandpa.

512
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,740
I could've prepped

513
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,220
something nice if I knew.

514
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:02,620
I can get some fish from the market,

515
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,500
and make you fish
with pickled vegetables.

516
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,380
No need.

517
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,980
I just came by to see you.

518
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:09,984
I have to go back soon.

519
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,140
Bao is alone in the cafe.

520
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,940
He can't manage it.

521
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,460
Now that you're here,

522
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,540
at least have a meal with me.

523
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,380
We can eat together
when Tuo returns from his business trip.

524
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,900
That would be better, wouldn't it?

525
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,460
I just came back to see you.

526
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,220
Tuo's been traveling a lot recently,
hasn't he?

527
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,540
He doesn't even reply

528
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,300
to my video messages.

529
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,020
No kidding.
He's been really busy recently,

530
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,740
working overtime every day,

531
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,620
and traveling every week.

532
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,060
I can hardly see him.

533
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,420
Last time we dated,
we watched a movie together.

534
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,060
That was two months ago.

535
00:32:39,488 --> 00:32:41,860
That won't do.
How are you supposed to live like this?

536
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,260
If we don't strive now,

537
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,740
life will be even harder later, right?

538
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,060
Rest assured, I support him,

539
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,780
a hundred percent.

540
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,940
We are good.

541
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,740
Dad.

542
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,020
Why are you here?

543
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,260
You should be at work.

544
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,100
Just finished a surgery.

545
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,460
Uncle.

546
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,660
Tuo's mom said you were here,

547
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,260
so I came to see you.

548
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,500
Grandpa,

549
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,340
could you please make me a cup of tea?

550
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,460
I'm craving for your herbal tea.

551
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,500
With some ginseng, please.

552
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,780
No problem. I got a lot of good stuff.

553
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,580
One for Shouzheng as well.

554
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,620
You'll sleep very soundly at night.

555
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,100
Thank you, Grandpa.

556
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,740
Tuo's mom has already told me.

557
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:33,980
You...

558
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,860
Don't worry.

559
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,820
Thank you.

560
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,860
Tuo is lucky to have you

561
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,940
as his girlfriend.

562
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,380
Then let's work hard together

563
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,060
to make this luck last longer.

564
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,380
I'm getting on in years

565
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,219
and feeling weaker now.

566
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,020
No way.

567
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,060
You play gateball pretty well,
don't you?

568
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:19,940
You even won a trophy.

569
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:21,980
I cheated,

570
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,300
kicking the last ball in with my foot.

571
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,420
That counts too.

572
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,540
I don't know if I can take part

573
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,860
in next year's season.

574
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,060
I can't leave Tuo behind.

575
00:34:36,619 --> 00:34:37,860
Tuo is doing well.

576
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,619
I'm by his side.

577
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,340
You have nothing to worry about.

578
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,460
Of course,

579
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,940
I feel much more at ease with you there.

580
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,139
I hope you two live

581
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,699
a long and happy life together.

582
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:55,540
I promise you.

583
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:58,260
We will definitely live a long
and happy life together.

584
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,460
Okay.

585
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,500
Grandpa.

586
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,060
The cab's here. I should go.

587
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,064
Call me anytime if you need anything.

588
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:08,740
Alright.

589
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,140
You may go back.

590
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,500
Text me when you get home.

591
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,140
Sure thing.

592
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,140
Que,

593
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,460
next time, remember

594
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,540
to bring Tuo along.

595
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,180
We'll come to see you
together next time.

596
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,140
I'll tell him as I get back.

597
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,460
See you, Grandpa.

598
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,140
Take care.

599
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,380
It's cold here.

600
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,300
Let's go inside.

601
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,660
Just a few more minutes.

602
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,340
Okay.

603
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,460
Do you know where I went today?

604
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,368
I went to your home.

605
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,580
I met with your dad, mom, and grandpa.

606
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,540
Did you tell Grandpa?

607
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,100
How could I?

608
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,260
I told him you were on a business trip.

609
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,060
I came back to attend a wedding

610
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,460
and to visit him.

611
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,740
Then

612
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,740
what did you say to my parents?

613
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,700
Haven't you always wanted to talk to me?

614
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,100
So, shall we talk now?

615
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:23,380
Sure.

616
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,820
Auntie told me

617
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,300
she's preparing to resign.

618
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,620
Uncle

619
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,980
also plans to give up the race for dean

620
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,140
to look for a cure for you.

621
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,304
I said to Auntie

622
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,900
that I hope they can continue working.

623
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,700
After all, treating this illness

624
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,980
will cost a lot of money.

625
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,980
We can't just all stop working, can we?

626
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,940
So I'll take care of you.

627
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,900
I'll be a burden to you.

628
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,580
Hear me out.

629
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,940
When I first learned
that you had this illness,

630
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,580
I was indeed overwhelmed.

631
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,940
Later, I went to see Director Zhou,

632
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,540
visited the rehabilitation center,

633
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
and saw those patients with ALS.

634
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,540
I now have a rough idea
of what this disease is like.

635
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,260
Actually, I'm quite scared.

636
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,660
I don't know if I can handle it,

637
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,900
or how long I can hold on.

638
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,060
I'm not a particularly great person.

639
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,340
I do this only because I love you.

640
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,780
I want to stay by your side.

641
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,020
So don't feel like a burden.

642
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,340
I can't make any promises.

643
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,700
When I can no longer hold on,

644
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,660
I might run away

645
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,540
or give up.

646
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,820
So while I'm still here,

647
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,060
let me stay by your side.

648
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,020
Que.

649
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,660
- I...
- If one day I give up,

650
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:25,900
could you not blame me?

651
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,140
I won't.

652
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:32,500
Never.

653
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:36,700
Okay.

654
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,060
Then in every weekend to come,

655
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,860
your mom and dad
will come to live with us.

656
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,580
I run my cafe,

657
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,340
and you keep working.

658
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,820
None of us will give up.

659
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,340
You also have to cheer up.

660
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,060
Let's all be a bit cooler, shall we?

661
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,140
Don't cry, shout,

662
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,740
or feel helpless

663
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,620
when things

664
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,220
get tough.

665
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,620
I won't accept
any suggestions made to me.

666
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,780
I demand

667
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,100
that we face this together.

668
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,180
Don't ever think about driving me away.

669
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,020
It's pointless.

670
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,180
So don't bother.

671
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,300
I'm not discussing this with you now.

672
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,620
I'm demanding you.

673
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,500
Do you understand?

674
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,100
Okay.

675
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,140
Then let's go to bed.

676
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,300
Tomorrow is a new day.

677
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,980
Let's begin with a good night's sleep.

678
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,620
Let's go.

679
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,740
Come on, stretch your arms.

680
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,180
That's good.

681
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,580
Dress up sharply

682
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,620
and go to work with me at HW.

683
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,140
Let's go.

684
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,700
Let's go.

685
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:33,780
Chen Guangpu

686
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,220
did get you an advanced wheelchair.

687
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,060
Yeah, it's electric,

688
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,260
moving on its own.

689
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,460
But I may not be able to operate it
with my hands in the future.

690
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,980
Exactly, no matter how advanced it is,

691
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,700
it still requires humans to operate it.

692
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,660
Could it possibly be voice-controlled?

693
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:53,330
(HW Cafe)

694
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,380
Tuo.

695
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,780
- I'll do it.
- Bao.

696
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Take it easy.

697
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,060
Alright, one, two, three.

698
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,260
Be careful.

699
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,340
Welcome back.

700
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,780
I have already prepared food for you.

701
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,980
We got iced Americano,

702
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,620
ginseng lemon blossom tea,

703
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,420
and silky egg and shrimp sandwich.

704
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,740
Give it a try.

705
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,780
Okay.

706
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:20,940
Try it.

707
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,460
Is it tasty?

708
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,700
It is.

709
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,180
Tuo, I am so happy to have you back.

710
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,660
Plus, I also can take care of you.

711
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,940
I'm good at it.

712
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,540
For free!

713
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:36,820
And

714
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,700
I don't know what else to say.

715
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,780
Anyway, just keep it up.
We all love you.

716
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:43,980
Thank you, Bao.

717
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,500
Right, I baked a cake for you.

718
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,100
I'll go get it.

719
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,300
Mr. Lin.

720
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:51,940
How is it?

721
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,460
Not that bad, right?

722
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Amazing, actually.

723
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,580
