Here's the meal.

18
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:30,976
Looking for an apartment is exhausting.

19
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:33,216
They are too expensive.

20
00:03:33,216 --> 00:03:34,376
Don't you use a broker?

21
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:39,496
No. It costs money.

22
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,936
I'm starting a business,
so I need to save money.

23
00:03:43,016 --> 00:03:44,736
Doing business is really tough.

24
00:03:44,736 --> 00:03:47,096
My great ambitions
are dashed in a flash.

25
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,336
Don't you find a suitable one?

26
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,736
I thought the flower shop was okay.

27
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,336
Just a bit far from you.

28
00:03:57,256 --> 00:03:59,456
We are talking about business here.

29
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:01,136
Let's make it big.

30
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,536
You two can meet every day.

31
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:04,976
I'm thinking about my dad.

32
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,376
If I get busy,
I won't have time for him.

33
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:08,696
Then he can come to me every day.

34
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,496
You're just too tied up.

35
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,176
Lin Tuo, your place here is pretty nice.

36
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:18,975
Any other ones for rent?

37
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,896
I could rent one in this community.

38
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,376
That way, we could live closer.

39
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,616
So I could come have a meal.

40
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:26,256
Then you'll have to pay me.

41
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:27,336
Don't be that petty.

42
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:30,696
The landlord has three apartments
in this community. I can ask him.

43
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:34,896
Three? What does he do?

44
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,256
It must be nice to be rich.

45
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:38,576
Does he still need a girlfriend?

46
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:41,776
He's already married,
and his child can even play online games.

47
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,616
Okay, tell me if he gets divorced then.

48
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:47,296
I think this one is pretty nice.

49
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:51,536
No way, it's not even
as nice as Lin Tuo's place.

50
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:55,856
Guangpu.

51
00:04:59,136 --> 00:04:59,936
Change your shoes.

52
00:04:59,936 --> 00:05:00,936
What for?

53
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:01,576
Why are you here?

54
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:02,216
Why are you here?

55
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,896
What's wrong? You bring luggage.

56
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:06,696
You scared me.

57
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:07,496
Running away from home.

58
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:11,176
Come on.
You got kicked out by your dad, right?

59
00:05:11,736 --> 00:05:13,936
Didn't you go apologize to your dad?

60
00:05:13,936 --> 00:05:16,696
It's useless. They don't buy that.

61
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,416
I was just about to start,

62
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,976
but he scolded me hard,

63
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:24,136
and even said to have me work
as a security guard at his factory.

64
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:24,816
Security guard?

65
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,776
It's too much! Right?

66
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:31,776
What's wrong?

67
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:33,096
A red slap mark.

68
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,072
You are not his biological child.

69
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:37,496
I suppose so.

70
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:39,736
It's not the first time.

71
00:05:39,736 --> 00:05:41,216
Why do you still go against him?

72
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,976
I graduated from college, comes from
a wealthy family, and am quite handsome.

73
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:48,096
I'm quite a figure
among the local youths.

74
00:05:48,096 --> 00:05:50,296
If I become a security guard,
how do I go to KTV?

75
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,976
How do I book a booth at the nightclub?

76
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,736
How do I communicate with my girls?

77
00:05:56,736 --> 00:05:58,016
It's not about being a security guard.

78
00:05:58,016 --> 00:05:59,816
My dad just wants to watch me every day.

79
00:05:59,816 --> 00:06:01,696
He said I squandered the money.

80
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:03,856
He said I had no shame.

81
00:06:04,456 --> 00:06:06,136
I was about to discuss with him,

82
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:08,936
and he slapped me hard in the face.

83
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,776
Well, I think that's not hard enough.

84
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:13,536
Your dad should have
slapped you like this.

85
00:06:13,536 --> 00:06:15,736
Hey, don't you feel sorry for me?

86
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:18,736
I'm 22 years old
and still getting slapped.

87
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:20,416
That's intentional injury.

88
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,496
I'm being filial
that I don't call the police.

89
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,736
Your dad is so unlucky

90
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,776
to have you.

91
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,416
It's my fault again?

92
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,856
I never steal, rob,
or have any bad habits.

93
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:33,176
I'm just a bit lazy, that's all.

94
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,296
He raised me this way.
It's not my fault.

95
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,736
So what?

96
00:06:38,456 --> 00:06:41,616
He told me I couldn't live without him.

97
00:06:41,616 --> 00:06:43,072
I just don't believe it.

98
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:44,936
When I broke up with a girl before,
at least I threw up...

99
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:48,536
I threw up for at least a week,
and I survived.

100
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:50,376
I could live without anyone.

101
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,696
I'll show them I can make it.

102
00:06:52,696 --> 00:06:55,296
I'll show them I can make money
and be independent.

103
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:58,136
Don't go home on your knees
when you're done spending your money.

104
00:06:58,136 --> 00:06:59,056
Of course.

105
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,056
Alright then.

106
00:07:02,216 --> 00:07:06,256
So you're bringing your luggage
to my place to stay?

107
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:09,416
What else? Or I'll stay in a hotel?

108
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:12,456
I've just become independent,
so I don't have much money.

109
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:13,536
Staying at a hotel costs much.

110
00:07:14,296 --> 00:07:15,936
There's only one bed at my place.

111
00:07:16,456 --> 00:07:17,496
Then you just make do.

112
00:07:18,216 --> 00:07:20,160
You can sleep on the sofa.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,816
Wait.

114
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:24,656
I've helped you so much before.
You have to repay me somehow.

115
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:25,976
I won't stay long.

116
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,816
I'll look for a place in this community.

117
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,016
He Xindi is going to rent a place too.
You two can share the lease.

118
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:33,456
No. It is improper
for a man and woman to live together.

119
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:37,256
Like I want to live with you.

120
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,976
I'm afraid
you'll set me up in the night.

121
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:45,296
Back then, I assured my parents

122
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:50,336
that I'd be a monk if I couldn't
make 50,000 yuan in three months.

123
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,856
I told my dad exactly the same thing

124
00:07:56,536 --> 00:07:58,216
when I came to Chongqing for college.

125
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,456
My parents have long been divorced.

126
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:06,176
My dad has remarried twice,
and it gets worse every time.

127
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:09,456
His current wife even has a son,

128
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,256
who's two years older than me.

129
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:14,376
My dad treats him like his own son,

130
00:08:15,056 --> 00:08:16,136
and doesn't care about me.

131
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,096
I don't care if he cares about me.

132
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:24,856
I am determined

133
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,416
to make big money on my own.

134
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:29,256
I'll make the three of them regret it.

135
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,016
Cool! Come on.

136
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:32,416
Cheers!

137
00:08:38,376 --> 00:08:41,656
I'm indeed a bit happier than you.

138
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:46,976
My parents still love me,
but they look down on me.

139
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,536
So I need to prove myself.

140
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,896
We must prove ourselves.

141
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:51,736
Right.

142
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:54,136
We're the ones
who can do the big things.

143
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:54,816
Right.

144
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:57,216
Tell me, how do you want to make money?

145
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:58,856
I make quick money.
I'll do financial management.

146
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:02,256
No, that won't work.

147
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,656
Tell me how much you've lost.

148
00:09:05,776 --> 00:09:10,016
Listen to me. Join me in livestreaming.

149
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:12,016
Just ask Que.

150
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:16,216
Que, do I make money via livestreaming?

151
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:17,536
No.

152
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:20,496
Did you hear that? Que said no problem.

153
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:21,456
She said so?

154
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:22,496
She said so.

155
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:28,056
Que, do I make money via livestreaming?

156
00:09:28,056 --> 00:09:29,616
- No.
- No.

157
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,456
Look, they said it's no problem.

158
00:09:34,536 --> 00:09:38,016
Keep your voice down.
The neighbor has a bad temper.

159
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:44,256
I've already made money.

160
00:09:44,256 --> 00:09:46,736
Otherwise, could I rent a house here?

161
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,016
About the livestreaming,

162
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:53,736
even though it's tough,
it has a promising future.

163
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:55,856
Let me tell you, just follow me.

164
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:59,696
You and I make 100,000 in three months.

165
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:00,456
Really?

166
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:01,576
Really.

167
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:05,016
I have some private savings.
We'll do it together.

168
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,976
Sure. May our cooperation succeed.

169
00:10:06,976 --> 00:10:07,936
Business is booming.

170
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:08,536
Cheers!

171
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:09,216
Come on.

172
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:13,056
It's so late now!

173
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,136
It's time for sleep.

174
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:19,056
Bro, let's have a drink together.
Cheers!

175
00:10:19,056 --> 00:10:19,936
Are you guys crazy?

176
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:21,736
Don't drag me.

177
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:22,848
Sorry, sorry.

178
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:23,696
Watch my livestreaming.

179
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:24,216
Don't drag me.

180
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:28,576
Watch my livestreaming, come on.

181
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:30,576
Whatever you like,
I'll give you a discount.

182
00:10:31,136 --> 00:10:32,176
Let's go.

183
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:39,216
Here.

184
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:40,136
Thank you.

185
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:44,816
You can't start
thinking about losing money.

186
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:47,616
Let's rent a small shop first.

187
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,016
Isn't this place pretty good?

188
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,216
And business is booming.

189
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:56,136
Your cake and coffee are profitable.

190
00:10:56,136 --> 00:10:57,456
Have confidence in yourself.

191
00:10:58,216 --> 00:10:59,656
I certainly have confidence.

192
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:01,696
Then you are worried about money.

193
00:11:02,776 --> 00:11:04,512
You have the skills and the confidence,

194
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,136
fond of this thing,

195
00:11:06,136 --> 00:11:07,360
and you are not short on money.

196
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,136
So you just need a shop, right?

197
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,056
Then I'll turn pressure into motivation.

198
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:12,856
I can surely find one.

199
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:14,776
I'll accompany you.

200
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:22,736
Oh, Que, go home with me
this weekend and see my parents.

201
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:23,976
I told my mom I am a regular worker.

202
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:28,136
This weekend? Just two days left.

203
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,496
So sudden?

204
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:33,096
Is that so? We've been together
for such a long time.

205
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:34,016
And I've also met your dad.

206
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,856
Now I have a stable job
and a rented house.

207
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:40,736
It's time for my parents
to meet who I'm marrying.

208
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,816
But I'm not stabilized yet.

209
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,456
I work all part time.

210
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,736
If your parents ask me what I do,

211
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:52,696
I'll be looked down upon.

212
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:54,696
You're about to be the boss.

213
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:55,896
How could they look down upon you?

214
00:11:57,856 --> 00:12:01,776
My parents are traditional,
but they are nice. Don't worry.

215
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,136
Would they fight when they get up?

216
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:11,776
Do they get up?

217
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:14,256
No.

218
00:12:33,284 --> 00:12:34,308
Oh my!

219
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:40,416
Guangpu, y-you're awake.

220
00:12:41,296 --> 00:12:42,456
What are you doing sitting there?

221
00:12:45,656 --> 00:12:48,176
Did you forget what you did last night?

222
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:59,776
No way. I'm fully dressed.

223
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:03,816
I knew you would set me up in the night.

224
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,616
What are you thinking? Wake up.

225
00:13:09,696 --> 00:13:11,016
What do you mean? Don't you admit it?

226
00:13:11,536 --> 00:13:12,856
What?

227
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:17,664
(Livestreaming Cooperation Agreement)

228
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:22,464
(Livestreaming Cooperation Agreement)

232
00:13:31,016 --> 00:13:34,056
W-When did I sign it?

233
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:35,856
I-I don't remember it at all.

234
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:37,696
You drank too much,

235
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:40,136
insisting on
doing livestreaming with me.

236
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:42,056
Did you trick me into signing it?

237
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,496
Come on.

238
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,496
Last night, you almost jumped down.

239
00:13:46,496 --> 00:13:49,136
I was the one who stopped you.

240
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,696
Exactly! That proves I was too drunk,

241
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:54,136
and I had no sense,
so this doesn't count.

242
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:56,456
But you signed the agreement.

243
00:13:58,016 --> 00:13:59,176
What legal effect does it have?

244
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,216
If I said to marry you,

245
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,776
would I have to marry you the next day?

246
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:06,416
Don't worry. I would never marry you.

247
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:07,456
But don't try to run from this.

248
00:14:09,136 --> 00:14:14,536
What? Drinking can lead to mistakes.

249
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:19,576
500,000? I don't have 500,000.

250
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:20,376
Pay in installments.

251
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:33,456
There's no evidence now.

252
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,736
I knew it, you little mischief.

253
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:39,416
This contract comes in two copies.

254
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:40,696
(Livestreaming Cooperation Agreement)
You just tore up your copy.

255
00:14:40,696 --> 00:14:42,456
This one has the same legal effect.

256
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:52,176
I must quit drinking!

257
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:55,256
Take it away.

258
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:01,856
Lin Tuo.

259
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,176
The exhibition materials are ready.

260
00:15:03,176 --> 00:15:04,416
Let's check them this afternoon.

261
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,376
Okay.

262
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,216
Oh, how many proposals
have you prepared?

263
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:07,896
Four.

264
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,136
What's with your hand?

265
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,576
My hand seems weak,
and I don't know why.

266
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,296
We've been working on computers
for a long time.

267
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,216
It might be cervical spine pressure.

268
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:20,656
And you have to make drawings.

269
00:15:22,136 --> 00:15:23,856
Try some calcium supplement.

270
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,016
Okay, I'll give it a try.

271
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:26,576
Okay, I'll call you when we set off.

272
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,496
Cervical spine pressure.

273
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:40,376
What's wrong, Tuo?
Why buying so much medicine?

274
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:41,456
Are you feeling unwell?

275
00:15:42,056 --> 00:15:46,376
No. Maybe I've been drawing too much.

276
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,856
I can't exert any strength in my hand.

277
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:49,816
I might lack of calcium,

278
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:51,976
so I bought some calcium tablets.

279
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:55,416
You might as well go exercise.

280
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,776
Let's get a gym card.

281
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:58,856
I do want to exercise.

282
00:16:00,056 --> 00:16:01,456
I haven't played soccer recently,

283
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,056
and my abs aren't even visible anymore.

284
00:16:03,056 --> 00:16:04,216
Really? Let me check.

285
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:05,976
You want to check?

286
00:16:07,616 --> 00:16:08,816
Come on, let's go inside to check.

287
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:16,096
Put me down.

288
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,576
What are you two doing? It's early now.

289
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:22,256
Go to your room. I'm here.

290
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:25,056
Wait, don't you even knock
when you enter?

291
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,576
Why would I knock?

292
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:27,536
I have the passcode.

293
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,656
Change the passcode right now.

294
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,176
Dangerous statement, An Zhique.

295
00:16:32,176 --> 00:16:34,816
I'm living with Lin Tuo now, not you.

296
00:16:35,336 --> 00:16:36,576
I can change the passcode too.

297
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:38,216
So scary.

298
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:39,136
Scary, right?

299
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:39,856
How dare you!

300
00:16:39,856 --> 00:16:41,616
I can change it now.
I'll do it immediately.

301
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,496
Didn't you go for Xindi?

302
00:16:43,016 --> 00:16:44,576
Don't mention her.

303
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,896
She is sick.

304
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:50,856
Listen, she said
if I go back on my word,

305
00:16:50,856 --> 00:16:54,016
she'd go to my parents
and tell them I got her pregnant.

306
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,176
I wonder how she knows this trick.

307
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:57,896
An Zhique, control your bestie.

308
00:16:57,896 --> 00:16:59,776
She's too wicked.

309
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,416
Aren't you two sharing the lease?

310
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:02,656
You can make money together.

311
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:05,335
I was forced to do it. I didn't want to.

312
00:17:05,335 --> 00:17:07,016
It's all fate.

313
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:10,256
What? I don't want it at all.

314
00:17:10,256 --> 00:17:13,416
This is a bad karma.

315
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:16,976
How's your shop going?

316
00:17:16,976 --> 00:17:18,696
Why would I tell you?

317
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,936
I was forced to be a shareholder,

318
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:23,576
so I have a right to know
what's going on with my investments.

319
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:29,056
Tell me the business plan
and the return on investment.

320
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:30,096
At least give me a proposal.

321
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:35,496
Okay, Mr. Chen, I'll go get it now.

322
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:41,456
You'd better be careful.

323
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:42,736
What am I supposed to be careful?

324
00:17:42,736 --> 00:17:43,936
I'm still here.

325
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:52,696
I still want to check Linglong Alley,

326
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,496
thinking of finding a shop around here.

327
00:17:54,496 --> 00:17:56,776
Sure. If you find it okay,
just make your decision.

328
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:57,576
We've seen so many.

329
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,856
Okay, I can't jump anymore.

330
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,416
50 more.

331
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:04,856
More? You want to exercise.
Why do I have to do it too?

332
00:18:04,856 --> 00:18:07,616
Let's get fit together,
in order to grow old together.

333
00:18:13,256 --> 00:18:17,896
I'll count for you. You'd jump,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

334
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:19,656
What time is it?

335
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,016
Why hasn't he arrived? Is it here?

336
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:24,456
It's him.

337
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:25,576
Is it?

338
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,536
I guess you two are here
to see the apartment?

339
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,816
You're the landlord, right?

340
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:35,096
Yes. Sorry for being late
as I had to drop my kid to school.

341
00:18:35,096 --> 00:18:35,696
It's okay.

342
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,656
Don't mind the old buildings
around here.

343
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:40,456
But my apartment is perfect.

344
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:42,216
Wait a moment. I'll lock the car.

345
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:43,176
Okay, no problem.

346
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,776
I don't think there are suitable places
for a shop around here.

347
00:18:47,776 --> 00:18:51,096
Just take a look. It won't cost us any.

348
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:51,776
Okay.

349
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,256
This way, please.

350
00:18:53,256 --> 00:18:53,856
- Okay.
- Okay.

351
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:03,044
(White tea)

352
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:11,056
Dad, what are these?

353
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,016
They probably don't need them.

354
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,856
I don't care if they need them,
but we have to send these gifts.

355
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:18,056
You have to bring many
for the first visit to his home,

356
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:20,136
or they'd think we are indecent.

357
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:22,336
Oh, Tuo has a grandpa, right?

358
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,376
Then we must be even more respectful.

359
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:28,456
Look, I prepared this for his grandpa.

360
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,520
This is a teapot I've collected.

361
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,936
I've cherished it.

362
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,536
Look, how's it?

363
00:19:35,296 --> 00:19:38,296
But we haven't asked
if they even drink tea.

364
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,736
If they don't, this can be
served as a work of art.

365
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:42,056
Old people usually like this.

366
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,136
You don't understand.

367
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:43,896
Alright, pack it up.

368
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:44,896
Okay.

369
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,896
You're staying there the whole weekend?

370
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:50,976
I'll come back on Sunday.

371
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,336
Then give me Tuo's apartment address.

372
00:19:57,336 --> 00:19:58,416
What do you want?

373
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,656
I want to give him a housewarming gift.

374
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:02,856
Okay, thanks, Dad.

375
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:05,376
This won't fit. Just carry it by hand.

376
00:20:05,376 --> 00:20:06,496
I'll just carry it.

377
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,016
This one too.

378
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:08,616
Be careful.

379
00:20:08,616 --> 00:20:11,456
Oh, I have something...

380
00:20:11,456 --> 00:20:12,096
More?

381
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:12,736
Wait, there's more.

382
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:16,896
Is she always this late?
Or is it just with me?

383
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,296
Just wait a while.

384
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:19,096
Coming.

385
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:21,856
Why are you bringing a luggage?

386
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:25,216
My dad prepared a bunch of stuff
for your parents,

387
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:26,456
telling me to bring them all.

388
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:28,616
What are these?

389
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:30,856
There's something for Ye
and your grandpa.

390
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:34,896
Chat in the car,
or you'll miss the train.

391
00:20:34,896 --> 00:20:35,616
Got it.

392
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,856
Thank you.

393
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,928
(Luzhou Station)

394
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,200
Come in.

395
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:08,216
Any pair is okay?

396
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:09,496
Change your shoes, here.

397
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:10,056
Thank you.

398
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:15,096
Mom.

399
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:19,136
Hello, Auntie.

400
00:21:19,856 --> 00:21:21,456
Mom, this is Que.

401
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:24,536
Hello, Auntie. I'm An Zhique.

402
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:25,536
You can call me Que.

403
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:28,696
Lin Tuo has mentioned you.

404
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:33,096
This is what Que
and her dad had prepared,

405
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:33,896
luggage of gifts.

406
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,096
Thank you for these.

407
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:37,656
Not at all.

408
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,936
How come you're here?

409
00:21:39,576 --> 00:21:40,776
What? Am I not welcomed?

410
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:42,416
Rolled pancakes for you.

411
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:46,296
I don't like them.

412
00:21:46,296 --> 00:21:47,696
Fine. Give them back to me.

413
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:54,016
I'm going to the hospital.

414
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:56,976
You'd go visit grandpa,
and we'll eat dinner together.

415
00:21:57,656 --> 00:21:58,464
Okay.

416
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:01,536
Ye, finish your meal
and don't be late for class.

417
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:02,376
I'll pick you up.

418
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,376
Mom, I can pick him up.

419
00:22:07,296 --> 00:22:08,456
My brother can pick me up.

420
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:10,936
Alright.

421
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:16,536
Where's dad?

422
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:18,136
When is he home on weekends?

423
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,056
How are you?

424
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:23,136
What can I say? As usual.

425
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:24,856
That's your room, right?

426
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:26,296
I'll take a look.

427
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:27,696
Who let you into my room?

428
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,056
You have so many books here.

429
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:35,016
If I had worked half as hard as you,
I would have gone to Tsinghua.

430
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:36,576
You?

431
00:22:37,096 --> 00:22:39,056
Who do you look down upon?
I was pretty good at my studies,

432
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:40,376
and I got a high score.

433
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:42,736
Weren't you an art student?

434
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,816
Why are you working so hard?

435
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:48,976
You should check my room first. Come on.

436
00:22:51,456 --> 00:22:52,176
Take a look at mine.

437
00:22:57,016 --> 00:23:00,176
Your room shows
you were not a good student.

438
00:23:00,176 --> 00:23:01,656
I was not a bad student, either.

439
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:04,496
I just loved to draw and play soccer.

440
00:23:04,496 --> 00:23:06,936
I used to make breakfast
for soccer when I was a kid.

441
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:11,656
Did you paint all of these?

442
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:15,976
Yes, I lost many when moving.

443
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:18,016
Look at this.
It's painted by my grandpa.

444
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,376
He paints so well.

445
00:23:20,376 --> 00:23:22,016
Just like the ones in the gallery.

446
00:23:22,016 --> 00:23:24,256
No wonder both you and Ye study art,

447
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:25,896
so it's in the gene.

448
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:28,296
We don't have any genes in my family.

449
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,816
Wait, we do have some.

450
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:31,376
I've inherited my dad's love for food.

451
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,376
It's kind of a talent.

452
00:23:37,336 --> 00:23:38,696
Were you this pretty
when you were a kid?

453
00:23:40,056 --> 00:23:41,896
Thank you, but that is Ye.

454
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,416
He's quite pretty as a child.

455
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,736
How did he grow up to be like this?

456
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,856
You are so rude.

457
00:23:50,456 --> 00:23:51,336
Are you going to school?

458
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:52,976
I'm off.

459
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:53,536
Wait.

460
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:01,976
For you. I've washed it. Take it.

461
00:24:02,696 --> 00:24:04,376
This color is not my style.

462
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,776
Come on, just use it.

463
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:08,416
This color is not easy to lose.

464
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:11,616
I'm off.

465
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,416
Take care. We'll come pick you up.

466
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:19,496
Here, fruit.

467
00:24:19,496 --> 00:24:20,192
Grandpa.

468
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,336
Thank you.

469
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,456
I bought them in the morning.

470
00:24:27,016 --> 00:24:27,856
Do you smell that?

471
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:30,496
I bought a lamb leg.
It's being stewed in the pot.

472
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,816
I love lamb the most.

473
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:34,936
I heard him mention it. Try my cooking.

474
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:36,696
Red wine braised lamb.

475
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,256
This is his secret recipe.

476
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:41,336
He cooked it for you.

477
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:44,256
I must treat
my granddaughter-in-law well.

478
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,416
Grandpa, you've been busy
since I arrived.

479
00:24:47,416 --> 00:24:48,576
You might take a rest.

480
00:24:48,576 --> 00:24:50,976
No. I'm so energetic.

481
00:24:52,216 --> 00:24:53,976
I'm so glad you're here.

482
00:24:54,936 --> 00:24:57,816
Grandpa, Que really likes
your paintings.

483
00:24:58,536 --> 00:24:59,496
Like traditional painting?

484
00:24:59,496 --> 00:25:01,696
Yes. Your paintings are wonderful.

485
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,376
Just like the ones in the gallery.

486
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:06,776
Alright, I'll paint one for you.
Let's go.

487
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:08,576
Okay.

488
00:25:24,932 --> 00:25:25,952
(Lotus Painting)

489
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:31,456
(Xu Bangquan)

490
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:33,572
(Bangquan)

491
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:35,776
Not so good.

492
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:38,776
It's great. Grandpa, did you
study this professionally?

493
00:25:38,776 --> 00:25:40,856
No, I never had formal training.

494
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:44,896
My master was a street artist.

495
00:25:44,896 --> 00:25:47,656
He'd paint and write calligraphy
on the street for money.

496
00:25:47,656 --> 00:25:50,056
And I learned from him
with a worn-out brush.

497
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:51,736
Later, I became a carpenter.

498
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:54,456
Carpenters have
to have some aesthetic sense

499
00:25:54,456 --> 00:25:58,056
to carve dragons and paint phoenixes
on the furniture.

500
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,776
If you paint well,
it could sell for more money.

501
00:26:01,056 --> 00:26:02,416
Then I quitted being a carpenter.

502
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:05,056
But I don't want to drop the brush.

503
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:08,936
Sometimes, I'd draw
or write something as a hobby.

504
00:26:09,456 --> 00:26:11,616
When the two of us have a child,

505
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:12,936
I'll let you

506
00:26:12,936 --> 00:26:13,976
teach him traditional painting.

507
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:16,176
I'd love to.

508
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:19,016
Hurry up, while I can still paint,

509
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,656
give me a great-grandson.

510
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:23,256
Copy that.

511
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:29,416
Ye.

512
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:34,176
Ye, I bought you a hamburger.

513
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:37,856
Where's the cup?

514
00:26:37,856 --> 00:26:38,656
In the bag.

515
00:26:38,656 --> 00:26:39,696
Have you used it?

516
00:26:39,696 --> 00:26:41,296
I put something inside for you.

517
00:26:41,296 --> 00:26:43,536
Goji berry, lemon, and hawthorn,
for refreshing your mind.

518
00:26:43,536 --> 00:26:44,496
Does it taste good?

519
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:45,576
Haven't tried it.

520
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:47,176
Don't you drink water?

521
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:48,296
Did you buy a drink?

522
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:50,736
Drinking sweet stuff all the time
isn't good for your brain.

523
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,496
Why are you babbling at this age?

524
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,376
Grandpa mentioned
the chestnuts are good.

525
00:26:56,376 --> 00:26:57,576
Let's go buy some for him.

526
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,456
I know.

527
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,416
Isn't your dad coming back for dinner?

528
00:27:09,416 --> 00:27:10,016
I don't know.

529
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:14,056
Just know how to play games.

530
00:27:14,056 --> 00:27:16,296
Wash your hand. Time for dinner.

531
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:17,976
Ye.

532
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,576
Dad, this is Que.

533
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:28,016
Hello uncle, my name is An Zhique.

534
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:29,256
Hello Auntie.

535
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:31,296
Hello.

536
00:27:32,576 --> 00:27:34,056
Dinner's ready. Go wash your hands.

537
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:37,496
Okay, let's wash hands.

538
00:27:38,336 --> 00:27:39,256
The soup is here.

539
00:27:39,856 --> 00:27:41,296
Give it to me. I got it.

540
00:27:42,016 --> 00:27:42,536
Okay.

541
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:45,256
Dad, you've made so many dishes.

542
00:27:46,216 --> 00:27:48,336
The cooking fumes are not good
for your lungs.

543
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:50,256
I have to show
my granddaughter-in-law my cooking.

544
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:51,176
I'm not doing it every day.

545
00:27:52,056 --> 00:27:53,056
Wash your hands.

546
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,136
Okay, wash hands.

547
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:56,056
Thank you, grandpa.

548
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:59,416
Now that you've become a regular,
you can be a designer now?

549
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,216
I'm still an assistant.

550
00:28:02,776 --> 00:28:05,256
But I'm ready to bid
on the design project.

551
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:06,216
I've made a proposal.

552
00:28:06,816 --> 00:28:07,536
Has it been approved?

553
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:10,096
Not yet, but I'll keep doing it.

554
00:28:11,616 --> 00:28:12,976
Yours is a private company, right?

555
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:16,056
Yes, but it's quite big.

556
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,496
It has a shopping place and factories.

557
00:28:18,736 --> 00:28:21,016
Private companies are not stable.

558
00:28:21,016 --> 00:28:23,376
There are many variables
in its development.

559
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:27,336
Whether a company develops well or not

560
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:30,536
is not about whether it's a state-owned
company or a private company, right?

561
00:28:31,816 --> 00:28:34,656
Some college graduates start
their own businesses after graduation.

562
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:37,936
There are so many emerging industries,

563
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:39,096
so opportunities are everywhere.

564
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:43,016
Right, the internet
is developing quite fast.

565
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:47,536
So, Que, what do you do now?

566
00:28:48,536 --> 00:28:49,856
I plan to start my own business.

567
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,056
She wants to open a coffee shop
and has found a place already.

568
00:28:54,296 --> 00:28:55,016
Coffee shop?

569
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:58,096
Yes, I've been working
part-time since high school.

570
00:28:58,096 --> 00:28:59,856
I can make a lot of cakes and coffee.

571
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:02,016
Now I'm planning
to open my own with my friend.

572
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:03,896
With your friend?

573
00:29:05,336 --> 00:29:08,416
Kind of, she's a livestreaming host
and we'll do it together.

574
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:11,656
What kind of host?

575
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:15,216
Selling products
through livestreaming online.

576
00:29:15,216 --> 00:29:17,336
Selling some skincare products,

577
00:29:17,336 --> 00:29:19,336
food and drinks. Basically everything.

578
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:22,856
It's just like the TV shopping.

579
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:23,520
Yes.

580
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:25,136
TV shopping.

581
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:32,376
Yes, we get our stuff
from the proper factories.

582
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:34,456
All items are carefully selected.

583
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:39,456
So, are you a livestreaming host
or do you run a coffee shop?

584
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:42,416
I run a coffee shop,
and my friend is a livestreaming host.

585
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:45,376
We can split the rent.

586
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:52,216
What's your major?

587
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:53,616
Internet big data analysis.

588
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,216
That's a good major.

589
00:29:56,216 --> 00:29:58,856
Why don't you find a job
that's right for your major?

590
00:29:58,856 --> 00:30:00,736
I like coffee,
so I want to give it a try.

591
00:30:03,496 --> 00:30:04,976
Do your parents agree?

592
00:30:05,536 --> 00:30:07,136
My dad is supportive.

593
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:08,536
And your mom?

594
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:13,256
She passed away early.

595
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:15,296
It's only me and my dad.

596
00:30:20,376 --> 00:30:22,056
It's not easy for your dad

597
00:30:22,056 --> 00:30:24,816
to raise you all by himself.

598
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:26,656
He is really amazing.

599
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:29,536
Her dad is a particularly nice.

600
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,296
What does he do?

601
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:33,696
He drives a taxi.

602
00:30:36,216 --> 00:30:38,776
Hurry up and eat.
The food is getting cold.

603
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:39,736
Don't just keep talking.

604
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:43,496
Don't leave tonight.
Just stay at my place.

605
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:45,176
My house is big. Just keep me company.

606
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:46,752
Okay.

607
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:48,856
Thank you.

608
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,536
Dad, I'll get you some soup.

609
00:30:51,536 --> 00:30:52,416
Okay.

610
00:31:04,536 --> 00:31:06,056
She has lost her mom,

611
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:08,976
her dad drives a taxi,

612
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:11,576
and she doesn't have a decent job.

613
00:31:12,776 --> 00:31:14,776
I wonder what Tuo is thinking.

614
00:31:15,776 --> 00:31:19,296
Don't you know
what girlfriend your son found?

615
00:31:20,456 --> 00:31:23,336
Yes, but he didn't tell me
anything about it.

616
00:31:24,136 --> 00:31:26,096
It's the first time I've met her.

617
00:31:28,376 --> 00:31:30,456
They don't fit to each other.

618
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:34,216
How could she possibly
help his future development?

619
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,056
They are not marrying yet.

620
00:31:38,656 --> 00:31:40,456
It'll be too late then.

621
00:31:40,976 --> 00:31:44,056
He's already grown up.
Do I have to tell him

622
00:31:44,056 --> 00:31:46,376
what kind of girlfriend
you should be looking for?

623
00:31:46,376 --> 00:31:47,896
You're his mom. Why can't you tell him?

624
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:49,696
You can't expect me to say it.

625
00:31:50,936 --> 00:31:51,936
He doesn't even listen to me.

626
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:55,296
Director Zhang's daughter is nice.
Does he listen to me?

627
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:58,136
He insists on finding someone
mismatched in social status.

628
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:01,616
Being together would
just be mutually draining.

629
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,616
Is there a throne
in our family to inherit

630
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:06,896
or do we have a fortune of billions?

631
00:32:08,096 --> 00:32:09,336
What are you saying?

632
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:12,896
Finding someone nice
is better than anything else.

633
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:15,736
She's the one who's with my brother,
not you two.

634
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:18,296
You don't understand anything.

635
00:32:19,056 --> 00:32:21,136
You two understand.
Are you two doing well?

636
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,536
Don't butt in when adults are talking.

637
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:38,736
I wonder if your parents think
I don't fit your family.

638
00:32:39,896 --> 00:32:41,336
Not at all. Who said that?

639
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,656
Haven't you noticed?

640
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,896
No, my parents are just serious.

641
00:32:48,776 --> 00:32:49,496
Don't worry.

642
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,136
I wonder if they agree to our marriage.

643
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,976
What? Do they want to break us up?

644
00:32:56,696 --> 00:32:57,936
You watch too many TV dramas.

645
00:33:00,016 --> 00:33:02,336
Haven't you noticed it?

646
00:33:03,336 --> 00:33:04,496
Not at all, okay?

647
00:33:06,936 --> 00:33:08,496
I was afraid I said the wrong thing.

648
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:13,856
Where's grandpa?

649
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,536
At his secret base.

650
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,336
Secret base?

651
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:19,336
I'll show you later.

652
00:33:19,976 --> 00:33:22,016
Okay, it's pretty mysterious.

653
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,416
This is his secret base.

654
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,696
Why didn't I see it when I came in?

655
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:31,416
You didn't notice.

656
00:33:31,416 --> 00:33:32,336
No.

657
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:35,392
Grandpa.

658
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:40,256
It's been a long time.

659
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:42,176
Today I'll make you a little gadget.

660
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:45,576
Grandpa, that's really cool.

661
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,656
This is what attracted me
when I was young.

662
00:33:49,656 --> 00:33:52,896
I always thought
I'd grow up to be a great craftsman.

663
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:55,256
I've never seen you do it.

664
00:33:57,696 --> 00:33:59,336
Then I'll show you today.

665
00:33:59,336 --> 00:33:59,936
Come on.

666
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:05,736
Turn around.

667
00:34:08,735 --> 00:34:09,976
Alright, off you go.

668
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,016
Que.

669
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,896
What do you think of your coffee shop

670
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,056
modeled after my carpentry yard?

671
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:25,655
It could work.

672
00:34:25,655 --> 00:34:26,336
Right?

673
00:34:26,336 --> 00:34:32,016
Tuo, if we turn the coffee shop
into grandpa's carpentry yard,

674
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:33,576
with that handcrafted style,

675
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:36,096
and then put all this stuff on it.
How cool is that?

676
00:34:37,616 --> 00:34:39,336
Sounds special.

677
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:41,096
Interesting.

678
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:43,215
Interesting. I think it's doable.

679
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:50,376
Thank you.

680
00:34:52,776 --> 00:34:53,296
Que.

681
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:58,496
(Que, Tuo)

682
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,216
This is yours.

683
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:02,376
And this is yours.

684
00:35:04,616 --> 00:35:07,056
You two get along well together.

685
00:35:07,056 --> 00:35:09,656
Come here often. This is also your home.

686
00:35:09,656 --> 00:35:12,456
Definitely. Once my coffee shop is open,
I'll come to pick you up

687
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:15,216
and let you try the cake I made
and have some coffee I made.

688
00:35:15,816 --> 00:35:16,656
Then I'll certainly come.

689
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:19,456
Just go.

690
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:20,216
Off we go.

691
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:21,296
Thank you, grandpa.

692
00:35:21,296 --> 00:35:21,936
Goodbye, grandpa.

693
00:35:22,896 --> 00:35:23,656
Go back, grandpa.

694
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:45,416
We are back.

695
00:36:07,496 --> 00:36:08,256
My dad.

696
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:15,056
Y-Your dad...

697
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:20,936
You are back.

698
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:25,856
What?

699
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:28,016
I didn't do it.
It's like this when I got back.

700
00:36:28,016 --> 00:36:31,416
The toilet is even more outrageous.
The toilet seat is like this too.

701
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:36,056
Be careful. It's thorny. Amazing.

702
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:36,976
What is this?

703
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:40,416
Can you understand it? I don't.

704
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:44,376
As soon as you open the door,
an uncle is facing the door.

705
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:46,256
"You two are back."

706
00:37:29,988 --> 00:37:32,336
(Chongqing Baihui Hospital,
Outpatient Department)

707
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:35,096
There's no bone damage on the scan.

708
00:37:35,096 --> 00:37:37,376
I think it's a mild sprain.

709
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,296
I've been having trouble
with my right hand lately.

710
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:47,656
My fingers aren't very flexible
and my wrists are a little sore.

711
00:37:48,216 --> 00:37:50,296
My legs are occasionally a little stiff.

712
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:53,096
My leg stiffened
and I fell down the stairs today.

713
00:37:53,776 --> 00:37:55,936
How long have you been like this?

714
00:37:58,296 --> 00:37:59,416
For a while.

715
00:38:01,096 --> 00:38:02,056
I didn't care before,

716
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:04,176
thinking it might just be fatigue
or calcium deficiency.

717
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:08,976
But falling down the stairs today
doesn't feel normal to me.

718
00:38:10,056 --> 00:38:14,656
Well, I suggest you
get to visit Rheumatology.

719
00:38:15,536 --> 00:38:18,696
Ask the doctor
to check if it's rheumatoid arthritis.

720
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:20,096
Rheumatology?

721
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,536
Okay, thank you, doctor.

722
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:24,056
It's okay.

726
00:38:52,256 --> 00:38:54,096
Lin Tuo, is your face okay?

727
00:38:55,296 --> 00:38:56,856
I'm fine. I just took a fall.

728
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:58,256
Why don't you go check in the hospital?

729
00:38:58,976 --> 00:39:00,376
No need. I've been to this morning.

730
00:39:00,376 --> 00:39:01,136
I just fell.

731
00:39:01,816 --> 00:39:03,136
Alright, then be careful.

732
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:10,736
Lin Tuo, come to my office.

733
00:39:11,376 --> 00:39:11,896
Coming.

735
00:39:28,776 --> 00:39:31,232
(Other treatments, Prognosis)
Impossible. I overwork lately.

736
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:31,856
(Most patients die within three to five years
from respiratory paralysis or lung sensation.)

737
00:39:31,856 --> 00:39:33,376
I've always been in good health.

738
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:35,216
I hardly ever catch a cold or fever.

739
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,976
I won't get this weird disease.

740
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:40,932
(Other Treatments, Prognosis)

741
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:42,776
No way.

742
00:39:55,576 --> 00:39:57,176
The first one won't do.

743
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,776
How can someone live
in such a small space?

744
00:39:58,776 --> 00:40:00,816
It smells bad. It must have been
left empty for a while.

745
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,656
The second one is nice.

746
00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:05,216
Let's settle.

747
00:40:05,816 --> 00:40:07,856
Let's settle then.

748
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:08,616
Go sign the contract.

749
00:40:10,256 --> 00:40:10,856
Are you home?

750
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:15,856
What? Got into a fight? With whom?

751
00:40:19,736 --> 00:40:21,696
Chen Guangpu said
Lin Tuo's face is all bruised,

752
00:40:21,696 --> 00:40:22,456
as if he fought someone.

753
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:23,216
A fight?

754
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:24,832
Que!

755
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:26,576
We're going back now.

756
00:40:26,576 --> 00:40:27,424
Wait for me.

757
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,120
Let me see.

758
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:32,016
Your hand...

759
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:33,536
- Is your hand fine?
- It's all good.

760
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,576
What about this one?

761
00:40:34,576 --> 00:40:37,656
Wait, who did you get into a fight with?

762
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:41,016
What? Don't listen to Chen Guangpu.

763
00:40:41,736 --> 00:40:44,096
You told me you were working overtime,

764
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:45,816
but you are at home. Are you lying?

765
00:40:45,816 --> 00:40:47,856
You don't want me to know it, right?

766
00:40:47,856 --> 00:40:49,576
I really was working overtime.
I just got back.

767
00:40:51,336 --> 00:40:52,016
Alright then.

768
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:59,576
Wait, you went to the hospital
and you still say it's not serious.

(Outpatient Medical Record)
Who did you fight with?

770
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:02,616
Just tell me

771
00:41:02,616 --> 00:41:04,256
if it's a colleague or anyone.
Tell me the name.

772
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,616
What? I told you I didn't fight.

773
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,976
When I went for work this morning,

774
00:41:08,976 --> 00:41:11,976
I didn't want to wait for the elevator,
so I took the stairs.

775
00:41:11,976 --> 00:41:14,256
I was looking at my phone
going down the stairs and I fell over.

776
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:16,256
Just the stairs at the entrance?

777
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,816
Yes, those stairs.

778
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,896
I just scratched my face
and everything else is fine.

779
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:25,136
I went to the hospital
and then I went to work.

780
00:41:25,136 --> 00:41:26,736
I was afraid you'd worry,
so I didn't tell you.

781
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:29,096
Why have you been falling
so much lately?

782
00:41:29,776 --> 00:41:31,736
You fell while you were playing soccer.

783
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:34,856
Don't you fall when playing soccer?
You fall more than I do.

784
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:36,456
He said he's fine.

785
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:39,856
We don't have to worry.
What about the house?

786
00:41:39,856 --> 00:41:41,136
It's settled. Didn't I agree already?

787
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:43,816
Let's sign then.
We can move in tomorrow.

788
00:41:43,816 --> 00:41:45,216
Don't be that hurry.

789
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:46,944
You, dilly-dallying.

790
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:47,456
I...

791
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:49,696
Why all the dilly-dallying?
Can't you be more efficient?

792
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:52,936
Let's go now. Hurry up.

793
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:54,528
We're going to sign for the house.

794
00:41:54,528 --> 00:41:55,096
Alright.

795
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:55,816
Hurry up.

796
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,176
Be careful.

797
00:42:08,616 --> 00:42:10,456
What do you think about
grandpa's carpentry yard?

798
00:42:13,216 --> 00:42:15,616
Make the coffee shop
look like a carpentry yard?

799
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:20,016
Yes, there are so many themed shops now.

800
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:22,736
If we want to stand out,
we have to do something different.

801
00:42:22,736 --> 00:42:25,416
Grandpa's carpentry yard is so cool.

802
00:42:26,376 --> 00:42:28,336
Well, then I can make it for you.

803
00:42:28,336 --> 00:42:29,936
That's why I told you.

804
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,176
Then, with your craftsmanship
and my skills,

805
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,016
we'll be unstoppable.

806
00:42:35,696 --> 00:42:36,416
Take a look.

807
00:42:45,936 --> 00:42:46,496
How is it?

808
00:42:47,016 --> 00:42:50,696
