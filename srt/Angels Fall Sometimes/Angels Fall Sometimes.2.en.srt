How did you get here from there?

33
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,720
I took a shortcut. It's faster.

34

Running away from home?

38
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,760
So a barista's handmade coffee means
buying a cup from the convenience store.

39
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,840
This is called a handmade
double-sugar latte.

40
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,520
Try it.

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,040
How is it? Is it a bit different?

42
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,720

ten yuan more expensive.

You seem a bit off.

It's nothing.

It's just right in this alley.

49
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,760
This convenience store
is quite fairy-tale-like.

50
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,520
This is our local
famous convenience store,

51
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,440
selling coffee 24/7.

52
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,040
The boss here is a man of rock and roll.

53
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,680
He's got that Nirvana vibe.

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Do you know Nirvana?

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Nope.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
It's a band from abroad
in the early years.

57
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,200
They must all be
a bunch of elders now, huh?

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,240
Do you like rock?

59
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
My dad likes it. I've been listening
to it at home since I was little.

60
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,200
My dad is a taxi driver. He pays
special attention to his appearance.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,120
But when he gets off work,
and there are no passengers in the car,

62
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,400
he would play that kind of
crazy dynamic rock music.

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
Imagine, a taxi-driving old man

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
playing rock in the car.
Isn't that especially cool?

65
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,880
Indeed, it's very cool. I like your dad.

66
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,640
What about your dad. What does he do?

67
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
He's a surgeon.

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,640
That's pretty cool too,
cool in a cold way.

69
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,880
No wonder you're a designer. It must
be in your genes. Skillful hands.

70
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,080
Now that you mention it,
there seems to be a connection.

71
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,240
I do have nimble hands. I always thought
I take after my grandfather.

72
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,040
My grandfather was an
exceptionally skilled carpenter.

73
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,600
You've mentioned it before, I remember.

74
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,720
He had his own woodworking workshop.

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
It was small, but really cool.

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,120
Every time I went to the factory,
I felt like there were robots inside.

77
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,280
But when I turned seven,

78
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,960
(Balloon Convenience Store)
he made me a robot out of wood.

79
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,680
It was like...

(This Balloon Convenience Store
started my fortune)

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,816
(but also marked
the beginning of her misfortune.)

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,240
(I've thought about it
many times later.)

83
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,200
(If I could go back in time, would I
choose to see her by appointment again?)

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,760
(Unfortunately, there are no 'ifs'.)

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
What are you doing? You scared me.

86
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,840
Two things. First, you promised
to have dinner with me.

87
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,800
But you made me wait here until 9:30.

88
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,480
You didn't even answer my calls. Why?

89
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,944
My phone died.

90
00:06:58,489 --> 00:06:59,440

91
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,880
Where did you go that was so deserted?
Who did you see?

92
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,040
A friend.

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,560
Girlfriend?

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,560
What's the second thing?

95
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,400
Okay, why did you buy me
six boxes of these?

96
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,160
You don't usually buy me drinks.

97
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,840
Why did you suddenly buy so much today?
What, is it to offset the rent?

98
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,640
Chen Guangpu, I'm only
staying here to take care of you.

99
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,280
And yet you ask me for rent?
I could go back to the dorm.

100
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,560
Wait a minute, what do you mean by that?

101
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,560
Trying to leave
after injuring me like this, huh?

102
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,960
Who will take care of me
if you go back to the dorm?

103
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,520
My arm hasn't fully recovered.

104
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,120
How can I take care of myself
with just one arm?

105
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,600
You couldn't take care of yourself
even when both your arms were fine.

106
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,240
I...

107
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,968
I'm going inside.

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,440
Stop there! Lin Tuo,
explain it to me right now.

109
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
Who did you go see? Explain it now.

110
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,480
To the right! Go get them
from the right!

111
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,440
Right, wait for me.

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,280
Go, go, go. What are you doing?

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,200
Don't you think she's been
particularly talkative today?

114
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,280
And she's laughing uncontrollably, too.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,640
Well done.

116
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,280
Why do I feel like
something's about to happen?

117
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,680
It's definitely to do with that boy.

118
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
What boy?

119
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,320
Well done. Good job!

120
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,600

121
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,080
Tell me what?

122
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
That's weird.

123
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,320
No, wait.

124
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,200
She met a boy at an interview
a few days ago.

125
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,320
After that, she's been
acting very abnormal.

126
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,039
Look how lively she is. It's scary.

127
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,200
No, wh-where is that boy from?

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
What's his name?
What's his major? What does he do?

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,920
I don't know. She's never told me.

130
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,560
She just said to me that day
that he's cute when he smiles.

131
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Right under this tower. Exactly.

132

135
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
So handsome.

136
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,800

Had dinner once.

142

And had a coffee.

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,840
As you can see, our study room
isn't actually that big.

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,640
We do only need one person.

179
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,280
- Then...
- Then hire us both.

180
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,520
And just pay us as one person.

181
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,320
Yes, one person's salary.

182
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,520
This doesn't seem quite appropriate.

183
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,640
Think about it,
the two of us working together

184
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,360
will definitely be more efficient
than one person, yes?

185
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,040
Alright then.

186
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,360
I have another suggestion.

187
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,560
Go ahead.

188
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,720
I can help you sell dumplings.

189
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,160
Sure, that way we'll have two incomes.

190
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,160
Two part-time jobs, not bad.

191
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,176
Perfect.

192
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,240
- Cheers
- Cheers.

193
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,600
Try this potato. It's exclusive
to this place, and it's really good.

194
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,720
- I'll give it a try.
- Yeah.

195
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,640
There's another one here.

196
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,080
Is it good?

197
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,616
Yes.

198
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,920
Wait, working at a dumpling shop

199
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,704
and cleaning the study room doesn't
count as an internship, so no credits.

200
00:12:29,636 --> 00:12:32,440
These are all part-time jobs, let's look
elsewhere for an internship.

201
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,760
Okay.

202
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:36,760
I'll work on it. Don't worry.

203
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,040
Here's to you.

204
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,000
Alright.

205
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,560
You can hold your liquor.

206
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,120
I got it from my father.

207
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
I mainly drink to keep him company.

208
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,400
Sounds like you can drink pretty well.

209
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,680
I've never drunk with my dad yet.

210
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,640
Doesn't your dad drink?

211
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,720
He doesn't always drink, and he
wouldn't drink with me either.

212
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
Mainly with his leaders.

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,200
True, intellectuals are usually strict
with home discipline.

214
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,120
Not like my dad. He's less educated.

215
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,240
But he's very easy-going.
Very easy to get along with.

216
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
I envy you.

217
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,080
I envy you more.

218
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,280
Alright, let's stop envying each other.

219
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,400
Let's celebrate our part-time jobs.

220
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,280
Cheers.

221
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Drink some more today.

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Where are you going?

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,600
To buy drinks.

224
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,960
Sit down. I'll go get some.

225
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:52,960
This is me.

226
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,560
No, let's go straight to the hospital.

227
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,360
No need.

228
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,680
Uh, is your dad home?

229
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,120
He has the night shift, so no.

230
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,000
Please come in.

231
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,800
Let me get you some slippers.

232
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,760
I'll do it myself.

233
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,320
It's fine.

234
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,200
Please sit.

235
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
Maybe we should still
go to the hospital.

236
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,480
It's okay. It's just a cold.
Some medicine will do.

237
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,880
Do you have any cold medicine at home?

238
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,840
Yes, I'll go get it.

239
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Is there hot water?

240
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,680
Yes, it's on that table.

241
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,224
Let me.

242
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,688
Thank you.

243
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:16,100
(Cold &amp; Flu Granules)

244
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,680
It's not too hot. Just go ahead.

245
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,480
Thank you.

246
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,960
We should take your temperature.
Got a thermometer at home?

247
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,920
Yes, it's right here.

248
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,960
Go ahead.

249
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,664
Okay.

250
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
Your home looks quite cozy.

251
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,200
It is cozy, but it's a bit old.

252
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,640
We've already bought a new house,
and the down payment is all paid.

253
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,200
We're paying the mortgage now.
We can move in next year.

254
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,440
Can you rent this house to me
when the time comes?

255
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,320
Are you staying here after graduation?

256
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,360
Yeah, I'll stay here after I graduate.

257
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,520
Renting a house, looking for a job.

258
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,920
Sure, I'll rent the house to you
at the cheapest price.

259
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,080
Our new house isn't far from here.

260
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,640
Then I'll save up.

261
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,080
Are you sure you're okay?
Your face still looks red.

262
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,959
I'm fine, just a cold.
I'll be better after some sleep.

263
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,160
I'll go boil some water.

264
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
Okay, thank you.

265
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:44,960
Que.

266
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,528
Who are you?

267
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,616
I...

268
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,664
Who are you?

269
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:54,200
Uncle.

270
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Who are you? Tell me.

271
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,400
- Dad, put it down.
- Calm down.

272
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,080
Easy.

273
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:00,000
Who is he?

274
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,560
I'm her boyfriend.

275
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,640
Boyfriend?

276
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,720
When did the two of you start dating?

277
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,520
Uncle, just now...

278
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,200
You said you were Que's boyfriend.

279
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,360
You said so, right?

280
00:19:46,528 --> 00:19:47,264
I did.

281
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,720
Then explain now.

282
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,560
Explain what exactly?

283
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,560
When did the two of you meet

284
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,400
and start dating?

285
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,640
Wait. Why didn't you tell me about this?

286
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,480
Do you think it's okay?

287
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,560
Uncle.

288
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,880
Sit. Sit down. You're so tall.

289
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,960
I get dizzy just by looking at you. Sit.

290
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,200
Go ahead.

291
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,520
Uncle. I was a bit anxious
and didn't make myself clear.

292
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,200
I want to be An Zhique's boyfriend.

293
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,880
Don't chuckle, I'm telling you.

294
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,560
This is a man-to-man conversation, okay?

295
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,800
It's not like you can be Que's boyfriend
just because you want to.

296
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Do you know each other?

297
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,528
We do.

298
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,880
Stop laughing. Be serious.
That's not enough.

299
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,840
Knowing is one thing,
but can Que agree to it?

300
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,440
I can.

301
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,800
Alright, I'll leave.

302
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,960
- Dad.
- Uncle.

303
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,520
Are the two of you
in a relationship or not?

304
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,880
For sure, we are in a relationship now.

305
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,280
Uncle, rest assured, I will
be good to Que.

306
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,560
I hope to get your blessing.

307
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,520
Uncle, here.

308
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,656
Love at first sight.

309
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:53,000
For real?

310
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,840
Thank you, Uncle.

311
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,280
Do you know what I used to do?

312
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,200
I was a truck driver. I drove
all over Inner Mongolia and Tibet.

313
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,840
Back then, driving trucks
wasn't as peaceful as it is now.

314
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
You could run into all sorts of people.
Look here.

315
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Here, and there's more on the back.

316
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,440
- I see it, Uncle, I see the scars.
- Take a good look.

317
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,960
All from back in those days.

318
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
Come on, poke it, here.

319
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,680
It's all muscle. Here, right here.

320
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
I feel it. I do.

321
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,440
Keep that in mind.

322
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,552
Got it.

323
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,880
You're... Lin.

324
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,600
Lin Tuo.

325
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,320
Yes, Lin, your build
is too frail, you know?

326
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,160
You need to work out.
Look at your skinny arms and legs.

327
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
Work for five to six hours a day.

328
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,040
In a year or so, I guess you
could become stronger.

329
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,400

got you a wax gourd.

my hair permed, really.

- Que.

My daughter is about to give birth.

443
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,120
So, I may have to go live with her
to help take care of the baby.

444
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,520
Therefore, I won't be running
this stall anymore.

445
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,360
Is it going to be closed?

446
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,880
I have no choice. Maternity nurses
are so expensive.

447

You two can't spend your whole lives
at my dumpling stall

453
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,160

454
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,200

going to that study room?

456

Yes.

457

- Is that so?
- Yes.

458
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:07,720
Go ahead.

Beibei, come here, give me a hug.

464
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,120
Her mom's gone to the night shift,
so I had to bring her over.

465
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,760
Thanks for your trouble.

466
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,880
Not at all.

467
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,800
Beibei, let your daddy
read his book first.

468
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,984
Can you play with me instead?

469
00:30:39,776 --> 00:30:41,920
Be good. You can't disturb him
while he's working.

470
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,320
Tell Daddy if you need anything, okay?

471
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,720
I'll take it.

472
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,440
What story are you going
to tell me today?

473
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,680
A fairy tale.

474
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,920
Lin, thank you so much.

475
00:31:05,888 --> 00:31:06,480
Come.

476
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,400
Careful, she's asleep.

477
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,840
See you.

478
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,560
Uncle Four, happy birthday.

479
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600

480
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,720
Thank you.

481
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,680
It's fine. Bye.

482
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Uncle Four. Bye.

483
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,760
Life is hard and competitive.

484
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,440
But it is indeed tough for Uncle Four
to study for the exam with a child.

485
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,520
This is already the fourth time, if he
doesn't pass, he'll become Uncle Five.

486
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,880
Oh right, I should pay you two today.

487
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:56,960
(32 years old, failed
the postgraduate exam four times.)

488
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,400

know her father is a failure?)

489
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,200

birthday tomorrow.)

490
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,840
Mom.

491
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,040
Has Ye called you?

492
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,880
No, why?

493
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
Your dad lost his temper with him today.

494
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,520
He hasn't come home until now,
and I'm so worried.

495
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,840
Could he be at the library?

496
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,520
The library would have closed
by this time.

497
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,320
He's taking the college
entrance exam next year.

498
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,840
But he's not focused on that at all.

499
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Your dad gets impatient whenever he
talks to him, and I couldn't help them.

500
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,760
Don't worry for now.
I will give him a call in a bit.

501
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,400
Alright, have a good talk with him.

502
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,184
I know.

503
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,560
Oh, Mom. I got my paycheck
from my part-time job today.

504
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,040
I've transferred some to you.
Did you see it?

505
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,640
WeChat? I haven't checked yet.
I just got off work.

506
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,520
I'll say it again.
Find a proper job, okay?

507
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,160
I know. I'm working on it.

508
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,648
Okay, talk to you later.

509
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,984
I'm gonna call
and see if your brother's back.

510
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:10,816
Mom.

511
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,440
What's wrong?

512
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,600
It's nothing. My mom's just worried
about me, asking about my interview.

513
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,920
I don't know what's up with my phone.

514
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,880
Did it crash again?
It won't turn on at all.

515
00:33:43,744 --> 00:33:44,360
Let me see.

516
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,320
I was thinking of buying you
a pair of sneakers.

517
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,000
Aren't you about to have a match soon?

518
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,680
It's on. I guess the battery is failing.

519
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,960
How come it starts working
as soon as it gets to you?

520
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
Look, do you like these?

521
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,520
Don't. The salary
is for you to spend it on yourself.

522
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,560
My sneakers are just fine.

523
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,000
Oh no.

524
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,160
What's wrong?

525
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,680
My dumplings are still in the bag.

526
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,344
This one?

527
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,279
My heart-shaped dumplings.
Why didn't you say anything?

528
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,960
Never mind. Let's just
eat them like pies.

529
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:38,600
You can still make some
for me when you get back.

530
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,120
Sure, I'll make as many as you want.

531
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,936
They are really like pies now!

532
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,520
Get him. Get him.

533
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:48,704
Where is he?

534
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,760
- Use your first skill.
- Here.

535
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,600
(Ye)

536
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,760
- Hit him again.
- Retreat.

537
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,560
Leave while they're not around.

538
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,680
Right.

539
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,884
(Payment password)
That's the only way.

540
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:03,640
(WeChat Red Packet)

541
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,676
Someone's coming.

542
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,080
(Red Packet Received)
Crap. It's over.

543
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,520
I can't believe you didn't get that.

544
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,200
What about you?
Did you even scout ahead?

545
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,920
Do I smell barbecue?

546
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,600
It's not for you. Sit down.

547
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,800
The Northeast flavor?

548
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,600
It's from my cousin abroad.
What's it to you?

549
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,360
Wait.

550
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,080
How come you're back?

551
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,600
I asked you to come over
to my place, but you didn't.

552
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,880
I can only come back to find you.

553
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,800
Your house is too far
from where my interview is tomorrow.

554
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,120
Fine, whatever you say.

555
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,320
Put it down. It's not for you.

556
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Didn't you come back to see me?
Who's it for?

557
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,280
Lemon.

558
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,240
Didn't she just block you yesterday?

559
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
Let me tell you, Lin Tuo.

560
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,280
Don't get cocky just because you are
in a relationship, okay?

561
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,400
I'm about to graduate. If I don't
find a girlfriend now, when will I?

562
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,960
School romances are better.
Do you get it?

563
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,920
If she kicks you out in a bit,

564
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,160
bring the barbecue back. Don't waste it.

565
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,880
I suggest you say something nice.

566
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,400
And you two.

567
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,080
Four years of being single.
Stop messing around and find a job.

568
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,120
Chen Guangpu, before you go,
I have something to show you.

569
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,400
I guarantee you won't regret it.

570
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,760
Look at Lemon's WeChat Moments today.

571
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,240
What's this? Who is this guy?

572
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,560
She blocked me and went out
on a date today. What does that mean?

573
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,840
Think about your own problems.

574
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,240
She's done for. Just wait.

575
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,160
What about the barbecue?

576
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:31,760
Forget about it!

577
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Maybe I should give it a try.

578
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,000
Come on, dinner's ready, guys.

579
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,960
The Northeast BBQ is the best.

580
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,600
Come on.

581
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,160
Come.

582
00:36:50,912 --> 00:36:51,600
Right.

583
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,840
Two, three.

584
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,000
Coming. Coming.

585
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,840
Why can't I open it?

586
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,800
I'll teach you again.

587
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,480
Look. Press these, right? Nine, eight.

588
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,040
Keep your voice down.
This is the password.

589
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,480
Zero, five, two, three.

590
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,640
You see, it doesn't work.

591
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,080
You have to press
the pound key, then it opens. See?

592
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,280
So, I forgot to press
that pound key, right?

593
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,912
Come inside.

594
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,240
But this is inconvenient.

595
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,680
There are locks that you can open
with just a fingerprint, right?

596
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,400
Isn't that expensive? Just press it
a few more times and you'll remember.

597
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,640
If you ask me, this lock is unnecessary.

598
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,080
We're about to move,
so why spend the money on this?

599
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,920
This house still needs
to be rented out, right?

600
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,120
Saves you the trouble
of worrying about the keys.

601
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,680
Once we move to the new house,
I'll install a smarter one for you.

602
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,640
Pupil recognition.

603
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,840
Smart. Always talking
about smart this and that.

604
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,440
I tell you, with all this smart tech,
there's no warmth anymore.

605
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,000
Like before, we could still

606
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
play mahjong or poker and such.

607
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,840
Now well, we don't meet up.
Everyone is on their phone.

608
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,760
Can you really play mahjong
or poker on a phone?

609
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,824
You still have to meet up to brag,
apply penalties and stuff.

610
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,600
What has it come to?

611
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,392
Mr. An, let's keep up with the times.
Technology changes life.

612
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,400
Don't go changing my life just yet.

613
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,600
You've fed the fish?

614
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,128
I haven't.

615
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,280
Won't my fish starve to death?

616
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,320
I fed them. I did.

617
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,360
Why did you scare me?

618
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
Chen Guangpu, hurry up.

619
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,800
Right away. Don't rush me.

620
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,720
Chen Guangpu, you've been occupying
the bathroom all morning.

621
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,000
Come on in.

622
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,560
What do you mean? I must have a job
to use the bathroom?

623
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,880
What are you doing?
Shaving for an interview?

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,360
Only you're not interviewing.
What do you plan to do?

625
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,680
I manage finances. I have so many funds
making money for me here.

626
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,120
This is not stepping
out of the house... Why is it green?

627
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,720
You've lost it all
without leaving the house.

628
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,520
It's fine. That's finance for you.
You have to be aware of the risks,

629
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,400
ups and downs, rises and falls,
and reds and greens. I'm used to it.

630
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,760
Change that green shirt for me.
I can't stand the color green.

631
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,120
Your life is a bit 'green'
right now, isn't it?

632
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,440
What happened to you last night?

633
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,480
It's none of your business.

634
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,320
He was throwing up all night.

635
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,840
What? Don't butt in.

636
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,920
It's in the past. This matter is over.

637
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,040
This woman can never
appear in my life again.

638
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,200
Her name is not to be mentioned,
and this green shirt is not to be worn.

639
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,080
Lemons are also forbidden from now on.
Got it?

640
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,920
Fried dough sticks, thank you.

641
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
I've bitten into it.

642
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,520
I don't care.

643
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,240
Isn't this He Xindi?

644
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,280
What's a big guy like you doing
watching face cleansing and skincare?

645
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
So men don't wash their faces?

646
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,840
Let me tell you some gossip.

647
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,560
What gossip?

648
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,720
He Xindi has a boyfriend now,
and he's very rich. You have no chance.

649
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,280
You don't know that.

650
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Come on, give me another sip
of Meco, thank you.

651
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,544
You really are something.

652
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:29,120
I choked.

653
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,000
Nice.

654
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,480
You came here early
in the morning just for this?

655
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,840
Is this a small matter?
I just lack evidence.

656
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,160
I still haven't found
solid proof of his cheating.

657
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,360
I didn't find his mistress, you know?

658
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,080
I wanted to sneak a peek at his phone.

659
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,280
But I couldn't get the password right.

660
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,400
You're not thinking of having me
hack Chen Xuan's phone, are you?

661
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,960
Isn't it your major?

662
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,400
Sis, that's called hacking.
What's my major in college?

663
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
Internet big data analysis. Do you see
any relation between the two?

664
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,720
What does it mean? Isn't it all just
programming stuff or something?

665
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,560
No, hacking into other people's phones
and peeking at them

666
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,840
are actions of privacy invasion.
Know your laws.

667
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,080
You have to help me find evidence.
I can't let them off easily.

668
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,360
I need solid evidence for this argument.

669
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,280
In a word, are you going to help or not?

670
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,920
Phone.

671
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,480
Alright, just add this person
called 'Peach Rabbit'.

672
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Just go and ask directly.
Reveal your identity and that's it.

673
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,040
Who is this? How did you get her WeChat?

674
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,720
Let me replay it for you, alright?

675
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,360
(Chen Xuan's personal page)
Click on Chen Xuan's game page.

676
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,800
(Peach Rabbit)
And he's been playing with this person.

677
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,960
He plays the shooter role,
and Peach Rabbit plays support.

678
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,360
Think about it, playing games together
in the middle of the night.

679
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,320
There must be something.

680
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,560
(He Xindi)
Go back to his short video page, see?

681
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,160
Every post has comments from one person.

682
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,000
(Drama Queen, Murder Mystery Games)
Although her ID isn't Peach Rabbit,

683
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,640
(Meinai)
there is a rabbit emoji.

684
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,000
Remember this girl's face.

685
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,408
Click on the name you just saw.

686
00:42:33,408 --> 00:42:36,280
(Meinai)
The home page of her short videos.

687
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,080
Does she look exactly the same?

688
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,760
Indeed she does.

689
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:44,032
(Drama Queen, Murder Mystery Games)
All pictures of Murder Mystery Games.

690
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,600
Wasn't that recent post by Chen Xuan
also about Murder Mystery Games?

691
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,000
So the two of them met
through playing Murder Mystery Games.

692
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,160
They haven't known each other long,
but they play together at night.

693
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,560
And short video comments,
and Murder Mystery Games group photos.

694
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,400
Definitely her.

695
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,560
Her WeChat.

696
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Awesome!

697
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,000
Watch how I deal
with this pair of toads.

698
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,888
Well played.

699
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,280
Be careful, and speak nicely. Don't
resort to violence. Mind your manners.
