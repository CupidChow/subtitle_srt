Let's watch a comedy next time,

20
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:10,608
instead of this tragic show.

21
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:17,328
If one day I get sick,
and I get a terminal illness,

22
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:18,088
what will you do?

23
00:02:18,928 --> 00:02:19,928
What can I do?

24
00:02:20,728 --> 00:02:22,408
I would do everything to cure you.

25
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:26,008
If my life could be exchanged for yours,
then you can just take it.

26
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:33,448
But if I get a terminal illness,

27
00:02:34,928 --> 00:02:37,728
you mustn't give up your life for me.

28
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:40,368
Remember that?

29
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:44,128
What nonsense are you talking about?
What terminal illnesses?

00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:55,448

If you want to see it,
just do it honestly.

34
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:38,608
Why do you always sneak around?

35
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:41,968
Can I see these?

36
00:03:42,728 --> 00:03:44,568
They're all wasted things.
What's there to see?

37
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,768
They're still good.

38
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:54,048
I must admit it. The way
you flatter others is quite delightful.

39
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,192
They're all yours. Take them.

40
00:03:58,608 --> 00:03:59,328
Thank you, leader.

41
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:17,688
He Xindi, how much luggage do you have?

42
00:04:17,688 --> 00:04:19,048
Just these two suitcases are so heavy.

43
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:22,568
Why is it so hard for a young man
like you to do some work?

44
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:27,488
You have too many clothes.

45
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,968
Why do you dress poorly
with so many outfits?

46
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:32,248
You don't understand.
This is called fashion, okay?

47
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:35,608
Fashion? You called it fashion?

48
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:36,848
Keep your dirty hands off my clothes.

49
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,568
You've run all over Chongqing
and ended up with this place?

50
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:47,232
What's wrong with this place?

51
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:50,688
The location and the price are good.
Most importantly, the landlord is nice.

52
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,488
What good does a nice landlord do?
It's not a blind date.

53
00:04:54,488 --> 00:04:55,928
The house is too run-down.

54
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:58,608
It's with such conditions
that you can refurbish well.

55
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,128
We can decorate it as we like.

56
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,128
The key point is it's cheap.

57
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,248
The subway entrance style
is even more free and much cheaper.

58
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:09,528
You're not putting in any effort.
Why are you fussy about it?

59
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:10,528
Find one yourself.

60
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:11,648
It's not like I didn't search.

61
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,848
But you all don't like the ones I found.

62
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,128
You even sought out Times Square.

63
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:17,608
Do we even deserve that place?

64
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,688
If we want to start a business,
just honestly aim for more with less.

65
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:23,608
The key is that we need to create
our own style and attitude, right?

66
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,808
I'm telling you the attitude is useless.

67
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:27,888
The place is a residential community.

68
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:31,328
The stores below are water stations,

69
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:34,048
convenience stores, lottery shops,
among others.

70
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:36,448
If you open a coffee shop there,
no one will buy coffee.

71
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,928
There is no right
to speak without investigation.

72
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:41,928
Let me explain to you.

73
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:46,608
Although this place is an old
neighborhood, it has a good location.

74
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:48,568
Once you go out,
there are a subway station,

75
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:50,608
three office buildings
and a large shopping mall.

76
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,328
Renting a place here

77
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:54,048
is almost one third cheaper
than renting those apartments.

78
00:05:54,048 --> 00:05:58,248
Yes, but we are trying to open a shop,
not to rent a place to live.

79
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:01,808
This is what you don't understand.
This is the core issue.

80
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,568
Who are the people working in the office
buildings and the big shopping mall?

81
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,128
Most of them are young people.

82
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:09,608
So, the majority of people living in
this old neighborhood are young as well.

83
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,728
Consider who buys coffee.

84
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,608
They are also young people.

85
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:16,688
All we need to do is to lower the price,

86
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,208
and make the packaging more upscale.

87
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,568
The young people will buy a coffee
on their way to work in the morning.

88
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:24,248
And in the evening, they can buy
some cake and desserts after work.

89
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:25,648
It's convenient and affordable.

90
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:27,408
The strategy we need to follow

91
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:30,928
is to find those non-traditional
storefronts with cheap rent,

92
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:32,848
and run our own small business.

93
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:35,968
As long as we maintain good quality,
the profits rise will be achieved soon.

94
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,328
I've already done the research long ago.

95
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:39,368
Applause.

96
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:39,888
Applause.

97
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:41,728
Your major of Internet big data
really proves useful.

98
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,328
Why are you so excited?

99
00:06:44,328 --> 00:06:46,608
Do you even understand it
before you applaud?

100
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:49,208
You think you have her wisdom?
Did you put in your thoughts?

101
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:51,448
Right. I'm the strongest support.

102
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:53,688
I think there's no problem
with this thought.

103
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:54,928
When we sign the contract tomorrow,

104
00:06:54,928 --> 00:06:57,288
we'll note a one-month
decoration period in the contract.

105
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,168
Then sign the decoration contract.

106
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,368
- As for the business license...
- I'll handle it.

107
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,208
I'll go ask the legal department at my
dad's factory.

108
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:06,968
I've also spoken
to several decoration companies.

109
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,320
I think one boasts
a high cost-performance ratio.

110
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,792
I'll negotiate the price tomorrow.

111
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:12,528
Okay, then I'll call a truck
to go to my grandfather's house

112
00:07:12,528 --> 00:07:14,128
and bring all my stuff.

113
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:15,648
Let's start work directly tomorrow.

114
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:16,368
Deal.

115
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:19,840
- Wish a most auspicious start.
- Wish a most auspicious start.

116
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:23,728
Six in total.

117
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:26,408
You can just put that cement
inside the house.

118
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,048
Just put that plank here.

119
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:32,008
Tuo, come, have some drink first.

120
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,824
Help me move this
inside the house later, will you?

121
00:07:33,824 --> 00:07:34,976
- Alright, okay.
- Thank you.

122
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:36,968
Come, have some drink.

00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:37,488

Thirsty.

126
00:07:42,248 --> 00:07:44,688
I didn't see you.
Why are you so invisible?

127
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:46,888
- Put the cement inside the house.
- Okay, go ahead.

128
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:48,168
Come on.

129
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:50,888

Alright, alright.

No.

170
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:21,848
In your case, you need to have
a blood biochemistry test done.

171
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,288
Only then can we determine
what the problem is.

172
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,768
Isn't it rheumatoid arthritis?

173
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:30,168
Other causes can also
lead to joint pain.

174
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:34,448
For instance, conditions like rheumatoid
arthritis and lupus erythematosus

175
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,568
can all potentially
cause these symptoms.

176
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:39,368
Well, let's do a blood test.

177
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:41,008
Have a comprehensive blood examination.

178
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:42,880
I'll let you have a check-up.

179
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:44,368
Thank you, doctor.

180
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:46,948
(Baihui Hospital)

181
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:18,488
Hold on, there's one more.

182
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,916
(Spring Breeze Self-Study Room)

183
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:26,568
When will you get your cafe open?
I want to come and support you.

184
00:11:26,568 --> 00:11:28,928
Soon. I'll send you a WeChat message
when it's open.

185
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,128
Just come then.

186
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,248
I'll treat you to coffee and cakes.

187
00:11:32,248 --> 00:11:32,832
Alright.

188
00:11:34,648 --> 00:11:37,688
I made it myself. Give it a try.

189
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:38,272
Really?

190
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:41,248
I didn't even know
you had this skill before.

191
00:11:41,248 --> 00:11:43,048
This is for Beibei.

192
00:11:45,608 --> 00:11:46,488
You must not know yet.

193
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,888
Uncle Four has failed the postgraduate
entrance exam again.

194
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:52,008
He said he is not going
to take it anymore.

195
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:54,208
He's planning to take his wife
and children back to his hometown.

196
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:55,888
Has he already left?

197
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:59,168
He should have. The New Year is coming.

198
00:12:01,408 --> 00:12:04,528
He's taken the exam so many times.
That was too hard.

199
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:09,328
- Try this.
- It smells so good.

200
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:13,528
- Wish the best of luck on the opening.
- Wish a thriving business.

201
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:20,728
The biggest contributor this time
is Lin Tuo.

202
00:12:20,728 --> 00:12:22,168
- Impressive. Give you a thumbs up.
- Not at all.

203
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:24,128
Wait a minute. What do you mean?

204
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:26,968
Did I not put in efforts?
Who moved the cement and sand?

205
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,448
You even have the nerve to say that?

206
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,408
Who rested so long
after carrying just a single sandbag?

207
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:33,368
Didn't you see how high
those stone steps are?

208
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:37,008
You're really something, blaming the
stone steps for your own incapability.

209
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:37,688
I'm incapable?

210
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:38,648
Right.

211
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:39,872
You say a man is incapable?

212
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:40,488
You are incapable.

213
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:42,488
You'd better reflect on
what you just said.

214
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:44,328
Let me tell you. What have you done?

215
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,128
The live streaming room
looks better than I thought.

216
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:47,888
It's just the soundproof glass
is quite expensive.

217
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:49,848
I'm telling you, He Xindi,
think about it yourself.

218
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:51,928
What did you do at that time?

219
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,496
Do you know why the soundproof
glass is expensive?

220
00:12:55,248 --> 00:12:57,368
It's because you're too noisy
during the live stream.

221
00:12:57,368 --> 00:12:59,448
You're quite loud.
Please lower your voice.

222
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:01,768
Alright, I've heard enough, enough.

223
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:03,648
But, to be honest,

224
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,608
if you don't decorate once, you really
don't know how expensive it is nowadays.

225
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:08,848
Really, thanks to Lin Tuo, this time

226
00:13:08,848 --> 00:13:09,888
we saved quite a lot of money.

227
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:12,328
Should we give Lin Tuo
some money this time?

228
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:14,008
No need. I did it all for Que.

229
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:17,888
Why does my life
suddenly feel so bright?

230
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:23,048
Because I gave you all the happiness.

231
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,248
I really can't stand this anymore,

232
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:27,128
I can't stand it anymore.

233
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,568
He Xindi, let's counterattack them.

234
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:30,368
Stay away from me.

235
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:32,568
If you don't mop the
floor after shower next time,

236
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:33,568
then get out and stay elsewhere.

237
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,248
I'm celebrating the opening.
Why bring up the shower?

238
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,208
Then who does the housework?

239
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:39,008
A bit noisy.

240
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:41,128
Wait, I just remembered
there's an important matter.

241
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:43,168
Que, has the cafe been named?

242
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:45,968
I've already decided it. No need for you
to come up with one.

243
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:47,456
That's right.

246
00:14:39,448 --> 00:14:44,968
One, two, one.

247
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,888
Halt.

248
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:46,608
One, two.

249
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:48,928
Turn left and right.

250
00:14:49,928 --> 00:14:53,168
Align to the left, eyes forward.

251
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,648
Let's welcome Leader An
to give a speech.

252
00:14:55,648 --> 00:14:56,248
Great.

253
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:56,848
- Great.
- Great.

254
00:14:59,368 --> 00:15:01,928
Today, let me announce some good news.

255
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:04,728
Our HW Cafe is officially open now.
Let's applaud.

256
00:15:04,728 --> 00:15:05,608
- Great.
- Great.

257
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:10,048
I hope we can carry forward our
hard-working spirit when we decorated.

258
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:11,888
Strive to improve even
when at a high position.

259
00:15:11,888 --> 00:15:13,408
Wish us a very auspicious opening.

260
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:15,208
- Auspicious opening.
- Auspicious opening.

261
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:18,648
Let's take a photo.

262
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:19,552
- Come on.
- Come on.

263
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,088
Come on.

264
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,088
May the business prosper.

265
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,088
Okay.

266
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,728
May the business prosper.

Chen, come quickly.

269
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,256
It's for number five.

270
00:15:37,248 --> 00:15:38,648
Leader An, I am so tired.

271
00:15:38,648 --> 00:15:40,608
I'll raise your pay. Hurry up.

272
00:15:42,528 --> 00:15:44,048
Your coffee. Sorry to keep you waiting.

273
00:15:44,048 --> 00:15:44,808
Okay, thank you.

274
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,768
It hasn't started yet, right?

275
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:53,128
No, it hasn't. I am adjusting.

276
00:15:53,128 --> 00:15:53,808
It's just baked.

277
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,608
Alright, alright.
I'll start the live stream.

278
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:01,528
Alright. Hello everyone!

279
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,288
Welcome to my live stream.

280
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:05,768
(Happy Everyday: Can it be reimbursed?)
Our cafe is open for business now.

281
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,356
(Open for Business)

282
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:23,368
Que. No, Leader An.

283
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:26,488
I have a humble suggestion.

284
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:27,888
Speak.

285
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:31,168
What about hiring another waiter?

286
00:16:31,168 --> 00:16:33,728
I feel so tired every day.

287
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:36,768
You're so tired, huh?
There are only two customers right now.

288
00:16:36,768 --> 00:16:38,968
How much would it cost
to hire another waiter?

289
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,448
Are you ignoring someone?

290
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:42,568
There's your bestie over there.

291
00:16:43,528 --> 00:16:46,088
He Xindi counts as 50 customers.

292
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:50,808
She's most good at
commanding me every day.

293
00:16:50,808 --> 00:16:52,848
Now I have to do the cleaning,

294
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:55,248
purchasing, transporting and stocking.

295
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,808
By the way, where are your boyfriend?

296
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:01,248
He went to make money.

297
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:03,968
Hurry up and let him
come back for a day. I am begging you.

298
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,768
If he doesn't come back,
I'll just lie down here.

299
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:08,488
I will wipe at most three more times.
Within these...

300
00:17:08,488 --> 00:17:09,208
Chen Guangpu.

301
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:12,607
Look, your bestie is starting
to command me again.

302
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:14,048
I have no idea where she gets so much...

303
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:14,768
Chen Guangpu!

304
00:17:14,768 --> 00:17:15,808
Coming!

305
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,048
Hello, welcome to HW Cafe.

306
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:25,688
What can I get you?

307
00:17:26,052 --> 00:17:27,684
(Chongqing Houses)

308
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:32,768
Everyone, let me treat you
to the afternoon tea today.

309
00:17:33,328 --> 00:17:35,688
My girlfriend's cafe
is opening for a trial run.

310
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,408
Well done. You even open the cafe.

311
00:17:39,008 --> 00:17:39,648
Here's your coffee.

312
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,568
Leader, my girlfriend's cafe is open.

313
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,488
This is a latte she made
for you. Please try it.

314
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,568
Leader, there are also cakes.

315
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,368
I know you love sweet ones.
This piece is for you.

316
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,648
Begin the meeting.

317
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:35,088
Your timing is perfect.

318
00:18:35,088 --> 00:18:35,680
What's up?

319
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:36,864
Sit.

320
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,608
New product. Taste it,
and share your thoughts.

321
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:47,048
What flavor?

322
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,088
Almond?

323
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,968
You can taste that? I can't.

324
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,728
It's a waste for you
who eats spicy hot pot.

325
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,168
Humiliating me?

326
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:00,408
Aren't you disgusting?

327
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:01,048
Have more.

328
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:04,128
How was the afternoon tea today?

329
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:05,528
It must be great!

330
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:07,008
Then I'll make you
try new ones tomorrow.

331
00:19:07,008 --> 00:19:07,872
Okay.

332
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:10,328
Give them for free every day.

333
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:12,408
When will we see
the return on our investment?

334
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:14,888
Look to the long term.

335
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,048
Expand your horizons.

336
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:17,408
Take advantage of a crisis.

337
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:20,608
And then chains of irons,
impregnable ones, and...

338
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:21,368
Shut up!

339
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:30,148
(Mr. Lin, today is a busy day,
keep going.)

340
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:31,076
(Mr. Lin, it's sunny day
and the blueberries are fresh.)

341
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,712
(Mr. Lin, there's a little kitten
outside the window. Did you send it?)

342
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:25,728
Eat less sweets.
Aren't you afraid of getting diabetes?

343
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,688
I haven't seen many
who get diabetes just by eating

344
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:30,728
a few pieces of cake like me.

345
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,688
Eating sweets ages you quickly.

346
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:34,048
Am I still afraid of getting old?

347
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:35,728
Are you planning
to get old and die alone?

348
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,408
Not planning to try
and find love anymore?

349
00:20:37,928 --> 00:20:40,288
I have no time.
You set an example first.

350
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,128
I could marry on a whim any day.

351
00:20:42,128 --> 00:20:45,328
Don't do that. If you do that,

352
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,928
who else can take charge of the company

353
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,168
and give me peace of mind?

354
00:20:48,168 --> 00:20:49,808
Want me to take charge of the company?

355
00:20:50,808 --> 00:20:52,768
If you want me to stay here,

356
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:55,328
can you cause me less trouble?

357
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:59,328
Why don't you take
Pengyu's project this time?

358
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:04,768
What a pity.

359
00:21:08,168 --> 00:21:11,248
Pengyu's project belongs to Han Yuxi.
How do you expect me to take it?

360
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,368
If I were Pengyu, I wouldn't want
to come to you either.

361
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:15,368
But it's the client who came to you.

362
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:16,848
There's nothing Han Yuxi could do.

363
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:18,408
Are you saying
I should turn away the client?

364
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:21,208
Would Han Yuxi accept it if I took it?

365
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:23,008
What if she comes up
with a conspiracy theory again?

366
00:21:23,008 --> 00:21:25,168
Isn't it annoying
to argue with her every day?

367
00:21:25,168 --> 00:21:27,768
Han Yuxi has
several projects starting up now.

368
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:28,888
She's too busy to bother you.

369
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:31,072
I don't want to provoke her.

370
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:35,392
Are you afraid of her?

371
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:39,688
Can you not
exacerbate conflicts as a leader?

372
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:42,848
Reverse psychology won't work on me.
I won't accept it.

373
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:49,288
The client
came to you with this project.

374
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:51,848
If you don't take it,
I can't explain it to the boss.

375
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:55,288
If we lost the major client, neither you
nor I can take the responsibility then.

376
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,688
I assure you I will handle Han Yuxi.

377
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:00,608
She will absolutely not bother you.

378
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,528
Send one of your subordinates
to coordinate with them.

379
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:04,568
This project isn't difficult.
It won't take much of your time.

380
00:22:04,568 --> 00:22:06,728
We have three tasks right now.

381
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,168
Huo Sheng and Peng Qianfan
both have tasks.

382
00:22:08,168 --> 00:22:09,312
Whom should I ask to take over?

383
00:22:09,568 --> 00:22:10,168
Lin Tuo.

384
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:25,888
(Mr. Lin, you scheduled
a cervical spine)

385
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,008
(and cranial MRI examination
half a month ago.)

386
00:22:29,008 --> 00:22:30,968
(Please arrive on time
for your MRI appointment)

387
00:22:30,968 --> 00:22:32,368
(and reschedule it if you are late.)

388
00:22:39,368 --> 00:22:39,968
Leader.

389
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:41,528
Two matters.

390
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:44,368
There's a new project transferred from
Pengyu. Go and coordinate with them.

391
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:47,528
They are our long-standing clients.
All the files are available.

392
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:49,568
Huang Xiaolv, find the files for him.

393
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:50,528
Alright.

394
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:53,688
Have a thorough grasp of the files.
I'll send the requirements to the group.

395
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,768
I'll give you three days.
Go have a meeting with Pengyu.

396
00:22:55,768 --> 00:22:57,648
Understand their needs
and then come up with a plan.

397
00:22:58,648 --> 00:23:00,168
I coordinate with them directly?

398
00:23:03,128 --> 00:23:04,728
Should I assign an assistant for you?

399
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:07,288
No, I can do it myself.

400
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:09,248
The second matter.

401
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,488
Where is your girlfriend's cafe?

402
00:23:14,648 --> 00:23:16,888
(HW Cafe)
Right, shall we stock some oat milk?

403
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:19,328
Oat milk or soy milk,
both are very popular now.

404
00:23:19,328 --> 00:23:21,328
She said oat milk.

405
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:22,328
Welcome.

406
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:25,168
This...

407
00:23:26,928 --> 00:23:27,688
This is my leader.

408
00:23:28,288 --> 00:23:29,848
Hello, Leader, I am An Zhique.

409
00:23:29,848 --> 00:23:31,808
- Welcome, Leader.
- Welcome, Leader.

410
00:23:33,928 --> 00:23:35,808
We've never met,
but I've had the food here.

411
00:23:36,408 --> 00:23:37,928
We came today to support your business.

412
00:23:37,928 --> 00:23:39,888
Welcome, please come inside.

413
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:40,576
Okay.

414
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:41,888
Please.

415
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:45,048
The long table over there
in front of you.

416
00:23:51,288 --> 00:23:53,328
I roughly know everyone's preferences.

417
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,688
How about I arrange
a set of afternoon tea for you?

418
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:56,768
Okay, arrange as you see fit.

419
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,288
Thank you.

420
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:59,168
Don't mention it. You chat.
I'll get to work.

421
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:03,408
This cafe is quite unique.

422
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,448
What style is this?

423
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:07,448
It's made in the style
of Grandfather's carpentry workshop.

424
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,288
Your grandfather is a carpenter?

425
00:24:09,288 --> 00:24:11,808
Yes, so I've liked doing these things
since I was young.

426
00:24:11,808 --> 00:24:14,368
Even this tablecloth is also handmade?

427
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:17,048
Nice. Who designed it for you?

428
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:18,568
We designed it all ourselves.

429
00:24:18,568 --> 00:24:20,688
To save some money, I made it.

430
00:24:20,688 --> 00:24:21,328
Impressive.

431
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:24,248
So you made these tables and chairs too?

432
00:24:24,248 --> 00:24:26,968
Right, I made
all the wooden items in the store.

433
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,808
You're really amazing.

434
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:30,568
So you and your girlfriend
are holding up the shop.

435
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:35,088
If there's anything not good enough,
please feel free to give us advice.

436
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:35,608
You're welcome.

437
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:40,328
Here is the coffee.

438
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:42,368
Here is the coffee.

439
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:43,648
Yours.

440
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:45,208
Thank you.

441
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,928
This is for leader.

442
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:47,768
Thanks.

443
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:51,688
I've prepared a cup of coffee
and a cup of fruit tea for everyone.

444
00:24:51,688 --> 00:24:54,208
I've also made three kinds of cakes.
Please try them.

445
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,688
This is a chocolate
ice cream specially for you.

446
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:00,208
How did you know I like chocolate?

447
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,608
I know what everyone likes to eat.

448
00:25:03,608 --> 00:25:08,608
Huo Sheng likes mangoes,
and Peng Qianfan likes blueberries.

449
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,568
Leader likes sweets. He adds two cubes
of sugar even when drinking a latte.

450
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:15,408
You two like to drink cold brew,
and Huo Sheng likes Americano.

451
00:25:15,408 --> 00:25:17,928
You guys chat first,
we'll go about our work.

452
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:18,648
Okay, thank you.

453
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:19,928
Bye.

454
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:20,448
Come on.

455
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,088
Everything is set.
Let's have the meeting.

456
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:22,688
Okay.

457
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,928
Lin Tuo, share your thoughts.

458
00:25:27,608 --> 00:25:28,224
Alright.

459
00:25:58,884 --> 00:26:01,664
(HW Cafe)

460
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:05,376
Let's go.

461
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:10,208
Get up, wake up, hurry up.

462
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,056
Pay the bill.

463
00:26:17,688 --> 00:26:19,968
It's your first time here.

464
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:21,528
I'll treat this time.
You can pay next time.

465
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,848
Okay, thank you then.

466
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:25,568
You're welcome.

467
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,528
I can get a card, right?

468
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:31,288
I'll get a card with 5,000 yuan,

469
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:33,728
and order your afternoon tea takeaway
every day to Ji Jia.

470
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,488
For the five of us,
you decide what we eat.

471
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:39,248
Okay. Then I'll send you an extra
herbal tea for free every afternoon.

472
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:41,648
Good, deal.

473
00:26:41,648 --> 00:26:42,328
Thank you, leader.

474
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:43,840
Lin Tuo.

475
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:46,928
You don't need to return to the company.
Just go off duty now.

476
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:49,824
Visit Pengyu early tomorrow morning
and we'll meet up after that.

477
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:50,976
Okay.

478
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:51,928
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day.

479
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:52,848
Thank you, leader.

480
00:26:52,848 --> 00:26:53,728
Take care, leader.

481
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:54,288
Bye-bye.

482
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:55,328
Take care, leader.

483
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:56,168
Bye-bye.

484
00:26:56,168 --> 00:26:57,008
Take care.

485
00:26:57,008 --> 00:26:57,528
Bye-bye.

486
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:58,168
Take care.

487
00:26:58,168 --> 00:27:00,448
Lv, this is for you.

488
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:01,688
Thank you for taking care of Lin Tuo.

489
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:02,784
You're welcome. Thank you.

490
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,368
Don't mention it.

491
00:27:03,368 --> 00:27:04,288
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

492
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:05,088
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

493
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,168
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

494
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,008
Hurry up.

495
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,512
- Have a seat.
- Boss An.

496
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,168
Come on.

497
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:14,528
Let me reward you.

498
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,528
Tired? Let me relax your shoulders.

499
00:27:17,528 --> 00:27:18,448
I'm not tired.

500
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:20,648
If I can really help you
with this little favor,

501
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:21,968
then I'm really useful.

502
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:27,688
I think your leader seems pretty nice,
not fierce at all.

503
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:34,008
He has been
quite nice to me recently, and...

504
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:35,728
And what?

505
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:39,808
He let me manage a project by myself.

506
00:27:39,808 --> 00:27:41,208
Really? That's great.

507
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:42,720
Come on.

508
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:43,888
Let me kiss you.

509
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,728
Okay.

510
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:47,768
They are showing off.

511
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:52,528
Come, let's go back
and keep making... money.

512
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:53,968
Keep going.

513
00:27:56,128 --> 00:27:57,688
Making money! Hurry up.

514
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,208
Are you tired?

515
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:01,848
It's okay. Just give me a massage.

516
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:03,688
Where does it hurt?

517
00:28:03,688 --> 00:28:05,168
Here, here.

518
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:06,168
It all hurts?

519
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:06,728
It all hurts.

520
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,608
- What do you want to do?
- A thorough massage.

521
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:11,288
Now it is simple and fashionable.

522
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:14,608
It's classy. How do you think
it matches with yours?

523
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:16,864
- Does it feel a bit less?
- Leader.

524
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:18,848
You're back. How was it?

525
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,368
The requirements
align with our expectations.

526
00:28:20,368 --> 00:28:23,248
I'll sort it out and send it to email,
and then sync it to the group.

527
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,808
Alright, I'll check. If there are no
problems, you can proceed with the plan.

528
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:27,424
Understood.

529
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:30,560
Let me see.

530
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,488
Welcome, senior, what brings you here?

531
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:55,488
The cake Lin Tuo brought me
is very delicious.

532
00:28:55,488 --> 00:28:57,688
I want to see if I can get something
more delicious in the cafe.

533
00:28:57,688 --> 00:29:00,088
Sure, take a look
and see what you'd like to eat.

534
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:02,608
Do you have pancakes? I'm a bit hungry.

535
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,096
Okay, what would you like to drink?

536
00:29:04,288 --> 00:29:06,448
I'll have an iced Americano, takeaway.

537
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:07,232
Okay.

538
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:23,488
Senior.

539
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:26,328
You came to see me?

540
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,768
You're here too?

541
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,848
Que and I opened this cafe.

542
00:29:29,848 --> 00:29:32,208
I'm doing a live stream inside.
Chen Guangpu is also here.

543
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,408
He went out and will be back soon.

544
00:29:34,688 --> 00:29:36,128
You opened it together?

545
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,448
If you had told me earlier,
I would have invested too.

546
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:38,768
Now I can only come here as a customer.

547
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:41,288
No worries. I'll treat today.
Order whatever you like.

548
00:29:41,288 --> 00:29:43,808
No, this is my first visit.
Consider it my support.

549
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,768
You treat next time.

550
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:49,280
OK, we've been talking about making
an appointment since we last had a meal.

551
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,308
But you didn't ask me out.

552
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,728
Was it because
I didn't rap well last time?

553
00:29:52,728 --> 00:29:53,928
No, you rapped very well.

554
00:29:53,928 --> 00:29:56,568
It's just that I've been
too busy lately.

555
00:29:58,328 --> 00:29:59,968
So is this weekend good?
Let's go singing.

556
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:03,488
On the weekend, I have
to play tennis with a client.

557
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:06,208
Next week?

558
00:30:06,208 --> 00:30:09,768
Right, can I get a membership card
at your cafe now?

559
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:10,336
Yes.

560
00:30:10,888 --> 00:30:11,568
Then I'll get one.

561
00:30:12,488 --> 00:30:14,848
Really? We have cards with 1,000,
3,000, and 5,000 yuan.

562
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:16,368
Okay, I'll get one with 5,000 yuan.

563
00:30:16,928 --> 00:30:17,888
A card with 5,000 yuan?

564
00:30:19,008 --> 00:30:20,328
Thank you, senior. You came to see me,

565
00:30:20,328 --> 00:30:21,792
- and even got a card.
- I've transferred it to you.

566
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:24,808
Okay, senior. Come by often.

567
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:26,328
Well, I can chat with you.

568
00:30:26,328 --> 00:30:28,568
I've also written a new song.
I'll sing it for you next time.

569
00:30:28,568 --> 00:30:29,728
Okay? It's really good.

570
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:31,048
- I think it must be the type you'd like.
- Alright.

571
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:32,088
Senior, it's ready.

572
00:30:32,928 --> 00:30:33,648
Thank you.

573
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:34,288
It's okay.

574
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,728
He got a card.

575
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:37,848
Thank you.

576
00:30:37,848 --> 00:30:38,368
I'll leave.

577
00:30:38,968 --> 00:30:39,768
Take care, senior.

578
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:40,640
Let's see you out.

579
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,248
Bye-bye.

580
00:30:41,248 --> 00:30:42,048
Bye-bye, senior.

581
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,608
Bye-bye.

582
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,248
Take care, come again,
I'll chat with you.

583
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,368
The song I wrote is very...

584
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:50,328
Come back. He has left.

585
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:51,248
Bye-bye.

586
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:52,328
Calm down.

587
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:55,288
Had I known he came today,
I would have worn a white dress.

588
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,088
What's up?

589
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:57,760
Let me tell you.

590
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,528
It's all my credit
that the senior got a card today.

591
00:31:00,088 --> 00:31:01,568
I was keeping his company for a while.

592
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:05,208
It not only enhanced our relationship
but also brought us profit, not in vain.

593
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:06,848
Truly remarkable.

594
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:07,768
(HW Cafe)

595
00:31:07,768 --> 00:31:10,928
Hello, may I ask if this
is Xindi's live steam studio inside?

596
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,688
Yes, just go straight in.

597
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,288
Thank you.

598
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:16,448
I...

599
00:31:20,368 --> 00:31:22,848
What does it mean?
Do I look very different?

600
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:26,808
Can't say it's exactly the same.
Just like two different persons anyway.

601
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:28,000
I...

602
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:31,888
So annoying.

603
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,660
(HW Cafe)

604
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:39,040
(Closing)

605
00:31:48,368 --> 00:31:49,328
- Alright.
- Let's go.

606
00:31:52,568 --> 00:31:53,568
Are your hands cold?

607
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:54,168
Yes.

608
00:31:57,608 --> 00:31:58,488
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

609
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:50,568
No problem. Just send it to them.

610
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:52,352
Okay.

611
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:55,168
Make a design proposal for this month.

612
00:32:57,128 --> 00:32:59,648
I'm offering it for the sake
of your girlfriend's cakes.

613
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Don't think you're good enough now.

614
00:33:05,768 --> 00:33:06,648
I...

615
00:33:09,648 --> 00:33:10,728
Lack confidence?

616
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:12,256
It's not about that.

617
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:16,688
It's just that our internal proposals
didn't pass before.

618
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:21,328
Do you know why you failed?

619
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:22,968
I don't know.

620
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:25,696
Come, sit down.

621
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:33,968
I remember your
previous designs had practical type,

622
00:33:35,088 --> 00:33:37,528
tech-integrated smart types,

623
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,128
and also eco-friendly types
for children, right?

624
00:33:41,128 --> 00:33:42,048
Yes.

625
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:44,208
Actually, is there any
significant problem with your design?

626
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,808
No, but the reason
I rejected it is simple.

627
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:52,128
It lacks originality and your thoughts.

628
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:57,488
It's not that your designs
have to be very novel or outstanding.

629
00:33:57,488 --> 00:33:58,648
But what is design?

630
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:04,528
It's not just a blueprint.
It's an object.

631
00:34:05,248 --> 00:34:08,408
Something that
is both practical and beautiful.

632
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:12,008
It should be
a part of our home and life.

633
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:18,687
I remember your graduation work
was a rocking chair.

634
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:20,544
Right.

635
00:34:21,368 --> 00:34:24,008
I saw emotion in that design blueprint.

636
00:34:24,888 --> 00:34:28,608
Abundant emotion
is far more important than cold design.

637
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,167
Actually, there is no right
or wrong in design itself.

638
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:33,568
Every design has its value.

639
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,768
But for the person who pays for it,

640
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:40,368
why should they pay for your design?

641
00:34:41,928 --> 00:34:44,848
It's your design.

642
00:34:46,488 --> 00:34:47,448
What is your design?

643
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,727
It's not a design that anyone can make.

644
00:34:50,727 --> 00:34:54,288
Nor is it a design that can be done
by following a book or someone else.

645
00:34:54,288 --> 00:34:57,168
It should carry the attitude
and warmth of the designer.

646
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:04,808
Is your girlfriend's
HW Cafe really that great?

647
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:09,488
Not really,
but why does everyone like it?

648
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,168
When you go back
and figure out this matter,

649
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:18,928
you'll understand
what your design means.

650
00:35:32,408 --> 00:35:33,288
Have a nice day.

651
00:35:35,408 --> 00:35:36,048
Your coffee.

652
00:35:43,248 --> 00:35:44,048
Chen.

653
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:45,568
Coming.

654
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,648
Please come again.

655
00:36:02,808 --> 00:36:03,728
Are you painting?

656
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:04,352
Uncle.

657
00:36:06,328 --> 00:36:08,168
What's with your look today?

658
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:13,448
My part-time job. Look this tailored
vest and the new helmet I bought.

659
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:15,888
And I'll ride your motorcycle.

660
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,848
Okay, it looks handsome.

661
00:36:17,848 --> 00:36:19,408
Is it? Where's the boss?

662
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:21,448
Boss.

663
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:24,888
Coming. Dad.

664
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:25,568
Where to deliver?

665
00:36:25,568 --> 00:36:27,296
Keep your voice down.
There are people around.

666
00:36:28,248 --> 00:36:29,048
Where to deliver?

667
00:36:29,048 --> 00:36:30,008
It's written on it.

668
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:30,928
Don't hold up my work.

669
00:36:30,928 --> 00:36:32,968
It's spilled. Be careful on the road.

670
00:36:33,848 --> 00:36:36,088
Serving for HW, goodbye.

671
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:38,528
Drive safely, Uncle.

672
00:36:39,248 --> 00:36:39,808
Bye-bye.

673
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:24,064
Everyone, please look.

674
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:28,528
This is the theme of my design.
Dining table.

675
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,768
It's a design
of a couple's dining table,

676
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:34,448
including a dining table and two chairs.

677
00:37:34,968 --> 00:37:37,048
Both the dining table
and chairs are extendable.

678
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:38,688
It can accommodate up to four diners.

679
00:37:39,928 --> 00:37:42,608
There is a slot on the table
for placing a tablet computer.

680
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:44,688
(Significance of a dining table)
Suitable for small apartments.

681
00:37:44,688 --> 00:37:47,448
Couples and newlyweds
are both my target customers.

682
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:52,648
We all know that the majority of
young people order takeout nowadays.

683
00:37:52,648 --> 00:37:54,648
Many people are reluctant to cook.

684
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,408
People rush to grab a bite outside.

685
00:37:56,928 --> 00:37:59,848
The dining table has become a desk
for piling up miscellaneous items.

686
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,888
But in fact, we don't need
such a large dining table.

687
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:07,408
We just need a small space
that belongs to the two of us.

688
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:12,168
My concept is
to have meals together as a family.

689
00:38:13,008 --> 00:38:14,688
Even if it's just a takeout,

690
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:18,648
the dinner time at home
should have its warmth.

691
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:25,008
This is the "Let's have meal together"
dining table I designed.

692
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:27,608
Thank you.

693
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,032
(Let's have meal together)

694
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:53,888
(Chongqing Houses)

695
00:38:56,288 --> 00:38:57,124
Lin Tuo.

696
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:57,664
Leader.

697
00:38:57,664 --> 00:39:00,064
Pengyu has directly placed an order
for the dining table you designed.

698
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:02,464
Stop working on the previous plan
and put your efforts into this one.

699
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:03,488
Pengyu placed an order?

700
00:39:03,488 --> 00:39:07,408
Yes, this means your design can be
directly turned into a finished product.

701
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,088
It can enter the market now.
You are so impressive.

702
00:39:13,968 --> 00:39:16,608
How about treating us to lunch,
Designer Lin?

703
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:17,968
Sure, anything is okay.

704
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:32,168
Senior, would you like some coffee?

705
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:32,688
No.

706
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:36,128
You are great! I've heard all about it.

707
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:37,168
Pengyu has ordered your goods.

708
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:40,808
I'll tell you a secret.

709
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:44,328
Do you know who recommended your design?

710
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:47,928
Our Leader Wei?

711
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:48,488
Guess again.

712
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:52,208
I don't know.

713
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:54,208
Han Yuxi.

714
00:39:56,288 --> 00:39:57,128
Ms. Han?

715
00:39:58,368 --> 00:40:00,848
Xing Peng, the head of Pengyu,
is Ms. Han's ex-husband.

716
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:05,728
Their company is Ji Jia's major client.
They've been cooperating for many years.

717
00:40:05,728 --> 00:40:08,128
It's been our team who
was in charge of their products before.

718
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:11,408
But they divorced later.

719
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:15,328
Ms. Han didn't want to be involved,
so she gave the client to your team.

720
00:40:15,328 --> 00:40:19,448
It's Ms. Han who discussed
about your dining table with Xing Peng.

721
00:40:19,448 --> 00:40:20,928
I don't know the details
of the conversation.

722
00:40:22,008 --> 00:40:26,248
But Xing Peng directly placed
an order for your design, surprised?

723
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:29,488
Quite surprised.

724
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:32,128
Ms. Han?

725
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:36,488
Anyway, congratulations
on successfully taking this order.

726
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:37,760
You've become a designer?

727
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,608
Thank you, senior.

728
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,808
Ms. Han, are you off work?

729
00:41:13,808 --> 00:41:14,528
Thank you.

730
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,128
Why are you thanking me?

731
00:41:20,808 --> 00:41:22,648
Thank you for encouraging my design.

732
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:24,688
Pengyu has already
ordered my dining table.

733
00:41:28,328 --> 00:41:29,528
What does it have to do with me?

734
00:41:30,248 --> 00:41:33,568
You seem quite idle,
knowing a lot of gossip.

735
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,356
Focus on work.

736
00:41:36,356 --> 00:41:38,116
Mind less of these useless matters.

737
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:39,408
Understood.

738
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:43,848
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not trying to encourage you.

739
00:41:43,848 --> 00:41:46,008
I just simply appreciate good design.

740
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:49,568
That dining table isn't anything novel,
but the theme is nice.

741
00:41:50,328 --> 00:41:52,168
And let me remind you of something.

742
00:41:52,688 --> 00:41:54,888
Pengyu has many requirements.

743
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:57,328
Don't fail to complete the task
and let Wei Haiyang down.

744
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,328
Aren't you his proud subordinate?

745
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:18,088
Thank you, Ms. Han, I will work hard.
