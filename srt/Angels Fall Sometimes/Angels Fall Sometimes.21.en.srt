Uncle Guo, have you seen Lin Tuo?

62
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:57,851
Nope.

63
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,371
I haven't seen him all day today.

64
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:03,491
I just came to see if he's returned.

65
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,611
I thought

66
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,131
he was with you.

67
00:04:06,592 --> 00:04:07,411
I'll go look for him.

68
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:08,251

hurry, get Qin

00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:16,011
Okay.

00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:16,531
Thank you.

75
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:23,651
Sorry.

00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:31,451

77
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:32,571
have you seen Tuo?

78
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:33,571
No, I haven't.

79
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:34,411
He's not in the canteen.

80
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:35,571
How about the garden?

81
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,491
Please help me find Tuo.

82
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:37,691
- Okay.
- Thank you.

No.

85
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:44,691
Keep looking.

86
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,451
Uncle Guo, do you have him there?

87
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:54,211
No, have you seen him?

88
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:55,131
No, I haven't.

89
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:55,811
Then...

90
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:56,931
- I'll check over there.
- Okay.

91
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:57,971
I'll go the other way.

92
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:58,371

94
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,531
I've asked
all the nursing staff to look.

95
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:04,731
None of them have seen Lin Tuo.

96
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:05,371
Que.

97
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:06,851
Call his family

98
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,691
and friends

99
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:11,011
to see if someone picked him up.

100
00:05:11,331 --> 00:05:13,211
If so, they would've told me.

101
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,491
What if something happened to him?

102
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:19,771
Hello, Chen Guangpu.

103
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:20,811
Lin Tuo is missing.

104
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,171
Where are you?

105
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:27,171
Chen Guangpu, are you an idiot
or something?

106
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:27,971
I'm telling you,

107
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,531
if anything happens,
there's no turning back.

108
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,211
I really don't know.

109
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:32,931
He said he wanted to go out for a walk.

110
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,291
I thought it would be okay for him
to get some fresh air.

111
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,931
Then I went to get him
something to drink.

112
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,731
When I came back, he was gone.

113
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:39,691
Where exactly?

114
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,291
Right here.

115
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,651
I called him but he didn't answer.

116
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:44,011
I've looked around several times.

117
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:45,011
Just keep looking.

118
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:46,811
He shouldn't have gone far anyway.

119
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:47,451
Move!

120
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,051
I'll call my senior and Bao.

121
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:49,771
Call them.

122
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,171
Go that way, hurry, over there!

123
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,171
Just go!

124
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:53,251
Call Bao.

125
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:55,011
Hello.

126
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:56,971
Excuse me, have you seen this person?

127
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:58,171
- Him.
- Take another look.

128
00:05:58,411 --> 00:05:59,331
Bro!

129
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,131
Excuse me.

130
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:00,891
You've seen him?

131
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,851
I don't think so.

132
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:03,011
Thank you.

133
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:03,891
- Then...
- There!

134
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:04,771
No luck.

135
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,051
Hello.

136
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,691

No.

Hello.

140
00:06:17,531 --> 00:06:18,571
Have you seen this person?

141
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:19,291
No.

142
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,171
Okay, thank you.

143
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:34,331
Lin Tuo.

144
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:35,931
Lin Tuo.

145
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:39,011
Hello, have you seen this person?

146
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:40,171
No.

147
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,891
Bro, have you seen this person?

148
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:44,811
Sorry, no.

149
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:45,531
Thank you.

150
00:06:54,611 --> 00:06:56,131
Mister, is this okay?

151
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:57,691
Yes.

152
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:00,811
All right, I'll put it in your pocket.

153
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,651
Mister, how about I get you back?

154
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:05,971
No need.

155
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,731
My family will pick me up soon.

156
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:10,011
Okay.

157
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,051
Then take care
while you're here alone, mister.

158
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,411
I'll head off, bye.

159
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,651
Thank you.

160
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,256
(Que)

161
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:29,491
Tuo.

162
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:32,531
We'll be fine.

163
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:34,051
Let go.

164
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:36,331
- I won't. We're not there yet.
- Let go.

165
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:38,571
I won't let go. I'll find a way.

166
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:40,251
Trust me. We'll be fine.

167
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:41,811
Is there any point?

168
00:09:43,731 --> 00:09:44,851
Is there any point?

169
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,811
Is there any point?

170
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:49,811
It is!

171
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,211
We'll be fine.

172
00:09:54,651 --> 00:09:57,371
We won't! My illness can't be cured!

173
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,931
It's not that I haven't tried.

174
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:05,011
I've worked very hard to deal with it.

175
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:07,611
You are not me.

176
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,571
The one in pain is me.

177
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:12,411
The one who can't move is me.

178
00:10:13,091 --> 00:10:14,851
The one who's going to die is me!

179
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,931
I'm gonna die no matter what I do.

180
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,811
Tuo, believe me, we'll be fine.

181
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,544
It's not that bad.

182
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,011
I just want to stop now.

183
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:32,171
I can't take it anymore.

184
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,931
I can't even manage to die.

185
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,691
I don't even have the ability to die.

186
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:44,851
I really don't want to live like this.

187
00:10:47,691 --> 00:10:48,291
Que.

188
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,051
I'm begging you.

189
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:53,211
Let me go.

190
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,211
Get out of my way!

191
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:27,851
I won't!

192
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,291
Get out of my way!

193
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:44,411
Want to die, don't you? Then go!

194
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:48,971
Go ahead! You want to die, don't you?

195
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:49,851
I'm telling you,

196
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,531
if you die, I'll die with you.

197
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,531
I'll die right after you do.

198
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:41,371
Lin Tuo.

199
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:43,691
Look at me.

200
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,051
I'm telling you,

201
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:56,411
if you don't die today,

202
00:12:59,851 --> 00:13:01,851
don't you ever think about dying again.

203
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:04,371
Do you hear me?

204
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,211
Do you hear me?

205
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,771
I'm asking you, do you hear me?

206
00:15:01,211 --> 00:15:01,891
Hey.

207
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,411
It's over.

208
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:16,731
Tuo.

209
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:19,011
Look at me.

210
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:29,331
I understand what you told me yesterday.

211
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,011
None of us

212
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,211
can take your place to bear this pain.

213
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:39,051
After you fell ill,

214
00:15:40,771 --> 00:15:42,131
I wondered

215
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,371
what I would be like

216
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:46,891
if I were in your shoes.

217
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,731
I might not be able to accept it.

218
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,131
I would make the same choice as you.

219
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,011
But have you thought about
the rest of us?

220
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,611
You can simply choose
to end it all by dying,

221
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,211
but for us, the living,

222
00:16:06,571 --> 00:16:07,771
we'll spend the rest of our lives

223
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:09,811
in self-blame and guilt.

224
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,251
No one will be at peace.

225
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:13,731
You understand this.

226
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,851
Do I not even have the right to die?

227
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:24,891
You do,

228
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:27,251
but I don't allow it.

229
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:30,691
I know.

230
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,491
Your illness is terminal,
and you will die.

231
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:36,931
But death is an unavoidable part
of the cycle of life.

232
00:16:37,211 --> 00:16:39,851
None of us can defeat death.

233
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:44,971
I don't need you to be very strong
or optimistic.

234
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:47,211
Trying to encourage you to be strong

235
00:16:47,451 --> 00:16:49,091
and optimistic is pointless.

236
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,251
We are all just ordinary people.

237
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,291
If you're in pain,

238
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,331
tired,

239
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,011
hurting,

240
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,931
or want to cry, just cry.

241
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:01,171
If you feel uncomfortable,

242
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:02,811
speak up.

243
00:17:03,851 --> 00:17:05,011
We are just ordinary people.

244
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:06,651
We are not saints.

245
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:09,171
We don't need to perform miracles.

246
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:12,931
I just want you to live well.

247
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,330
We all want you to live well.

248
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,851
So don't you ever

249
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,651
feel like a burden.

250
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:25,971
Those who think you're a burden
won't come to take care of you.

251
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:28,411
The ones who are willing to

252
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,851
take care of you will be by your side.

253
00:17:34,851 --> 00:17:37,771
We've all looked into the abyss
at some point,

254
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:38,491
haven't we?

255
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:41,011
And we know

256
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:43,851
not to go there.

257
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:48,851
Everything will be fine.

258
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:53,251
Everything is fine.

259
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,371
Can you calm down a bit?

260
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,691
How can I?

261
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,811
Lin Tuo almost died
in the river yesterday.

262
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,971
He was saved this time,
but what about next time?

263
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,128
Jump off a building maybe?

264
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,491
What happens if we are out of luck?

265
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:23,091
I'll go watch over him.

266
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:25,371
Que is already watching over him.

267
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,011
She can use some help.

268
00:18:27,331 --> 00:18:29,211
Yesterday's accident might happen again.

269
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:31,011
You think Tuo did that

270
00:18:31,331 --> 00:18:32,251
because of this illness?

271
00:18:32,531 --> 00:18:33,611
What else then?

272
00:18:35,131 --> 00:18:37,091
Because he feels
he's dragging everyone down.

273
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:38,371
He feels useless.

274
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:39,971
He thinks he has
caused trouble for everyone.

275
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:41,931
We're making things

276
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,091
harder for him.

277
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,891
Que has been watching over him.

278
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,291
You're dropping everything

279
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,091
to watch over him now.

280
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,371
You think he can live with it?

281
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:51,851
So what are you suggesting?

282
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:53,611
Have a seat.

283
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,571
Sit down, I'm telling you.

284
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,731
Right now, we should not

285
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,251
make a big deal out of this anymore.

286
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:04,011
Hasn't Que already said

287
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:06,811
that we shouldn't have any
extreme reactions?

288
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,651
Don't treat him like a disabled person,

289
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:10,651
or as someone with a terminal illness,
who is going to die.

290
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,651
We should just be calm.

291
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:14,371
Lin Tuo

292
00:19:14,371 --> 00:19:15,731
has been ill for such a long time.

293
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,891
Naturally, he'd feel moments of despair.

294
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:19,931
He didn't mean to do that yesterday.

295
00:19:21,251 --> 00:19:23,291
Let's act as if nothing happened,

296
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,928
and create a relaxed atmosphere.

297
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:27,371
Yes.

298
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:28,928
That makes sense.

299
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,531
We can't add more to his burden.

300
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:34,291
It is just

301
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,171
like when we drink too much,

302
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:37,491
and do something embarrassing.

303
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:39,651
Who doesn't regret it after sobering up?

304
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,851
Let's just not mention it. That's it.

305
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:45,971
So what should we do?

306
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:50,091
We'll definitely go see him.

307
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,131
Let's buy some food,

308
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,411
and go there happily together,

309
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:57,371
as if nothing happened.

310
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:58,171
Let bygones be bygones.

311
00:19:58,691 --> 00:19:59,771
What does Tuo like to eat?

312
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,011
Let's go now.

313
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:05,371
Now?

314
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,571
You haven't eaten well for several days.

315
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:10,891
You must be hungry.

316
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:11,891
My dad said he made

317
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:12,931
something tasty for you.

318
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:13,891
He'll be here in a bit.

319
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,971
Here I am!

320
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:16,771
Dad.

321
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:18,331
I figured you guys would be hungry.

322
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,411
Look, the soup is here.

323
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:21,291
Telling you, I've made soup today,

324
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:22,451
chicken soup,

325
00:20:22,451 --> 00:20:24,051
with free-range chicken.

326
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:25,491
I've been simmering it for so long.

327
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:30,731
Godfather, you've arrived before me.

328
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,651
- Come on.
- Got your favorite pizza.

329
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:34,571
Take a look.

330
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:36,931
I wanted to eat it along the way here,
but I resisted.

331
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,331
Now we have the main course.

332
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:41,771
How about I taste it for him first?

333
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:46,851
Tuo.

334
00:20:47,091 --> 00:20:47,891
Uncle Guo is here.

335
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,371
Uncle Guo.

336
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,291
The canteen served chicken legs.

337
00:20:50,771 --> 00:20:52,491
- I got you some.
- Tasty.

338
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,251
Chicken legs?

339
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:54,451
Thank you, Uncle Guo.

340
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:58,131
Smell so good!

341
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,611
Look, we got vegetables, soup,

342
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:01,131
main course, and meat.

343
00:21:01,131 --> 00:21:02,171
Such a great meal.

344
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:08,371
Here we are!

345
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,251
Dong Dong.

346
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,051
Dong Dong.

347
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:10,944
Come on, Dong Dong.

348
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:15,571
Give me a hug.

349
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:17,771
One, two, one, come on.

350
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:19,411
Good to see you, Dong Dong.

351
00:21:29,411 --> 00:21:32,640
Lollipop.

352
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,531
Que said

353
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:37,531
lollipop makes you happy.

354
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:40,891
Such a good child.

355
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:42,611
Great, Dong Dong.

356
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:07,232
(HW Cafe)

357
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:14,331
- Sorry, the meeting ran long.
- Senior.

358
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,291
Sorry.

359
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,451
Thanks for making the trip.

360
00:22:17,931 --> 00:22:18,771
I had to come anyway.

361
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,091
How is Lin Tuo doing now?

362
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:21,771
I called him last night,

363
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,611
and sent him some designs

364
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:24,331
for his opinion.

365
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,531
He told me everything.

366
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,371
He felt much better emotionally

367
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,131
seeing them.

368
00:22:30,051 --> 00:22:30,691
That's good.

369
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:32,611
By the way,

370
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:38,291
I bought a new computer

371
00:22:39,171 --> 00:22:40,371
for Lin Tuo.

372
00:22:43,011 --> 00:22:44,096
And this eye tracker,

373
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:47,171
he can directly control the computer
with his eyes.

374
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:50,091
I've also downloaded
some graphic design software

375
00:22:50,091 --> 00:22:51,131
and movies for him.

376
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:52,131
Bring it to him.

377
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:53,611
Thank you, senior.

378
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,571
Now we must figure out a way

379
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,691
to make him feel that
he still has things to do.

380
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,611
Don't let his mind wander.

381
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,651
It works?

382
00:23:12,651 --> 00:23:13,211
Yes, it does.

383
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:16,811
So advanced, isn't it? So convenient.

384
00:23:17,331 --> 00:23:18,411
I'm not very proficient though.

385
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,411
You just need more practice.

386
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:25,491
Can you use this to draw?

387
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,251
I'll copy your design drafts onto it,

388
00:23:28,251 --> 00:23:29,371
so you can continue to work on them.

389
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:30,651
Okay.

390
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,771
Uncle Guo mentioned before

391
00:23:35,251 --> 00:23:37,131
that many patients' family members

392
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:39,411
are elderly people,

393
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:43,131
who find it hard to read those
nursing manuals.

394
00:23:43,891 --> 00:23:44,811
I'm thinking

395
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,411
maybe we could compile it

396
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,771
into a beginner's nursing manual.

397
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:50,211
Sure.

398
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:52,251
I can do these things now.

399
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:53,491
Good.

400
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:56,491
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:59,411
The subscriber you dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

402
00:23:59,851 --> 00:24:00,971
Please redial later.

403
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,016
(Chen Guangpu)

404
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,496
(Chen Guangpu)

405
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:19,251
Hello?

406
00:24:20,971 --> 00:24:21,731
You called me?

407
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:24,451
Are you drinking?

408
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,251
It's fine then. Keep drinking.

409
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,571
Why are you mad? I...

410
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:30,891
I am accompanying a client for my dad.

411
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:32,731
He can't drink, so I drink for him.

412
00:24:33,091 --> 00:24:33,931
What's wrong with you?

413
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:37,371
I have a stomachache
and there's no stomach medicine at home.

414
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,571
I need an appointment to get my meds.

415
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,571
Stomachache, is it your stomach?

416
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:44,091
Of course, what else could it be,
the lungs?

417
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:46,371
You should go to the hospital.

418
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:48,131
I'm coming home to pick you up.
Wait for me.

419
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:50,144
You've been drinking.
How can you come back to pick me up?

420
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:50,971
It's fine.

421
00:24:51,211 --> 00:24:53,051
Anyway, I'm going back now.

422
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:53,931
Wait for me.

423
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:54,731
Chen Guang...

424
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:52,096
Chen Guangpu.

425
00:25:52,811 --> 00:25:54,016
Where are you?

426
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:57,211
It's been over an hour. Where are you?

427
00:25:57,211 --> 00:25:59,411
Reply to me if you got my message.

428
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:19,411
Hello.

429
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:21,171
Is this 110?

430
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:22,331
My friend is missing.

431
00:26:22,811 --> 00:26:23,331
No.

432
00:26:24,011 --> 00:26:26,731
Well, he's drunk.

433
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:28,411
He told me he would come back
to pick me up.

434
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,291
It's been two hours already.

435
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,851
He didn't answer my calls

436
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:32,771
or reply to my message.

437
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,688
Could something have happened to him?

438
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:36,491
Can you look into it for me?

439
00:26:36,491 --> 00:26:37,440
Help me find him, please?

440
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:38,491
Thank you.

441
00:26:39,691 --> 00:26:40,211
(Heping Pharmacy)
Sir.

442
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:41,891
- Sir.
- I can't get through.

443
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,411
- Sir, wake up.
- My client is drunk.

444
00:26:44,691 --> 00:26:45,651
- I'll call you later.
- Sir.

445
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,264
Are you alright, sir?

446
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:49,171
Wake up, sir.

447
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:50,851
Sir.

448
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:52,811
Chen Guangpu.

449
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,331
What's wrong with you?

450
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,056
Officer, what's wrong with him?

451
00:26:57,611 --> 00:26:59,651
Chen Guangpu.

452
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,411
You just called us

453
00:27:00,611 --> 00:27:01,891
to look for someone, right?

454
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:03,491
Yes, it was me. I just dialed 110.

455
00:27:03,891 --> 00:27:04,491
What happened?

456
00:27:05,051 --> 00:27:06,091
Don't panic. Everything's fine.

457
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:07,851
We came to check things out.

458
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:09,408
He's fine, just drunk.

459
00:27:09,651 --> 00:27:10,528
He got a substitute driver.

460
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:14,131
It's him, Mr. Zhou. Please come here.

461
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,531
Tell us what exactly happened.

462
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,211
As soon as I got in the car,

463
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:19,811
he said he was finding pharmacy
to buy medicine.

464
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,571
I took him to several pharmacies,

465
00:27:21,811 --> 00:27:22,851
but all of them were closed.

466
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:24,211
Where am I supposed to

467
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:25,451
find him a pharmacy at this hour?

468
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,072
He wasn't happy,

469
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:29,651
and insisted on finding
an open pharmacy tonight.

470
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:30,491
So we went on looking.

471
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:32,891
Then we saw this pharmacy
with the lights on.

472
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:33,931
I got out of the car to check.

473
00:27:34,091 --> 00:27:35,371
But there was no one inside.

474
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:37,691
He got out of the car,
saying he was going to smash the door.

475
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:38,891
I couldn't stop him.

476
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:41,331
Then he started throwing up all over m.
Look at this mess.

477
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:42,971
Sorry about that.

478
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:43,851
Then he laid down,

479
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,491
and said he wanted to take a nap.

480
00:27:45,491 --> 00:27:46,971
He told me to break in and get the meds.

481
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,291
I didn't dare to leave,

482
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,371
fearing something

483
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:50,371
might happen to him.

484
00:27:50,891 --> 00:27:52,608
I called the police
and stayed here the whole time.

485
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:55,211
Now that we know he's okay,

486
00:27:55,211 --> 00:27:56,331
just drunk and fell asleep.

487
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:57,651
Ma'am,

488
00:27:58,131 --> 00:28:00,611
do you need me
to call an ambulance for you?

489
00:28:00,611 --> 00:28:01,691
Yes, he's just drunk.

490
00:28:01,691 --> 00:28:02,731
He was making a fuss just now,

491
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,051
saying his girlfriend has a stomachache
and needs meds.

492
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,251
He should have passed out by now.

493
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,611
He's just drunk.

494
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:12,480
I can handle it.

495
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:14,571
Thank you.

496
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:18,571
Chen Guangpu, get up.

497
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,531
Chen Guangpu, get up!

498
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:24,731
Chen Guangpu!

499
00:28:28,011 --> 00:28:29,571
Chen Guangpu, are you crazy or what?

500
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:31,211
Why running around outside
when you're drunk.

501
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,371
You want to scare me to death,
don't you?

502
00:28:35,371 --> 00:28:36,571
You didn't answer my call.

503
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:38,451
I've been looking for you all night,
you know?

504
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:41,411
What am I supposed to do
if something happens to you?

505
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:43,691
You scared me to death.

506
00:28:43,771 --> 00:28:45,171
Too tight, I want to vomit.

507
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:48,811
Go ahead, and vomit yourself to death!

508
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,131
I'm awake now.

509
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:55,371
It's fine.

510
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:57,051
Everything is fine.

511
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:58,171
Alright, it's fine now.

512
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,011
Nothing to see here, guys.

513
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,411
Let's go.

514
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,080
I'll be fine.

515
00:29:06,771 --> 00:29:09,371
I haven't married you yet.

516
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:12,091
No way, I haven't said yes yet.

517
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,251
It hurts.

518
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:17,171
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:17,411 --> 00:29:18,491
Does your stomach still hurt?

520
00:29:19,731 --> 00:29:21,251
It hurts. It's killing me!

521
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:23,051
Then let's find another pharmacy.

Hello.

528
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:04,611
Coffee.

529
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:06,851
Thank you, bye.

530
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:01,651
What's wrong?

531
00:31:03,051 --> 00:31:03,771
We have work to do.

532
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:15,251
I've been overestimating him.

533
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:17,531
Can't take it seriously.

534
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:23,571
This wet wipe is specially designed
for children.

535
00:31:23,872 --> 00:31:25,851
It contains alcohol

536
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,011
for sterilization and disinfection.

537
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,531
Sorry, guys!

538
00:31:34,531 --> 00:31:35,811
Can I make a correction?

539
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,011
Let me correct that.

540
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,571
This wet wipe is specially designed
for children, it...

541
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,491
Sorry, let me correct it.

542
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:51,531
It does not contain alcohol
or fragrance,

543
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:54,051
safe for children and pregnant women.

544
00:31:54,051 --> 00:31:54,731
Rest assured to buy.

545
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:56,211
I just misspoke.

546
00:31:56,211 --> 00:31:57,251
I'm really sorry.

547
00:31:57,571 --> 00:31:59,011
Sorry, everyone.

548
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:09,851
Chen Guangpu, what are you doing?
I'm live streaming.

549
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:11,131
I know.

550
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:12,691
Then what are you doing?

551
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:14,331
Proposing.

552
00:32:15,451 --> 00:32:15,904
Proposing?

553
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:17,691
Isn't everyone watching?

554
00:32:17,931 --> 00:32:19,651
- Stop it, I'm live streaming.
- Let me have a look.

555
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,051
The livestreaming now has a total of

556
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,371
1,136 viewers, right?

557
00:32:25,771 --> 00:32:26,571
You're lucky.

558
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:29,851
You all are witnesses
for my proposal today.

559
00:32:30,091 --> 00:32:32,531
I'm going to propose to
Ms. He Xindi right now.

560
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:34,051
What are you doing?

561
00:32:35,211 --> 00:32:35,811
He Xindi.

562
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:47,091
Marry me.

563
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,171
The pink flowers are pretty.

564
00:32:58,331 --> 00:32:59,571
Chen Guangpu, are you crazy?

565
00:33:00,091 --> 00:33:00,651
Yes.

566
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:02,611
What?

567
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:05,771
You're my cure.

568
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:08,371
He Xindi.

569
00:33:09,491 --> 00:33:10,211
Marry me, please.

570
00:33:15,571 --> 00:33:16,571
Yes or no?

571
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:26,971
My wife.

572
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:32,736
Guys, attention,

573
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:34,851
you see that?

574
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:35,571
What is this?

575
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:37,851
Don't ever call her "wife" from now on.

576
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,131
She's my wife now.

577
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:42,331
Your Xindi is now my wife.

578
00:33:42,331 --> 00:33:43,771
I'm telling you, do you understand?

579
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,731
So wish us a happy marriage now.

580
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:47,291
Wish us a happy marriage, everyone.

581
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:49,251
Here we are!

582
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:50,851
Go for it!

583
00:33:50,971 --> 00:33:52,051
Congratulations!

584
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,451
Wishing you a long and happy marriage!

585
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:10,571
Wait, this is so sudden.

586
00:34:11,371 --> 00:34:13,251
Actually, we've been
working on it for a while.

587
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:14,931
Have you?

588
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,610
You have.

589
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,130
Me?

590
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,210
You've had a crush on me, right?

591
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:21,170
When did this version of the story
come out?

592
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:23,411
What? You're denying it now?

593
00:34:24,451 --> 00:34:26,690
No. What I mean is,

594
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:29,891
we developed feelings
for each other naturally.

595
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:31,130
It's destiny, right?

596
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:32,971
She's got me.

597
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:35,130
What do you mean? Are you complaining?

598
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,011
I'm grateful for it.

599
00:34:37,531 --> 00:34:39,451
Otherwise, I wouldn't know
who to spend my life with.

600
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:41,771
I, Chen Guangpu, hereby clarify,

601
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,011
I've had a crush on Ms. He

602
00:34:43,451 --> 00:34:44,451
and worked on the proposal.

603
00:34:45,011 --> 00:34:46,251
It's my honor to marry her.

604
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:47,170
That's it.

605
00:34:47,371 --> 00:34:47,931
Alright.

606
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,411
Did you propose?

607
00:34:49,411 --> 00:34:50,371
For sure!

608
00:34:50,371 --> 00:34:51,170
Look at her.

609
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,731
If I didn't propose, she'd...

610
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,971
What do you mean by that?

611
00:34:55,291 --> 00:34:56,931
It's a good chance
to show them the ring!

612
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:58,011
The ring.

613
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:00,891
It's so shiny.

614
00:35:01,611 --> 00:35:03,771
I'm still in shock.

615
00:35:04,291 --> 00:35:06,251
Well, it could be considered destiny.

616
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,491
That's it. It's not that bad.

617
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:10,624
For me,

618
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:13,251
I want you to be my best man.

619
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:16,960
You must witness my marriage.

620
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,771
If you don't, I'll just quit.

621
00:35:21,691 --> 00:35:23,411
Perhaps skip the ceremony.

622
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:25,691
Correct.

623
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:27,331
My wedding wouldn't mean a thing

624
00:35:27,691 --> 00:35:28,451
without you.

625
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:32,331
Oh, we found a bridal shop.

626
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:33,651
- Yes.
- Let's go there this afternoon.

627
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,171
Pick some expensive outfits for you.

628
00:35:36,011 --> 00:35:37,771
We'll make you the best suit.

629
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:38,880
It's my big day.

630
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:40,691
You must be there for me.

631
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:42,211
You too.

632
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,248
How about this one?

633
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:56,291
I'd like it to be more revealing.

634
00:35:57,651 --> 00:36:00,051
Come on, it's revealing enough.

635
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:01,251
A once in a lifetime experience!

636
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:02,731
Just let me shine.

637
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:04,251
Go try it on.

638
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:04,771
Give it a try.

639
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:05,411
Let's go.

640
00:36:06,971 --> 00:36:07,744
Men's section!

641
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:09,472
Wait for me.

642
00:36:10,091 --> 00:36:10,851
I'll go take a look.

643
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:16,032
How about this one?

644
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:17,931
French vinyl owner vibe!

645
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:20,771
Looks like a violinist.

646
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,451
A vinyl owner
can definitely play the violin!

647
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:24,640
Try this one first.

648
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:26,531
Come on, go try on clothes with me.

649
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,851
♪No matter where you go♪

650
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:29,611
Looks good.

651
00:36:32,851 --> 00:36:33,451
Does it look good?

652
00:36:34,411 --> 00:36:36,211
You look like a silver mushroom.

653
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:39,611
Does this pair of pants fit you well?

654
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:41,211
I'll use height-increasing
insoles anyway.

655
00:36:41,411 --> 00:36:42,931
It has nothing to do
with your waistline.

656
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,691
I can take in the waist of my pants.

657
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:46,171
Do you dare to let go of this dress now?

658
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:47,171
Of course, it'll be fine!

659
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:48,211
Look at your pants!

660
00:36:48,211 --> 00:36:49,131
Stop arguing, guys.

661
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:49,891
Look at him!

662
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,171
If it's not working, just change it.

663
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:52,451
Change what?

664
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:55,171
Change the clothes, of course.

665
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,211
Your choice, you're the boss.

666
00:36:56,891 --> 00:36:58,251
That's the spirit.

667
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:58,931
Go ahead and change.

668
00:36:59,291 --> 00:36:59,971
I'll change too.

669
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:01,771
- Go ahead.
- Silver mushroom.

670
00:37:02,091 --> 00:37:03,891
- Hurry up and change.
- Silver mushroom.

671
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:07,051
I'm telling you, you're like a queen.

672
00:37:07,211 --> 00:37:07,931
What's this?

673
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:08,931
Feel like a Matryoshka doll.

674
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:10,291
You two take a photo together.

675
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:10,971
Let me do it.

676
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:11,731

Three, two, one.

683
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:31,931
Cheese.

685
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:42,731
So

686
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:46,048
how did I end up marrying He Xindi?

687
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:48,051
Why ask me?

688
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:49,571
I don't know.

689
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:52,091
Anyway, it's too late to ask.

690
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:53,851
But I really didn't expect

691
00:37:54,651 --> 00:37:56,331
that the two of us
would end up together.

692
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:59,531
It would be strange
if you two didn't end up together.

693
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:01,651
So,

694
00:38:02,291 --> 00:38:03,451
isn't it a bit hasty?

695
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,211
It's too late for regrets now.

696
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:06,931
What are you saying?

697
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:08,411
I wouldn't regret it.

698
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:10,771
I was just thinking,

699
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:13,491
after all the Ms. Wrong I dated before,

700
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:17,171
I finally realized that my Ms. Right
is right by my side.

701
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:20,531
Then why

702
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:22,051
flirt with those wrong girls?

703
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:24,611
Wasn't that all just a waste of time?

704
00:38:25,851 --> 00:38:27,451
If you didn't waste that time,

705
00:38:27,851 --> 00:38:29,611
how can you know
that she is the right one?

706
00:38:32,451 --> 00:38:32,971
That's true.

707
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:34,771
So,

708
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:36,211
I think

709
00:38:37,251 --> 00:38:39,171
that one really shouldn't
make too many plans.

710
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:41,531
You never know what will happen.

711
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:46,011
Everything will eventually
be settled in the end.

712
00:38:47,771 --> 00:38:48,851
Good to know you're settled.

713
00:38:49,691 --> 00:38:50,851
You're about to get married.

714
00:38:51,171 --> 00:38:51,811
Be mature.

715
00:38:53,491 --> 00:38:55,491
You won't find anyone
better than He Xindi.

716
00:38:56,851 --> 00:38:57,611
Not really.

717
00:38:58,611 --> 00:39:00,651
Compared to Que,
He Xindi still falls short.

718
00:39:01,371 --> 00:39:03,051
But compared to other girls,

719
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:04,491
He Xindi wins hands down.

720
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:05,771
Put it this way.

721
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:09,011
If you rank all the girls in the world,

722
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,051
Que is number one,

723
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:11,811
and Xindi is number two.

724
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:14,491
They're ours.

725
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:17,251
Lucky you, Mr. Lin.

726
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:19,680
You too, Mr. Chen.

727
00:39:20,731 --> 00:39:21,451
I'm lucky.

728
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:39,744
Still not answering?

729
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:44,544
I shouldn't have made this call.

730
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:47,011
What's there to say?

731
00:39:47,811 --> 00:39:49,811
They haven't cared for me
since I was 16.

732
00:39:50,331 --> 00:39:52,171
Whether I get married,
to whom, or where,

733
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:53,291
doesn't matter to them.

734
00:39:54,411 --> 00:39:55,411
They don't care about me.

735
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,971
We make this call

736
00:39:57,971 --> 00:39:59,851
just to fulfill a duty.

737
00:39:59,851 --> 00:40:01,152
Just to let them know.

738
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:02,851
It's not to make you suffer.

739
00:40:03,731 --> 00:40:05,051
Why should I?

740
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:06,971
Have they fulfilled their duty?

741
00:40:07,611 --> 00:40:09,531
They didn't pay a cent
for my university fees.

742
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:11,371
They've never even
made a phone call to me.

743
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:13,211
Those who don't know

744
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:14,451
might think

745
00:40:14,931 --> 00:40:16,371
I'm some unwanted child.

746
00:40:17,211 --> 00:40:18,251
Of course you're not.

747
00:40:18,531 --> 00:40:19,451
I want you,

748
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,531
and this family wants you.

749
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,411
Don't you know that?

750
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:22,811
Ungrateful girl.

751
00:40:23,611 --> 00:40:24,531
Be mature.

752
00:40:24,691 --> 00:40:27,371
And after all these years,
it's not worth getting upset about.

753
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:31,491
Why upset?

754
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:33,651
I'm not upset at all.

755
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:39,051
You and godfather

756
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:40,691
are my family.

757
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:41,851
Exactly.

758
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:43,851
And soon there'll be Chen Guangpu.

759
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:46,291
And his family too.

760
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:48,651
I have a family of my own.

761
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:51,936
I've had

762
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:53,411
a lot of boyfriends.

763
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:56,571
No one ever asked me
where I spent Spring Festival.

764
00:40:58,051 --> 00:40:59,811
Chen Guangpu was the first
to ask me this.

765
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:01,691
What a fate.

766
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,931
What's wrong? Don't you want it?

767
00:41:06,211 --> 00:41:06,971
That's great.

768
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:08,384
I'm relieved.

769
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:11,424
At one point,

770
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:14,371
I wanted to marry
some kind of financial magnate,

771
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,651
and become a rich lady.

772
00:41:16,851 --> 00:41:18,331
But I ended up marrying

773
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:19,531
an unreliable rascal.

774
00:41:21,611 --> 00:41:22,496
Chen Guangpu

775
00:41:23,971 --> 00:41:24,731
is average looking,

776
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,051
not that smart,

777
00:41:26,611 --> 00:41:27,851
putting all his savings in funds,

778
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:29,051
unpromising funds.

779
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:31,571
His car is second-hand,

780
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:33,691
and the house belongs to his parents.

781
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:36,011
But I feel

782
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,051
so settled.

783
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:46,176
For your settled life.

784
00:41:46,331 --> 00:41:47,811
What is this? Why is it so retro?

785
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:49,691
This is my mother's necklace.

786
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,611
She wore it when she got married.

787
00:41:51,851 --> 00:41:54,011
She married the man
who I think is the best in the world.

788
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:55,691
Here, it's yours now,

789
00:41:55,691 --> 00:41:56,811
with blessings from my mother.

790
00:41:57,571 --> 00:41:58,051
No.

791
00:41:58,971 --> 00:42:00,091
Que, I can't take it.

792
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:01,611
This is too precious, really.

793
00:42:02,011 --> 00:42:04,288
You're more precious than it.

794
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:06,211
Just keep it.

795
00:42:08,091 --> 00:42:10,091
I won't be getting married anytime soon.

796
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:12,691
You will

797
00:42:13,331 --> 00:42:15,051
wear a wedding dress for me.

798
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:19,371
One of us should
find happiness first, right?

799
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:26,091
Try it on. See if it fits.

800
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:27,872
Come here.

801
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,051
Come on.

802
00:42:37,131 --> 00:42:37,571
Perfect.

803
00:42:38,691 --> 00:42:39,411
Does it look good?

804
00:42:41,971 --> 00:42:43,051
Be happy, promise me.

805
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:47,851
Que.

806
00:42:51,211 --> 00:42:53,371
Que, don't make yourself suffer.

807
00:42:54,011 --> 00:42:55,411
Promise me to take care of yourself.
