Come on, come on up

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,900
what makes your car so aggressive today?

5
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,460
What does your car have to do with you now?

6
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,640
How bad do you want it, you?

7
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,500
Do you have a bloody brain Illustrate this

The Korean flag is the symbol of the Korean people.

25
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
I don't think I'll lose even if I get a win.

26
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,120
The world's baduk champion, Cho Woonyun, has returned today.

27
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,120
The Korean flag is a unique car parade from Gipo Airport to the Korean flag in the middle of the country.

28
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
The Korean flag is the symbol of the Korean baduk.

29
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,120
Cho Woonyun, who has raised the status of the Korean baduk worldwide, decided to give the silver medal to the Korean flag.

30
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:25,440
Thanks to his

31
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
I heard you don't have a job.

32
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I think it's over. Let's stop.

33
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,120
Come on.

34
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I don't think it's over yet.

35
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Why?

36
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,120
No, it's not.

37
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
It's all over.

38
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
If you're okay, can I keep going?

39
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,120
How do you think I'm going to stop with the empty one?

40
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Wow, that's amazing.

41
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,120
As expected of Cho Guk-soo.

42
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
He's going to turn this upside down.

43
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,120
He's a different champion.

44
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,120
Originally, Yuri was the only one who didn't have a job.

45
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I'm going to get a job.

46
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
It's harder to win without Yuri.

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I'm a little bit of a bad guy.

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Give me another round.

49
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
What's wrong with you?

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
You're a big guy.

51
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
Go over there and play.

52
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Let's go over there.

53
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Let's give him another round.

54
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
If we get back together, I'll win.

55
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
What's your name?

56
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,120
What's your name?

57
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Chang-ho.

58
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Lee Chang-ho.

59
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
Come here.

60
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,120
Sit down.

61
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
Chang-ho.

62
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
You said you'd play the four-ball game soon.

63
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
Find the path of the earth.

64
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
If you're jealous of this,

65
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
I'll give you another round.

66
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
You're right.

67
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
What are you talking about?

68
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I'm not talking about anything else.

69
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
He's the same Gyeong-joon.

70
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,120
He's been so busy with his family.

71
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I should have brought him here.

72
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
You're strong.

73
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
He's not a normal guy.

74
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Is he your nephew?

75
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I've never seen him before.

76
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
He's a total jerk.

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
He said he's a high-profile guy.

78
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,120
He looks like he'd be a top player.

79
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
How many goals did you score?

80
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,120
You scored 5 points in a half year.

81
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
It's not 100, it's 0.

82
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
You must be mistaken.

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Misunderstanding? Me?

84
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Why are you giving me such a hard question?

85
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,120
There's no answer to a bat.

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
It's a bad bat.

87
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,120
It's a strong bat.

88
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
It's very strong.

89
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Let's play a game.

90
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's play a game.

91
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
No, no.

92
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Let's play a game.

93
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
He's so busy.

94
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,120
He said he'd focus on his game today.

95
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,120
He won't be able to do it if he keeps staring at him.

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Right, right.

97
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,120
He's doing something big.

98
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Let's go out and play a game.

99
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
I'll live.

100
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
I'll go study.

101
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,120
I'll just eat and say hello.

102
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Aren't you going to do your homework?

103
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Are you going to sit like that all day?

104
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
I'm going to study.

105
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,120
He's a good son.

106
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
He's good at math.

107
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
He's got a good chance.

108
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,120
I'll do the rest.

109
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
That's amazing.

110
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,120
He's a good boy.

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I'm a first-class student.

112
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm going to win a game if I play with him.

113
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,120
I'm going to win a game if I play with him.

114
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm going to win a game if I play with him.

115
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,120
The wave has been very bad these days.

116
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,120
There's a lot of international competition.

117
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
It's not bad to play with waves.

118
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Is that so?

119
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Yes.

120
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,120
I'd like to see if you could give him a few months.

121
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,120
I'll make sure you don't get disappointed.

122
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I'll give you a lot of spoilers.

123
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,120
You're going to send him to study abroad with that money, right?

124
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
That's the only way.

125
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,120
It's a good thing you can't study even if you die.

126
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
It's no use raising him if he's not a genius.

127
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
A reporter?

128
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
No.

129
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Take a look.

130
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Mr. Seo!

131
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Mr. Seo!

132
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Hey, you!

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
I've been working for you for months.

134
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,120
Do you know how much this guy's spoiler is?

135
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
We're not just a bunch of fools.

136
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,120
It's good for the reception and the spoilers.

137
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Let's not do business with the waves.

138
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
That's a stone game.

139
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
There's no delivery.

140
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Delivery...

141
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Minjae.

142
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
What are you doing?

143
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Is it good?

144
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I made it so you wouldn't fall out.

145
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Minjae, I told you not to touch the bottle.

146
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Leave it. I'll clean it up.

147
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Come here.

148
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Why is it so fun?

149
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Wash your hands.

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Let's eat.

151
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Put the bottle on the floor.

152
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
Hello?

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
Hey, Seob.

154
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm a good guy.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Oh, yes.

156
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Did you say Changho?

157
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Can you see him again?

158
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Oh, come on.

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Come on.

160
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Come on.

161
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Come on.

162
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Come on.

163
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,120
Come on.

164
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Come on.

165
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Come on.

166
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
I'll just clean up the table.

167
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,120
But if you win, you can clean up the waves.

168
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Why do you want to learn from me?

169
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
You said the waves were the strongest.

170
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
You said it was the best in Korea.

171
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Hey, hey.

172
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
The best in Korea is the best in the world.

173
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
You don't know anything about the world.

174
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,120
I'm a master of the game.

175
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
You're so good at it.

176
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
You're so good at it.

177
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
You're so good at it.

178
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm not talking to you.

179
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,120
Come on.

180
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm not talking to you.

181
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
You can't beat me if you're good at it.

182
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,120
You want to beat me?

183
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,120
You want to beat me?

184
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
If you lose,

185
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
If you lose,

186
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I'll give you a lot.

187
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Okay.

188
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
I'm glad you came all the way here.

189
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I'm glad you came all the way here.

190
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
You're such a good son.

191
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Brother, don't stand there.

192
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Come here.

193
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
You didn't get a zero.

194
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,120
You didn't get a zero.

195
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
Did you really finish this time?

196
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah, I lost this time.

197
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
You've improved a lot.

198
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
You won the beginning.

199
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
You won the beginning.

200
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
You won the beginning.

201
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Who won?

202
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
I just won the beginning.

203
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120
He won.

204
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
I'm not going to let you win.

205
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
I'm going to win the first round, so I'm going to have to see the end.

206
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Are you having fun watching it?

207
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
What is it?

208
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,120
I can't send it without sleeping.

209
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,120
But if I win, it can't be fun.

210
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,120
I'm not going to let you win.

211
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,120
You're not a baby.

212
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
The winner is...

213
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
The winner is...

214
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Come up and let's do it.

215
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
What's that man?

216
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,460
Like a

217
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,120
I call him a teacher.

218
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
Oh my god.

219
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,120
You're amazing.

220
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
You're so good.

221
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
Hurry up and make a bow to the teacher.

222
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Thank you.

223
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,120
That's right.

224
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,120
That's right.

225
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,120
What are you going to do with the teacher?

226
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Do you have time to teach him properly?

227
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Don't talk about our teacher.

228
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,120
You can't be a teacher.

229
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Don't make a fuss.

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Just go to Daegu.

231
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,120
You can't even get a member of the family.

232
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,120
There are so many people like you.

233
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
You'll get everything.

234
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
I'm not going to go in there.

235
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,120
I'm suddenly curious.

236
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,120
What's going to happen to him.

237
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,120
I always think of you as a hereditary.

238
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,120
I've decided to do it.

240
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Try it right.

241
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,120
You have to work hard.

242
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,120
Listen to the teacher.

243
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Okay?

244
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Yes.

245
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay.

246
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
Mr. Jung.

248
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
The door is going to break.

249
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Hurry up.

250
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Hurry up.

251
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
Oh, my God.

252
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
Come on.

253
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
You worked hard to feed him.

254
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Come on in.

255
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Oh, my God.

256
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
You're so handsome.

257
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,120
I'm proud of my father.

258
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
She's a good daughter.

259
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,120
I think she'll be a good daughter.

260
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Congratulations.

261
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Congratulations.

262
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Congratulations.

263
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
You got a new baby.

264
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
You're right.

265
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,120
You said Chang-woo, right?

266
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Nice to meet you.

267
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,460
Uhuh

268
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,120
You look so scary.

269
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
How old are you?

270
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
She said she passed away.

271
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
How happy are you?

272
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,120
You're so young and bright.

273
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,120
My grandfather said he was going to die.

274
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Come out.

275
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Come out.

276
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,120
I'm not drunk because I'm Lee Gang-ju.

277
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm a man of the Joseon Dynasty.

278
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Tell your grandfather that I'm grateful.

279
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Yes.

280
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Is the food good?

281
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Yes, it's delicious.

282
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
You're good at cooking.

283
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I don't think so.

284
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,120
Yeah, we're all in the same family.

285
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Why are you calling me that?

286
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
You're not a lady.

287
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
You're a man of the Joseon Dynasty.

288
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
That's right.

289
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,120
It's hard to call you that.

290
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
How about a little mom?

291
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Just call me little mom.

292
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Okay?

293
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Yes.

294
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Chang-ho, do you want more rice?

295
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Yes.

296
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
Give me some rice.

297
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Oh, my God.

298
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Oh, my God.

299
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
What?

300
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
Did you come to find your dad?

301
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,120
No, I'm not.

302
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
I'm in the family.

303
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
Family?

304
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Who is he?

305
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,120
He's a disciple of the Patriarch.

306
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Who's next?

307
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
What? Did you see it?

308
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
It's no joke.

309
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
It's a big one.

310
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
What is it?

311
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
You're going to put it in like that?

312
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Does it make sense?

313
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Oh, my God.

314
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,120
I don't have time.

315
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm going to go and get it.

316
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Wow, it must be Shindong.

317
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Why did the Patriarch go all the way to Jeonju?

318
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Wow, the Patriarch must have picked up a lot of things.

319
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
He's really good at it.

320
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I can't even afford to buy a house.

321
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,120
I can't even afford to buy a house.

322
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
Is it hot?

323
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,120
30 minutes left until the end of the year.

324
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,120
The last day of the year.

325
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Anyway, we're going to eat noodles.

326
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
I've been waiting for 30 minutes for a long time.

327
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,120
I'm more proud of my brother who doesn't throw money.

328
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
I feel like I'm going to see the end of the year.

329
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,120
I'm sick of this man.

330
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
It's the last day of the eighth season.

331
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,120
One, two, three, four.

332
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

333
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm screwed.

334
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I should have drunk.

335
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
It's a little hot.

336
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I'm going to get some water.

337
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
Here's the thing.

338
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,120
What is it?

339
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
You don't know?

340
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,120
When a good guy shakes his legs, he catches the plate.

341
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,120
It's the same as when a good guy shakes his legs.

342
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
It's the same as when a good guy shakes his legs.

343
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,120
One, two, three, four.

344
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm a member of the Cho Eun-young team.

345
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I think our brother is in a good mood today.

346
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
You have to take care of the waves.

347
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
You have to be polite.

348
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You're not polite.

349
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,120
It's harder when you step on it when you can win.

350
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Don't worry. I'll be back with a lot of knives.

351
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Congratulations. You said you were successful today.

352
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Don't talk.

353
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,120
I'm already looking forward to tomorrow's headlines.

354
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,120
If you're all mixed up because of Cha Hong-ah,

355
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,120
the students will fall down like a drop of wind.

356
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
If a good girl picks up a tiger,

357
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
it's a genius. It's a Shindong.

358
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Don't say that in front of Cha Hong-ah.

359
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,120
There's nothing good for the kid.

360
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
Let's go together.

361
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
What are you doing?

362
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I'm home.

363
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,120
You two are here together.

364
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,120
I met Hong Yoo-ho.

365
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Did you have a good time?

366
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Yes, a little.

367
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
How was Daegu today?

368
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
It was good.

369
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,120
It was really good.

370
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,120
The first half of the day was a mess.

371
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Do you know what the most messy thing is?

372
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
It's your attitude.

373
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
What?

374
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,120
I won all the games.

375
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
The English team didn't do much.

376
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
It's not all.

377
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,120
It's been months since I learned.

378
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Do you think the seniors who studied for years are laughing?

379
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
They're not in the middle of the game because they're ahead.

380
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,120
It's polite to do your best until the end.

381
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Learn how to respect your opponent.

382
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
You want to do it, too.

383
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
You're a chicken and a corn.

384
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
You...

385
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
Hey.

386
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
You're a jerk.

387
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Do it when you're the best.

388
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Learn the basics step by step.

389
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I saw it earlier.

390
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
The standard is boring.

391
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
It's boring.

392
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Is it boring?

393
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
Where do you like black and white?

394
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
This is obviously a good one.

395
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,120
White.

396
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
It's not a good time to think for a long time.

397
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
It's a bad time to think.

398
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Now I'm raising my senses.

399
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,120
But you can't just come out of nowhere.

400
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Don't back down.

401
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
The essence of the game is fighting.

402
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
It's an attack.

403
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Do you still like white?

404
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,120
No.

405
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Black.

406
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
I'm going to do it.

407
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
You're only good at the basics.

408
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
Can't you use your strength?

409
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Don't believe what geniuses and people say.

410
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,120
What you're good at is just calculating and memorizing.

411
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
You're just imitating the bat.

412
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Don't be a jerk and learn the basics first.

413
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I don't know anything else, but when you play the bat, use your right hand.

414
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
That's the least polite thing to the opponent.

415
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,120
Yes.

416
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
Everything is about stamina.

417
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,120
The humble hand that goes out of the fire.

418
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,120
The one who wants to compromise.

419
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Ani and the one who wants to compete with Cho.

420
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,120
All of these are the results of the loss of stamina.

421
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
No, I'm going to do it with my left hand.

422
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,120
I'm going to do it with my right hand.

423
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm going to do it with my left hand.

424
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I'm going to do it with my left hand.

425
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I'm going to do it with my left hand.

426
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
I'm going to do it with my left hand.

427
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,120
I'm going to do it with my left hand.

428
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Hello.

429
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,120
Why are you eating here?

430
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
I ordered it.

431
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
I ordered it for half the price.

432
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
I'm not kidding.

433
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,120
If you want to feed your son, you'll have to go to the hospital.

434
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,120
But you know who I am, right?

435
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Of course I know who you are.

436
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,120
You're the master of Nam Ki-chul, our teacher's rival.

437
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
What rival?

438
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Don't be surprised that you're in the army.

439
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
You're a very strong teacher.

440
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:17,120
But I don't know if I can learn from you.

441
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I want to follow you, but I don't have the skills.

442
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,120
Don't try to learn. Just do what you want.

443
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Then you'll learn naturally.

444
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I told you when I was dealing with your teacher.

445
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,120
It's so fast.

446
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
How do I catch this?

447
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
I don't know.

448
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
I don't know what to do.

449
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I don't know what to do.

450
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Chang-woo, you're working hard until late.

451
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
How's it going?

452
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,120
The preliminary round is starting soon.

453
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
It's not important to have good grades right now.

454
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
It's important to find your son.

455
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
You're going to be a rice to make a living?

456
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Don't be too hard on him.

457
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
He's still a kid.

458
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,120
If you're good, you're not good at anything.

459
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,120
You should raise him as best as you can.

460
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,120
In the world of competition, a life that's not for humans is too sad.

461
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I'm going to be a rice to make a living.

462
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,120
I can't believe you're staring at me like that.

463
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,120
I thought you were sleeping in the grand hall.

464
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,120
He's like an old man who's greedy for a field.

465
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,120
He's just giving me two rounds.

466
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
How much did you get?

467
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
20.

468
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,120
I'm going to be a big hit this month.

469
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,120
I thought there would be something because I was a good student.

470
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,120
He was so smart when he was young.

471
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
He's gotten really weird.

472
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,120
How much do you have to catch a child with a good temper?

473
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,120
I'm not going to live with a teacher like that.

474
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Grandpa, your batook is fancy and strong, but it doesn't fit me.

475
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Even if it takes time, I'm going to find my own batook that no one can imitate.

476
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,120
That's not it.

477
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,120
The one who's got a bad temper, pushes, pushes, and takes off.

478
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
Where did you sell everything you've learned?

479
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Honey, talk about tomorrow.

480
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
Get out of here.

481
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
How do you always win?

482
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
Why are you so upset because you lost so much?

483
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,120
I told you to get out.

484
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,120
You have to hold it in when you have to go out.

485
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
You have to burst it when you have to hold it in.

486
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,120
Why are you a bully?

487
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I think it's better to help the latter half because there are many variables when there is a fight.

488
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,120
I told you.

489
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,120
It's not a batook to compromise and build a house.

490
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
Bite, tear, throw, and fight.

491
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,120
That's your style, but it doesn't fit me.

492
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Don't be arrogant.

493
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
Style?

494
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,120
A fan?

495
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
It's no use if you give me that.

496
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
Do it as usual.

497
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
The standard is first.

498
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Do all batooks in the world have to be the same?

499
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,120
There is a order.

500
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,120
Even if you put a stone in the batook, there must be a reason.

501
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,120
Even when you take your hand out, there must be a reason.

502
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,120
There must be a basis to apply, interpret, and give.

503
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,120
It's natural to go out this way here, too.

504
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,120
Why are you taking your hand out?

505
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Are you going to take it out now?

506
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:23,120
That's right, but there is a risk of being reversed.

507
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,120
But if you do this, it's 100.

508
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
I win the half house.

509
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
100?

510
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,120
The center is hard to make a house, and I can't calculate it because it's a place of irreconcilable change.

511
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,120
That's right.

512
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,120
I thought I could calculate it.

513
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,120
So I did an experiment.

514
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Experiment?

515
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,120
You're very funny.

516
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,120
You have a good talent, and you're good at basic things.

517
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
You're useless and stubborn.

518
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Who?

519
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
Let's quit.

520
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,120
There's no reason to be angry at a guy who doesn't even want to learn.

521
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,120
But if you do this, it's 100.

522
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
I win the half house.

523
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,120
The first house is advantageous.

524
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:50,120
So when you put the baton in the other side, the first side is half the size of the five.

525
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
That's the bonus.

526
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Here, the half house is to prevent a tie.

527
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,120
There is no half house on the actual baton board.

528
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:10,120
The minimum group that decides the winner is the half house that does not exist on the baton board.

529
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Maybe he's looking at something else.

530
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

531
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Where are you going?

532
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,120
Jeonju at 9 40.

533
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,120
Oh, my God.

534
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Teacher.

535
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Anyway, the half house you said.

536
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,120
It's not completely wrong.

537
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,120
But it's not right either.

538
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:50,120
I just haven't found the alcohol yet.

539
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,120
I just found it.

540
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
There's no answer to the baton.

541
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,120
I forced you to answer.

542
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,120
I'm sorry.

543
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,120
It's better to run around and walk around.

544
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I found your baton, so it's okay.

545
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,120
If that's what you decided, you have to take responsibility.

546
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,120
Selfishness and life.

547
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Do you understand?

548
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,120
In practice, the momentum is the eight.

549
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:47,620
I'm talking about the

550
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,120
I'd rather hide it.

551
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Your thoughts, emotions, and breathing.

552
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Don't tell anyone about it.

553
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,120
I don't know, but it's not easy.

554
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Think of the familiar and comfortable things.

555
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Things that make you feel comfortable just by thinking.

556
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,120
The moment you lose your peace of mind, the floor is over.

557
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,120
It's not about dividing the stones by color.

558
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,120
There has to be a reason for everything.

559
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:30,120
Home is born naturally, not forced.

560
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Take good care of each stone.

561
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,120
Then the stones will naturally fit together.

562
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,120
Hey, you don't have to go up.

563
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,120
You don't have to go.

564
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,120
Oh, my God, Chang-ho, I met him again.

565
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
I met him again when I was a senior in the senior high school.

566
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Who cares about who?

567
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Everyone's not going to catch Chang-ho.

568
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,120
He's a unique guy.

569
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
He's not even good at taking off.

570
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,120
Strangely, the batu keeps growing.

571
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,120
The first stone is weak and the horse is slow.

572
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
I've been getting along with it for a while.

573
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,120
I think it's better than me.

574
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
Then, even these days, the 60-year-old man is a batu.

575
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,120
No, 80.

576
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:42,120
I'm going to make a house by fighting.

577
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,120
I'm going to keep it safe even if it's a half house.

578
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,120
The batu is a house fight anyway.

579
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Grandpa, I think I've finally found my batu.

580
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:04,120
I'm going to make a batu that never loses to anyone, even if it's a little rough and not as fancy as you.

581
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,120
That's a good place.

582
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,120
This girl is definitely a good girl.

583
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
There are two professional drivers in one house.

584
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Congratulations.

585
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,120
It's not bad to be a professional driver.

586
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,120
Shouldn't we take a picture on a day like today?

587
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,120
Mr. Cheon, please take a picture of our family.

588
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Yes.

589
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,120
One, two.

590
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,120
Chang-ho, smile. Why are you whining?

591
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Why are you smiling?

592
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
I'm smiling.

593
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Is that so?

594
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,120
Then let's take a picture.

595
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,120
One, two, three.

596
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:17,120
But here, I think it's better to hit the batu this way.

597
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,120
I can see a big advantage, but I'm afraid I'll give you a secret.

598
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,120
But isn't it better to stop here?

599
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,120
You can't even hit the stone bridge, so you're just going around.

600
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:39,120
I don't like it, but I'm not going to go anywhere and make you a curse.

601
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,120
Next opponent.

602
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
Nam Ki-chul.

603
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,120
I'm worried, too.

604
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Nam's batu is so fierce.

605
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
It's a tough batu.

606
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,120
If you start to back down, you'll see the target and hit it here and there.

607
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,120
You have to push it hard from the beginning.

608
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,120
I'm going to hold it in and protect it.

609
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
You bastard.

610
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,120
You told me to find my batu.

611
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
So don't do it.

612
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,120
Please believe me.

613
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,120
Yeah.

614
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,120
Just relax and think you're learning.

615
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,120
Just relax.

616
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
No.

617
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,120
I'm going to win.

618
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,120
Lee Cheol-gu team, He.

619
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Lee Chang-ho, three, Baek.

620
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,120
I'll start the game.

621
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Father.

622
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Let's go to the prosecutor's office together and have a cup of coffee.

623
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,120
No, I'm not coming.

624
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,120
I'm going to go to the prosecutor's office.

625
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
10 minutes left for the management team.

626
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,120
Oh, my God.

627
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Baek, you're not a good player.

628
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,120
Oh, Mr. Baek.

629
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,120
I learned a lot.

630
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
Hey, Jung-wook.

631
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,120
I think black is better.

632
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,120
Hey, you know it well.

633
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,120
You're not good at it.

634
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,120
No, I'm not bad.

635
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,120
I was a little drunk that day.

636
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,120
It's up to 115.

637
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,120
I'm going to go to the prosecutor's office.

638
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,120
You shouldn't have stopped here.

639
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,120
If you had just received it.

640
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:12,120
Push one and spread it out in the middle.

641
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,120
It's not good to be stuck with Cho Gok-soo.

642
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,120
Jung-wook is better than you.

643
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,120
Congratulations, Mr. Lee.

644
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
I'm sorry.

645
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
I'm sorry.

646
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
You're not good at it.

647
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
You're not good at it.

648
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,120
Look, I'm not weak, I'm strong.

649
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
He's definitely a good guy.

650
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
Oh, my God.

651
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
It's a private match.

652
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,120
It's too fast.

653
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,120
Is there a story behind the victory?

654
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,120
What if he gets caught by Chang-won?

655
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
Oh, my God.

656
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,120
It's still 10 years.

657
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Oh, my God.

658
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:13,120
When you're attacked in the middle, you're weak.

659
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:21,120
You're weak when you're in a big shape.

660
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
I'm sorry.

661
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,120
I'm sorry.

662
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,120
I'm sorry.

663
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,120
I'm sorry.

664
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:36,120
I'm sorry.

665
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
I'm sorry.

666
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,120
Sir, I heard you're going to be discharged.

667
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,120
Oh, my God.

668
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Oh, my God.

669
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,120
No, tell me something.

670
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,120
Please tell me something.

671
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,120
What kind of teacher are you?

672
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,120
What am I?

673
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,120
Did you sleep well?

674
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
Are you feeling okay?

675
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
Yes, I'm fine.

676
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,120
Don't be too concerned about the victory and defeat.

677
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,120
Just put your foot down.

678
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,120
Okay.

679
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,120
How are you feeling about the meeting with the president of the country?

680
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,120
I'm fine.

681
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,120
I'm going home.

682
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,120
Good night.

683
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,120
Okay.

684
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,120
I'll cover the road.

685
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
In two.

686
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,120
Troops.

687
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,120
Just put 2 guns and Prayons of the Lord in the Emergency Line division.

688
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,000
I'm going to start the fight.

689
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:54,920
It's funny.

690
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:55,760
Let's play a game. Wait.

691
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,520
How's the game?

692
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,560
I just got it.

693
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,020
I haven't played it yet.

694
00:52:59,020 --> 00:52:59,860
Please teach me.

695
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,860
Just a little bit.

696
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,860
Hurry up.

697
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,860
Let me go. Let me go.

698
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,860
Oh, I'm so confused.

699
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:11,860
Wow, the noodles are so good.

700
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,860
Huh?

701
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
You've been working hard since the beginning.

702
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:18,860
Isn't this too much for a young student?

703
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,860
Oh, I'm so sorry.

704
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,920
I'll be back after dinner.

705
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,920
I should have just taken it.

706
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:02,920
I should have just given up on the game.

707
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,920
I should have just given up on the game.

708
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,920
When did you come, Mr. Jung?

709
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,920
I'm taking the first car today.

710
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:23,920
But I don't think I'm feeling very well today.

711
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,380
I didn't have any

712
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,920
ID cards when I was in school.

713
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,920
Is our business different from others?

714
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,920
I asked the teacher to take a look at me.

715
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,920
He asked me to be gentle.

716
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
That's not true.

717
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,920
A game is a game.

718
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,920
Oh, the food is here.

719
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,920
Oh, it's so good.

720
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,920
It's so good.

721
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,920
Oh, my God.

722
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,920
There are so many mistakes today.

723
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,920
We're running, too.

724
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,920
How can I be so stupid?

725
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Isn't he your teacher who went to heaven?
