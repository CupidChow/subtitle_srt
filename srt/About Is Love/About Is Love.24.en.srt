28
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,179
[Episode 24]

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,600
Okay.

30
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,320
Okay, no matter you're
his friend or girlfriend,

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,519
I'll have to thank you
on behalf of Wei Qing.

32
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,599
Do you know? For many years,

33
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,080
I've been trying to find someone
that Wei Qing can trust...

34
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,560
to resolve the curse on him.

35
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,759
Well, I'll try my best...

36
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,840
since I don't know anything.

37
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,800
By the way, I heard Wei Qing said...

38
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,920
you think his illness is
due to a psychological condition?

39
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,959
Through my analysis and treatments,

40
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,560
I think his condition belongs to...

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,640
a type of PTSD.

42
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,119
He lost the memory of his teenage years.

43
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,319
You know that, right?

44
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,280
Yes.

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,759
This is a type of self-defense as well.

46
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,119
Is it because his father
passed away when he was young?

47
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,640
To put it accurately,
his father was murdered.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,239
And Wei Qing was the first one
to discover his body.

49
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,720
That's why,

50
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,119
I think something appened
during that period.

51
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,879
since then he becomes ill.

52
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,519
Of course, for many years,

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,200
I've always tried to
persuade him to try hypnosis.

54
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,080
At least he can reclaim
his lost memories.

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,119
But he has been escaping from this.

56
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,879
Don't ask too much, okay?

57
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:28,840
Just give me a checkup
when you need to.

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,039
And give me my medicines.

59
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,679
As long as you can treat me,

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,679
you can get your money.

61
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,160
Do you know that extreme allergies...

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,399
will cause shock and DIC as well?

63
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,879
You want to attend parties
with a body like that?

64
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,519
It's because of this
I need to attend parties.

65
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,280
Maybe I can find someone
that I'm not allergic to.

66
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,879
Listen. Stop interfering
my personal life.

67
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:53,360
Just treat my illness, okay?

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,640
Can you do that?

69
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,399
Since it's that serious,

70
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
I don't think I can help much.

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
That's not the case. You must know it.

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,199
There's an important step in
solving psychological issues.

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,959
That is to obtain one's complete trust.

74
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,359
Although I knew him for over 10 years,

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,480
compared with me,

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,959
I think he trust you better.

77
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,600
How is that possible?

78
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,959
How is that impossible?

79
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,679
Our body is very honest.

80
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,760
Look.

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,560
Wei Qing's body is just like a fortress.

82
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,399
When it detects something,

83
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
the fortress will go to an alert state.

84
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,359
But his fortress has
no reaction towards you.

85
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,239
That's why, you're not his enemy.

86
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,720
At least from the body's perspective.

87
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:10,600
Why does this sound weird?

88
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:23,880

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,040

90
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,799
Thank you for giving us hope.

91
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,000
And thank you for
letting us believe that...

92
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,199
Wei Qing can be treated.

93
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,440
That's why, please.

94
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,000
You must be confident with yourself.

95
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,519
I have the confidence.

96
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
But what should I do?

97
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,560

What do you mean? Where is she going?

There's a woman climbing
into other people's house!

108
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,679
Maybe she's a thief!

You're really something, huh?

Go and explain it to them yourself.

What are you writing? They're hideous.

136

[Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy]

139
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,360
You've read all of these?

140
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,680
Of course!

141
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:10,959
Are you so touched?

142
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,920
that you can't say a word?

143
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,800
Your words are hideous.

144
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,319
So what? I can understand them.

145
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,639
Do you know?

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Dr. Chen recommended them to me.

147
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:26,040
I've read them for many days.

148
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,879
I wasn't this serious
for my NCEE, you know?

149
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,920
To put it simply,

150
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,399
allergies are our body's
self-defense mechanism.

151
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,120
The immune system of some people will
have problems identifying some objects.

152
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:40,040
From that, it forms a reaction.

153
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I don't understand.

154
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,920
For example,
if you're allergic to peanuts,

155
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:48,759
if you accidentally ate some peanuts,

156
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,800
your body would be aware of it.

157
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,559
And it will defend itself.

158
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,240
Thus forming an allergic reaction.

159
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,759
That's because your body
wants to remind you...

160
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,399
that it's dangerous to do so.

161
00:09:58,959 --> 00:09:59,879
I understand.

162
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,800
How about things other than food?

163
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,959
Will someone be allergic
to certain people?

164
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,920
For example, if I touched you,

165
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,360
and you're allergic to my touch.

166
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,999
That's possible.

167
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:11,160
Our body is very complex.

168
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,480
Our skins, odours,

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
hairs, fluids,

170
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,999
all of those may cause
allergies as well.

171
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,879
But we can't say that for sure.

172
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,439
Some people,

173
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,160
they're not allergic to mangoes.

174
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,040
But they're allergic to mango juices.

175
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,519
And they're not allergic to
mango cordials.

176
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,720
It's very complicated.

177
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,160
My goodness! Just kill me already!

178
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,920
My goodness!

179
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,800
Okay, let's get down to business.

180
00:10:43,999 --> 00:10:45,439
Between humans,

181
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,160
there are levels of distances.

182
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:48,680
An anthropologist from the US...

183
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,079
categorised four types of distances
according to our relationships.

184
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:54,600
According to the intimacy between human,

185
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,959
The public distance
ranges from 3.7 to 7.6 m.

186
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,480
The personal distance
ranges from 46 cm to 122 cm.

187
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,519
For the intimate distance,

188
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,879
it ranges from 15 to 44 cm.

189
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
The close distance range
is shorter than 15 cm.

190
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,079
Although I don't know...

191
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,680
why you have this kind of condition,

192
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,519
since you can't contact with other people,

193
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,040
we must remember the
four types of distances well.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,160
If you don't want others
to know your secret,

195
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:22,399
you need to maintain at least
a 1 m radius from other people.

196
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,759
And don't let anyone come
into your green circle.

197
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,439
If you want others to come in,

198
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,240
you can only pick people you trust,

199
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,559
or those that won't cause you allergies
when you come into contact with them.

200
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,280
Wei Qing! Are you listening?

201
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,879
I heard you. If someone...

202
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,959
manage to enter the green circle,

203
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,800
and I'm not allergic to him or her,

204
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,519
that means that person is safe for me.

205
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,199
So, how about you?

206
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:51,480
For me,

207
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,199
I think I'm in this range.

208
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:58,680
I don't think so.

209
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,199
I think...

210
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,600
you're in this range.

211
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
And if you want to treat me,

212
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,759
you need to stay within
this range, right?

213
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,319
This...

214
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,280
Fine.

215
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,040
Tell me your plan.

216
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,280
I'll use a gentle way
of systematic desensitization.

217
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,800
And use the principal of conflict,

218
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,199
to help you reduce
your allergy symptoms gradually.

219
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,720
What should I do?

220
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,319
You just write down
the things or people you hate.

221
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,399
From the top to the bottom.

222
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,240
We'll overcome them one-by-one.

223
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,920
From that, we can reduce
your resistance against them.

224
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:39,519
Things or people I hate?

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,160
[Cats, Ning Fei]

226
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
[He Wei, Zhang Shuai, you.]

227
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,280
You!

228
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,879
Cats?

229
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,280
Cats are so cute.

230
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,559
How could you hate them?

231
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,120
People like you should be exiled.

232
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,079
And live forever alone.

233
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,160
Why are you annoyed by
my hatred for cats?

234
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,840
I've already written them down.

235
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Tell me then. What is your next step?

236
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,399
He Wei, Zhang Shuai.

237
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,959
Did Zhang Shuai offend you?

238
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,879
Do I need a reason to hate someone?

239
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,519
How about me?

240
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,800
Why am I on the list too?

241
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,079
What do you mean?

242
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,319
Okay, I'll come immediately.

243
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,559
Come, follow me.

244
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,439
I haven't eaten yet.

245
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,040
I'll change my clothes first.

246
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,959
When I change, you'd better eat something.

247
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,759
We'll go after I finish changing.

248
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,959
Did Xue Zi say why
she wanted to find me?

249
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,639
She said she needs to
discuss something with you.

250
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,280
Since we're meeting at Xun Art Gallery,

251
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
I think it's about Yun Ma Artwork.

252
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,040
Xue Zi wanted to meet me?

253
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,280
Is there any news about...

254
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,160
Director He and He Wei?

255
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,399
Director He has
transferred all her shares...

256
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:25,040
to He Wei.

257
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,120
He Wei is the biggest shareholder
of Yun Ma Artwork now.

258
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,439
She really believes in her brother.

259
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,879
That's better for me.

260
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,280
I can focus on dealing with He Wei now.

261
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:40,519
By the way,

262
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,559
what's your plan again?

263
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,559
For the first step, we focus
on daily contact with people.

264
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,480
I'll help you familiarize the feeling
of getting into contact with people.

265
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:51,399
Come.

266
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,319
What are you doing?

267
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,240
I need to get used to this, right?

268
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,600
I don't have feelings holding your hand.

269
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,280
This is better.

270
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,319
Come. Follow me to Xun Art Gallery.

271
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
When you meet Wei Qing later,

272
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,720
you must be in contact with him.

273
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,120
It doesn't matter if you
shake his hands or hug him.

274
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,840
You must touch him.

275
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,360
Why?

276
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
This is not within my job scope.

277
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,759
I want to confirm something.

278
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,319
Since you know him already,

279
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,040
just treat it as a greeting then.

280
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,920
Remember to be natural.

281
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,559
Can you do that?

282
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,240
Okay, I understand.

283
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,160
Wei An  and I will enter.

284
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,920
You just stay in the car.

285
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,120
But I'm so boring alone.

286
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Can't I just view Xun Ran's
paintings while waiting for you?

287
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,840
Stay in the car.

288
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,559
Why are they here as well?

289
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,399
I forgot about this.

290
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,759
You don't really like
Xun Ran's paintings, right?

291
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,040
I'm sorry. I do enjoy viewing them.

292
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,279
Everyone has their own preferences

293
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,919
If you like it,

294
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,039
you can continue.

295
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,640
No thanks.

296
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll have time for that later.

297
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,520
I'm one of the shareholders
of this gallery too.

298
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,679
I meet you today
because I want to...

299
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,199
talk about the gallery's operation
in the future.

300
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,079
What suggestions do you have then?

301
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,919
Calm down. Let's wait for
another person to arrive.

302
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,679
Sorry, Director Xue. I'm late.

303
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,079
Director Wei, long time no see.

304
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,159
Director Wei,
she's asking for a handshake.

305
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:50,400
You're acting so coldly.

306
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:55,559
Miss Xue!

307
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,799
What a coincidence! We meet again!

308
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,360
Yeah, what a coincidence.

309
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,520
Chairman?

310
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:07,439
Assistant An? Director He?

311
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,039
Why are you guys here?

312
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:12,520
Fei Fei? You're here too?

313
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,640
You guys know each other?

314
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,919
Yeah, we're roommates.

315
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,079
Zhou Shi, why are you here?

316
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm on leave today.
I'm here to view the paintings.

317
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,840
Didn't you know that we're busy here?

318
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,240
Leave first.

319
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,079
I'm sorry! I'll leave now.

320
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,400
Fei Fei,

321
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,880
are you free?

322
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,720
I...

323
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,000
Director He.

324
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,760
I think you should let her rest as well.

325
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:42,959
We got some things to discuss.

326
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,480
-Okay.
-Thank you, Miss Xue.

327
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:46,400
We'll leave now.

328
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,959
Let's sit down and discuss.

329
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,240
Wait, what's the matter?

330
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
Why are you here as well?

331
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,559
I came with Wei Qing.

332
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,439
Why did you want to shake his hand?

333
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:10,120
He Wei asked me to do this.

334
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,880
He said he wanted to confirm something.

335
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,799
He does know something.

336
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,279
You were used by him, you know?

337
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
What do you mean?

338
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,279
He Wei is not a good person.

339
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,679
Why did Xue Zi ask you all to come?

340
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,720
Do you want to know?

341
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:24,640
I do.

342
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,840
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

343
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,079
You've asked both of us to come.

344
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,319
What do you mean by this?

345
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,720
I didn't do much since...

346
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:35,439
I became Yun Ma Artwork's shareholder.

347
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,679
Xun Ran is holding an exhibition
in the Xun Art Gallery now.

348
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,799
And Yun Ma Artwork has been
hitting limit up recently.

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,720
I want to use this chance,

350
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,679
to discuss about Yun Ma Artwork's
future development.

351
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,919
My sister had always been
managing Yun Ma Artwork.

352
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,120
You may know her as Director He.

353
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,400
Miss Xue, you don't
need to worry about this.

354
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,439
I heard that Director He had
transferred all her shares to you.

355
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,520
Yeah. I'm the biggest shareholder
of Yun Ma Artwork now.

356
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,439
You were.

357
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,840
What do you mean?

358
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,240
During these few days,

359
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,720
I've bought over the shares
of other shareholders gradually.

360
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,840
That's why Yun Ma Artwork's
stock price has risen.

361
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,799
I've spend much on them.

362
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,360
But they're worth it.

363
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,439
Now, I have 35% worth of stock.

364
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,720
It's higher than Director He's 33%,

365
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,360
and Director Wei's 32%.

366
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,039
It's higher than both of you.

367
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,559
That's why,

368
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:28,199
I'm Yun Ma Artwork's
biggest shareholder now.

369
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,439
What are you trying to do?

370
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,959
Yun Ma Artwork
has been incurring losses.

371
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,559
As one of the shareholders,

372
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,959
of course I need to consider
its future development.

373
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,439
The best way for it to develop...

374
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,720
is to take over it myself.

375
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,959
Director Wei, I'm helping you as well.

376
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,240
Because of your relationship
with Director He,

377
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
you've been letting
Yun Ma Artwork incur losses.

378
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,840
And you're stressed out by that too.

379
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,760
That's why, once I take over here.

380
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,760
I will remove
Director He from her position.

381
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,079
What?

382
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,760
Xue Zi, this is despicable.

383
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,480
You didn't say that when you were...

384
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,959
persuading us to sell the shares!

385
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,919
The business field always changes.

386
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,799
Director He,
you're a businessman as well.

387
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,720
I'm sure you understand this as well.

388
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,319
Xue Zi is something else.

389
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,240
She cheated both Wei Qing
and He Wei at the same time.

390
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,799
She's been faking
ignorant the whole time.

391
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,640
What should Director He do
if she really gets sacked?

392
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:30,000
Yun Ma Artwork is her life's work.

393
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:32,120
She'll go crazy over this.

394
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,799
I think Wei Qing won't
let her do what she wants.

395
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,120
Miss Xue.

396
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
You have a nice plan.

397
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,760
But don't forget...

398
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:41,760
the name of Yun Ma Artwork.

399
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:43,279
As long as the name is there,

400
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,880
you can't just do anything
you want to do.

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,039
Director Wei,
stop cheating yourself already.

402
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,000
Only Yun Ma Artwork's name
belongs to Yun Ma Group.

403
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,799
In reality, it has always
been operating independently.

404
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,480
Since I'm the biggest shareholder now,

405
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,880
I can change its name too.

406
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,600
How about we call it the Snow Artwork?

407
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,600
But Director Wei, don't worry.

408
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,240
I won't do that.

409
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,199
Since...

410
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,919
we'll have more collaborations
in the future.

411
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,240
For my next plan,

412
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,799
besides firing He Yun,

413
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,559
I want to reduce the number
of galleries too.

414
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,760
And a new series of jewelries created by
Xun Ran and Snow Group will be launched.

415
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,480
I will send the details
to you two later.

416
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,240
I'll leave first.

417
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,799
I'll wait for your replies.

418
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,400
I was fooled by this wretch!

419
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,240
Didn't you say that she's gullible?

420
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,720
Didn't you say that you
were in charge of everything?

421
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,079
What is this then?

422
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:52,640
Why are you angry with me?

423
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:53,679
You think you're any better?

424
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,199
Have you ganged up with her before?

425
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,559
You got fooled too, didn't you?

426
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,120
Wei An, let's go.

427
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,919
-This is bad. They're coming out.
-Let's move.

428
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,760
Sit here.

429
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,000
Listen.

430
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,240
That was so funny!

431
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,799
Stop pretending already.

432
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,240
I know you guys were
eavesdropping on us.

433
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
By the way, we're neighbours, right?

434
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,480
Don't say I didn't warn you.

435
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:29,640
Don't be too close to He Wei.

436
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,959
Don't worry.

437
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,919
I know what kind of person he is.

438
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,919
What kind of person am I?

439
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,120
A person like me.

440
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,159
You were quick-witted just now.

441
00:23:57,439 --> 00:23:58,400
Of course.

442
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,679
I can't let you embarrass yourself
in front of others.

443
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,480
I'll be irresponsible if that happened.

444
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,880
By the way, does He Wei
know your condition as well?

445
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,319
Did he arrange your
exes to come as well?

446
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,760
He's my relative.

447
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,199
It's no surprise that
he knows something about it.

448
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,799
I've been trying to distract him too.

449
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,600
But he's been testing me recently.

450
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,559
I think he's onto something.

451
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,880
He's despicable!

452
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,720
He used Fei Fei too!

453
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,640
I'm not worried about him.
I'm worried about Xue Zi.

454
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,319
Yeah. Is she really going
to sack Director He?

455
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,919
Please think!

456
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:34,959
If she is going do that,

457
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:36,600
she doesn't need to inform us.

458
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,480
She can just sack her
and tell us after that.

459
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,360
Since she told us this,

460
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,959
I'm sure she has other motives.

461
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,720
But,

462
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,919
I don't know what's her real motive.

463
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,600
According to what you've said,

464
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,480
it seems you have a solution.

465
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,199
Of course there are solutions.

466
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:52,559
If I can think of them,

467
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,679
I'm sure He Wei can think of them too.

468
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,840
It all depends on
who initiates on the topic.

469
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,360
What solution is that?

470
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,120
This...

471
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:04,199
You don't need to worry about that.

472
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
You don't need to interfere.

473
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,760
What you need to do now,

474
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,400
is to try and treat my condition.

475
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,880
Start your next plan then.

476
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,400
I understand.

477
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,120
Where are you going?

478
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,679
Why did you bring me here? It's crowded.

479
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,199
It's better for your condition
when it's crowded. Let's go.

480
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,279
I'm not going.

481
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:38,439
Don't worry.

482
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,640
I'll protect you.

483
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,799
Let go of me! You're a bear!

484
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,640
Why is your hand red?

485
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,880
Are you allergic to me now?

486
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,959
It's not that.
This place is too crowded.

487
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,480
I understand now.

488
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,279
It is a psychological condition.

489
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,400
How about this? Just close your eyes.

490
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,039
How can I walk with my eyes closed?

491
00:25:58,199 --> 00:25:59,640
Don't worry, I'll hold your hand.

492
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:00,840
Don't be afraid.

493
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,799
Are you feeling better now?

494
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,279
Yeah.

495
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's stop here then.

496
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,679
Don't worry.

497
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,039
I'll stay beside you. Don't be afraid.

498
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,559
Take a deep breath.

499
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:33,559
Now, just pretend
I 'm the only person around here.

500
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,360
That's impossible!

501
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,480
Everyone is talking beside me.

502
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
It's impossible for me to do that.

503
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:01,240
Now, we'll continue to walk.

504
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,520
You mustn't be afraid.

505
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:04,079
I'll always protect you.

506
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,919
Where's your sunglasses?

507
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:09,360
It's in my pocket.

508
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,159
Now,

509
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,159
I think people won't
be suspicious of you.

510
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:41,679
Let's just sit here and rest.

511
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,520
Sit here?

512
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,799
Where? Is it clean?

513
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,919
Don't worry, I've put a cushion there.

514
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:47,079
Have a seat.

515
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,799
Take off your sunglasses
and have a look.

516
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,279
We walked so far already?

517
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,600
See? This isn't as hard
as you think.

518
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,120
It's because I have you.

519
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,120
Egg waffles!

520
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,480
I want one.

521
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:26,880
Okay.

522
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:37,439
Here you go.

523
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:41,799
Try it.

524
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,600
I'm not trying.

525
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,360
This is delicious. Just try it.

526
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:45,520
No way.

527
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,919
Just try it. Please?

528
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,640
That doesn't work on me.

529
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,520
Fine. If you don't try it, I'll leave.

530
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,480
You can stay here alone.

531
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
You!

532
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,400
You can't swallow it like that!
You must chew it first.

533
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,319
That's not how you eat it.
Take another bite.

534
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,400
How's the taste? Is it nice?

535
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,199
See? You're just scaring yourself.

536
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,679
It's just like interacting with people.

537
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,679
You can do it as long as you're relaxed.

538
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,279
Yes, Miss Zhou. You're right.

539
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,480
Smelly tofu!

540
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:48,959
One set, please.

541
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,120
Okay.

542
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,079
Are you kidding me?

543
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,159
Come, have a taste.

544
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,799
That's impossible.

545
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:01,159
Just one bite? It's delicious!

546
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,279
I would rather...

547
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,679
eat the egg waffles.
I'm not eating this.

548
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,840
How can you know
since you haven't tried it?

549
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,199
-I don't want to.
-Just try it!

550
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,199
I...

551
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,919
I'm sorry!

552
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm sorry!

553
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,000
It's so smelly!

554
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,400
I didn't mean to do that!

555
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,799
Don't come!

556
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,600
Did I cause this?

557
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,679
It's nothing. I know you were nervous.

558
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,919
It's normal for you to grip hard.

559
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,840
I'm sorry.

560
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,159
I said it's nothing.

561
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,520
Besides, didn't I pour
the tofu all over you as well?

562
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,079
We're equal now.

563
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:52,720
No.

564
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,199
That's a small matter.

565
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,240
If it weren't for you,

566
00:30:57,439 --> 00:31:00,120
I may never get the chance
to walk in a crowd.

567
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,159
If it weren't for you,

568
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,600
I may never get the chance
to eat egg waffles in a mall.

569
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,199
But,

570
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,240
thanks to you,

571
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,760
I feel like a normal person again.
Thank you.

572
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,000
No need to thank me.

573
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,199
Okay. From now on,

574
00:31:22,439 --> 00:31:25,520
I will leave myself in your care.

575
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,600
Don't worry. Just leave it to me.

576
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,159
I promise to turn you
into a normal person again.

577
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,679
You can touch anyone you like.

578
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,720
Wait, that sounds wrong.

579
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,520
You can be touched by anyone.

580
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,640
Just shut up.

581
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,760
By the way,

582
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,039
there's something I need you to do.

583
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,559
What?

584
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,319
You're moving to his house again?

585
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,600
I can't tell you the details.

586
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,679
I can only say that...

587
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,760
Wei Qing is in a huge trouble.

588
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,120
And I'm the only one that can help him.

589
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,799
He did everything...

590
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:06,360
because of this too.

591
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,679
So, he was here last time
because he wanted your help?

592
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,279
Yeah. He helped me many times already.

593
00:32:12,439 --> 00:32:13,760
This time, I'm returning the favour.

594
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,520
Okay then.

595
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,919
As long as he doesn't bully you.

596
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,240
Don't worry.
Even if he wants to bully me,

597
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,880
he doesn't have the ability.

598
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,120
You're right.

599
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,520
Okay. Just go then.

600
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:26,640
If he bullies you,
you must call us immediately.

601
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Qiu Jing and I  will come
to save you immediately.

602
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,039
Give me a hug.

603
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,600
Okay then. You can go now.

604
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,199
Goodbye.

605
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:35,799
Goodbye. Be careful.

606
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:55,199
You don't need to memorise them now.

607
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,000
I'll put the board here.

608
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:58,520
Just remember to view it.

609
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,439
I think I should move out.

610
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,480
Go and eat in the dining room.

611
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
I'm just eating an apple.

612
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,279
Apples have juices inside.

613
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,079
You have so many rules here.

614
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,279
Good habits will
improve your personality.

615
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,760
It's good for your future.

616
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:27,559
Where's the guest room again?

617
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:29,279
Are you done tidying up the room?

618
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,799
You're not sleeping there.
You're sleeping with me.

619
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,360
I'm sleeping with you?

620
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,559
Why?

621
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,319
You know I have nightmares, right?

622
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:44,640
But when I'm with you,

623
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,760
I can sleep well.

624
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,120
That's why I'm doing this.

625
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,240
Since we need to be in contact anyway,
why don't we be closer?

626
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,919
But don't worry,
I'll only lie beside you.

627
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,679
I won't do anything too much.

628
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,640
I can stay in your house.

629
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,400
But I can't accept the fact...

630
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,000
that you want us to sleep together.

631
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,679
Even if we didn't do anything,

632
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,439
people will misunderstand...

633
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,039
our relationship too.

634
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,279
So, I'm sorry but I can't do it.

635
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,519
It's my fault,
I didn't consider everything.

636
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,400
I'll go to the guest room now.

637
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,400
What's wrong?

638
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:32,960
I'll finish it in the dining room.

639
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,640
Never mind.
You can take it with you.

640
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,680
I've put some tissues below it.

641
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,039
I won't spill it on the floor.

642
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:52,200
What's going on?

643
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,719
Sister, don't be angry.

644
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,600
-You must care for yourself.
-Shut up!

645
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,440
Didn't you say you were
in charge of everything?

646
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,719
And everything is OK as planning?

647
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,079
What is this then?

648
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:02,120
You were around
when we were negotiating...

649
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,440
with Xue Zi, right?

650
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,279
You heard her promises too.

651
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:06,920
Who knew that she'll...

652
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,640
fool us after that?

653
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,680
If Xue Zi can buy our shares,

654
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,999
of course she can buy
the shares of others too.

655
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,999
Sister, don't panic.

656
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,719
We still have a way...

657
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,120
to take back Yun Ma Artwork.

658
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,360
What's that?

659
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:24,360
The Yun Ma Artwork now,

660
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:26,239
is supported by three major factions.

661
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,840
The first is Xue Zi.

662
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,880
The second is me.

663
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,759
The third is Wei Qing.

664
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,079
If Wei Qing is willing to part...

665
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,759
some of his shares with me,

666
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,640
I just need around 3% of his shares,

667
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,079
by then, I will have
36% worth of shares.

668
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,719
I'll be the biggest shareholder by then.

669
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,279
Ask him to transfer some then.

670
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,279
It isn't that easy.

671
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,999
Wei Qing won't sell his shares
to us that easily.

672
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,039
In my opinion,

673
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,440
I think this is a trap
deployed by Wei Qing.

674
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,559
He and Xue Zi has some
unclarified connections.

675
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,799
I'm sure he asked Xue Zi
to buy all of the shares.

676
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,519
When that happens,
Yun Ma Artwork will belong to them.

677
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:02,479
And we're out of the game.

678
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,999
What should we do then?

679
00:36:05,999 --> 00:36:09,360
We can't just let them take
Yun Ma Artwork away, right?

680
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,160
How about this?

681
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,960
Let's test his intentions first.

682
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,799
We'll think of a solution after that.

683
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,840
What's wrong?

684
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,120
He's not answering.

685
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:38,680
Call him again.

686
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:46,711
[He Wei]

687
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,195
[He Wei]

688
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,714
[He Wei]

689
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,680
Why are you answering me so late?

690
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,239
Get straight to the point.

691
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,519
What do you plan to do with Xue Zi?

692
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:12,680
Since it came to this already,
what else can we do?

693
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,079
Stop pretending.

694
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:16,799
Now, we need to work together
to suppress Xue Zi.

695
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:19,120
Yun Ma Artwork is
your father's legacy, right?

696
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,880
Can you stand it
if someone else takes over it?

697
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,999
Transfer your shares to me then.

698
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,920
You know that's impossible.

699
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,319
I have nothing to discuss with you then.

700
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,120
Wei Qing, I have a limit to my patience.

701
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,319
I'm not begging for your help!
I'm trying to help you!

702
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,400
Honestly speaking,

703
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,079
I don't care if Yun Ma Artwork
belongs to someone else.

704
00:37:49,279 --> 00:37:50,960
I can still get the profit.

705
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,239
But it's different for you.

706
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,719
If Yun Ma Artwork
belongs to the Snow Group,

707
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,479
do you think Yun Ma Group
won't be affected by that?

708
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,239
If the base of a building collapses,

709
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,640
the whole building will fall apart.

710
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:01,999
And,

711
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,759
you always said that
you're a filial child, right?

712
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,920
Now it's the time for you to be filial.

713
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,519
If you transfer your shares to us,

714
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,960
maybe my sister will forgive you.

715
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,960
I can transfer the shares,

716
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
only if she's the one
negotiating with me.

717
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,400
What did he say?

718
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,360
He wanted to negotiate this
with you personally.

719
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:50,239
It's 3 a.m. already.
Why have you not slept?

720
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,559
What are you doing?

721
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,039
What is this?

722
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,039
It's Contra. Didn't you
play this before?

723
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,479
Brother, I'm sorry.

724
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,519
We're from two different ages.

725
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,799
I've never seen an antique game
like this before.

726
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,840
Play with me.

727
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,200
No, I want to sleep now.

728
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,079
Just for a while.

729
00:39:10,479 --> 00:39:11,920
How do you play this game?

730
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:13,999
Wait.

731
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,799
Let me set this to a two player mode.

732
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:18,440
Take this.

733
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,360
This is the directions.

734
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,319
This is the shoot button.
This is the jump button.

735
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:31,120
This is the block button.
This is the dodge button.

736
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,600
Come on.

737
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:36,960
Someone shot me!

738
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,200
Am I dead?

739
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,160
You're dumb!

740
00:39:49,239 --> 00:39:50,920
Don't you know how to avoid them?

741
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,120
It's my first time playing.

742
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:54,400
No, let's restart.

743
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,039
Why am I dead again?

744
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:16,880
I quit!

745
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:19,759
Don't move.

746
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,799
Why?

747
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:22,999
You must accompany me. I can't sleep.

748
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,600
But I didn't cause that.

749
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,160
Of course you caused it!

750
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:28,559
You didn't sleep with me.

751
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:31,759
What logic is that?

752
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,160
I don't care. I want to sleep.

753
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,079
You can't sleep.

754
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,400
It's either you sleep with me,

755
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,960
or nobody gets to sleep.

756
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,160
You!

757
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:44,799
How about this?

758
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,120
If you don't want to sleep
in the same bed with me,

759
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,360
we can sleep on the sofa.

760
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,319
We've slept like that
in the past, right?

761
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,719
Is that okay with you?

762
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,600
Okay, it's decided then.

763
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:55,519
Take your blanket.

764
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,239
If not, nobody gets to sleep.

765
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,719
Despicable!

766
00:41:01,799 --> 00:41:03,960
Don't go and lock yourself
in the guest room.

767
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,600
This is my house.

768
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:08,039
I can open every door in this house.

769
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,600
Hooligan!

770
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,960
You're back? That is fast.

771
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,719
Did you take a bath already?

772
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,920
Of course. You can smell me if you want.

773
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,920
Fine.

774
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,960
Good night.

775
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,279
Good night.

776
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:41,759
We haven't turn off the lights.
Let me turn them off.

777
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,759
No need.

778
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,200
Lights out.

779
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:48,239
That is amazing.
