I don't have time to eat.

Then don't eat then.

143

Remember to fast until
the feast tomorrow night.

What period?

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,239
Every month, women will
experience changes...

148
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,999
in their bodies for a few days
due to body's oestrogen.

149
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,439
Sometimes, measurements might increase.

150
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,760
Especially the part below
the neck and above the waist.

151

This is for you.

156

Such confidence.
Have you memorised them by heart?

157

I ate and drank nothing

158
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,359
All I did was memorising them.

159
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,119
Ask away.
I'll admit defeat if I can't answer.

160

161

All the people on this list
are unimportant.

00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,320
Her Chinese name is Xue Zi.

166
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,479
She's the secret guest
of this event and...

167
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:39,160
the reason why I'll attend the event.

168
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,439
Unfortunately, she is not on the list.

169
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,999
And there isn't much
that I know about her.

170
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,439
She is not on the list? How am I
going to look out for her then?

171
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,799
What's the fastest way
to find the answer...

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,359
when you are faced with unknown?

173
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,599
Elimination.

174
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:59,119
You want me to memorise the guests'
information in order to find her?

175
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,799
Can't you do it yourself?

176
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,320
I'll get a headache if I do that.

177
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,439
Besides, I have to deal with He Wei.

178
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:08,320
I won't be able to handle that.

179
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,880
Your brain power is not that good
but your eyes are not bad, right?

180
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,320
What are you doing?

181
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:17,599
Looks like you've really
worked hard yesterday.

182
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,280
You even have dark circles.

183
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,799
Let go.

184
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,599
This is bad.

185
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:24,239
What's bad?

186
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,679
You face.

187
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,400
I know I'm ugly.
Thank you for reminding me.

188
00:10:29,599 --> 00:10:33,080
Who said that you are ugly? I just
think that you need to be polished.

189
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,599
Let's go. I'll find you
a good makeup artist...

190
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,919
to add more foundations.

191
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,640
And let's change you out
from your tasteless clothes.

192
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:46,039
Good day, Chairman.

193
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:49,039
Give her a full-body spa treatment
first and then the makeup.

194
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,919
Don't worry. Everything is
ready just like what you've asked.

195
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,200
This way please, Miss Zhou.

196
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,880
Spa? This is too grand.

197
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,479
It's fine. This way please.

198
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,599
It's fine. This way please.

199
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,119
Sit down.

200
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,479
This is too over.

201
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,999
I need to do a full body spa
before my makeup?

202
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,400
Since you have to put on makeup,
of course you have to get clean first.

203
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:15,720
Do I have to get such
a thorough cleaning?

204
00:11:16,479 --> 00:11:19,679
Forget it. Where's the makeup artist?
I have to get makeup on, right?

205
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,239
I'm already here.

206
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,520
You?

207
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,679
You know how to apply makeup?

208
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,960
You don't have any strange hobby, right?

209
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,960
What are you thinking?

210
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,239
When I was in America, I've always
seen people putting on makeup.

211
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:45,119
Although I've never done it before,

212
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,239
it should be the same as painting.

213
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,479
Just that it's on a face.

214
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,200
You will be my first creation.

215
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,520
First?

216
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,239
Then, I'm now a lab rat.

217
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,520
Shut up.

218
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm going to start now.

219
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:13,640
So many gowns.

220
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,039
This is the exclusive dressing room for
Wei family's female members.

221
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,960
Wei family...

222
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,039
really loves hoarding
and displaying things.

223
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,840
Even your dressing room
is like a museum.

224
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:27,080
So many dresses.
How long will it take to try them on?

225
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,239
I can't try them all
even if there are 100 me.

226
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:31,239
Who asked to try them all?

227
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,320
This is too gorgeous.

228
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
It doesn't suit me at all.

229
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,080
We should try a plain-looking one.

230
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,520
I know better whether
it suits you or not.

231
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:52,880
Miss Zhou.

232
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,119
♪ It isn't like me ♪

233
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,479
♪ It's like you instead ♪

234
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,119
♪ The hot weather is annoying ♪

235
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,400
♪ My mood is like the rain ♪

236
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,080
♪ It may be cloudy or sunny like you ♪

237
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,880
I'll get out from the car
with you later.

238
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,119
No need to be nervous.

239
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,760
I already talked with the media here.

240
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:26,880
They'll delete your photos
when they draft the news.

241
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,280
So, don't worry about
being photographed.

242
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,439
Zhou Shi, are you listening?

243
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,320
You are so useless.

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,559
It's painful. What are you doing?

245
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,960
It's just a red carpet.

246
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,520
Do you need to be so nervous?

247
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,760
Is this the same as
taking your food delivery?

248
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,559
This is not something common.

249
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,439
I'm here. What are you afraid of?

250
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,919
It's troublesome because you are here.

251
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,119
I'm used to a rough life.

252
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,640
Coming here is already very strange.

253
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,439
And I'm speechless with how I'm dressed.

254
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Do you think you are ugly?

255
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,160
Am I not?

256
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,119
You took it seriously?

257
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:12,479
Let me tell you then.

258
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,439
You are very beautiful today.

259
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,640
No. You are stunning today.

260
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,520
I rarely compliment others.

261
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,359
But you deserve the compliment today.

262
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:24,559
Really?

263
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:26,400
Yes.

264
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:30,479
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

265
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,559
Look. That is Wei Qing's car.

266
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,999
-Wei Qing is here!
-Quick!

267
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:53,280
Don't fall down.

268
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,200
If you fall down here,

269
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,080
you'll make the headline for sure.

270
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,840
Chairman Wei.
Is this your new girlfriend?

271
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:04,919
Haven't you talked to them
about not photographing me?

272
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,280
Don't worry. They are just some
who slipped through the net.

273
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,559
I know which firm they are from.
Don't worry.

274
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,439
You just need to follow me until here.

275
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,080
Do you still remember the
guest list you memorised?

276
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,280
I won't stay here for too long.

277
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,280
I'll greet those I know,

278
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,200
go through the event
and then I'll leave.

279
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,400
Use this time to help me confirm...

280
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,200
whether or not Xue Zi is here.

281
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:02,599
Contact me as soon as you see her.
Can you do that?

282
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,239
One more thing.

283
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,880
The eyes of the people here are more
poisonous than the paparazzi's.

284
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,479
If you don't want to be
the female lead for gossips,

285
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,200
pay more attention then.

286
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,119
So annoying.

287
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,720
Chairman Wei. Welcome.

288
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,720
The beauty who is wearing
the vintage gown by Dior...

289
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,320
is your new girlfriend, right?

290
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,080
He looks familiar.

291
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,160
I think he's He Wei's assistant.

292
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,520
You've been following me sneakily...

293
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,559
from the moment I stepped
on the red carpet.

294
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:39,919
What do you want?

295
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,999
I'm so hungry. I better
get something to eat first.

296
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,919
Chairman Wei. You are a smart man.

297
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,200
For you who are naturally
a hot-searched item.

298
00:16:51,359 --> 00:16:52,840
Rather than sneaking a photo of you,

299
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,760
it's better to drop a hint
for you instead.

300
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:56,760
We can have more public appearances...

301
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,559
and increase our popularity too, right?
So, why not?

302
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,200
Sure. I'll accept Xue Zi's
schedule in exchange.

303
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,640
About this...

304
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
I really can't tell you.

305
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,839
Our editor had warned us very strictly.

306
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,999
I'll lose my job if I tell you.

307
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,079
I don't need a solid answer.

308
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,719
I just need you to
nod or shake your head.

309
00:17:17,719 --> 00:17:19,680
Is Xue Zi here?

310
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,839
For the thing you want,
I'll ask my assistant...

311
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,479
to send the draft to you.

312
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,440
You just need to publish it.

313
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,239
But don't overdo it.

314
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:32,239
Don't worry.

315
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,040
They are all people on the list.

316
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,760
Looks like Xue Zi is not here.

317
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,239
-I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.
-It's fine.

318
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,719
-I'm sorry.
-Stop cleaning me up.

319
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
Don't dirty your beautiful dress.

320
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:07,520
Could it be that...

321
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,760
she is...

322
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:22,839
Where is she? She's is gone so fast.

323
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,999
How am I going to find her
in such a huge place?

324
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,959
Wait. Do you need my help?

325
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:30,560
No need. Thank you.

326
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
Wait.

327
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:34,079
The dress you are wearing...

328
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:36,719
is the Haute Couture dress
from a brand 10 years ago.

329
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,479
As far as I know, only one person
in China has ever worn it.

330
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,160
That is, Wei Qing's mother,

331
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,560
my sister.

332
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:45,760
So, what's your relationship
with Wei Qing?

333
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,400
Where did Zhou Shi go?

334
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,719
You are indeed here.

335
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,520
This dress looks good.

336
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,319
And the handwork is exquisite.

337
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,880
It's suitable for someone elegant.

338
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,719
Unfortunately,
you're the one wearing it.

339
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,479
But luckily, you are not
the only one who has it.

340
00:19:24,479 --> 00:19:26,760
I think it's more suitable
to the lady over there.

341
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

342
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,239
Please excuse me.

343
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,319
At least this'll do until
you go to the dressing room.

344
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,479
Thank you.

345
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:29,239
I'm sorry. Please let me through.

346
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,400
Xue...

347
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,999
Are you alright, lady?

348
00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:38,719
I'm fine. It's just a small matter.

349
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,199
Thanks to this sir over here.

350
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,359
It's just something trifle.
Don't mention it.

351
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,119
But it's too bad for this dress.

352
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,560
I was worried about wearing
the same dress as others.

353
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,199
Now, it's resolved.

354
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,160
I'm really sorry, Miss Xue.

355
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,880
We've slipped up...

356
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,400
and put you under the spotlight.

357
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,280
Who is the man just now?

358
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,760
He is Wei Heng's son, Wei Qing.

359
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,520
He is chairman of Yun Ma Group,
the one you wanted to visit.

360
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,319
So, it's him.

361
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,400
-Are you Wei Qing's new girlfriend?
-No.

362
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,959
-Then, you are his toy.
-Toy?

363
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:20,999
Looks like it's true.

364
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,079
Poor child.

365
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,400
You are just another front for Wei Qing.

366
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,800
It has been so many years.
He's still not bored with this game.

367
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,839
What's the difference
between both of them?

368
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,319
Has he ever told you to...

369
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:34,599
stay within reach so that...

370
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
he can reach you anytime?

371
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:37,880
It's confirmed then.

372
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,800
When he needs woman...

373
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,239
or doesn't want to
waste time in a relationship,

374
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,479
he'll find a front to fool the public.

375
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,719
Then, he'll let her stand
under the limelight.

376
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,479
He'll create an illusion that...

377
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,040
he's always sought after.

378
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:52,079
And then, he'll be with them...

379
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,400
until he gets bored with them.

380
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,599
When the time comes,
he'll have a new woman.

381
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,920
Usually, it won't last
more than half a month.

382
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,680
My advice is, you better be prepared.

383
00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:02,880
Or else, he can throw you away anytime.

384
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,800
Isn't that great?

385
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,719
What did you say?

386
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,040
What has it got to do with me?

387
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,400
-I don't want to be his girlfriend.
-Then, why are you with him?

388
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,760
Money. What else?

389
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,800
You are quite honest.

390
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,079
His previous girlfriends
always said that it's true love.

391
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,599
In the end, they are just here
for the money.

392
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,560
But...

393
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,640
with your appearance,

394
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,079
looks like he has been
celibate for too long.

395
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,800
Why would he choose
a plain woman like you?

396
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,359
Let go of her.

397
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,319
Chairman Wei. Aren't you tired
from standing here for so long?

398
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,319
Looks like old habit dies hard.

399
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,959
You still like to talk to
other's girlfriend here.

400
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:48,479
Aren't you afraid of your safety?

401
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,719
Why would I be afraid?

402
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,319
See. I've told you so.

403
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:02,239
Uncle. You never listen
about other's advice.

404
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,520
In the end, you'll be the one
to suffer losses.

405
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,959
-Apologise to my uncle now.
-No.

406
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,719
I can't believe this child.

407
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm sorry, uncle.

408
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,560
She is spoiled by me until
she has quite a temper.

409
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,520
But hear me out.

410
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,920
You better don't offend her next time.

411
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:24,040
Or else, it might not be just...

412
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:25,719
a punch to the face.

413
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,079
Looks like you are quite close.

414
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,959
But young lady,

415
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,239
Don't you want to know why
Wei Qing chose you?

416
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,839
-This is your biggest doubt, right?
-I...

417
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,280
No need to trouble yourself for this.

418
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,760
We'll solve our issues on our own.

419
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,160
Let's go. There's no need
to stay here anymore.

420
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,680
-We have more important things to do.
-Where are we going?

421
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,560
Where are we going?

422
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:51,680
You are exhausted.

423
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,280
So naughty.

424
00:23:57,959 --> 00:23:59,119
Let's go, darling.

425
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,400
What is it? You are still mad?

426
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:19,599
I already told you, right?

427
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,359
I have no choice just now.

428
00:24:21,479 --> 00:24:23,239
So, I can only act in front of him.

429
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,719
Moreover,
I just carried you for a while.

430
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,839
Your performance tonight is not too bad.

431
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:31,160
You passed but just barely.

432
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:33,279
[Target, woman, 25-26 years old]
[Long brown hair]

433
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,360
[White dress, silver heels]

434
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:36,920
Please excuse me.

435
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,839
Thank you.

436
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,599
You managed to send me that message...

437
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,160
and not Xue Zi owes me one.

438
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,640
It's considered the
biggest gain for tonight.

439
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,880
I'll transfer money to
your account tomorrow.

440
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,479
Really?

441
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,800
But the money
will be transferred from...

442
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,760
your account to Yun Ma's account
to pay off the debt.

443
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,479
Don't be so negative.

444
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,119
Life is still long.

445
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,160
If you can perform so well every time,

446
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,520
Maybe you can really...

447
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,560
pay off your debt before you reach 60.

448
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,520
There's indeed a followup.

449
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,959
Luckily they blurred my face.

450
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,999
There are so many drafts.

451
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,079
But none of them showed
my face from the front.

452
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:44,040
It's indeed watertight.

453
00:25:55,479 --> 00:25:57,079
I'm the one who came here first.

454
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,400
Brat! Don't you know about ladies first?

455
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:08,079
It's urgent. Give me 20 minutes.

456
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,719
20 minutes?

457
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,560
Do you have flowers or fish inside?

458
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,040
Listen. I'll give you five minutes.

459
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,319
If you don't come out,
I'll kick down the door.

460
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Hello, Miss Zhou.

461
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:35,920
-Miss Zhou, this way please.
-Why are you here?

462
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:39,599
-This way please.
-What are you doing?

463
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:41,079
Get into the car first.

464
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,839
Where are we going?

465
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,999
I'm asking you. Where are we going?

466
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,880
Have you gotten the gift?
Do you like it?

467
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,119
It's alright.

468
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,040
But what's the meaning of this gift?
We already broke up.

469
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,599
You want me to take
a look at your new girlfriend?

470
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,560
Don't be mad at me.

471
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,040
I was wrong before this.

472
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:23,440
You are a fairy.

473
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,280
Please forgive a useless man like me.

474
00:27:26,199 --> 00:27:28,640
Give me another chance.

475
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:32,440
I won't be that easy.
I'll have to see your performance.

476
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,040
What about the man last night?

477
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,959
He's my fallback guy.

478
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,359
Do you really think that
no one is pursuing me?

479
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,680
Fine. You are pretty and
you are always right, okay?

480
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:44,239
I've reserved a table tonight.

481
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:46,999
I'll pick you up tonight.
Let's meet at our usual place.

482
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,719
Alright then.

483
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,640
She is so easy to coax.

484
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,319
I just need to give her a bag.

485
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,719
Gao Yang?

486
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,319
You know me, pretty lady?

487
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,239
I'm Zhou Shi. Fei Fei's friend.

488
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,999
What, you are that unrefined...

489
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:16,959
Why do you look like a different person?

490
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,079
Plastic surgery?

491
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,479
I have things to do. See you later.

492
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,719
Zhou Shi?

493
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,599
She is sitting on
Zhou Shi's place right?

494
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,599
Don't tell me that
this beauty is Zhou Shi.

495
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,359
I think it's really her.

496
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,199
Oh my goodness.

497
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,839
So, she is actually so pretty.

498
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,079
I've been in the same class
as her for almost three years.

499
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,160
Was I looking at a fake all these time?

500
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,040
Where has that rough
and unpolished girl gone?

501
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,359
She is so beautiful that
it's against the law.

502
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,800
Is it too late to pursue her now?

503
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,680
She doesn't have boyfriend, right?

504
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,920
Zhang Shuai.
You have more competitors now.

505
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,999
It has nothing to do with me.

506
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,959
I'm not the same as you guys.

507
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:31,800
Why do I have to endure this?

508
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:34,959
Luckily, Brother Ming Cheng
couldn't see me like this.

509
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,880
Zhou Shi. Somebody is looking for you.

510
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,839
Brother Ming Cheng!

511
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,999
Brother Ming Cheng!

512
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,280
I really didn't plan to wear like this.

513
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,359
Do you know a girl named Bi Qiu Jing?

514
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,599
Yes. She is my roommate.

515
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,560
She went to look for you
in the board room before.

516
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,160
It's indeed her.

517
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,640
What's wrong with her?

518
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,599
Where will she be usually?

519
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,839
She'll either be at home
or in the library.

520
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,959
Brother Ming Cheng. You are leaving now?

521
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,760
Send me her contact later.

522
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:29,959
Why is your hair like this?

523
00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:31,560
Straighten it back.

524
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,959
You are wearing so little
and you are so exposed.

525
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,079
-Get changed as soon as possible.
-Alright.

526
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:39,560
Wipe off the makeup on your face.

527
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,280
Wait.

528
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,199
This will be saved as dark history.

529
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,079
Don't put on makeup
like this ever again.

530
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:51,319
At least don't do it in front of me,
understand?

531
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:52,880
Understood.

532
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,520
So, Brother Ming Cheng is still
paying attention to me.

533
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,400
At least this is a gain by misfortune.

534
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,199
What is this?

535
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,680
Invitation card from Xue Zi.

536
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:12,680
She returned temporarily this time
just to inspect the China's market.

537
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,400
She'll be going back to America soon.

538
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,680
Before going back,

539
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,400
she is going to hold
a small salon party.

540
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,239
She has specially invited you.

541
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,760
She said she is thinking of
collaborating with Yun Ma Jewellery.

542
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,560
How many will be there.

543
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,520
Around 20 to 30 people.

544
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:31,999
They are all celebrities in both
art and fashion world.

545
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,479
Reject the invitation.

546
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:37,040
Say that I'm thankful
for her generous invitation...

547
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,760
but my schedule is packed.

548
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,599
Alright.

549
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:43,239
She is eager to pay me back.

550
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,880
But I purposely don't want
to let her do that.

551
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,119
Have you checked her preference yet?

552
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
Xue Zi is a low-key person.

553
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,400
She frequents...

554
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,199
the gallery and the auction house.

555
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,160
But she particularly loves...

556
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,760
Xun Ran's works.

557
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,599
Before this, Xun Ran's painting
was auctioned out at a high price.

558
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,239
And Xue Zi seems to be the buyer.

559
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:10,959
Xun Ran.

560
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,520
He is really loved by many.

561
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,800
But lately, he hasn't been producing
any new paintings, right?

562
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,560
He doesn't do it often.

563
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,719
His latest painting is the
'Starry Sky' a few years back.

564
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,280
Send the 'Mountain
Gallery Hotel' painting...

565
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,839
that is in our collection to Xue Zi.

566
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,640
Considered it as an apology for not
being able to attend her party.

567
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:33,359
And it'll be a farewell gift as well.

568
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,760
-Alright. I'll get it done now.
-By the way,

569
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:38,680
about our collaboration,

570
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,520
tell her that we'll talk in details
when she comes back next time.

571
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,760
I never thought that
there'll be a day...

572
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,920
where I have to use that guy's painting
as a stepping-stone.

573
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,359
What is it? You don't like it?

574
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,999
This is not about liking it or not.

575
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:17,599
Why do I have to eat salad
while you get the meat?

576
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,800
Do you think it's so easy
to stay by my side?

577
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,599
You just barely passed last night.

578
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,199
I've asked someone to increase
the size of that gown.

579
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:29,520
Or else, do you really think you can
fit into that red carpet gown?

580
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:32,599
Yes. I'm a worthless person.

581
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,400
Thank you for taking the trouble.

582
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:37,319
I didn't plan to please you anyway.

583
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,560
What did you say?

584
00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:40,239
I said,

585
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:43,920
I will do my best from now on...

586
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,040
to fulfil your demand
even if I starve to death.

587
00:33:48,479 --> 00:33:50,079
By the way, from now on,

588
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:52,479
besides dining in formal events,

589
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,880
you need to be within reach
all the time.

590
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
What is it? You are not happy with it?

591
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,599
No. It's good as long as you are happy.

592
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:15,000
What class are we having today?

593
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,440
Aren't you the future mistress
of Yun Ma, Zhou Shi?

594
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,640
What is it? Are you going
to forget about us...

595
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:26,720
now that you got into a rich family?

596
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,640
That's right.

597
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:29,920
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

598
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,079
You've moved out from the hostel
for so long. Can't we have a chat?

599
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
This dress looks expensive.

600
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:39,279
I think I've only seen this on Weibo.

601
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:42,160
I think it's the latest dress this year.

602
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:44,400
How much is it? Is it authentic?

603
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,599
Of course. Her boyfriend
is the chairman of Yun Ma.

604
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,079
Of course she is different from us.

605
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,839
You are right?

606
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:54,680
Are you done? I'll be leaving now
if you are done.

607
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,640
Look at you. Why did you bang into me?

608
00:35:58,759 --> 00:36:00,680
You can't wash this off easily, right?

609
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
Who said I'm going to wash it?

610
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,079
I don't like this dress anyway.

611
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,160
Thank you for giving me
a reason to throw it away.

612
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,359
What happened to your dress?

613
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:17,640
I'm fine.

614
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,279
What's there to be proud of?

615
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,119
She really thinks that she's
living in a high society now.

616
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,920
We need to show everybody...

617
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:29,720
her true colours.

618
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,720
Zhou Shi, I think you should...

619
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,640
go back and rest for a while.

620
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:54,400
Come back to class only
after everything has died down.

621
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,559
-Teacher, I...
-It's alright, Zhou Shi.

622
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,200
I know what you want to say.

623
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,279
It's fine to be in a relationship.

624
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,519
It's just that your partner
is too famous.

625
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,160
With the comments on the internet,

626
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:07,039
it's normal for everybody
to exaggerate it.

627
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,160
-But we are...
-No buts, Zhou Shi.

628
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,200
This is not easy for you.

629
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,559
It's stressful to have
a famous partner, right?

630
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,079
Listen to me. Go back and rest well.

631
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,440
Don't think too much.

632
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,519
I'll have a talk with Chairman Wei.

633
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,839
Let the university handle this.
Don't worry.

634
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,400
Go home.

635
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:47,720
Zhang Shuai.

636
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,599
Assistant An.

637
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,880
I already talked with the media.

638
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,079
That article is considered as
a breach of personal privacy.

639
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:16,440
I think it'll be taken down very soon.

640
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,359
Although it's a bit sudden,

641
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:22,119
it has not escalated quickly.

642
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:24,559
Now, it's still under control.

643
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,960
Yun Ma's Public Relations Department
is now cleaning up...

644
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,640
the attacks on you from
the internet comment section.

645
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,119
We'll minimise the damage to the lowest.

646
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,880
Got it.

647
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,519
But since it already happened,

648
00:38:37,759 --> 00:38:40,240
chairman has asked me
to apologise to you...

649
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,359
in his stead.

650
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,400
You can request anything you want.

651
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,920
I have a question.

652
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,799
-Why is it me?
-What?

653
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,720
Your chairman is a public figure.

654
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,200
As long as I stay by his side,

655
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,200
things like this will happen
sooner or later.

656
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,880
But I don't understand.

657
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,599
Why did he choose me?

658
00:38:56,759 --> 00:38:58,319
Although I have an agreement with him,

659
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:01,039
why do I have to be his female partner?

660
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,960
What can he benefit from that?

661
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,359
I'm sorry. I can't answer your question.

662
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:09,240
Forget it.

663
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,640
I don't have the rights to ask anyway.

664
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,720
Where are we going now?

665
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,680
You'll accompany the chairman
to meet a well-known designer.

666
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm back.

667
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,240
Why did you dress up like that?

668
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,119
Get up.

669
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,599
Don't just throw it here.
This is expensive. What if you spoil it?

670
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,480
I'll throw it away then. Ask that
useless man to deduct my money.

671
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,559
I won't be able to pay him back anyway.

672
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,480
Who cares about this money?

673
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,440
Who is that useless man? Your boss?

674
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,519
How much do you owe him
until he torture you like this?

675
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,920
I owe him a lot.

676
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,319
What a bad luck.

677
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:11,279
I must have offended the
God of Wealth in my previous life.

678
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,640
That's why I'm so poor in this life.

679
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,240
-How much do you owe him?
-If it's a few thousands, I can help.

680
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:18,680
-I can just sell my bags.
-I can help too.

681
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:21,400
I have a lot of money
left from my scholarship.

682
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,000
I have nowhere to spend.

683
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,920
You are like my real sisters.

684
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,640
But I owe him too much.

685
00:40:29,799 --> 00:40:31,160
You won't be able to help.

686
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,599
I have money. How much do you want?

687
00:40:36,759 --> 00:40:38,559
How boastful you are.

688
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:42,559
How much money can you have when you
are eating and drinking here for free?

689
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,880
I'll give this to you.
Spend it however you like.

690
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,559
Xiao Fei.

691
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,960
You really have private savings.

692
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,480
But I forgot the passcode.

693
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:01,839
Xiao Fei. I'm grateful that
you are willing to help.

694
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,279
But I can't take your money.

695
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,039
And you won't believe it
even if I tell you.

696
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:10,119
I don't even know how much I owe him.

697
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,480
The amount I owe him
is increasing every day.

698
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,240
I don't even dare to look.

699
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:19,240
I'll be staying like this forever.
Thank you though.

700
00:41:20,039 --> 00:41:23,200
I won't go to class these few days.
Don't bother to wake me up.

701
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,000
Why isn't she going to class?

702
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,799
You didn't read it on Weibo?

703
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,799
She has been the hot search
these few days.

704
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,920
I think the university asked her
to stop taking class because of bad influence.

705
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,960
She really owes money to someone?

706
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,559
And from what she said, it's a lot.

707
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,559
Could it be from the loan shark?

708
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,759
I don't know.

709
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,640
But from what she said, her creditor...

710
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,400
is someone who's ruthless and cruel.

711
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:57,920
If this goes on,
I think Zhou Shi is going to be doomed.

712
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:07,400
Help me.
