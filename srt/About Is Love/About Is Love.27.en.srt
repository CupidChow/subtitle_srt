00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
Who is knocking at the door
so early in the morning?

30
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,960
What do you want?

31
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,960
Excuse me.

32
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,919
Zhou Shi!

33
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:29,840
Why are you here looking for Zhou Shi?

34
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,560
I couldn't sleep,
I need her to keep me company.

35
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,240
You want her company.

36
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
What?

37
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,479
She has been sleeping with me lately.

38
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,599
Without her,
I couldn't get used to it.

39
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,000
Where is she now?

40
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,919
Zhou Shi?

41
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,359
She went out looking for material.

42
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:48,800
Looking for material?

43
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,039
Why didn't she tell me?
Where did she go?

44
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:52,039
She didn't say.

45
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,039
When did she leave?

46
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,879
Earlier this morning.

47
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,560
Don't bother calling her.
She must be sleeping right now.

48
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,280
-Who is with her now?
-The people from her course.

49
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,479
He is with her too?

50
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,199
Friends from her course?

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,280
Zhang Shuai is with them too?

52
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,280
He is the leader.

53
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,919
Wait!

54
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,639
Are you seriously going after her?

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,919
Why not?

56
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,359
Wait!

57
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,479
What now?

58
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,400
Didn't you tell us you are a
friend receiving her treatment?

59
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,359
Why would you care so much about
where she is?

60
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
Don't you think you are too nosy?

61
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,680
As you said, she is giving me treatment.

62
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,120
She went missing without
telling me beforehand.

63
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,079
Shouldn't I be looking for her?

64
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,759
Indeed.

65
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,400
Don't tell her I am going after her.

66
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,560
We won't.

67
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,879
Don't worry, she won't know.

68
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,520
-He likes her.
-He likes her.

69
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,720

71
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:32,159
Why didn't you answer my calls?

72
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,759
I am sorry, the phone
is on silent mode.

73
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,759
It's okay, let's go to the inn.

74
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,199
Let's go.

75

Brother Ming Cheng.

80

Shi Shi, where are you now?

81
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,199
Wei Qing asked you to call me?

82
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,159
No, you wasn't here in the office
when I arrived this morning.

83
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,039
I took a leave to go out
for material search.

84
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:59,599
Liar, I didn't give her the permission.

85
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,280
Ask her where she is.

86
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,240
Shi Shi, where are you collecting
the material?

87
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,280
An old town next to Ninghai.

88
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,240
Okay, I'll hang up now.

89
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,039
Zhou Shi, how was it?
Did you get everything ready?

90
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,359
I am almost done.

91
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,680
I am sorry, they ran out of room.

92
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,639
I am sorry but you need to sleep
on the small bed.

93
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,000
It's nothing, I was late anyway.

94
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,479
Shi Shi.

95
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,479
Are you on the phone?

96
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,479
Brother Ming Cheng,
is there anything else?

97
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,879
That's all from me.
I am hanging up now.

98
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,319
Is it ready?

99
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,440
I am starving, let's get some food.

100
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,959
Brother Ming Cheng, I have  to go.
I'll talk to you later.

101
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,800
-Okay.

No.

Yes.

109
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,599
Hello.

110
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,240
-Is there any vacancy?
-No.

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,080
-Please, help me out.
-I told you...

112
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Get a fine hotel nearby.

113
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,640
Other than the students here,

114
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,320
relocate all your customers there.

115
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:55,039
I will pay them double the
price as compensation.

116
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,080
Sir, what do you want?

117
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,080
The feng shui here is great.

118
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,760
So, can it be done?

119
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,440
-Come on.
-Here you are, you must be tired.

120
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,760
Not at all.
The scenery here is amazing.

121
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,880
Of course it is.

122
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,599
You must be art students.

123
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, we study fine arts.

124
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,080
You look so pretty,
you are even great at drawing.

125
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,519
Look at how handsome this young man is.

126
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,200
This girl here is adorable.

127
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,719
Thank you, madam. We will be going
if there is nothing else.

128
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,399
Yes, I have good news for all of you.

129
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,839
What is it?

130
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,760
You people are getting lucky today.

131
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,760
You are just in time
for our anniversary.

132
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,120
I upgraded all of your rooms to suites.

133
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,320
But you said there is no vacancy
this morning.

134
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,479
You could only give us extra beds.

135
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,240
Which is why you are so lucky.

136
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,959
A bunch of customers
checked out this morning.

137
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,800
So, I upgraded your package for free.

138
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,519
That is enough talking,
let me show you the rooms.

139
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,880
Come with me.

140
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
An upgrade?

141
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:18,320
That sounds all too familiar.

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,479
Please, come inside.

143
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,039
This way.

144
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,719
It's so pretty.

145
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,640
It is very nice indeed.
This is the best suite we have.

146
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
I changed the sheet for you too.

147
00:11:38,479 --> 00:11:39,880
Relax while you are here.

148
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,440
-Thank you so much for this.
-You are welcome.

149
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,680
Rest well, I shall leave you be.

150
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,120
-See you.
-Goodbye.

151
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,880
The bed is so soft!

152
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Do you like it?

153
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,919
Why are you here?

154
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,240
Just because you left secretly
doesn't mean I can't find you.

155
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,359
You! You are so despicable!

156
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,440
You used Brother Ming Cheng
for your bidding!

157
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:12,599
You left me without even
saying goodbye?

158
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,479
This is a programme for my course,
why can't I come out?

159
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,719
Why did you leave in a hurry
and didn't tell me?

160
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,359
I have been tired lately.

161
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,839
I wanted to relax, okay?

162
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,399
Sure.

163
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,519
I am tired too. Let's relax together.

164
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,560
I came out here because I want
to stay away from you.

165
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:35,440
Why would you want to stay
away from me?

166
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,080
I've been under a lot of pressure.

167
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,599
Your condition became worse
because of the cat.

168
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,680
I blame myself for that.

169
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,359
I am afraid of making another mistake.
So I came here to clear my thoughts.

170
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,760
Why didn't you tell me you
are under a lot of pressure?

171
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,200
Don't you know I would never
blame you for the accident?

172
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:56,839
I blame myself because you weren't
even mad at me!

173
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,919
Don't worry, I will get back on my feet.

174
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,599
It won't get in the way
of the treatment.

175
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:04,760
The treatment can wait.

176
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,279
We can take it slowly.

177
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:09,039
No, it needs to be done.

178
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Why?

179
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,560
Because that is the only way...

180
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,760
we can both get back to
our normal lives.

181
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,399
You mean...

182
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,080
treating me is affecting your life?

183
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,479
No.

184
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,560
Maybe a little.

185
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
I am sorry.

186
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,719
It must be bothersome for you.

187
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,880
-It's not that bad.
-I will go back tomorrow.

188
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:43,959
Very well.

189
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,919
Right.

190
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,760
Don't stay in my room for the night.

191
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:52,599
Back in my home, Fei Fei and
my senior are good friends.

192
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,080
They know me well.

193
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,599
But all my classmates are here.

194
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Fair enough.
I will stay in the room next door.

195
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,560
Is there anything else?

196
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,640
No.

197
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,320
Zhou Shi?

198
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,320
-Senior?
-Wei Qing?

199
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,200
Xiao Fei, have a bite.

200
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
Here.

201
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Thank you.

202
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,320
Not at all.

203
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,080
Zhang Shuai, try the food.

204
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,479
You can go back to the room
if you are not used to the food here.

205
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,800
You don't need to do this.

206
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,479
It's nothing. The food is great.

207
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,599
Assistant An?

208
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,320
Why don't you take the Chairman
back to the hotel?

209
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,399
Wei An, get back to your seat.

210
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,640
You don't need to do this.

211
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,359
What do you want?

212
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:34,120
I want to be with you.

213
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,680
We need to talk outside.

214
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,599
We'll talk outside.

215
00:15:57,599 --> 00:16:00,599
Why force yourself if you
can't eat the food?

216
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,399
You want me be healed as soon as possible,
I am cooperating.

217
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:07,880
You don't have to force yourself
if you don't want to treat me.

218
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,959
You may leave anytime you want
and get back to your life.

219
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,680
I thought you don't hate me anymore.

220
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,279
I never expect you to
push yourself so hard.

221
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,279
I am not pushing myself.

222
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:27,240
-I am just scared.
-Of what?

223
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:32,680
I am scared that if the line
of our relationship is blurred,

224
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,279
something could go wrong.

225
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,599
What could possibly go wrong?

226
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,560
Our relationship is perfectly fine.

227
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,000
Tell me what our
relationship is about.

228
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,200
Are we friends?

229
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:47,519
Or is it as simple as
patient and healer?

230
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,479
Or are we in love?

231
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,120
In love?

232
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,640
You are being paranoid.

233
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,640
I am being paranoid.

234
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,680
So can you please tell me
what our relationship really is?

235
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,239
It's as simple as patient and healer.

236
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,119
That is all? There is nothing else?

237
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,720
Why are you laughing? What is so funny?

238
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,239
Of course it's funny.

239
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,720
You went through so much
because you are afraid?

240
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,680
Did you use the cat...

241
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,440
because of that same reason?

242
00:17:26,639 --> 00:17:27,680
Yes.

243
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:30,600
We have known each other for so long,

244
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,680
don't you have any
special feeling for me?

245
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:38,200
Do you have feelings for me?

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,680
Yes.

247
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,440
Listen carefully.

248
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:45,999
I don't.

249
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,879
I have always seen you as a friend.

250
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,960
Even if we had any intimate contact,

251
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,960
it's only ever for the treatment.

252
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,560
If I caused any confusion,

253
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,519
I apologize for that.

254
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,399
Is there anything else?

255
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,519
Nothing.

256
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:13,519
If there is no other questions from you,

257
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:15,840
you may go back to your meal.

258
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,759
I will take a walk outside.

259
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,999
Maybe...

260
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:29,680
I wish to spend some time alone.

261
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:50,440
I wish to spend some time alone.

262
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,119

Tell me what our relationship is about.

00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,800
Or is it as simple as
patient and healer?

269
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:37,759
Or are we in love?

270

In love?

271
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,759
You are being paranoid.

272
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,039
I am being paranoid.

273
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:48,800
So can you please tell me
what our relationship really is?

274

278
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,399
Sherry.

279
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I am Wei Qing.

280
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,039
Shouldn't a handsome man like you
be in a bar?

281
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:25,039
Why are you sitting
here all by yourself?

282
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,440
Or did you meet enough
pretty ladies just now?

283
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:29,200
Are you taking a break here?

284
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,759
What if I tell you
I am waiting for my prey?

285
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,200
-So, did you get your prey?
-Only if the prey bites the bait.

286
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:52,720
The hunter will be become the prey
if he backs out in the last minute.

287
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:14,800
What's wrong?
Is it you or is it my problem?

288
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,239
It's my problem.

289
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,200
It's such a shame,
you have a good look.

290
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:25,840
I don't meant that thing, it's just me.

291
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,519
We are here only for fun.

292
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,720
After tonight, we are still strangers.

293
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,999
You condition is rather interesting.

294
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,680
You are only allergic to women?

295
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,600
Or are you allergic to men as well?

296
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:00,039
Both.

297
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,279
But you don't seem to
be allergic to me right now.

298
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,759
Will you show me your hand?

299
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,879
What now?
Is this some new kind of approaching?

300
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,999
That is not possible.

301
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,720
Am I the first one that doesn't
give you allergic reaction?

302
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,680
No.

303
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,759
There was another one before.

304
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:46,639
But you are the second person
I am not allergic to.

305
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:49,239
Is there any special
characteristics on your body?

306
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,279
Technically speaking,
I am a non-secretor.

307
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,680
People like me do not secrete
the antigens characteristic of...

308
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
these blood groups in bodily fluids.

309
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:01,039
Which mean we can only determine
our blood type...

310
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,480
by using blood test.

311
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,279
Blood type?

312
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,720
That can't be right.

313
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,600
The people I was in contact with
wasn't bleeding at the time.

314
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,519
Why would I be allergic to them?

315
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,159
I am dermatologist.

316
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,320
I specialize in issues
regarding allergy.

317
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,720
Only a tiny portion of human
react to human blood.

318
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:25,119
In some extreme cases,

319
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,360
people react to substances
from the human blood.

320
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,840
But for people who are non-secretors,

321
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,840
the substances in our blood will not
be secreted into other bodily fluid.

322
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,159
Perhaps that is why you
are not allergic to me.

323
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,879
But non-secretors only make up
20% of human population,

324
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:40,279
it's quite rare.

325
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,960
So, she wasn't my only hope.

326
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,519
If it's possible,

327
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,360
you can give me the treatment too.

328
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,399
Do you mean the other person?

329
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,080
All this time,

330
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,560
I thought she was the only hope,

331
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,399
a hope I cannot replace.

332
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,360
I can't even stand the sight of
her being with other men now.

333
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,600
I want to keep her by my side.

334
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,759
I am afraid she might leave me someday.

335
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
But since she is not my only hope,

336
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,239
what does she mean to me now?

337
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,480
Compared with me, how does she look?

338
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,080
You are much prettier.

339
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,960
Her figure is not as good as yours.

340
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:36,200
Dump her and date with me.

341
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,639
I believe I can heal you too,

342
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,399
I could do a better job than her.

343
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,800
So, it seems she does
mean something to you.

344
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:56,200
She and I can help you,
yet you chose her.

345
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,399
The answer is very obvious, isn't it?

346
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,919
Does it mean...

347
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,800
I really do have feelings for her?

348
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,800
You are so funny. How could you
not know your own feelings?

349
00:25:08,999 --> 00:25:10,360
Because of my condition,

350
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,159
I have never truly been in love
with anyone before.

351
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,960
I had dated many girls,

352
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,680
but only to find out...

353
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,080
if they would cause me
to have any allergic reaction.

354
00:25:22,239 --> 00:25:23,800
So love...

355
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,039
is something I never understand.

356
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,440
Poor thing.

357
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,560
Now you know,
are you going to tell her?

358
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,480
Confess my love to her?

359
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,519
That is not possible.

360
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:42,480
I already told her that
I have no feeling for her.

361
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,639
Why?

362
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,360
Because I was scared.

363
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,279
Innocent men like you are
a rare breed nowadays.

364
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,440
But even if you turned her down,

365
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,720
that doesn't mean you can't
confess to her in the future.

366
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,440
It's too embarrassing
to change my mind so quickly.

367
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,039
So, do you love her?

368
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:02,360
Does she love you?

369
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,119
Buddy, tell her if you love her.

370
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,680
If she does reject you,
that makes you even.

371
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,680
But if you hide your feelings for her,

372
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,239
I believe you will regret it one day.

373
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:25,480
Thank you.

374
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,840
If you wish to thank me,
keep me company tonight.

375
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,480
So long, my handsome boy.

376
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,119
Zhou Shi?

377
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,720
You are not going to see her?

378
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:05,720
Since I didn't tell her
when I came here,

379
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,279
there is no need to inform her
when I am leaving.

380
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,960
Are you sure about this?

381
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,279
Yes, I am.

382
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,560
I really do love her.

383
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,200
What is so funny?

384
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,519
I am happy for you.

385
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,680
But how do I tell her
how I feel for her?

386
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,960
I never expect you
would come here again.

387
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
My precious celestial
globe is still here.

388
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,080
It's you that I hate to see.

389
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,639
Have a seat.

390
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,239
The portion is not right.

391
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,560
I followed everything detail
you wrote in the note.

392
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,840
Leave the maintenance to someone
professional like me to do .

393
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,680
Get rid of the water,
bring me some clean water instead.

394
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,360
-Okay.
-Wash the basin, fill it to 70% full.

395
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Okay.

396
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
It's done.

397
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,720
Well, I have a question for you.

398
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:21,879
I know nothing.

399
00:29:21,999 --> 00:29:22,960
I haven't asked yet.

400
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,200
I am not telling you anything.

401
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
You are Shi Shi's good friend.

402
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:31,720
How exactly is her relationship
with Wei Qing?

403
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,759
So, you like gossips too?

404
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,800
I am only concerned for her.

405
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,919
I feel like something is
not right between them.

406
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,159
You are getting better at observing.

407
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,239
Yes, they are at a stage similar
to Schrödinger's cat.

408
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,039
You mean...

409
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,879
So, they are now in a paradox?

410
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,800
Yes.

411
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,320
That is the most
interesting phase of it,

412
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:01,039
there are endless possibilities.

413
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,039
I thought you hate relationship.

414
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,919
Why are you so interested
in someone else's love life?

415
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,560
Love is the most ancient
topic of mankind.

416
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:14,159
I simply despise the fact it might
happen to me,

417
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,840
it doesn't mean I am not interested
in people's love life.

418
00:30:17,239 --> 00:30:20,919
But if you don't experience
a relationship yourself,

419
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,159
and rely solely on people's data,

420
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,239
doesn't that make your
research unreliable?

421
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:28,440
Or is it because...

422
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,600
you are rejecting the thought of it...

423
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,119
because it's too hard
for you to accomplish?

424
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:40,239
You seem to become more intriguing.

425
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,200
Is that so?

426
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,080
You so easily excited,
you are as boring as always.

427
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,560
Fei Fei? Senior?

428
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:06,440
I am home.

429
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,360
Where is everyone?

430
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,560
I am exhausted.

431
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,360
So, are you still going
to give me treatment?

432
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,840
-Come to the window.
-What does he want now?

433
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,680
Why didn't you tell me you are back?

434
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:05,840
Do I have to report everything
to you all the time?

435
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,360
As my assistant,

436
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,159
I think that is necessary.

437
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,039
Come with me.

438
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,480
No, I need to sleep.

439
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,159
Dr. Chen asked for me.

440
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,879
It's something about my condition.

441
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,159
Seriously?

442
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,560
Yes.

443
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,999
This is how it goes.

444
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,600
After the treatment from earlier,

445
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,200
Wei Qing is indeed
showing some improvement.

446
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,279
After all, he is a man who
went through tremendous trauma.

447
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,080
So technically speaking,

448
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,480
he is still recovering.

449
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:55,560
Since both of you have some free time,

450
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,639
perhaps you could use this chance
to take a step further.

451
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,759
Get into more contact
and relax.

452
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,759
It helps with his emotional adjustment.

453
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,759
Since you said that,

454
00:33:09,999 --> 00:33:11,600
I shall follow your instruction.

455
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,800
Very well. I picked the place for you.

456
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,119
Have a look.

457
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,879
This is a new resort.

458
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,039
They are still on soft launch.
There will be less tourists.

459
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,239
Which makes it more suitable
for your treatment.

460
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,200
The place seems decent.

461
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,879
This is far more than decent.

462
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:33,600
It must cost a fortune.

463
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,879
Don't worry about that.
I made the reservation for you.

464
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:41,159
Right, I do have...

465
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,560
the responsibility as your doctor.

466
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,560
If I hadn't asked you to
push the limit,

467
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,560
you wouldn't have resorted to such
extreme procedure.

468
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,680
So, take this as a
compensation from me.

469
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,759
But this doesn't seem adequate.

470
00:33:57,919 --> 00:33:59,200
why not?

471
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,039
Dr. Chen is showing us her good will.

472
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:03,879
Just accept it.
Thank you, Doctor Chen.

473
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:05,320
You are welcome.

474
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,160
To make the treatment
more convenient,

475
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,759
I only booked one room for you.

476
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:18,439
Why? We lived together before

477
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,199
But we agreed not to stay
in the same room!

478
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,800
That is exactly the reason.

479
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,439
This is only for the treatment,
what could go wrong?

480
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,600
-But...
-Enough of your excuses.

481
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:30,400
Dr. Chen has other patients to see to.

482
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,439
We should leave her be for now.

483
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,880
We will start packing right away.

484
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:36,800
We will leave tomorrow.

485
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,439
Thank you so much, Dr. Chen.

486
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,439
Are you serious about this?

487
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,479
I want to be with her.

488
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,519
But it's not because she can cure me,

489
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:12,360
it's because I really do love her.

490
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,600
I am surprised I am actually
going to witness you fall in love.

491
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,959
Fine.

492
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,880
I will help you out.

493
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,320
These files might be cleared
out soon enough.

494
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,160
You just came back,
why are you leaving again?

495
00:35:53,439 --> 00:35:56,759
It can't be helped,
it's for Wei Qing's treatment.

496
00:35:56,999 --> 00:35:59,999
-Dr. Chen arranged this.
-Dr. Chen?

497
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,679
She said he is having a relapse.

498
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,279
She wants to consolidate the procedure
and book a room at the resort.

499
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,880
You should go.

500
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:12,439
I think the treatment...

501
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,239
will have extraordinary results.

502
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,840
I just hope there won't be
anymore awkward moments,

503
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
that is all I ask.

504
00:36:22,999 --> 00:36:24,600
You are going on a vacation.

505
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:27,199
Fei Fei is on a business trip.

506
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:30,239
Only Xiao Fei and I will be
at home for the next few days.

507
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,279
It's delivery meals for me again.

508
00:36:40,279 --> 00:36:42,560
Speaking of the devil.

509
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,360
Xiao Fei, Zhou Shi is going on
another vacation.

510
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:49,320
It's only the two of us
for the next few days.

511
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,600
Do you need me to bring the
celestial globe back for some fun?

512
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,600
Zhou Shi is leaving? When?

513
00:36:56,759 --> 00:36:57,959
Tomorrow.

514
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,279
I am going out as well.

515
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:01,080
You are going out too?

516
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:02,920
Auntie is taking me out
to collect some materials.

517
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,160
I will be at home alone.

518
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,479
Why don't you come with me?

519
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,039
Forget it.

520
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,999
I am interested in Wei Qing's condition.

521
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,239
This time is not the right time.

522
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:16,719
So I am not joining you.

523
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,640
The right time?

524
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,120
Schrödinger's box is opening.

525
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,880
Forget it, I will starting packing now.

526
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,479
I should go too.

527
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,600
I need to start packing
before I unpack the luggage.

528
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,360
How about a game of
chess face-to-face?

529
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,800
Yes, how about an
interesting gathering?

530
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,560
Chairman He, you told Director He...

531
00:38:26,759 --> 00:38:28,080
I am your girlfriend?

532
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,279
Yes.

533
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,439
But I didn't say I agreed.

534
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,759
Why don't you accept me now?

535
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,959
That sounds too rash.

536
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,279
Three days.

537
00:38:37,479 --> 00:38:39,039
In the three days while we are here,

538
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,600
let me feel happy
being your boyfriend.

539
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,560
Or maybe you could just
expose me right in front of my sister.

540
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,120
That it as my unwavering love for you.

541
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,800
Just three days?

542
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Okay.

543
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:59,679
Maybe I will be your real boyfriend
in three days.

544
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,279
-He Wei!
-Sister!

545
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,439
Fei Fei.

546
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:05,640
What brings him here?

547
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,479
Director He, I am not feeling well.

548
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:13,239
Are you all right? Do you need
me to send you to a hospital?

549
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,199
It's nothing, I will
take a rest in my room.

550
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,880
Fei Fei, are you all right?

551
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,479
I'll be fine. It's been a while,
Director He.

552
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,039
I didn't believe it when He Wei told me.

553
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,279
You two are really in love.

554
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,880
Yes, it's been over two months.

555
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,439
Right, Fei Fei?

556
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
Let's not stand out here.

557
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,039
Sister, let me show you around.

558
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,640
-Sure.
-Let's go.

559
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,080
Listen, over there,

560
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,439
I will build a horse race track.

561
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,999
Girlfriend?

562
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,640
No, we are lying to his sister.

563
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,560
Right, why are you here?

564
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,080
Collecting materials.

565
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,239
Why did you choose to do it here?

566
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,199
Why? You hate to see me here?

567
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:56,999
I...

568
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,320
Fei Fei?

569
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,840
Xiao Fei?

570
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,120
Why are you here?

571
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,560
What brings you here?

572
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:07,039
I am going climbing.

573
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,719
It is relaxing.

574
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,039
Spending money for two shares...

575
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,959
and having the whole
restaurant,

576
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:32,439
but it'll only for a while.

577
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,759
This place will soon be full of people.

578
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:37,120
Don't ruin the atmosphere here.

579
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:41,479
We need to enjoy the present
to the fullest.

580
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,679
Fine.

581
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,080
I think I heard the birds chirping.

582
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,479
That seems to be closer.

583
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,840
I don't think that is
the birds chirping.

584
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,959
I think someone is talking.

585
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,880
You jinxed us.
Here they are now.

586
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
We are almost done here.
Finish your food.

587
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:04,800
No, I still have a dessert.

588
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,800
Waiter, bring us the dessert.

589
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,840
Fei Fei? Xiao Fei?

590
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,560
Why is my senior out there
with Director He and Chairman He?

591
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:20,320
Let's leave this place.

592
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,439
Sit down!

593
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,080
The people you hate are here.

594
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,120
They're just here in time
for your treatment.

595
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,199
-Let go of me!
-Stay still and sit tight!

596
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,640
Let go of me!

597
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,679
Stop still.

598
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,279
Zhou Shi?

599
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,199
Over here!

600
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,400
