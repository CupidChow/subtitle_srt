Say it.

144
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,519

Don't blame me for thinking too much.

147
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,000
Zhou Shi is my best friend.
I don't want her to be hurt.

148
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,399
From the first day
you met her until now,

149
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,680
everything you did has exceeded
the scope of a friend.

150
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,279
I asked her before and she said that
it was just a misunderstanding.

151
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:16,599
But a person won't be so generous
to someone without a reason.

152
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,080
You are not trying to pursue her.

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
So, what do you want to get from her?

154
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,839
You are right.

155
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,919
I have my own reason.

156
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,279
But I can't tell you about that reason.

157
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,000
Zhou Shi is very important to me.

158
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,959
I won't hurt her for sure.

159
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,159
Do you love her then?

160
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,320
Love?

161
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,399
What is love?

162

You had so many girlfriends
and yet you ask me what love is.

163

Or were you just playing
a game with them...

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,000
and you never actually
had any feelings for them?

165
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:57,039
What if I tell you that I'm the latter?

166
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,399
I don't care what you did to others.
I just want to be sure that...

167
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,880
you are not playing a game
with Zhou Shi.

168
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,919
I'm sincere towards Zhou Shi.

169
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,279
Alright. I believe you.

170
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,000
Although I don't know what's the deal
between two of you,

171
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
what I can be sure now is,

172
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,000
you won't hurt her.

173
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,320
Thank you.

174
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,279
I won't ask you to do it for free.

175
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,039
I don't need money.

176
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,640
I had rejected your assistant before
when he offered to buy me things.

177
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,320
Now, you want to buy things
for me again. Why?

178
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:32,760
Do I look like someone who will
betray my friend for glory?

179
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,399
You've misunderstood.

180
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,560
I just use this way
to convey my thanks.

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You already did so much for her by...

182
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,359
passing on her gift like this.

183
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,479
It's already enough for me.

184
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,880
If there's nothing else, I have to go.

185
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,640
By the way, I'll thank you
in Zhou Shi's stead.

186
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,599
Bye.

187
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,120
Brother Ming Cheng,
you came back from your business trip?

188
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,279
That's right.

189
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,560
By the way,
I was too busy before..

190
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,479
and didn't get to ask you.
How's your exam?

191
00:13:16,359 --> 00:13:18,279
What is it? You didn't do well in it?

192
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,320
I don't want to talk about it.

193
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,599
It's my fault.

194
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,159
If it wasn't because of a business trip,
I would be able to tutor you.

195
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Shi Shi. Don't be upset.

196
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,120
If you really can't graduate on time,

197
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:37,599
we can do nothing about it. Next year,
I'll tutor you as best as I can.

198
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,560
Why are you laughing?

199
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,279
I'm just fooling around you.
I did quite well in the exam.

200
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,120
-Really?
-Yes.

201
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,959
I can't guarantee about other things
but at least I'll pass.

202
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,800
What about CET-4?

203
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,959
It's fine. At least I can finish it.

204
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,159
Good job.

205
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,120
You even know how to trick people now.

206
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,000
You gave me a fright.

207
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:02,760
So naughty.

208
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,039
Since I've behaved well,

209
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,000
don't you think I deserve a reward?

210
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,640
Of course I need to reward you.

211
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,159
How about this?

212
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:14,240
I didn't get to celebrate
your birthday with you.

213
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,320
The day after tomorrow
will be the weekend.

214
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,599
Whatever do you want to do
I'll keep you company

215
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,800
Really? Are you saying that...

216
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,519
you'll do anything as I say?

217
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,959
Of course.

218
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,959
Tell me when you've decided
about where you want to go.

219
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,320
I'll go up now.

220
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,359
Bye.

221
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,279
Fei Fei.

222
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,200
What?

223
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,760
I'm at Yun Ma now.

224
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:52,240
Birthday party?

225
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,800
This is too extravagant.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,399
Why are you so shocked?
You booked this place, right?

227
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,039
That's right. I am just so thrilled...

228
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,760
every time I see it.

229
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,440
Fei Fei. This is too expensive.

230
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,440
Let's forget it.
We can just celebrate in a restaurant.

231
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,640
No way. We are not only
celebrating your birthday...

232
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,919
but also your passing CET-4 exam.

233
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,080
Of course we need to have some fun.

234
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,839
But the cost...

235
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,399
No need to worry about it. This hotel
collaborates with our magazine firm.

236
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,279
This is just the cost of a hotpot meal.

237
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,680
So cheap? Then I want to
come here too during my birthday.

238
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:33,919
You shouldn't do this.

239
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,120
You are a goddess of study.
Why do you want to be...

240
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,599
as philistine as the rest of us?

241
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,039
Sometimes, you need to decorate your
wisdom with something extravagant too.

242
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,560
We just need to do this once.
It's nice to eat steamboat at home.

243
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,680
Fei Fei, just forget it.

244
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,399
Look. There's only  four of us.

245
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,120
Five including Brother Ming Cheng.

246
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,479
If I invite Wei Qing, it'll be six of us
in such a huge ballroom.

247
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,959
It'll be too empty.

248
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,959
Who said it'll be just six of us?

249
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,680
Do you think a huge ballroom
like this is just a dining place?

250
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,760
Of course we'll have a party here.

251
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,560
Just six of us? How awkward is that?

252
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,839
It won't be just six of us.

253
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,080
Zhou Shi. Invite all your
close friends from your class.

254
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,479
Invite those who are not too.

255
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
Let's show off to them.

256
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,599
Invite that Zhang Ran Yu as well.

257
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,240
She always looks down on you, right?

258
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,039
Let her be on the
receiving end this time.

259
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,479
How can I do that? It's so cruel.

260
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,560
So what? You are going to graduate soon.

261
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,760
Leave a name for yourself.

262
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,159
No need to care about it.

263
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,839
When the time comes,
I'll show you what a dancing queen is.

264
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:45,800
Why haven't you taken them down?

265
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,359
Why should I take them down? I can
use it for your next year's birthday.

266
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,399
Why are you here?

267
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,120
Fei Fei is going to organise
a birthday party for me this weekend.

268
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,640
I want to invite you over.

269
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,080
Party?

270
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,800
Sure.

271
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,720
I'll prepare a huge gift
for you on that day.

272
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:10,519
No. Don't give me any presents.

273
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,039
You already helped me enough.

274
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
I don't even know how to thank you.

275
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,279
You can thank me by dancing with me.

276
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,119
Sure. If you are not afraid
to have you feet stamped.

277
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,999
Anything else?

278
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,360
One more thing.

279
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,080
Don't laugh when I tell you about it.

280
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:28,639
Tell me.

281
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:32,720
I want to confess to Brother Ming Cheng
during the birthday party.

282
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,279
This is already the third time.

283
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,239
I know. But it's different this time.

284
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,600
I have a deal with Brother Ming Cheng.

285
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,999
If I can guess what
he wants for his birthday,

286
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,560
He will fulfil my wish too
during my birthday.

287
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
Are you talking about...

288
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,560
-the Chinese calligraphy?
-That's right.

289
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,800
If I want to be together with
Brother Ming Cheng,

290
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,840
this will be my last chance.

291
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,480
But even if he agrees,

292
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,399
he didn't do it because he likes you.

293
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,879
Can you stand that?

294
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Forget it.

295
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,960
You need to put an end to this anyway.

296
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,919
If you've really decided about it,

297
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,239
then go ahead. I wish you luck.

298
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,720
Wish me luck.

299
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,690
[Happy birthday, Zhou Shi.]

300
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,720
Zhou Shi is really something.

301
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,159
It's just a birthday and
yet she celebrates it so grandly.

302
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,560
I heard that this party
is organised by her best friend,

303
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,039
Lin Fei Fei.

304
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,680
I see.

305
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,999
What a profound friendship.

306
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,720
Why don't I have such a
good friend like that?

307
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,039
You've already decided
what to play next, right?

308
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,279
Okay.

309
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,399
What's wrong? You feel like crying?

310
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,800
Do you know?

311
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,840
My biggest wish in this life...

312
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,080
is to have someone to organise...

313
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,600
a ballroom party like this for me.

314
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,440
I never thought that Zhou Shi will
realise this dream before me.

315
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,080
She has to thank you for it.
If it wasn't because of you,

316
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,600
she wouldn't have this party.

317
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,239
Have you gotten dumb from reading
too much? How could I afford this party?

318
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,639
I thought it's a 90% discount.

319
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,919
Discount? Not only I don't have that,
I need to pay extra for it.

320
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,200
Because this venue is
booked temporarily.

321
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,480
And these are all paid by Wei Qing.

322
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,879
Wei Qing? Why did he do that?

323
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:08,800
He's afraid that she will get upset.

324
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:12,360
He spent on her and has to worry
about her being upset.

325
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,960
Did she save the world
in her previous life?

326
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,480
I'll organise a party for you
during your birthday.

327
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,879
You are the one who said it.
I'll remember that.

328
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:22,999
No. Didn't I ask you
to look for Zhou Shi?

329
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,279
-Why are you here?
-I'm hungry.

330
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:28,560
Fine. Finish your food. We'll check on
her together after you are done.

331
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,720
It'll be magnificent if I use my...

332
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:37,759
planetarium in such a huge hall.

333
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
Oh my goodness.
You are too pretty today.

334
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,399
Thank you, Fei Fei.

335
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,680
It'll be my most
unforgettable day today.

336
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,600
I have to thank you too.

337
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,200
This is my most
unforgettable day today too.

338
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,239
Do you think that if I wear this...

339
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:04,519
to confess to Brother Ming Cheng,
will he agree?

340
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,639
Of course he will.
You are so beautiful today.

341
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,239
Wait, you want to confess
to Li Ming Cheng?

342
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,440
That's right.

343
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,080
But you have Xiao Fei already, right?

344
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:19,159
Xiao Fei is different.

345
00:21:19,399 --> 00:21:22,080
Why is he different?
Aren't you two together?

346
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,879
-No.
-No.

347
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:27,080
Didn't you say that you have something
to tell her in Karaoke?

348
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,519
-I already told her.
-What did you say?

349
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,639
He said that he is Xun Ran.

350
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,919
Who is Xun Ran?

351
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:38,279
That genius painter?

352
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,399
Wait. I'm confused now.

353
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,039
So, the important thing
you wanted to say is...

354
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
you are Xun Ran?

355
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,519
So, you told me so excitedly
about Xiao Fei...

356
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,999
in your room because he is your idol?

357
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,720
Why else would I do that?
Did you think that we are together?

358
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,639
That's impossible.
This is just a small matter.

359
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,560
Do you need to be
so mysterious about it?

360
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,480
We are not being mysterious.
You are the one who think too much.

361
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,200
So, you want to confess to
Li Ming Cheng today?

362
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:09,039
Alright then.

363
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,080
Alright. Both of you can go out first.

364
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:12,600
I want to rest here.

365
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,960
Oh my goodness, isn't that Wei Qing?

366
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:48,159
-Wei Qing knows how to play piano?
-He's so handsome.

367
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,639
-Why is he here?
-Have you forgotten about it?

368
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,159
Before this, he had a scandal...

369
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,720
with Zhou Shi before this.

370
00:22:54,879 --> 00:22:57,039
Maybe something had really
transpired between them.

371
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,239
Wei Qing is here too?

372
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,159
He plays quite well.

373
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,039
Zhou Shi looks so beautiful today.

374
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:40,320
The lady dancing over there is Zhou Shi?

375
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:41,800
Impossible.

376
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,800
How did she look like that?

377
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,800
Did she get a plastic surgery?

378
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,279
I don't want to have relationship with her.

379
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,159
but play piano with her.

380
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,399
-Stop drinking.
-None of your business.

381
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,560
Xiao Fei, you can dance really well.

382
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,159
I learnt it before during a
high school dance party in America.

383
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,480
You have to guide me then.

384
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
My shoe laces are a bit loose.
I can't embarrass myself.

385
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,399
Don't worry. You are the
prettiest lady here today.

386
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:50,119
Such a sweet-talker.

387
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,080
You like Zhou Shi, right?

388
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
Go on then. Or are you afraid?

389
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,480
Are you afraid that Wei Qing will
steal your love away like last time?

390
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,440
Brother Ming Cheng. Aren't you going
to invite me for a dance?

391
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,720
I'm sorry. I already have
someone to dance with.

392
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,440
Bi Qiu Jing.

393
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,999
Can I invite you for a dance?

394
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:03,519
Not interested.

395
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,600
Don't tell me that you can't dance.

396
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,759
Can I invite you for a dance?

397
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,600
I...

398
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,919
What is it? You can't talk now?

399
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,879
Can I...

400
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,440
Can you what?

401
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,200
When do you plan to confess?

402
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,399
Later. Maybe I'll confess when
I dance with Brother Ming Cheng.

403
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:40,480
Don't worry. You are the star today.

404
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:43,239
You will succeed for sure. Be confident.

405
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,159
Thank you.

406
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:32,919
Bi Qiu Jing. For me, you are...

407
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,720
like my de Moivre-Laplace theorem.

408
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,999
You are my central limit
amongst variations...

409
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,680
to guide me to my heart.

410
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,039
You are my Euler-Lagrange equation.

411
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:45,039
I'll always use the most minimum
cost function to get near to you.

412
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,560
Will this be too sickeningly sweet?

413
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,320
We need electric to create magnetism
and only then can we create electricity,

414
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,680
So, without each other,
we won't be able to exist.

415
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,720
I think she won't like this as well.

416
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,879
How about...

417
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,159
I'd better do that.

418
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,279
This is more interesting.

419
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,080
Bi Qiu Jing.

420
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,320
You are here. This is good.

421
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,919
I didn't come here to eat.
I have something to tell you.

422
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,879
-Tell me then.
-Bi Qiu Qing. For me, you are...

423
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,399
like my de Moivre...

424
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,440
-Chairman.
-Come with me.

425
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,879
-What is wrong with them?
-What did Li Ming Cheng say just now?

426
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,600
Chairman. You have something to say?

427
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,639
You said a bunch of nonsense
in the bathroom just now.

428
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,519
Although I don't really understand it,

429
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,519
you want to confess
to Bi Qiu Jing, right?

430
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:46,039
Yes. That de Moivre-Laplace theorem...

431
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:48,480
Stop. No need to explain so much to me.

432
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,039
Anyway, don't confess today.

433
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,399
-Why?
-Someone wants to give you a surprise.

434
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,279
What has it got to do
with my confession?

435
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,159
Because if you confess,

436
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,279
it'll be a surprise
without the 'happy' element.

437
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,639
Who is going to give me a surprise?

438
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:06,039
It's a surprise.
Of course I can't tell you that.

439
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,200
Anyway, you can confess on
any other day except today.

440
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,680
But it's a good opportunity
for me to confess today.

441
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,759
I'm afraid that after today,
I can't find...

442
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,399
another suitable opportunity to confess.

443
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:19,360
Moreover,
I even wore my confessing shirt.

444
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,840
What nonsense is that?

445
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,039
-The first one is the Ohm's law.
-Stop.

446
00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:25,480
No need to explain it to me.

447
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:27,960
Bi Qiu Jing is there without going anywhere.

448
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,600
You can confess whenever you want.

449
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,639
I can organise another party
for her here during her birthday.

450
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,039
When that time comes,
you can confess however you want.

451
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,639
If that's the case,

452
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,560
-alright then.
-Alright. You can go back to them.

453
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,440
Alright.

454
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,960
Brother Ming Cheng,
can I dance with you?

455
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,239
Sure.

456
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
What did Wei Qing say to you just now?

457
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,360
It's nothing.

458
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,999
Shi Shi, you are really pretty today.

459
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,800
Thank you.

460
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,560
Hello.

461
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,999
I am Zhou Shi's classmate.

462
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,759
I know you are the one
who organised this.

463
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,480
They said that this is organised
by Lin Fei Fei for Zhou Shi.

464
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,919
But I know that it's you.

465
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,320
What are you trying to say?

466
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,200
What is your relationship with Zhou Shi?

467
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,560
I don't need you to tell me.

468
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,279
Do you remember Zhou Xin Yao?

469
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,239
-Who is she?
-As expected, you forgot about her.

470
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,039
She is my ex-girlfriend.
You stole her away from me.

471
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,639
I won't let you use the
same way to hurt Zhou Shi.

472
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,560
The relationship between me and Zhou Shi
is none of your business.

473
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,999
What is it? Are you going to
back down just like this?

474
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,480
Don't vent out your anger on me.
Show it to Wei Qing.

475
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,480
First, he dances with Bi Qiu Jing
and now, he is dancing with Zhou Shi.

476
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,159
Li Ming Cheng, are you
playing with me on purpose?

477
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Brother Ming Cheng.

478
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,919
I...

479
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,440
Are you alright, Shi Shi?

480
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,320
Why did my strap come off at this time?

481
00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:26,720
Brother Ming Cheng, wait for me
while I wear my shoe.

482
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,600
-I'll bring you there.
-No need. Wait here.

483
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,039
Be careful, Shi Shi.

484
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,239
Li Ming Cheng, dance with me.

485
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,480
Why did you drink so much?

486
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,399
I'm in a bad mood.
Of course I need to drink.

487
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:44,399
I took the initiative to invite you for
a dance and you rejected me.

488
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,800
You've embarrassed me.

489
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:47,879
You drank too much. Have a rest first.

490
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:49,919
I'm not drunk. I want to dance with you.

491
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,159
You are so close with
another girl in public.

492
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,440
It'll be bad if Zhou Shi sees this.

493
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,840
Li Ming Cheng, what do I lack?

494
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:01,239
You can even dance with
Bi Qiu Jing, the nerd.

495
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,080
Why can't you dance with me?
I don't care. You have to dance with me.

496
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:06,519
I'm sorry.
I only dance with people I like.

497
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,999
You. I don't care.
I want to dance with you.

498
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,679
Come with me.

499
00:34:14,279 --> 00:34:15,759
What is this on your shirt?

500
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,080
Let me take a look.

501
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,400
The first line, Ohm's law.

502
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,239
U/R=I.

503
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:28,719
Second line, 1000mL=1L.
So, it's L.

504
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,400
2/1O2 is O.

505
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,560
The third line. Density=Mass/Volume

506
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,039
m/ρ=V.

507
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,039
The last one is
the equation of electric field.

508
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,920
F/q=E.

509
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,479
The third line is a linear function.

510
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,239
Y=kx+b. So, it's Y.

511
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,840
The second one is as above, O.

512
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:49,560
The last one is the relationship...

513
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,160
between power, resistant and voltage.
Square root PR=U.

514
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,400
So, the combination
of the three lines is,

515
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,840
I love you.

516
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,959
What an insipid wording.

517
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,439
Li Ming Cheng. Are you going to confess?

518
00:35:08,999 --> 00:35:12,600
As expected, you are the
only one who understands me.

519
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Don't tell me that you like me.

520
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,400
Bi Qiu Jing. I like you.

521
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,840
Zhou Shi!

522
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,080
Shi Shi. You fixed your shoe already.

523
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,640
Zhou Shi.

524
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,239
Brother Ming Cheng.
Just now, you said that...

525
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,199
you like Qiu Jing?

526
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,120
-Yes.
-No.

527
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,759
Zhou Shi. Let me explain.

528
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,160
I know nothing about this.

529
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,840
I swear. If I knew,
I wouldn't have come today.

530
00:35:55,999 --> 00:35:57,920
Can I...

531
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,479
What is happening now?

532
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:02,679
Zhou Shi.

533
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,640
Zhou Shi!

534
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,039
What happened to Shi Shi?

535
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,360
Are you dumb?

536
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,560
Can't you tell that Zhou Shi likes you?

537
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:30,880
Shi Shi likes me?

538
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:37,360
Best friend stealing the boyfriend.
What a show.

539
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,320
Zhou Shi!

540
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,080
Zhou Shi!

541
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,959
Zhou Shi!

542
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,880
Zhou Shi!

543
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,880
I'll chase after her now.

544
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,719
Go and contact others.

545
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,439
Did you find her?

546
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,880
She got into a bus.

547
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,560
What should we do now?

548
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:26,239
My senior had gone after her.

549
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,080
What is happening now? Who likes who?

550
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,239
Ask him.

551
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:34,479
How do I know that Shi Shi likes me?

552
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:37,479
Let me warn you.
Stay away from me after this.

553
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,199
I won't be together with you.

554
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,640
Why?

555
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,479
Because being in a relationship
is just a waste of time.

556
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,199
Besides, Zhou Shi likes you.

557
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:47,360
Stop fighting!

558
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,840
Call her now.

559
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,679
Give it to me.

560
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,560
As expected, you are the
only one who understands me.

561
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,160
Don't tell me that you like me.

562
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,239

Why did you run out so suddenly?

588
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,880
