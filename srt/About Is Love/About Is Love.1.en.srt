00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,799
what was its name?

168
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,760
The Mountain Art Gallery Hotel.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Yes...

170
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
The hotel that your girlfriend
booked for us.

171
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,359
How long can we get there?

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,800
Three hours if there
isn't any traffic jam...

173
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,319
and you can concentrate on driving.

174
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,079
And, Zhou Shi isn't my girlfriend.

175
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,040
She's my neighbour.

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,759
She isn't your girlfriend?

177
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,040
If she isn't your girlfriend,

178
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,040
will she go to the hotel
one month in advance...

179
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
and save us money by getting...

180
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,999
a staff discount?

181
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,439
To be precise,
she's my childhood friend.

182
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,439
She must like you.

183
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,840
You're thinking too much.

184
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,280
We grew up together.
We know each other well.

185
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,879
If she harbours feelings for me,
I'll know about it.

186
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,040
Maybe,

187
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,040
she's waiting for this chance
to confess her feelings to you.

188
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:06,879
Think about it,

189
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,920
she isn't spending Chinese
Valentine's Day with her boyfriend,

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,480
but instead she's spending it with
astronomy geeks like us.

191
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,480
Besides wanting to be near to you,

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,439
I can't think of any other reason.

193
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,800
Boyfriend?

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,040
She wouldn't dare.

195
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,240
She didn't even pass the CET-4,
yet she wants to date?

196
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,840
As her brother, I'd be
the first one that disagrees.

197
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,600
Ming Cheng, you're...

198
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,160
a top student,

199
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,559
why do you need to make her like you?

200
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,759
She's studying arts.

201
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,240
She just needs to be pretty.

202
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,519
Why does she need to be smart?

203
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,040
Do you think everyone is like...

204
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,199
Senior Ran Yu who is smart and pretty?

205
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:41,399
Be careful!

206
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,879
I hope he'll say yes.
I hope he'll say yes.

207
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,199
I hope he'll say yes.

208
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:30,160
Say important things three times.

209
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,960
[Brother Ming Cheng]

210
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,759
It's that effective?

211
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,399
Brother Ming Cheng, where are you?

212
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,720
We're on the way.

213
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:48,519
We'll reach before the sun sets.

214
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,319
I prepared a room for you.

215
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,759
I found the perfect
observation spot too.

216
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,160
Although it's quite far away,

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,120
it's suitable for stargazing.

218
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,439
At night, just the two of us...

219
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:00,920
together, okay?

220
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:01,920
Okay.

221
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,519
I'll have to trouble you, Shi Shi.

222
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,879
Goodbye.

223
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,559
Goodbye.

224
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,759
Ming Cheng.

225
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,079
Are you joking?

226
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,480
With all of us,

227
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,399
our cameras and telescopes,

228
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:17,840
if we walk to the hotel,
it'll be dawn.

229
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,759
Stop talking nonsense.
Quick, flag down a car.

230
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,720
A luxury car is approaching.

231
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
A car is approaching.

232
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,399
Stop!

233
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,840
Stop!

234
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:57,680
Zhang Ran Yu?

235
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,879
Why is she in the car?

236
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:00,120
Senior Ran Yu?

237
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,800
The weather is nice.

238
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
Where are we going?

239
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,360
A hotel under my group.

240
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,759
Although it's a little far,

241
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,319
not much people is there.
We won't be disturbed.

242
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,959
The scenery is nice
and is suitable for a vacation.

243
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,639
It seems far away.

244
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
If we go back and forth in one day,

245
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,199
it'll be late by the time
we get back to the university.

246
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,399
So, I booked a suite in the hotel.

247
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,759
For the next few days,
give yourself a break.

248
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,840
I'll talk to your dean.

249
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,079
I see.

250
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,360
Do you think the car...

251
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,720
that just passed by...

252
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,600
looks like this one posted in Weibo?

253
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:37,720
Both of them are Maseratis.

254
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,399
Then, the driver is her boyfriend,

255
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,840
Wei Jing?

256
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:42,840
Wei Jing?

257
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,439
Wei Qing.

258
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,199
That promiscuous guy?

259
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
Why is Senior Ran Yu with him?

260
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,879
Welcome!

261
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,680
Welcome!

262
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,759
Xun Ran?

263
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,160
His painting is here?

264
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:14,319
Now, the price of his paintings
are sky high.

265
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,399
I can't believe I can see one here.

266
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,480
Quick, I have to take a picture with it.

267
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,600
He's coming...

268
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
What are you doing here?

269
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,319
Quick, let's go.
He's coming, let's go.

270
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,120
Wait a minute, who is coming?

271
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,959
Who is coming?

272
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,720
One of the treasures of our hotel,
our boss!

273
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,840
Seriously,

274
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:43,199
if he said that he's coming earlier,

275
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:45,639
I can use this to attract more guests.

276
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,480
Now, he's showing up suddenly.

277
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,759
What is going on?

278
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
Why are you standing here?
Quick, let's go.

279
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,439
Okay.

280
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,280
Attention to every staff,

281
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,840
Chairman Wei is coming
to our hotel soon...

282
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
for an inspection.

283
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,680
All departments are required...

284
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,720
to clean the area you're assigned to...

285
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,319
and prepare for a smooth transition
for the next employee.

286
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:04,519
After cleaning,
assemble at the front desk.

287
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,040
Why haven't you done yet?

288
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:07,680
Quick, be quick!

289
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,399
Here, wipe this carefully.

290
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,480
Don't leave any trace of dust.

291
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,399
The guest room...

292
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:15,959
Hello, sir.

293
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:16,759
Here.

294
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,480
Sir,

295
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,399
why did the announcement sound weird?

296
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,999
What does "prepare a smooth transition
for the next employee" means?

297
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,079
That means,

298
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,519
whoever that offends the boss...

299
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,280
will have to leave.

300
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,519
Is it the routine inspection
so terrifying?

301
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
No.

302
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,519
He's here for a vacation.

303
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Moreover, he's bringing a woman along.

304
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
Woman?

305
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:41,040
Here.

306
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
Sir.

307
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,040
Sir, come here.

308
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,920
What's wrong?

309
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,480
You did the final checks?

310
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,759
Everything is fine, right?

311
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:55,920
Okay.

312
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,480
Great.

313
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,199
I'm relieved if everything is fine.

314
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,959
This is too over.

315
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
If the boss comes, he'll want to
stay in the presidential suite, right?

316
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,360
Why does he want to stay in
a standard suite on the second floor?

317
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,559
Are you the boss?

318
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,559
Every time when he comes,

319
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,639
he'll choose the place
he wants to stay in himself.

320
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,999
He even stayed in the warehouse...

321
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,879
and made it into a guest room.

322
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,439
Is he crazy?

323
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:15,280
No, he isn't.

324
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,040
He has mysophobia...

325
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:19,399
100 times more serious than others.

326
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
Can't you wipe more carefully?

327
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,680
Sir.

328
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,360
Be alert.

329
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,519
Be alert.

330
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,999
And you, Xiao Li.

331
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,319
Smile.

332
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,680
Seriously.

333
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,240
He's here.

334
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:16,720
Welcome.

335
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,439
I haven't seen you for a while, Mr. Wang.

336
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,040
He's the boss?

337
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,319
He seems kind.

338
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,360
He doesn't seem that picky.

339
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,439
Did the chairman already start?

340
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,439
It has been 10 years.

341
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,520
It's finally the day.

342
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,600
Whether it works or not
depends on tonight.

343
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,279
It has to be her.

344
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,919
Hello, sir.

345
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,480
Wei An, go to the hotel's
logistics department.

346
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,600
Okay.

347
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I will clear the stock of...

348
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,279
the convenience stores
at the foot of the mountain.

349
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,000
Ask Old Wang to answer the phone.

350
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,919
Okay.

351
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,679
The chairman wants to talk to you.

352
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay.

353
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,319
Sir, hello.

354
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,679
Old Wang, I've chosen the room.

355
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
But, the hygiene doesn't
meet my standards.

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,400
I threw everything out.

357
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,319
And, arrange a personal
housekeeper for me.

358
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,039
Okay, no problem.

359
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,000
I'll follow your orders.

360
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,961
[Where are you now?]
[Do you need me to pick you up?]

361
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:44,679
Sir.

362
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,520
What room are you in now?

363
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
1208.

364
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,079
1208!

365
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,679
Seriously?

366
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,199
Sir, I'll send someone there now.

367
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,799
Who's in charge of 1208?

368
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,159
Come out!

369
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,799
You, come out.

370
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
You...

371
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:25,799
The boss is extremely dissatisfied...

372
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,079
with your cleaning.

373
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:27,799
Now,

374
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,439
you have a chance to make it up.

375
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,400
You'll be the personal
housekeeper for the chairman.

376
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,640
Any problem with that?

377
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:36,840
Do you have a problem with your brain...

378
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,159
or your neck?

379
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:40,840
The guest that originally
booked the room...

380
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,559
Immediately upgrade to a suite.

381
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,159
Then the things in that room...

382
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:46,640
The chairman personally
threw them all away!

383
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,240
Why are you still standing here?
Quick, go and work!

384
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,640
Sir.

385
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,120
Sir.

386
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,559
My letter is here.

387
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,520
Who are you? Get out!

388
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,480
I only touched your face.

389
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,199
Do you have to do that?

390
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,559
He turned on the water to full force.

391
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,279
Do your family own the hotel?

392
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,319
The hotel really belongs to his family.

393
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,360
Oh no...

394
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,279
He took my letter.

395
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,799
Which department are you from?

396
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,799
Housekeeping department.

397
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,600
Old Wang is getting better
at hiring staff.

398
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't tell me you're
my personal housekeeper?

399
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,000
I am. Are there any problems?

400
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,279
What can you do?

401
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,559
You're a young girl.

402
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Without any skills,

403
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,000
you won't be hired.

404
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,799
I don't hire idlers here.

405
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,919
I can draw.

406
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,199
I can run errands and carry water.

407
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:14,640
I'm really strong.

408
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,279
That's right.

409
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,439
I need manual labourers here.

410
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,199
Especially people like you...

411
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,039
who is a fool.

412
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,559
I only have two requirements.

413
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,480
First, come whenever I need you.

414
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
If I don't need you, stay away from me.
The further the better.

415
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,679
Can you do that?

416
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,959
I think so.

417
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,520
Do not use filler words.

418
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,439
Are you a primary school student?

419
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,679
Can you do it or not? Yes or no?

420
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,559
I can.

421
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,559
Yes.

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,919
Are you waiting for me
to complement you?

423
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,520
What kind of person is he?

424
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I want to pray to his girlfriend.
Is she Buddha?

425
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,079
Is she an internet celebrity?

426
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,720
She's the prettiest girl
in Brother Ming Cheng's university.

427
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,919
What are you looking at?

428
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
Is there something on my face?

429
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,439
No.

430
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,600
I was thinking about the first time...

431
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,520
we met beside the river.

432
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,720
You also wore this dress.

433
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,439
It was a month ago.
You still remember it?

434
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,679
I was drunk...

435
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,319
and nearly fell into the river.

436
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,720
Luckily, you saved me.

437
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Sir.

438
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,079
Sir, wake up.

439
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,400
Did you save me just now?

440
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,679
Who are you?

441
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,120
My name is Zhang Ran Yu.

442
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,799
Be my girlfriend.

443
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,000
Sometimes, I was thinking that...

444
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,520
you're a girl,

445
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,840
how can you be so brave...

446
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,720
and save a drunkard
you didn't know at night?

447
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,679
Weren't you afraid of
drowning with me?

448
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,400
It was nothing.

449
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,760
Moreover, that was in the past.

450
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,000
The present is more important, right?

451
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,559
I have a reason now.

452
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,760
Does he think he's modelling
for a couple poster?

453
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,159
I'm the only person here.

454
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,120
Why is he being lovey dovey?

455
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,079
I wish I can take my letter and leave.

456
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,400
Wei Qing.

457
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,600
I really like you a lot.

458
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,760
No matter how we started,

459
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,120
let's keep on dating, okay?

460
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,600
I have a present for you.

461
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,480
Do you recognise this necklace?

462
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,319
Is this a new product that
your company designed?

463
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,760
But, it looks simple.

464
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,679
It doesn't look like Yun Ma's style.

465
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,319
I'm sorry, I took the wrong one.

466
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Is my letter still with him?

467
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:50,439
This is the one.

468
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,880
Forget about the previous one.

469
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,959
This is your present.

470
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:09,880
It's a new design from Yun Ma.

471
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,760
It's so pretty.

472
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,720
I guessed correctly.

473
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,480
It suits you well.

474
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,439
Thank you, I like it a lot.

475
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,760
If...

476
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,640
Do you need more wine?

477
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,199
I'm sorry...

478
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:36,279
I didn't mean it.
I'll wipe it for you.

479
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,760
Let's take a walk outside.

480
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,679
Sir, your glasses are empty.

481
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,039
Do you need more wine?

482
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:52,120
No need.

483
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,240
Can't you tell we've finished eating?

484
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,240
But, there are so much food left.

485
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,199
Is there something wrong
with this woman?

486
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,600
Why does she always
appear at the wrong time?

487
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,439
I get it. Take care, sir.

488
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,279
While you're waiting for my orders,

489
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,760
stay 10 metres away from me.

490
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:11,799
I dislike...

491
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,959
your presence in the air surrounding me.

492
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,240
Do you think I want to go after you?

493
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:20,760
If it wasn't because of...

494
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,679
Wei Qing?

495
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,640
He is more handsome in person.

496
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,559
Sir, wake up.

497
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
Sir.

498
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,439
What's wrong? Do you feel cold?

499
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,240
The wind is strong in the mountains.

500
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,120
I may have a cold.

501
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,480
Then, let's go back.

502
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,959
Finally she did it.

503
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,240
It's fine. This is good enough.

504
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,600
A human's body is the warmest.

505
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,799
I wanted to hug you ages ago.

506
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,919
You won't blame me, right?

507
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,360
No.

508
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,000
As long as you're happy.

509
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:48,520
She took the initiative.

510
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:50,880
She's clinging to him like an accessory.

511
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:57,920
[Take her away, 100 yuan]

512
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,480
What's going on?

513
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,240
He thinks I'm cheap labour?

514
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,760
I need to be paid.

515
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:06,279
Why isn't she here yet?

516
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,613
[Quick, take her away!]

517
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,480
Miss Zhang, are you feeling unwell?

518
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,319
Do you need me to
send you back to your room?

519
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,319
I'm not unwell.

520
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,000
I'll go and take
an extra layer of clothing.

521
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,360
I'll come to you later.

522
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,600
Your girlfriend just glared at me.

523
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,559
Did she?

524
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:41,520
I was wrongly accused.

525
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,120
She won't complain about me, right?

526
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,319
So what if she complains about you?

527
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,919
This hotel belongs to the Wei family.

528
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,480
Good.

529
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,720
By the way, are you feeling unwell?

530
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,039
Do you need me to inform your assistant?

531
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,120
No need.

532
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:55,840
Well...

533
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:08,959
Thank you, boss. But...

534
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,760
This isn't enough.

535
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,439
This means three.

536
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,120
Not okay. A gentleman...

537
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:27,199
Thank you, please come again next time.

538
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,520
Look.

539
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,720
I don't want to look.

540
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,159
I told you before...

541
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,520
that this won't work.

542
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,439
Then, tell me...

543
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:52,720
an effective solution.

544
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,439
I've been seeing you for 10 years.

545
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,880
But, there wasn't any improvement.

546
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,360
I told you before,

547
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,199
this is an allergy reaction...

548
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,120
caused by mysophobia.

549
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,439
I told you to go to the hospital
to get an allergy test.

550
00:31:03,439 --> 00:31:04,799
But, you refused to go.

551
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,079
Hospital?

552
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,640
You want me to go to a hospital...

553
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,840
filled with bacteria?

554
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:10,679
I'd rather you hit me to death.

555
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:13,640
My allergy symptoms become weirder.

556
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm now allergic to almost everything.

557
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,159
Even if I go to the hospital, they won't
be able to find out the reason.

558
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,039
Okay.

559
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,799
I can understand your reluctance
to go to the hospital.

560
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,120
It has been years,

561
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,880
but you wouldn't listen to me
and undergo hypnotherapy?

562
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,079
Doctors can only treat you...

563
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:28,600
when we find the reason.

564
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,159
Let's put aside the fact
that you avoid hospitals,

565
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,400
you even look for unorthodox solutions.

566
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,959
Let me ask you.

567
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,480
if you were me,

568
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
can you accept the fact that...

569
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,079
you'll always be alone,

570
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,840
can't touch...

571
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,319
nor interact with others,

572
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,559
and can't develop feelings for others?

573
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,640
Forget it. I have plans tonight.

574
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,919
I have to leave.

575
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
You asked them to come?

576
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,319
You're observant.

577
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,439
Mr. Wei, you're sharp-eyed.

578
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,000
They came for you.

579
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,720
-What are you doing?
-Get out!

580
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,240
Did you break up with me...

581
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,559
to have fun here?

582
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Am I worse than her?

583
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:21,079
You'd rather touch her than touch me?

584
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,640
If I were you,

585
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,279
I'd go home and look in the mirror
before saying that.

586
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,679
Wei Qing, I finally understand you.

587
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,480
You're a scoundrel.

588
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,319
Was I hugged by someone?

589
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
Why didn't my body...

590
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,640
reject it?

591
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,439
Sir...

592
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,079
Sir, wake up.

593
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,480
Did you save me just now?

594
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,720
Who are you?

595
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:02,079
My name is Zhang Ran Yu.

596
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,480
I think I've got it.

597
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,319
So, this girl...

598
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,440
not only saved you,

599
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,239
most importantly,

600
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,559
your body...

601
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,519
didn't have adverse reactions
towards her.

602
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,680
Even if you have close contact with her,

603
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,120
you won't have rashes
on your body, right?

604
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:25,200
If your body...

605
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:27,600
doesn't have adverse reactions
towards her,

606
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,600
then there is hope for your illness.

607
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:31,440
But,

608
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,479
this time, to what extent
do you plan to go to confirm it?

609
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,920
I think...

610
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,880
we won't have to get naked.

611
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,200
I'll have to advise you,

612
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,960
prepare a backup plan.

613
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,559
If it doesn't work out,

614
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,319
you can leave.

615
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,960
Or else, it'll be hard to leave.

616
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,079
If you're trapped in bed,
who will come and save you?

617
00:34:51,479 --> 00:34:52,479
Don't worry.

618
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,079
I'll prepare a backup plan.

619
00:34:54,279 --> 00:34:57,079
I won't fight in a battle unprepared.

620
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,279
It wasn't her.

621
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:35,120
He's taking a shower again?

622
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,239
Since he's showering now,
I'll take my letter and leave now.

623
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:43,799
Where's his clothes?

624
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,640
I remembered he wore it back.

625
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,759
Could it be...

626
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:52,239
No, I don't want to see him shower.

627
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
Who's out there?

628
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,200
Come out.

629
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,920
I saw you.

630
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:27,600
Turns out you have a weird habit
of being in someone else's closet.

631
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,960
Or, do you like men's clothing?

632
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,680
I'll give you some.

633
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,880
No need.

634
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,239
The smell of antiseptic is too strong.
I can't stand it.

635
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,079
Well, can you pretend
that you didn't see me...

636
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:43,479
and let me leave myself?

637
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,640
No.

638
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,160
Then, pretend I'm acting as Doraemon.

639
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,840
Get out.

640
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,960
See that?

641
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,759
Security department?

642
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,160
-Connect Mr. Chen for me.
-No...

643
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,200
-I didn't see anything.
-Why do I have to believe a thief?

644
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,239
-I'm not a thief.
-Then, what are you?

645
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:25,319
I got lost.

646
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:27,039
I'm terrible at directions, okay?

647
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,319
Now, thieves have unique excuses.

648
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:33,079
If you aren't here to steal,
then you came to spy on me?

649
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,319
I didn't spy on you.

650
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,239
It's not like I haven't seen men before.

651
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,719
Moreover, looking at a
man's chest is nothing.

652
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,160
I'm sorry.

653
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,200
I sullied your body with my eyes.

654
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,880
But, I didn't do that on purpose.

655
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,479
Actually, I left something in your room.

656
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,079
So...

657
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,999
By the way, are you suffering from
an allergy reaction?

658
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,880
Do you need me to find medicine for you?

659
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,920
I heard that after fainting,

660
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,640
people will lose their memory.

661
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,360
Do you want to hit the wall yourself
or do you want me to do it?

662
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,440
Wait...

663
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,279
I was born in the year of fish.
I can't remember things well.

664
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,600
If you stop provoking me,

665
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:11,279
I'll forget everything that
happened just now.

666
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:12,519
I'm serious.

667
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,279
I promise,

668
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,559
if I get my stuff back,

669
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,479
I'll stay away from you.

670
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:18,519
Why should I trust a liar?

671
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,239
I didn't lie.

672
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,640
From now on, your task is over.

673
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,120
But, my stuff...

674
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:30,719
If you don't want to
lose your job, shut up...

675
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,079
and go back to your position.

676
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,279
No matter what happens,
stay away from me,

677
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,279
-do you hear me?
-My stuff...

678
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,999
Get out.

679
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,440
It's still in your room.

680
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,479
Why wouldn't he listen to me?

681
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,079
In 10 seconds,

682
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,200
if you're still in
the line of my vision,

683
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,799
take your salary at the human
resource department and leave.

684
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,999
What?

685
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:57,559
-What?
-Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

686
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,479
five, four, three, two, one.

687
00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:12,999
Who are you looking for?

688
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,120
It's me.

689
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:15,840
Brother Ming Cheng.

690
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,680
Finally you called me.

691
00:39:17,799 --> 00:39:18,920
I'm sorry, Shi Shi.

692
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,920
My phone ran out of battery.

693
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,799
Moreover, we ran into a few issues.

694
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,440
I was afraid you'll be worried,
so I didn't reply you.

695
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,559
But now, everything is solved.

696
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,680
We'll go according to plan.

697
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,039
The sky is clear here.

698
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:32,920
At night,

699
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,719
we should be able to see it
with our naked eyes.

700
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,319
Let's go together tonight.

701
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,319
Where?

702
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,519
To see the meteor showers with me.

703
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,239
I'll wait for you.

704
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,039
Okay, see you later.

705
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,440
He wants to meet me.

706
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,479
Did he detect it...

707
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,719
and gave me a chance
to confess my feelings?

708
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm excited...

709
00:39:57,799 --> 00:39:59,239
How should I give him the letter?

710
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,640
Wait.

711
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,880
The letter is still with that person.

712
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,160
How can I take it back?

713
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:12,880
You left something in our room?

714
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,239
Is it expensive?

715
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,799
It's not expensive.

716
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,999
It's just a letter and a ring.

717
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,840
But, it's important to me.

718
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,920
Letter?

719
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,160
I forgot it's Chinese
Valentine's Day today.

720
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:26,759
But, I didn't expect
his fan to be so traditional.

721
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,880
You even wrote a letter
to confess your feelings?

722
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,120
No, I'm not his fan.

723
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:31,999
Although that letter is
a confession letter,

724
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,880
it's not for Mr. Wei.

725
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,759
Mr. Wei is so capable,

726
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,999
I wouldn't even dare to think about it.

727
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
You and him are a perfect couple.

728
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:41,960
I think you can progress well.

729
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:44,360
If that's the case,

730
00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:46,120
I can help you to take it back.

731
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:48,519
But, can you do me a favour?

732
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,079
What is it?

733
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,680
Condom?

734
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,279
Condom.

735
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,239
You want me to buy this?
Aren't there any in this hotel?

736
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,960
I don't know why...

737
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:03,759
this hotel has everything...

738
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,239
except for contraceptives.

739
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,799
I called and asked the supervisor.

740
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,319
He said, they are
currently restocking it.

741
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,559
I had to beg you because
I had no choice.

742
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,400
You know about Wei Qing and I.

743
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,799
Today is Chinese Valentine's Day.

744
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,440
He's really careful.

745
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,960
Without that, he won't...

746
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:18,999
I get it.

747
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,880
You'll have to go get it.

748
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:23,600
By the way, just in case, buy more.

749
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:25,039
Money isn't a problem.

750
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,239
This much?

751
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,680
Miss Zhang, actually,
a few boxes of contraceptives...

752
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,559
won't cost that much.

753
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,920
Moreover,

754
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,880
you can actually ask
Mr. Wei to buy it for you.

755
00:41:36,039 --> 00:41:37,160
Aren't you a couple?

756
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,640
How can I?

757
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,360
I don't want him to
think lightly of me.

758
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,279
Our relationship is quite special.

759
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:44,319
It depends on tonight.

760
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,239
Don't worry.

761
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,039
You'll be compensated handsomely.

762
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,400
No need for that.

763
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,640
It's working hours right now,

764
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,319
if someone finds out I left
my position without permission...

765
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:55,960
Don't worry, I'll be your witness.

766
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,719
Hurry up and go.
