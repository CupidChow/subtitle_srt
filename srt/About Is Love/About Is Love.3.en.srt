[Episode 3]

29
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,039
Did you change the pass-code again?

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
Yes, please key in...

31
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:27,239
the first ten numbers
of the Fibonacci Series.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
What is that?

33
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,399
Or key in sum of the birth year,
month and day of my Mr. Perfect...

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,440
after addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Your Mr. Perfect has been dead
for so many years.

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,319
Not that long. Just over 200 years.

37
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,399
Give me the egg tarts.

38
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,560
I have freshly baked egg tarts.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,599
How fragrant they are.

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
I'll count to three and
you'll open the door.

41
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,280
One, two...

42
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,119
See?

43
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,160
She is the new roommate you found?

44
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,160
Hello, I'm Zhou Shi.

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,720
Do you have any bad habits?

46
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:28,959
No.

47
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,239
Any speciality?

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,479
I can cook. Does that count?

49
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,560
How to prove that?

50
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,280
She made the egg tart
that you are eating now.

51
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,800
We pay the rent once
every three months.

52
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,280
We divide the water, electricity,
and gas fees. Any objections?

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,399
Don't you understand?
She has accepted you.

54
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,560
I passed so easily?

55
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,399
Didn't you say she's hard to deal with?

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,440
It's her brain that is hard to
deal with. Not her stomach.

57
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,920
Welcome.

58
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:01,039
I'll count on you about my three meals from now on.

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,399
Alright.

60
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:04,679
Do you have more of these?

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,679
I'll make it for you later.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,479
Thank you for your hard work.

63
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,239
Come on. Let me show you around.

64
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,160
Give me the water.

65
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:15,039
Thank you.

66
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,560
Zhou Shi?

67
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,119
Have you handed in your
summer holiday sketch?

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,079
You are the only one
who haven't done that.

69
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,679
I almost forgot.

70
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Daily assignments can affect
the semester results.

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,160
So, our teacher asked me
to remind you.

72
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,280
Although you didn't get
the National Scholarship,

73
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,679
we can still apply for...

74
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,199
the Entrepreneurship Scholarship.

75
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,399
By the way, the chairman of
Yun Ma Group had visited...

76
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,119
Fine Arts Faculty this morning.

77
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:43,720
So, there's a high chance...

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,880
for the students in our faculty
to get chosen.

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,359
Thank you for reminding me.

80
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,720
You've been of great help.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,880
I'll finish the drawing today
no matter what.

82
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:05,000
Why did I lie?

83
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,679
Why did I say that I can
finish it in a day?

84
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,040
I don't have any inspiration.

85
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,840
What are you doing?

86
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,239
Aren't they beautiful?

87
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,359
So magical.

88
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Why did he appear in my mind?

89
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,280
And it's quite a nice view too.

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,280
Don't you think that
a girl engrossed in art...

91
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,679
looks so enchanting?

92
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:46,600
-It's alright.
-Let me tell you.

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,119
Cooking is not the
only thing she can do.

94
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,199
It's done.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,480
I wouldn't see him anyway after this.

96
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,600
He won't blame me for
putting him into my work, right?

97
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,480
Teacher Xiao.

98
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,119
You can leave.

99
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,840
Chairman Wei,
this is Zhou Shi's work.

100
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,679
I'm sorry. I missed out a name just now.

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,239
Zhou Shi from Fine Arts Faculty.

102
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,440
Xiao Wang.

103
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,079
Go and take a look.

104
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,280
Chairman Wei,
we've seen each other, right?

105
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,119
I won't blame you for
the polite banalities.

106
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,119
But it's just the two of us now.
No need to act like you don't know me.

107
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,079
You hope so much that
I remembered you?

108
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,079
I just don't want to
live in other's lie.

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,639
Especially under this kind
of unnecessary circumstance.

110
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,600
Is it so hard to say that
you know this nuisance?

111
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,600
Or you are already so used to lying?

112
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,440
You have the thinking of a child.

113
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,959
You want to fight about
right or wrong in everything.

114
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,720
Then let me tell you.

115
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,440
We've met each other
and it's more than once.

116
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,560
Do you believe me?

117
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,440
See? You don't believe me.

118
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,639
So, what's the point of you
questioning me about lying?

119
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,840
Didn't you say that you want
nothing to do with me?

120
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,079
I've changed my mind.

121
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,399
Little girl.

122
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,600
We'll meet again for sure.

123
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
My fellow students, be quiet.

124
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,879
Due to issues with the power supply,

125
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,920
so, our awards ceremony will end here.

126
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:51,999
Please keep quiet and leave
the hall in an orderly manner.

127
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,519
How is it, Lucky Star?

128
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,759
How does it feel to be hit by money?

129
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,800
She hasn't gotten the money yet.

130
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:08,559
I think she can only get
the money next month.

131
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,759
That's right.

132
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,720
You all know how much money I have.

133
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,759
I don't even know if I can
make it until next month.

134
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:21,480
This is...

135
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,879
I thought you lostthis necklace.

136
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,240
Yes. I lost it when
I was working at the hotel.

137
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,680
That time, I couldn't find it anywhere.

138
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,920
Why would it appear suddenly
in my pocket?

139
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,800
Besides, when I lost it,

140
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,559
I wasn't wearing this shirt.

141
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,439
Little girl.

142
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,759
We'll meet again for sure.

143
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,360
So, back at the hotel,

144
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,319
it wasn't the first time
we had seen each other.

145
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,160
Indigo.

146
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,160
Dark green, white, amber.

147
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,040
Rouge, autumn yellow, silver.

148
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,680
Purplish red?

149
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,680
Why...

150
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,800
Why are all the pretty colours
so expensive?

151
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,600
The local ones are expensive too.

152
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,759
One colour can already pay for a meal.

153
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,800
If I'm rich,

154
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:59,999
I'll buy all of these colours.

155
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,120
Don't move.

156
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,680
You...

157
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,079
You...

158
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,519
Stop.

159
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,199
Are you trying to buy everything here?

160
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,480
What is happening to me right now?

161
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,079
Get into the car. I'll send you back.

162
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,519
It's fine. I can go back myself.

163
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,999
Are you fine staying alone
in such a big house?

164
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,959
Are your neighbours good?

165
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,559
Nobody harassed you?

166
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,879
I'm doing fine.

167
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,160
Alright then.

168
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,959
Be careful.

169
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,559
Goodbye, auntie.

170
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
Oh my goodness.

171
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,680
Why am I so dumb?

172
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,439
I'm doomed now.

173
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,480
I won't be able to wash it off.

174
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,600
What should I do?

175
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,840
That's right. Zhang Shuai.

176
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,920
Zhou Shi.

177
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,319
Zhang Shuai. You came right on time.

178
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,439
-I'm looking for you.
-What is it?

179
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:48,160
I heard that you are very good
in ink and wash painting.

180
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,959
I would say normal.
I'm better in oil painting.

181
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
What happened to your shirt?

182
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,079
I accidentally got acrylic paint on it.

183
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,680
I won't be able to wash it off.

184
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,600
Buy a new shirt then.

185
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,840
No. I can't waste money like that.

186
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,120
I can use the money to
buy more drawing tools.

187
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,680
Alright. How do you need my help?

188
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,240
Can you add something to my drawing?

189
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,199
Sure. Where is your drawing?

190
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,559
Are you serious?

191
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,240
Just help me draw on it.

192
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,840
Help me. And please draw nicely.

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
It'll be fine.

194
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,879
Fine.

195
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,920
I can't draw if you are
looking at me like this.

196
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
I won't look at you then. Draw on.

197
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,600
Senior. We already have
enough materials for...

198
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,840
the campus belle this time.

199
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,879
Why do we have to interview
the Fine Arts Faculty?

200
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:53,439
Let me show you the faculty belle
of the Fine Arts Faculty.

201
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,800
Fine Arts Faculty?

202
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,399
Hadn't we interviewed that faculty
a long time ago?

203
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,959
That one was enhanced later on.

204
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,879
Let me show you an all-natural beauty.

205
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,519
All-natural?

206
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,959
Stop shooting.

207
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:10,199
Don't look, little kid.

208
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,559
Fei Fei.

209
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,680
So, you are just drawing.

210
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,240
It's a misunderstanding.

211
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,199
Yes, Zhang Shuai's ink and wash
painting is the best in our faculty.

212
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,999
How is it? It's nice, right?

213
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,999
It's actually quite nice.

214
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,680
You are able to draw so calmly...

215
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,759
in front of a beauty.

216
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
That's not right.

217
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:33,519
Look at the strokes on the chest.

218
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,519
I think they are a little bit blurry.

219
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,079
Are your hands shaking
because it's too close?

220
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,559
Where are you focusing on?

221
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,160
Can you give some screen time...

222
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,079
to this pure and artsy boy?

223
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,519
Student Zhang. Among all
the flowers you drew,

224
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,079
is this the most
three-dimensionally one?

225
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,959
Will you vote for Zhou Shi if there's
another faculty belle selection?

226
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,639
You've seen her close.
How would you rate her beauty?

227
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,319
-Five marks.
-Five marks, brother?

228
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:05,840
Can you be honest in front
of the camera?

229
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:08,199
I'll do a voice-over here.
Cut this part out.

230
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,639
Fei Fei. Stop teasing him.

231
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,999
He is an introverted but good boy.

232
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,519
Zhou Shi!

233
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,079
-Teacher Xiao is here.
-Teacher Xiao.

234
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,079
-Let me hide.
-Zhou Shi!

235
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,600
Have you seen Zhou Shi?

236
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,079
No.

237
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,319
If you see her, ask her to come
to the teacher's office.

238
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:34,439
Zhou Shi!

239
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,280
Zhou Shi!

240
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,600
I'm so scared.

241
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,519
Zhang Shuai. I'm sorry...

242
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,720
that I used you as a shield just now.

243
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,439
Don't do this again next time.

244
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,759
Actually, since young,

245
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,559
I've always been using
the five-point scale.

246
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,480
What is wrong with him?

247
00:17:02,999 --> 00:17:05,319
Did I hold him too tightly just now?

248
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,039
Why is he acting so strange?

249
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,559
It's not that you had
hold him too tightly.

250
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,760
Zhou Shi.

251
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,079
If I didn't know you well,

252
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,039
I would've thought that you
are an experienced player.

253
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,439
Fine. Let's not talk about him.
Why is Teacher Xiao looking for you?

254
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,279
Are you late from paying
the school fees again?

255
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,720
Are you serious?

256
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,760
You take so many part-time jobs every day.
Where's the money?

257
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,959
The paintbrush for traditional Chinese
painting class, Xuan paper and dye.

258
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,439
The clay for sculpture class,

259
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,640
-metal for DIY assignment...
-Enough. Stop.

260
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,000
I know it now. Fine Arts Faculty
is an expensive course.

261
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,439
But your parents should have
given you the school fees.

262
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,679
I didn't take it from them.

263
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,880
I went against their will...

264
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,959
to enroll in such
an expensive art school.

265
00:17:57,199 --> 00:17:59,039
It'll be shameful
to take money from them.

266
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,079
Moreover, you know about...

267
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,360
my family's situation.

268
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
You didn't tell me about it back then.

269
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,799
Oh my goodness.

270
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,039
I thought you've finally
opened your eyes...

271
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,559
and wanted to get money to buy
cosmetics, clothes and bags.

272
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,559
You really did everything just to...

273
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,039
stay in the same city as him.

274
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,520
You are exaggerating.

275
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,559
I'm not exaggerating.

276
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,919
Does he know that you
did so much for him?

277
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,079
You didn't get to confess to him during
the Chinese Valentine's Day.

278
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,159
Who knows when you'll
have the chance again.

279
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,360
Brother Ming Cheng.

280
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,679
Meet me in Kwang Hua University's
Chess Club in 20 minutes' time.

281
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:39,959
Maybe I'm being too narcissistic,

282
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:42,279
but I think he knows.

283
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,520
Every time I'm in a dilemma,

284
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,000
he'll be there.

285
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,799
Brother Ming Cheng is so smart.

286
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,480
I think he can sense it.

287
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,439
Yes. You are always right.

288
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,559
Enough. Go and find
your source of energy.

289
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,439
Bye.

290
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,840
I hope that I'll never have to...

291
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,520
go through an unrequited love.

292
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,760
I heard that you had
a thrilling holiday this time.

293
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:13,880
Playing car crash?

294
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,120
It's a bit overdone.

295
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,679
But the result is quite satisfying.

296
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,000
That Miss Zhang on
the main page of Weibo...

297
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:23,919
is talking about
emotional hurt every day.

298
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:26,959
Every line insinuates that
she has a bad partner.

299
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,000
And you think that the result is good?

300
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
She's not the one I enjoyed myself with.

301
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,520
She is just the impostor
of the real one.

302
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,159
Can you be sure that...

303
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,959
the girl is the one you are looking for?

304
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,559
I'm 99% sure.

305
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:40,199
Unless she can clone herself.

306
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,439
Will you be able to get
this girl easily?

307
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,640
Normal difficulty.

308
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,520
If it goes smoothly,
I just need around one month.

309
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,520
Looks like you know her weaknesses.

310
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,799
How many do you know?

311
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:52,199
Not many.

312
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,120
But her biggest weakness is,

313
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,600
she is poor.

314
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,319
Brother Ming Cheng looks
so handsome when he's being serious.

315
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,679
How long are you going to stand there?

316
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:52,199
Brother Ming Cheng.

317
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,039
Say something if you are here.

318
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,760
Don't stand there like a fool.

319
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,319
Brother Ming Cheng.
Why did you call me here?

320
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,679
I heard that you got the
Entrepreneurship Scholarship.

321
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:04,760
Yes.

322
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,880
But...

323
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,919
You are amazing.

324
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,600
Finally, you are showing something promising.

325
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,319
Let's go.

326
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,159
-Where to?
-You are treating me to a meal.

327
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,240
I've waited so many years for you
to get a scholarship and treat me.

328
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,039
Brother, I'm very poor now.

329
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,079
The more reason to have a feast.

330
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,480
Eating is a fortune.

331
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,319
You'll look richer when you eat more.

332
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,720
I know an excellent restaurant.
Let's go.

333
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,120
Let's go.

334
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,640
Hello, Sir. Is this unit 101, Block 6?

335
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,919
-Yes.
-You have two packages.

336
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,640
Here they are. Please sign your name,

337
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,679
Alright.

338
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:43,600
Over here.

339
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,039
Alright.

340
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,279
-See you next time.
-Alright.

341
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,439
Eat more, Shi Shi.

342
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,760
Brother Ming Cheng.
I'll get it myself.

343
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,240
-My bowl is full.
-Alright.

344
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,760
Shi Shi.

345
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,559
You are almost in
the fourth-year now.

346
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,919
Have you thought of your future?

347
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,880
I don't know. I'll think of it later.

348
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,679
Have you thought of applying for...

349
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,640
postgraduate in
Kwang Hua Fine Arts Academy?

350
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:57,039
-What did you say? Me?
-Are you alright?

351
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,559
Yes. Haven't you thought of that?

352
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,679
But I can't even pass the CET-4.

353
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,720
It'll be a joke to everybody
if I apply for postgraduate.

354
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,279
And we're talking about postgraduate
in Kwang Hua University.

355
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,640
I think I'll leave this
difficult mission to you.

356
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,240
I won't embarrass myself.

357
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,959
Have you never thought of studying
in the same university as me?

358
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,480
Your results in cultural lessons...

359
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,959
are not that good.

360
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,959
But you have very strong art foundation.

361
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,159
And it's better for you to
study further for your profession.

362
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:28,039
When you graduate from it,
with Kwang Hua's certificate...

363
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:30,799
That's right. I can choose this path.

364
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,120
If I can get into Kwang Hua
University's postgraduate,

365
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,279
then we can...

366
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,919
play games, eat together and...

367
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,400
sleep in the library together.

368
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,959
He can sign for me when I'm absent.

369
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,959
And send me books during exam.

370
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,439
That will be so great.

371
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:45,760
Shi Shi.

372
00:24:46,199 --> 00:24:47,760
Did you hear what I said?

373
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,880
I've decided.
I'll apply for postgraduate.

374
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,959
Such aspiration.

375
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,199
When you become my schoolmate,

376
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,240
I'll keep a seat for you every day.

377
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,439
We can do self-study together,

378
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,760
go for morning study
and lecture together.

379
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,400
And then we'll do projects together.

380
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,240
Why is it different from
what I've imagined?

381
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,880
Shi Shi. I'll have to use the washroom.

382
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,559
-Alright.
-Eat more.

383
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,439
Alright.

384
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,600
Who is it?

385
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:42,159
Who are you?

386
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:44,360
Innerwear.

387
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:46,919
Your innerwear.

388
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,840
Leopard prints, lace, polka dots.

389
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,360
Phone harassment?

390
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,919
What is this?

391
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:14,559
Thank you for today,
Brother Ming Cheng.

392
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,400
No need to be so courteous.

393
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,520
I think I've eaten the whole fridge.

394
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,799
I don't need to eat for the next month.

395
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,520
Li Ming Cheng.

396
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,039
It's really you.

397
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,919
And your sister is here too.

398
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,840
Excuse me, my surname is Zhou
and his surname is Li.

399
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,520
We are not related by blood.

400
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:35,880
I'm not his sister.

401
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,959
I don't think you look
like family as well.

402
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,919
I can't tell from the names.

403
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,120
Just like Kwang Hua University
and Guanghua Vision University.

404
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,799
One is the national best,
another one is a low-class school.

405
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,600
How can you be a family?

406
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,000
-What do you mean?
-Shi Shi.

407
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,840
When Ran Yu talks about you,
just listen.

408
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
When you get into
Kwang Hua's postgraduate,

409
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,720
no matter where you are from,

410
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,079
we'll all be the same when you
got into the university.

411
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,400
Understand?

412
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,880
Yes.

413
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,039
Brother Ming Cheng.
It doesn't mean anything.

414
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:06,360
Please don't misunderstand.

415
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,679
I don't think you can stop here.

416
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,079
Besides, I think your driver...

417
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,679
looks quite drunk.

418
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,880
Although your perfume
has covered quite a lot of it,

419
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,720
but drink-and-drive is against the law.

420
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,039
It may become a crime if it's serious.

421
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,840
Don't try your luck.

422
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:22,319
We'll be leaving now.

423
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,720
Let's go, Shi Shi.

424
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,959
Don't bother yourself
with those juniors.

425
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,760
We have important things to do later.

426
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,679
That woman is not my junior.

427
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,079
She wouldn't be able to
get into Kwang Hua University.

428
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,400
Are you going to sulk here...

429
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,400
or enjoy a good show in the bar later?

430
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,840
Fine.

431
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,120
When both of you get into
the bar later, lie low.

432
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,959
My nephew's sense of smell...

433
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:53,000
is way better than that guy just now.

434
00:27:53,199 --> 00:27:55,240
Don't overdo it.

435
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,520
Alright.

436
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,720
Don't let him find the
source of problem...

437
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,400
and drag himself into it.

438
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:02,240
Let's go.

439
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,480
From what you told us,
your Brother Ming Cheng...

440
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,760
is not a simple man.

441
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,159
Are you talking about...

442
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,640
that Li Ming Cheng from
Kwang Hua University?

443
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,880
Yes. Do you know him?

444
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,159
Now I remember. You are from Kwang
Hua University's Chemistry Faculty.

445
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,159
Does he look that smart?

446
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,199
Of course. He excels in his study.

447
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,640
He's always been No.1 since young.

448
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,159
He even came first for
the college entrance exam.

449
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,480
This is what you mean by smart.

450
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,480
Those who can get into Kwang Hua...

451
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,000
must have excelled in some things.

452
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,159
The way you talk so casually
about study...

453
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,240
is so similar to Brother Ming Cheng.

454
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,959
I think I need to introduce
both of you to each other.

455
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:49,400
Moreover,

456
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,279
I have no interest in people
who have lower IQ than me.

457
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,199
Sister Fei Fei.

458
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,720
Can you introduce me to some jobs?

459
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,240
Really?

460
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,000
I don't care how tiring it is.

461
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,679
I'm applying for postgraduate
in the second half of the year.

462
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,480
So, I need to save up as much as I can.

463
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,400
Come. Let me take a look at your face.

464
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,959
You are beautiful. No makeup needed.
Go to work with me later.

465
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,240
You are the best, Sister Fei Fei!

466
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,279
Enough. Change your clothes first.

467
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,480
Your innerwear too.

468
00:29:17,959 --> 00:29:19,039
That's right. Innerwear.

469
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,199
Where is the pure silk innerwear
I bought from Taobao?

470
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,199
Didn't I ask you to take
the package for me?

471
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,959
No?

472
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,520
This is weird. Why did my packages...

473
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,199
keep on getting lost lately?

474
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,559
Where were they delivered?

475
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,000
Did you put your address as...

476
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,360
21st Yanjiang South Road,

477
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Garden District, Unit 101, Block 6?

478
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,720
Yes.

479
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,720
It was sent to a floor above us.

480
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,319
Why?

481
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,880
This place...

482
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
is remodelled from a studio.

483
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,520
So, there's only one address.

484
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,720
We are on the first floor.

485
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,640
It was a storeroom for the studio.

486
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,480
The landlord separated it
to rent this out.

487
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,319
The main studio is on
the second and third floor.

488
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,000
I wasn't occupied before this.
So, the packages were sent here.

489
00:29:58,199 --> 00:29:59,559
Now, the owner is back.

490
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,240
I think the clueless courier...

491
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,880
just assumed that this is one house.

492
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,880
After you said that, now I remember.

493
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:09,400
I think a young handsome guy
had moved in two days ago.

494
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:12,559
Now, you've reminded me.

495
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,720
I received a strange phone call
in the evening.

496
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:17,720
It's about leopard print innerwear.

497
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,720
Call him back now.

498
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,959
Oh my goodness.

499
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,919
This is so disgusting.

500
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,720
No. Go up with me
to catch that pervert. Let's go.

501
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,600
Anybody home?

502
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,279
Open the door!

503
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,120
Fei Fei, stop pressing the bell.

504
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:58,799
You'll disturb the neighbours.

505
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,799
We don't have any neighbours here.

506
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,520
Besides, I'm trying to wake him up.

507
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
Anybody home?

508
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,439
Finally, you are out.

509
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:18,279
It's you?

510
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,120
You know each other?

511
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,159
What do you want to do?

512
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,880
Let's talk.

513
00:31:35,439 --> 00:31:37,079
Do you still remember me?

514
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
Do you remember this colour?

515
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,959
Looks like you remember.

516
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,640
Actually, we are not here
to look for trouble.

517
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,840
I received a strange
phone call this afternoon.

518
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,360
The one who talked about
innerwear was you, right?

519
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,159
Don't deny it.

520
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,480
We heard your ringer.

521
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,279
-It's me.
-My packages are with you.

522
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,079
The courier made a mistake.

523
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,159
As expected.

524
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,360
Can you give us back the packages?

525
00:32:15,439 --> 00:32:18,240
They are in the house.
But I forgot where I put them.

526
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,439
Oh my goodness.

527
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,840
It is huge. How are we going
to search for them?

528
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,679
Did you draw all of these?

529
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:38,159
My master and my senior...

530
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,079
stayed here when I was young.

531
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,360
Have you forgotten why we are here?

532
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,240
Are you a fish with
seven seconds memory?

533
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,640
Those who can draw
can never be a bad guy.

534
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:51,480
Don't stress too much about things.

535
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,079
It's just innerwear, right?
I'll search it for you.

536
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,199
Don't go over there.

537
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:12,520
This is just a bowl.

538
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,840
Do you have to give such big reaction?

539
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,760
I think something is wrong.

540
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,439
This bowl looks important.

541
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,720
It's just a normal ceramic bowl.

542
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,559
It's not something valuable.

543
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:29,360
No.

544
00:33:29,959 --> 00:33:32,159
There are so many drawings here.

545
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,000
Could it be that...

546
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,640
Let's go. I don't want
the packages anymore.

547
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,559
He looks so scary. It is horrifying.

548
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:03,400
Did you get your things?

549
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,400
No only we didn't get it,

550
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,640
we broke his bowl.

551
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,440
It's just a bowl.

552
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,840
There's bowl like this everywhere.
I'll go and buy one now.

553
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,680
But you still have to work, right?

554
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,479
It's almost nine now.

555
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,920
Can you help?

556
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,640
I don't like to be in other's debt.

557
00:34:18,759 --> 00:34:20,799
If I can't solve this issue today,

558
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,400
I'll feel uncomfortable.

559
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:24,200
But I don't have much experience.

560
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,279
What if I cause you troubles when I go?

561
00:34:26,479 --> 00:34:27,880
No experience is needed.

562
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,999
You just need to look pretty
and keep up appearances.

563
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,999
I thought you wanted a job.

564
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
This is a chance, right?

565
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,600
Let's go and change your clothes.

566
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,640
I really don't know what to do.

567
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,719
I've seen Fei Fei wore this before.

568
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,680
Why does it feel so strange...

569
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,640
when I wear it?

570
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,799
You there.

571
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,960
You are Xi Xi, right?

572
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,160
Fei Fei introduced you here, right?

573
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,960
Xi Xi?

574
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,799
So, this is my name here?

575
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,719
Yes. I'm here to replace
Fei Fei temporarily.

576
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:36,559
Any instructions for me?

577
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,200
Instructions?

578
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,960
You are so interesting.

579
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:43,360
Actually, working here is...

580
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,799
the same as working outside.

581
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,239
You are a service provider.

582
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,239
Just that the customers here
are more liberal with money.

583
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,440
And they give more tips.

584
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,279
Newbies like you...

585
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:55,799
just need to wait outside
the private room.

586
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,600
No need to care about other things.

587
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,920
Director Sheng.

588
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,400
Young Master Wei is here.

589
00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:02,319
He's here?

590
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,799
Go and get some people...

591
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,519
to go out and explain to the customers.

592
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,440
Say that there have been some issues.

593
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,200
Apologise to them...

594
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,039
and tell the doorman...

595
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,920
not to let in any more customers.

596
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:14,999
Go.

597
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,600
Quick!

598
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:24,400
Stand properly.

599
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,400
Quick. Stand properly.

600
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,640
Why is it him again?

601
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,200
And why are we in
this kind of situation?

602
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:56,200
Award ceremony in the morning
and bar at night.

603
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,479
Way different situation.

604
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,759
Why are you standing here?

605
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,999
They need people there. Go in now.

606
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,960
I'm new. I don't know anything.

607
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,400
I'd better stay outside.

608
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,880
You can't. You came on Fei Fei's stead.

609
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,160
-You need to take this responsibility.
-But I...

610
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:18,600
No buts. Young Master Wei
just ordered a Dynasty Wine.

611
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:20,319
Serve it to him quickly.

612
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,759
Quick.

613
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,600
Wait.

614
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,559
This is bad. He has recognised me.

615
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:53,840
He knows which university
and faculty I'm in.

616
00:37:53,999 --> 00:37:55,680
I even took his scholarship.

617
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,799
What if he reports it to the school?

618
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,120
You, come here.

619
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,559
You forgot your tips.

620
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,279
Thank you.

621
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:29,920
This is so strange.

622
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,120
He couldn't recognise me
although I'm so near.

623
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:38,319
This is too extravagant.

624
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:41,440
Just because he's the eligible bachelor,
he gives necklaces to everyone.

625
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,039
He is too rich for his own good.

626
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:47,319
Have you found Wei Qing?

627
00:38:47,479 --> 00:38:50,239
No need to look.
He booked the whole place today.

628
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,680
He is so liberal with his money.

629
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,680
If only he's not someone
we have to get rid of.

630
00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:00,039
It'll be great if he's our client.

631
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,360
In your dreams.

632
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,440
Just finish the work quickly.

633
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,600
We'll think about the future later.

634
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,880
By the way, Chairman He...

635
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,559
told us not to overdo it.

636
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,360
I got it.

637
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,160
Later, I'll distract his bodyguards...

638
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,999
and you'll give him the death blow.

639
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,680
Remember. Make it clean.

640
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,039
Don't let the CCTV get you. Let's go.

641
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
Are they talking about Wei Qing?

642
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,600
Young Master Wei, anything?

643
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,920
Is the girl new here who served
the wine ?

644
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:46,799
Her? She is Xi Xi.

645
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:48,680
She is replacing her friend for today.

646
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,759
This is her first time here.

647
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,840
First time? Xi Xi.

648
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,160
You know her?

649
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,960
I just never thought that
we'll meet so soon.

650
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,680
And at a place like this.

651
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,799
I've waited for nothing.

652
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:03,999
Looks like she is fated to meet you.

653
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,440
Do you want her to have
some drinks with you?

654
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,440
No need.

655
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:09,479
With her temper, even if she comes,

656
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,440
she'll not treat me well.

657
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:14,759
Wei Qing, come with me now!

658
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,880
Quiet!

659
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:25,079
Except him, all of you, get out now.

660
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,440
Go!

661
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,960
What are you doing?

662
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:30,400
Go now.

663
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,479
I'm talking about you. Go now.

664
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:35,960
Wei Qing.

665
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:37,360
Anything?

666
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,640
Can you see that they
are here to beat you up?

667
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:41,200
Do you think they are here to treat you?

668
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,360
None of your business. Leave.

669
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:43,920
The pretty lady is right.

670
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,160
You've seen it too. In this situation,

671
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,999
we are just hired muscles.

672
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,319
Don't blame us for troubling you.

673
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:54,880
It's your fault for being too famous
and having too many competitors.

674
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,759
Do you want us to attack...

675
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,279
or do you want to lie down
and let us get a few good hits?

676
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,960
It's late now.
Let's get this over with quickly.

677
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:05,759
The hospital is near too.

678
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,759
You won't have to wait
at this time as well.

679
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,319
Actually, we are just
doing this for money.

680
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,759
If you don't want to
suffer physical pain,

681
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:17,079
we don't mind to get more money.

682
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,600
That's right.
If only you can pay us double.

683
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,200
Are you done?

684
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,160
