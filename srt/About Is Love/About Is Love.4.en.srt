00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,440
is a professor who graduated
from Royal College of Art.

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,359
He is qualified to teach you.

168
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,240
Cut the nonsense.
Apologise to him now.

169
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Old Yan, I have something to say to her.

170
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,240
-Continue with your work.
-Alright.

171
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,760
Apologise to him properly.

172
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:24,640
-What are you doing?
-Apologising.

173
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
How rigid. Compared to an apology,

174
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,479
I rather hope that I can talk to you...

175
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,800
about what to eat for lunch today.

176
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,320
Is your company so free?

177
00:10:34,479 --> 00:10:35,680
Why would you have the time...

178
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,640
to be a professor in our university?

179
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,719
I'm here...

180
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,719
to repay my gratitude.

181
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,039
What?

182
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,080
Last night, you said that you want
to pass your theory exam, right?

183
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
I've seen your results.

184
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,880
Your Introduction to Art subject
is the worst.

185
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,039
And next is History of Art.

186
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Basically, you hover on the line
between passing and failing.

187
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,080
Old Yan had introduced me just now.

188
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know about other things.
But I'm qualified enough to...

189
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,440
teach you about art theories.

190
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,599
It wouldn't hurt to call me a teacher.

191
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,719
Are you saying that...

192
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,519
you can help me pass the test?

193
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,919
Then what should I do?

194
00:11:13,719 --> 00:11:16,959
Do the PowerPoint for
our lecture tomorrow.

195
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,359
What is this?

196
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,279
The topic, context and reference books
are already listed here in details.

197
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:23,919
Get it done by tomorrow morning.

198
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,320
Or else, you'll have
to take the responsibility...

199
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,719
for a blank PowerPoint.

200
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,159
-I won't do it.
-No choice. This is your assignment.

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,719
Why are you like this?

202
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,320
It's fine if you don't want to do it.

203
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,440
I can just tell Old Yan about you
working part-time in a bar.

204
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,839
You are ruthless.

205
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,479
Why are you still standing over here?

206
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,880
The library will close on five.

207
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:52,159
Go ahead and waste
your time here if you want.

208
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,120
So much information.
And I have to memorise it in a night.

209
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,200
Is this how you repay for kindness?

210
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,200
I should have just rescued
a husky instead.

211
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,479
I'm too unlucky.

212
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,159
Gao Yang?

213
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Tell me clearly.
What happened to Fei Fei?

214
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,080
Bowl? What bowl?

215
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,760
Stop mentioning bowl.

216
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,080
Now, I'm surrounded
by bowls everywhere.

217
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,039
Starting from last night,

218
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,359
Lin Fei Fei has been buying bowls
like a possessed woman.

219
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,880
I already max out one of my cards.

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,919
If this continues,

221
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
my parents will cut my sub-card.

222
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,880
Why are there so many bowls?

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,279
My vision are already blurred
from picking them out.

224
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,440
Your eyes are black.

225
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Black?

226
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:53,599
What about this?

227
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:58,159
Does this look like the broken bowl?

228
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,599
I'll stop now.

229
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,240
Please talk to your friends.
I'll be leaving now.

230
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,599
Don't go! If you leave, what she would do?

231
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,680
How can you be like that?

232
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,399
Please be decisive.

233
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,359
This is already the tenth bowl that
you think is similar to it.

234
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,479
Have you made a decision
about your choice?

235
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,880
Wait for a moment.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,519
Gao Yang.

237
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,159
Where are you going, you jerk.

238
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,880
Fei Fei!

239
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,359
Why are you so loud? You scared me.

240
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,080
-What is it?
-Have you paid?

241
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
No.

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,440
Good. Listen to me.

243
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,440
Put them back. Don't buy them.

244
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,599
No.

245
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:45,719
Can you stop?

246
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,200
Why do you need so many bowls?

247
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,800
To open a shop, for exhibition...

248
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,880
or to summon God and dragon
from your collection?

249
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,479
No. I don't care.
I won't stop until I got it.

250
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,800
I have to show the boy upstairs
that I'm better even if...

251
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,359
I have to cut off my hands tomorrow.

252
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
Why the enmity?

253
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,640
What happened between you both?

254
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,039
No. I'm telling you that...

255
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,159
Let me speak. It's like this.

256
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,159
Open the door.

257
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,640
This is for you.
I don't like to owe someone.

258
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,399
I said that I'll pay you back.

259
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,279
I've searched all the shops around me.

260
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,800
This is the most similar one.

261
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:32,039
It's yours now. Don't say that
I took advantage of you.

262
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,159
Are you insane?

263
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't drop it even if you don't want it.

264
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
Fine. You don't want a bowl, right?

265
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,959
I'll pay you back in cash then.

266
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,240
How much is it? I'll get
the money from the bank.

267
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,880
Wait, I can pay you through WeChat too.

268
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,359
Don't keep quiet.

269
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,760
You can give me a reply at least!

270
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:02,919
Open the door!

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
Is it so hard to say something?

272
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,120
Come down!

273
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,760
I'll give you money.

274
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,839
Go and get one exactly
the same as mine.

275
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,839
Or else, I'll call the police.

276
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:30,440
Fine. Game on.

277
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,680
It's just a bowl.

278
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,919
I'll pay you back.
I don't need you money...

279
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,000
to get you one that is exactly the same.

280
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,519
The latest battle is,

281
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,120
she has to find a bowl
exactly the same as his.

282
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,680
So, she has returned
all the bowls previously.

283
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,919
What a shock. It's good then.

284
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,959
I don't have to worry that
she'll lose a hand now.

285
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,120
Please wrap this up for me.

286
00:15:55,599 --> 00:15:57,760
But she bought the most expensive bowl.

287
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I can't believe her.

288
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,519
Fine. I'll talk with the boy upstairs
when I have the time.

289
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,560
You are too old to be so temperamental.

290
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,680
It's him?

291
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,039
What a coincidence!

292
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,800
Are you looking for me?

293
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
What are you looking for then?

294
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,999
I'm looking for books.

295
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,560
I couldn't find it anywhere.
So, it's here.

296
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,680
They have a female version
for this book.

297
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,360
Want me to help you find it?

298
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,879
No need. I'm just
looking around casually.

299
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,919
Are you from the Fine Arts Faculty too?

300
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,239
Why haven't I seen you before?

301
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,680
Do you show up only to hand in...

302
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,600
your assignments and during exam?

303
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,119
Won't the teacher and professor
penalise you?

304
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,119
Who are the teacher and the professor?

305
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,480
Why are you so arrogant?

306
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Maybe because I'm good in my drawings.

307
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,200
I'll forget that you said this to me.

308
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,399
Don't say the same thing to others.
You'll get hit.

309
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
What books are you looking for?
Let me help.

310
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,039
A translated work from Japanese.

311
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,399
What is the title of the book?

312
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,039
If you know that being
troubled and confused...

313
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:56,440
are the characteristic of young people,
no need to worry.

314
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,879
Because this is how everybody
grows into adults.

315
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,999
I was once a troubled
and confused genius.

316
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,519
If you realise that
there will be no growth without...

317
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:04,840
troubles and confusion,

318
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,519
then you just need to like your work.

319
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,840
Then, you'll be able to do anything.
Find it.

320
00:18:10,239 --> 00:18:13,279
This is the title? It's too long.

321
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,119
What kind of nonsense books
does he read usually?

322
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,600
The author is an illustrator,
Tadanori Yokoo.

323
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,399
Are you...

324
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
-You've heard it wrongly.
-Wait for me.

325
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,840
I'm really sorry for
what happened last night.

326
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:33,680
My roommate didn't do it purposely.

327
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:36,200
Although things had developed
in a strange way,

328
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
she's really trying hard
to pay you back.

329
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,440
So, please forgive her.

330
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,840
Are you alright?

331
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,480
Is he alright?

332
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:55,960
Why does he walk like a zombie?

333
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:06,519
Have you gotten
the materials you need?

334
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,680
Haven't.

335
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:10,360
How did you get my number?

336
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,639
Your dean, professor,
the bar, the hospital.

337
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,999
I can get your phone number everywhere.

338
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,919
Where are you now?

339
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,039
Thanks to you Chairman Wei,
I'm still in the library.

340
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,720
Why are you so slow?

341
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:26,480
And, it's teacher, not Chairman Wei.

342
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,039
Forget it. Come to the bar tonight.

343
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:32,560
-Remember to bring your laptop.
-Why?

344
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,159
-To supervise when you work.
-I...

345
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:36,680
Teacher Wei.

346
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,919
Don't you think you
take it too seriously?

347
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,159
It'll start at nine tonight.
Do not be late.

348
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,480
This is the new design.

349
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,119
I've asked the design team to redo it.

350
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,440
It's a combination of
the most popular styles.

351
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,080
There's improvement. At least
it now fits the public aesthetic.

352
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,919
But it's still trash.

353
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,360
Although Yun Ma's design focuses
on classical design,

354
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,399
its target group is young people.

355
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,399
Now, we want to recommend
some new artists who are the focus...

356
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,720
of overseas mainstream media.

357
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,200
Our first choice will be...

358
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,800
the most popular visual artist now,
Xun Ran.

359
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,919
Xun Ran.

360
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,720
I know him.

361
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,399
Fashion magazines commented that...

362
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,800
he's the new and dashing artist
who is popular among young people.

363
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,800
His works are bold and eclectic.

364
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,800
I heard that he sold a single...

365
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:39,279
piece of art at the highest price
when he was abroad.

366
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,360
Even the Snow Group
wants to take him in.

367
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,159
He has unlimited possibilities.

368
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,919
But until now,

369
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,279
he has never announced
his real name in the media,

370
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,639
And he never took part in
any business events.

371
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,360
How did you contact him?

372
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,919
According to the latest news,

373
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,960
Chairman He has already
gotten Xun Ran's...

374
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,360
domestic brokerage rights.

375
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,759
Don't you know that?

376
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,919
I thought that with your relationship
with Chairman He...

377
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,200
Good.

378
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:07,759
If Chairman He can seal
the contract with him,

379
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:09,840
the marketing costs for
Yun Ma's next season...

380
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:11,560
can be reduced by half.

381
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,639
Have a meeting with the
marketing and planning department.

382
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,919
Give me a solid collaboration plan.

383
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,080
Alright.

384
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,039
I was curious about the many bills...

385
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,360
on high quality goods for men.

386
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,960
So, she's not buying bags
but taking care of a pet instead.

387
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,360
Madam...

388
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,639
Say no more.

389
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,360
I know her temper very well as her son.

390
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,840
She has always favoured
that stray cat more.

391
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,800
Nobody is comparable to him.

392
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,200
I've been back for so long and
still she hasn't greeted me.

393
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:48,320
I have to get the news about
my mother from others.

394
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,840
I'll investigate at once.

395
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,440
She is used to things going her way.

396
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:54,119
Don't be angry.

397
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,960
Angry?

398
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,639
Can I get angry at her?

399
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,039
My mood is spoiled.

400
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,720
Cancel the afternoon meeting.

401
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,320
I want to take a breath outside.

402
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:10,840
You...

403
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,360
Stop right there.

404
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,919
I know that I'm the same as
the odds and ends in this building.

405
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,680
No need to accept my apology,
feel free to make things hard for me.

406
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,960
But I've never broken my promise before.

407
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,600
I'll pay you back no matter what.

408
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:25,239
Don't go.

409
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:28,560
This is the 107th.

410
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,999
This is the best that I can give you.

411
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,399
I even fought with my boyfriend
because of it.

412
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,399
I'll give it to you now.
Do whatever you want with it.

413
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:41,279
Use it to vent out your anger.

414
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,119
No need to pay me back.

415
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,480
You can take it back.

416
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:47,119
Really?

417
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,600
What about the police?

418
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
I didn't call the police.

419
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,919
See. Why would you make
such a big deal about a bowl?

420
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm sorry.

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,919
I've moved it forward. Any objections?

429
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:42,159
But I just paid for one hour karaoke
in this room.

442
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,999
The acknowledged work of creators.

443
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,680
What kind of title is that?

444
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,320
Where was the...

445
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,639
branding and value addition
for artwork that I asked you to do?

446
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,999
That title is too profiteering.

447
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,840
I can't do it.

448
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,879
Who gave you the courage
to change the title I decided on?

449
00:24:52,999 --> 00:24:55,999
You asked me to gather materials
in order to help me pass, right?

450
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,239
But we don't have exam on the
business thinking of businessmen.

451
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
So, why would I prepare
the materials for?

452
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,239
So, your mind is actually working.

453
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
Tell me then.

454
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,720
What kind of product is considered good?

455
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,200
The drawings will express...

456
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,600
the thinking of the creators themselves.

457
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,399
So, the creators themselves decide
which are the best products.

458
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,080
When the third party is admiring it,

459
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,759
they will feel it too.

460
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,519
I'll wait until the person who
likes this drawing shows up.

461
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,320
And then, he'll pay to buy it.

462
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,800
So,

463
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,159
if a creator thinks that
it's his best product,

464
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,999
then it'll be the best product
for others as well.

465
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,759
This doesn't sound like
that you will say.

466
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,480
You copied it from a book, right?

467
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:38,239
This is said by a famous
Japanese gallery broker.

468
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,399
He is a famous man who promoted...

469
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,720
Takashi Murakami and Yoshitomo Nara
to the whole wide world.

470
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,200
How many Takashi Murakami and
Yoshitomo Nara will there be?

471
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:51,320
And how many brokers can
wait until they succeed?

472
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,639
Before that happens, the gallery
would have wilted already.

473
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:55,119
Selling drawings is a business.

474
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,320
It's not that different from selling
fish. It might be even harder to sell.

475
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,519
Because humans have to eat to survive.

476
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:02,800
And be considered as tasteless
if they can't appreciate a drawing.

477
00:26:02,999 --> 00:26:05,919
And 99% of the people
in this word are tasteless.

478
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:09,279
You want to resonate with others
through what you like.

479
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,519
Why not capture...

480
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
the hearts of the majority
from the beginning?

481
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,560
Popularity is the key.
More so for arts.

482
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,080
You...

483
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:29,919
You like Xun Ran too?

484
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,119
I've been his fan for five years.
And I'm a hardcore fan.

485
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,279
What is his appeal to the people?

486
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,720
Even his name and identity is fake.

487
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,919
-Why would they like him?
-At least he is honest to himself.

488
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:45,239
He is drawing about himself.

489
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,200
Gloomy but innocent.

490
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,999
Shrewd but uncanny.

491
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,720
Crazy but strict.

492
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,399
He is like the combination
of a kid, an adult...

493
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,080
and also the devil himself.

494
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,759
Anyway, this is what I feel
from his drawings.

495
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,759
The one on the right is
high quality work.

496
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,999
But the one on the left
are the real fine work.

497
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:21,639
What? Are you crazy?

498
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,720
I can't agree with your point.

499
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:26,800
Speak Chinese.

500
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,200
This is just a bunch of nonsense.

501
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,440
No point, no subject.

502
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,119
Who says that it has no point?

503
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,279
The title for this drawing is,

504
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,519
wetting the bed.

505
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,080
Ning Fei wanted to go
to the toilet just now.

506
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:48,680
But he had been holding it in
because of the time limit.

507
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,680
So, from the shapes on his painting,

508
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,440
you can feel the flow of something
very powerfully.

509
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,200
But when he comes back,

510
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,680
he has changed his pants.

511
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,039
He must have lost control halfway...

512
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,960
and peed in the pants, right?

513
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:05,480
I hate you, Teacher Yan.

514
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:07,960
Have you seen him before?

515
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,519
Of course not.

516
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,239
You should read others' face.

517
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,919
Read what?

518
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,279
What are you doing?

519
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,759
I want your help to look at my face.

520
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,600
But...

521
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,600
But aren't we here to do the PowerPoint?

522
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,800
Why do I have to look at your face?

523
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,399
Game over.

524
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,200
Your turn to attack.

525
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:46,919
Okay.

526
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,840
The final aim for buying artwork...

527
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,200
with investment in mind...

528
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,239
is so that in the
secondary sales market...

529
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:12,360
The final aim is so that
they can buy artwork...

530
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,519
with a more stable value
in the secondary sales market.

531
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,800
The more popular the artist is,

532
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,639
the more stable the market is.

533
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:31,279
In a nutshell, artwork that
has gone through branding...

534
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,759
and artwork that is more recognized...

535
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,919
will be approved by
the mass more easily.

536
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,999
Continue to spin your words.

537
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,279
If you are so great,
don't look at the PowerPoint.

538
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,560
Can both of you stop coughing?

539
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,800
-How could you break a bowl again?
-I...

540
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,360
Maybe I've seen too many
bowls these two days.

541
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,919
Maybe I'm feeling numb now.

542
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,800
Why am I in such a bad mood?

543
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:13,440
It's already resolved but
I still don't feel good.

544
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,639
Calm down. He said that
you don't need to pay him back.

545
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:18,440
-Why are you still stressed about it?
-I can't take it.

546
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,639
I apologised to him so sincerely.

547
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,720
He wouldn't even look at me.

548
00:30:22,879 --> 00:30:24,919
What evil things had I done?

549
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,720
It's just a bowl. Does he have to be
like this because it broke?

550
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,399
Does he want me to restore it?

551
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,399
Restore it.

552
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,080
That's right.

553
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,800
Why haven't I thought of that?

554
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,720
Since we can't find its replacement,

555
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,999
we should restore it instead.

556
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,360
Restore it?

557
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,440
What era are we in right now?

558
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,200
Nobody will fix a broken bowl.

559
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,600
Broken mirror can be joined together.

560
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,560
Have you forgotten that I took pottery?

561
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,039
I'm a craftsman.

562
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:53,119
This won't be hard for me.

563
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm worried that what's
done can't be undone.

564
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,879
Just like the money
I spent on bowls today.

565
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
-This...
-Water?

566
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,080
What is happening?

567
00:31:11,239 --> 00:31:13,080
I think it's dripping from above.

568
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,320
What should we do?

569
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,879
-Let's go.
-Wait for me.

570
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,840
Anybody home? Your water is
dripping down to our house.

571
00:31:32,239 --> 00:31:33,960
Nobody is at home?

572
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,639
Impossible. I saw him coming back.

573
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,519
And I didn't hear him going out.

574
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,600
Something is not right.

575
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:45,159
Where are you going?

576
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,720
Wait for me!

577
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,560
Wait! Come down.

578
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,039
What are you doing?

579
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,480
I'm worried. I'll go up and have a look.

580
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,960
He has such ill temper.

581
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,200
We are like this now
just because I broke his bowl.

582
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,239
If you go up suddenly,
aren't you afraid that he'll...

583
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,960
If he is fine,

584
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,919
he will just scold me.

585
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,600
If something happens to him
and we help him,

586
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,200
then it'll be even between us
for breaking his bowl, right?

587
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,239
Don't worry.
Wait for me at the entrance.

588
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,759
I'll open the door once I'm in.

589
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,119
Be careful then.

590
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,360
Don't worry.

591
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,759
Is she insane?

592
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,999
How is it, Zhou Shi?
Are you in?

593
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,399
Oh my goodness.

594
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,879
Why is there so much water?

595
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,159
What if he's showering?

596
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,119
You'll see something embarrassing
if you go in.

597
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,720
We can't care about that.

598
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,960
Oh my goodness.
Why is there so much blood?

599
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,600
Did he commit suicide?

600
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:10,639
He killed himself for a bowl?

601
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,279
Ambulance. 102. Where is my phone?

602
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:15,119
-Wait?
-What are we waiting for?

603
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,440
He's going to die.

604
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:19,720
Can you hear something?

605
00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:22,200
I don't care about any sound.
He's going to die.

606
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,360
Should we call 110 or 1...

607
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Why do you go there?

608
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,360
What if you became the suspect?

609
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Don't worry. It's fine.

610
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,759
This is...

611
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,279
You've scared me.
Thank goodness that you are fine.

612
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,879
What is it?

613
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:53,080
Come and smell it.

614
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,560
I don't want to.
It's too bloody over there.

615
00:33:55,879 --> 00:33:57,560
Whose blood smells like dye?

616
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,119
Come and take a good sniff.

617
00:33:59,239 --> 00:34:00,519
It's fine.

618
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:08,959
Is it paint?

619
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,479
I don't think so.

620
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,519
He's still breathing.

621
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:37,959
He is fine. The cause
of his unconsciousness...

622
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,560
might be malnutrition.

623
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,360
It's easy for hypoglycaemia patients
to experience this...

624
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:44,120
if they don't eat for quite some time.

625
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:45,999
Haven't eaten for a long time?

626
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,120
But there's another reason
for being unconscious,

627
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,320
impact on the head.

628
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:53,439
I think he hit his head when
he lost his consciousness.

629
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,039
Yes. He hit his head accidentally.

630
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:57,920
Is it serious?

631
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:00,320
It's not that bad. He'll wake up
by tomorrow the latest.

632
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,560
But...

633
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:03,600
before we can contact his family,

634
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,160
which of you can go to the hospital
to settle some paperwork?

635
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,719
I'll go.

636
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:13,840
I still have a conscience.

637
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:16,959
-Don't worry.
-Remember to call me.

638
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,120
He said that he's an excellent painter.

639
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,800
Looks like he's not boasting about it.

640
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,600
If I think about it,

641
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:10,439
why is his drawing style
so similar to Xun Ran?

642
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,439
Could it be that he's Xun Ran?

643
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:18,880
Impossible. He's still so young.

644
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,519
Maybe he's Xun Ran's fan...

645
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,160
just like me.

646
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,959
This is a high imitation
of his drawing style.

647
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,920
Chairman, Xun Ran...

648
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,600
I found out about
Ning Fei's whereabouts.

649
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,920
He came back two weeks ago.

650
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,560
Under madam's arrangement,

651
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,719
he's now studying...

652
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,519
in the Fine Arts Faculty of
Guanghua Vision University as student.

653
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:16,080
He's now living in the garage
studio where master had lived in.

654
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,600
I just received news that...

655
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Ning Fei lost his consciousness
suddenly...

656
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:24,199
and was sent to Branch of Ninghai's
People Hospital by his neighbour.

657
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,759
Madam has received the news...

658
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,239
and she is now on her way
to the hospital.

659
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,279
Director Wang. I am He Yun.

660
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:41,320
Yes, I've come back.

661
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,719
I'm doing quite well.

662
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,360
Director Wang.
I need to ask you a favour.

663
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,239
Please give me a VIP ward.

664
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,759
I want to transfer a patient.

665
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,279
Alright. Sure.

666
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,360
Thank you. Alright. Bye.

667
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,560
Miss Lin?

668
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,519
Can you please tell me
which room is Xiao Fei in?

669
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:08,279
This place is too messy.

670
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,759
I'm going to transfer him.

671
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,719
Please wait a while.
May I ask what's the room number?

672
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,759
-1218.
-1218.

673
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,560
Alright. I see it now.

674
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,600
Xiao Fei.

675
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,080
Wake up, Xiao Fei.

676
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,600
It's me, Xiao Fei.

677
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,279
You are fine now. You can go back.

678
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,120
Isn't she the one who
courts a young man?

679
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:41,160
Xiao Fei.

680
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
How long has he been like this?

681
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,840
When can he wake up?

682
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:48,719
Don't you have any solution?

683
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,360
Are you just going to let him be?

684
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,239
He won't wake up so soon.

685
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,360
-Who are you?
-I'm his neighbour.

686
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,279
I'm the one who sent him
to the hospital.

687
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,759
Miss Lin.

688
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,679
Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry about just now.

689
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:03,519
It's fine.

690
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,039
My surname is He. I'm his guardian.

691
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:08,279
Nice to meet you.

692
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:09,600
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

693
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,360
Thank you for saving Xiao Fei.

694
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,199
-Welcome.
-This child...

695
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,880
is too important to me.

696
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:18,479
If something happens to him,

697
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,880
I'll really...

698
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,439
This is too much.

699
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,279
Besides looking good,

700
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,800
I can't tell what's so good
about this weak guy.

701
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,239
You are too kind. We are just
doing what we should.

702
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,759
We also found out that he
lost consciousness by chance.

703
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,880
If we knew earlier that
he's going on a hunger strike,

704
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:38,519
-he won't turn out to be like this.
-Hunger strike?

705
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,959
-Why?
-We don't know.

706
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,039
With how weak he is,
the doctor said that...

707
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,959
he hasn't aten anything for three days.

708
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,519
As for what happened three days ago...

709
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:52,519
Don't go over there.

710
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:00,519
This is just a bowl.

711
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,519
Do you have to give such big reaction?

712
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:04,439
I think something is wrong.

713
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,239
I think something is wrong.

714
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,560
Madam He.

715
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:18,679
I want to ask you something.

716
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,679
You are back?

717
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,840
His guardian came.

718
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:43,239
He is transferred to another hospital
and he has a nurse aide.

719
00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:45,279
There's nothing else I can do.

720
00:40:45,439 --> 00:40:48,840
But you don't sound like you are fine.

721
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,800
Zhou Shi.

722
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,279
I think I've made a...

723
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,920
fatal mistake this time.

724
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,320
What happened?

725
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,999
About the boy upstairs,

726
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,640
before this, I thought that
something is wrong with him...

727
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,279
for fighting with me because of a bowl.

728
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,279
I never thought that it's true.

729
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:07,279
What's wrong with him?

730
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,120
Obsessive compulsive disorder.
Have you heard it before?

731
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:14,120
That kind of illness where
it'll only happen...

732
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,400
to the CEO in a drama.

733
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,640
It looks cute
but it's not like that at all.

734
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,519
I remember that I saw a news before.

735
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
There was a boy who broke the cup...

736
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,320
he drank water with since young.

737
00:41:24,439 --> 00:41:26,239
From then on,
he never drank water again.

738
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:28,479
That time, I thought that it was fake.

739
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:32,239
I never thought that
there's really an illness like that.

740
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,959
Miss Lin.
This is not entirely your fault.

741
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,039
It's his obsession towards the thing
left behind by his family member.

742
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,759
That bowl is something
left behind by his family member?

743
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,239
Yes.

744
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,439
Ning family and Wei family
have known each other for generations.

745
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,400
Xiao Fei's father was a pottery master
when he was still alive.

746
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,199
It's a Blessing Bowl
he made specially...

747
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,640
for Xiao Fei.

748
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,679
It was a pair at first.

749
00:42:00,999 --> 00:42:02,920
Now, only one is in his hands.

750
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,920
And the other one was lost somewhere.

751
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:07,999
So, he has been...

752
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,160
treasuring it all these while.
