29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,359
Why are you here?

30
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,800
I just walked past.
I didn't hear anything.

31
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,240
Chairman Wei.

32
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,680
Let's stop for now.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,439
Miss Xue, let's talk next time.

35
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
Compared to Yun Ma Artwork,

36
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,639
I'd rather work closely with you,
Chairman Wei.

37
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,120
Miss Xue Zi was so passionate.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,680
You're so lucky.

39
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,040
Why is your ear red?

40
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,279
It doesn't look like it's red, it's...

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,359
Don't touch me!

42
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,600
Why are you here?

43
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm here to resign.

44
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,040
Remember to come on time tomorrow.

45
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,479
Okay.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
Count these in.

47
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,600
I'm embarrassed.

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,639
It's nothing.

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,079
Here.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,880
Ning Fei?

51
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,240
Chairman He, do you know him?

52
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,559
Take mine.

53
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,960
Should I send you guys back?

54
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,160
-No need.
-Sure.

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,400
Never mind then.

56
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,359
Fei Fei, we'll meet up during work.

57
00:03:56,999 --> 00:03:58,559
Okay, be careful.

58
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,479
Stop!

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,439
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

60
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
Why are you criticizing him?

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
He's not a good guy.

62
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
Are you familiar with him?
How can you say that?

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,719
He's the brother of my aunty.

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,919
Aunty? You mean Mrs He?

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,039
So what?

66
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
How can you say that about him?

67
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,520
I know what I'm talking about.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,479
You!

69
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,840
What about these?

70
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,359
They're heavy.
I don't want to carry them.

71
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,800
Lin Fei Fei,

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
next time, if you're buying
groceries with him,

73
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,639
you should just
kill yourself with a tofu!

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,359
Stand there!

75
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,319
She has connections with both
Ning Fei and Wei Qing?

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
Lin Fei Fei is not a simple girl.

77
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,639
I want to discover
your attractive points.

78
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,720
She managed to attract
both of them at once.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
Fei Fei.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,359
Are you really lending this shirt to me?

81
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,400
Of course!

82
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,079
Tomorrow is your first day of work.

83
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,240
You must amaze them with your style!

84
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,240
The most important part is you
can't lose to Zhang Ran Yu!

85
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,680
You're right!

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,800
I need to be confident!

87
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,599
Fei Fei, what happened to your arms?

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,400
You should ask your cat.
He's not obedient anymore.

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,440
How did Xiao Fei disobey you?

90
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,319
I've compromised a lot for him.

91
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,319
Did you know this? He insulted
Chairman He in the supermarket today.

92
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
Why did he do so?

93
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,240
He said that he's not a good guy.

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,840
Do you know this?

95
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,599
Chairman He is
Miss He's younger brother.

96
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,199
If that's the case, Xiao Fei
should've known him for a long time.

97
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:55,599
If that's true,

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,840
I think Xiao Fei's words
have some truth in them.

99
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,280
What do you mean?

100
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,919
The news said that He Wei is a playboy.

101
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,120
Wei Qing is a playboy too.

102
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,560
But you still like him, right?

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,680
That's a different story.

104
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:15,079
Did you guys really...

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,319
I've said this already.
We were only drunk that time.

106
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,039
Besides, I think Wei Qing's not
the same as what the news have reported.

107
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,879
He respected me.

108
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,240
Don't say I didn't warn you.

109
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,280
Wei Qing is very experienced
in relationships.

110
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,919
A person who has no love experience
like you would be trapped by him.

111
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,599
Don't worry.

112
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I have Brother Ming Cheng in my heart.

113
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
I will not fall in love
with someone else.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,039
There's something I need to say.

115
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,440
Tell me.

116
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,159
Don't you think
Brother Ming Cheng and Qiu Jing...

117
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,840
have something special in common?

118
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,919
You saw them that day, right?

119
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:04,319
I think it's weird.

120
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,720
You think too much.

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,520
They're just caring for each other
because they're both elites.

122
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,319
Besides, we know Qiu Jing well, right?

123
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
She's not interested
in having a relationship.

124
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,159
Yeah.

125
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,960
Maybe I think too much.

126
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,680
She's a black hole in relationships.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,079
Yeah.

128
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,440
Why would she like Brother Ming Cheng?

129
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,800
Why would she?

130
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,479
This shirt is nice, right?

131
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,039
Xiao Fei, what are you drawing?

132
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,919
I'm doing a design.

133
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,079
Our Xiao Fei is great now!

134
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,120
You're starting to
develop your business now.

135
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,560
I got this job out of nowhere.

136
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,319
I hope that we can come out with
galaxy-themed jewelries.

137
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,159
This is the first draft of
the design department.

138
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:55,759
Just have a look.

139
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,039
For me, it's the best
if you can make it simple.

140
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,280
You can do other things
on your own accord.

141
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,680
Although I don't want to say this,

142
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,440
this time, we're on the same front.

143
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,240
Your design would directly affect
the future of Yun Ma Artwork.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,599
If you can't touch her with your design,

145
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,400
many galleries would have to close then.

146
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,599
Why?

147
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,159
Ask your aunty.

148
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,120
Ask her the reason she sold
the art centre away.

149
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
You have half a month.

150
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,240
I hope you can do your best
and protect my father's legacy.

151
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,640
Why do you have the word 'Ran' here?

152
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
How did you know that?

153
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,919
A fan of Xun Ran told me this.

154
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,919
Who is that fan? Where is that person?

155
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,839
She's the boss of a company.
Her name is Xue Zi.

156
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,440
Xue Zi?

157
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:05,640
You know her?

158
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,880
You didn't tell me yet.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
Why is there a 'Ran' word
on your painting?

160
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,080
She said that only a few
people know about this.

161
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,640
I...

162
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,200
imitated him.

163
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
You can imitate this as well?

164
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,159
I'm not a loyal fan then.

165
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:26,880
How can I be oblivious about this?

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,680
Do you like Xun Ran that much?

167
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:29,919
Of course!

168
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,200
Many people think that
his paintings are obscure.

169
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,039
Just like what Xue Zi said,

170
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,200
although his paintings are good,

171
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
they don't seem
very pleasant to the eyes.

172
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:42,320
It's just like staring into the abyss.

173
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,760
You can't reach the depth of it.

174
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:49,560
But to me, I think his paintings
are not that depressing.

175
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,719
I think he's full with hope as well.

176
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
Especially with his recent paintings.

177
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,839
His touch is much softer.

178
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,640
They're more humane.

179
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,640
It's like he found a place
where he belongs.

180
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Is that true?

181
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,000
When can I see Xun Ran?

182
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,719
You'll have to wait until he's ready.

183
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
-This must be the new employee.
-She's beautiful.

184
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,839
Look!

185
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,479
-She is beautiful too.
-Not bad.

186
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:30,479
Hello, I'm reporting for duty.

187
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,519
Me too.

188
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,560
Please write your
registration number here.

189
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,599
Senior, you're reporting for duty too?

190
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,959
You're here as an intern?

191
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,080
Okay then.

192
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,839
I'm an official employee.
I'm working today.

193
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:48,200
Done.

194
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,880
Thank you.

195
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,399
Where's the chairman's office?

196
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,240
You can't reach him with this lift.

197
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
You must get to the top floor.

198
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,839
And use a special lift
to find his office.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,120
How did you know that?

200
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:30,680
I heard it from someone.

201
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,359
By the way, aren't you here
for Brother Ming Cheng?

202
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,120
I thought you'll go
to the investment department?

203
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,680
Do you think everyone is like you?

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Happy with just a Li Ming Cheng?

205
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,719
He's a nice guy.

206
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,519
But he's only within
Kwang Hua University's parameter.

207
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:46,240
What do you mean?

208
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,200
Having a relationship
in a university is nice.

209
00:11:49,359 --> 00:11:52,599
But now, I'm aiming for Wei Qing.

210
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,519
I'll go to the top floor now.

211
00:11:54,719 --> 00:11:57,880
I want to thank him
for giving me an opportunity.

212
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,880
Good luck then.

213
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,240
Of course.

214
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,719
It's my first time coming
to a working field like this.

215
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,680
This is so professional.

216
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:29,919
Shi Shi.

217
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,039
Brother Ming Cheng?

218
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,039
You're here for work?

219
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,440
You look nice.

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,599
You must be the new employee.

221
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:46,279
Why are you trying to get close to him?

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,719
Don't affect other people!

223
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,519
Wait in front of the desk.

224
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:55,440
Help me with this.

225
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,039
-Give it to me by afternoon.
-Okay.

226
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,560
Assistant An.

227
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,599
The chairman is busy.
He has no time for you.

228
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,320
I just wanted to thank him for this.

229
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:14,959
For hiring me.

230
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,200
You are hired by the supervisor
of your department.

231
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,120
The chairman doesn't know about this.

232
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,200
If you want to thank someone for this,

233
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,200
go and thank your supervisor.

234
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,080
Thank you.

235
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,120
Welcome to Yun Ma's
investment department.

236
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,479
You're looking for?

237
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,599
Okay, please wait.

238
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,719
I'll relay your message.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,959
This is easy.

240
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,719
I'm just a human telephone.

241
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,000
It's not hard at all.

242
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,159
Hello! You're looking for?

243
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,159
I forgot to welcome him.

244
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,919
Welcome to Yun Ma's
investment department.

245
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,959
Who are you looking for?
I'll relay your message.

246
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,719
Li Ming Cheng.

247
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,519
Why are you here?

248
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:13,440
Chairman.

249
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,279
Chairman, why are you here?

250
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,039
Why didn't you tell me about this?

251
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,080
I'll give you a warm reception
if you told me earlier.

252
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,240
I told you this already.

253
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
We must on the air purifier and
humidifier before the chairman comes!

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,039
And we must vacuum
the floor at least two times!

255
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:31,080
And we must clean the sofas
with the Dust Mite Controller!

256
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,279
Did you hear me?

257
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,159
No need for that.

258
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,039
I won't stay here for long.

259
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,279
I need to speak to her.
Continue your work.

260
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:42,760
Why are you standing there?
Go and pour some water.

261
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,599
Wait.

262
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,359
Do I have to pour my own coffee?

263
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,359
Do I need to pour it for you?

264
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,440
Do you think you just need
to stand in front of the reception desk?

265
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,760
Do you think you're a welcome mat?

266
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
Should I hang some red ribbons on you?

267
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,479
Is this okay?

268
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,080
Wait.

269
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,159
What?

270
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,000
You must call me chairman
when you're in the office.

271
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:31,919
Today is my first day of work.

272
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,320
I'm sure you're here to scare me.

273
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,320
It's because of this,

274
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,519
that I need to tell you
about some rules.

275
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,200
Technically speaking,
you're here for your job training.

276
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,240
That's why I'm giving you
first lesson today.

277
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,880
You must respect your boss.

278
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,399
If you're working with a company
and when you come to the company,

279
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:52,200
you discover that an intern
calls her boss by his name,

280
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
and speaks disrespectfully,

281
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,800
would you still respect that company?

282
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,719
If a company doesn't
have any basic rules,

283
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:03,800
would you work with that company?

284
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,200
I won't.

285
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,479
That's why.

286
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,120
I'm sorry, Chairman. It's all my fault.

287
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:12,800
I will learn from my mistakes.

288
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:14,599
Call Li Ming Cheng here.

289
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,320
Why are you finding for him?

290
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,680
Chairman,

291
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,760
why are you finding for him?

292
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,000
Here's the second lesson.

293
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,719
When you haven't reach
a high position yet,

294
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,279
you must do whatever
the boss wants you to do.

295
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
Don't ask too much questions.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,760
Okay. Chairman, please wait.

297
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,320
I'll call him now.

298
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,760
Hui.

299
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,320
Try and straighten your waist.

300
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:57,760
Yes. And keep your chin down.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,839
Very nice.
The reflector should be nearer.

302
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,599
Yes.

303
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,440
Very nice.

304
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,560
-Hello, Chairman He.
-Hello, Chairman He.

305
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
Come and do your hair.

306
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,039
What are you listening to?

307
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,279
Just some random songs.

308
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,360
Is it nice?

309
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,720
But I think your voice is nicer.

310
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,639
Is that true?

311
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:36,680
That's why,

312
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,960
you need to talk with me next time.

313
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:41,360
Okay.

314
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,440
I'll continue my work first.

315
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,320
I'll find you later.

316
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,560
How is it? Are you okay with the job?

317
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm still learning.
You must be fast.

318
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,279
You're someone I hired personally.

319
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,360
If you don't do a good job,

320
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
you're embarrassing me.

321
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,200
I understand.

322
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,680
Did you remember your analysis for
Yun Ma Artwork during your interview?

323
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:22,440
You did a great job.

324
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,999
Yun Ma Artwork has many problems.

325
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:27,119
In the past, there were
many reasons for this.

326
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,119
That's why I can't solve them.

327
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,320
But now, the problems are getting worse.

328
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,840
I need to investigate the cause of this.

329
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,639
But it's very complicated.

330
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:40,879
Those who investigate this case
are likely to be threatened.

331
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,239
And they're likely to be boycotted.

332
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,039
In a desperate situation,

333
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,159
I may need to sacrifice them.

334
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,519
That's why I need someone I trust.

335
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,999
And someone who is brave.

336
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,480
Chairman, you want me to take this up?

337
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,840
I don't like to force people.

338
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,279
You can reject my proposal.

339
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,720
Okay. I accept this job.

340
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,480
What are they talking about?
Aren't they finished yet?

341
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,440
You...

342
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,999
I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

343
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,320
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

344
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:33,919
It's not Chairman's fault.

345
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,279
Go back first.

346
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,999
Get ready. You'll start tomorrow.

347
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:39,399
Okay, Chairman.

348
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,639
Are you done eavesdropping?

349
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,560
I didn't hear anything.

350
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,239
I didn't!

351
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,159
How is it? Are you used
to the department yet?

352
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,360
Chairman,

353
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,399
I'm not even here for a day yet.
I can't say I'm used to this.

354
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Never mind that. I didn't want you
to stay there for too long anyway.

355
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,519
Where will I go then?

356
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,360
Chairman.

357
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,919
Pack your things and come to my office.

358
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,119
Okay, Chairman.
Please take your time.

359
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,760
[Lin Fei]

360
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,360
Just come at me!

361
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,519
Why do you need to resort to this?

362
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:05,440
You want Miss Zhou to
be your personal assistant?

363
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,560
I know she's important to you.

364
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,239
But she doesn't have any experiences.

365
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:13,480
I'm afraid she'll...

366
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,200
Of course I know that.

367
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,759
But now, our relationship
is getting better.

368
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,159
I don't want to waste all my efforts.

369
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,519
My personal assistant is the closest
to me. Besides you of course.

370
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,279
I understand.

371
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,440
Wait.

372
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,399
Ask Zhang Ran Yu to
be my personal assistant as well.

373
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:32,680
Zhang Ran Yu?

374
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Zhou Shi doesn't like to lose.

375
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,200
If Zhang Ran Yu,

376
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:39,999
a person who has more experience
competes with her,

377
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:41,960
I'm sure she'll learn faster.

378
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:46,279
You're giving Miss Zhou
a challenge here.

379
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,440
Hello, Assistant An.

380
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
The chairman is waiting for you.
Go in now.

381
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,960
Okay.

382
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,399
Chairman, do you need me?

383
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,960
Be my personal assistant.

384
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,800
What?

385
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,119
My personal assistant.

386
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,239
And help me with my daily routine.

387
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,399
Are you sure I can do it?

388
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:18,519
Of course you can't.

389
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:20,720
That's why I found you a competitor.

390
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:21,999
From today onwards,

391
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,279
you and Zhang Ran Yu will
be my personal assistants.

392
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,239
The trial lasts for one month.
I'll hire the best.

393
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:27,680
Senior Ran Yu?

394
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,879
What? Are you scared?

395
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,680
Are you kidding? I'm not scared.

396
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,759
My goodness.

397
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,800
She knows what to do?

398
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,919
She's been typing
for 20 minutes already.

399
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,480
Should I do something as well?

400
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
What should I do then?

401
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,639
Hello, this is the chairman's office.

402
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,360
At 3 p.m., he has a meeting.

403
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,080
After that, he has a meeting
with the designers.

404
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:34,560
He has a dinner
with the exhibitors tonight.

405
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,119
Okay, I'll relay your message.

406
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,119
Goodbye.

407
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:41,919
So that's all.

408
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:44,480
It's only answering calls.
I can do that.

409
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,440
Hello.

410
00:23:55,999 --> 00:24:00,639
He's not here. I...

411
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,480
I...

412
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,560
Oh, sorry.

413
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,039
If you have any questions,
please tell me.

414
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,119
I'll help you to communicate with him.

415
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,399
Okay, you're welcome.

416
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:15,399
Goodbye.

417
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,159
I think this job is not for you.

418
00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:21,879
I would've quitted if I were you.

419
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,039
Hello.

420
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
This is a document for the chairman.

421
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,919
He must sign this before afternoon.

422
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,239
Okay, I'll hand it to him.

423
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,119
Chairman, you need to
sign these documents.

424
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,639
Why are you here? Where's Zhou Shi?

425
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:54,399
Zhou Shi?

426
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,440
I don't know what she's doing.

427
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,440
She has been sitting there all morning.

428
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:01,519
Okay. Just put the documents down.
You can leave now.

429
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,320
Chairman, you have a meeting at 3 p.m..

430
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:08,039
After that, you have a meeting
with the designers.

431
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,080
You have a dinner
with the exhibitors tonight.

432
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,960
Cancel the dinner for me.

433
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,119
I have something else to do.

434
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:14,119
Okay.

435
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,960
Chairman, I think this job is
not suitable for Zhou Shi.

436
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,879
She can't even speak English.

437
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,360
I'm afraid that she'll cause
misunderstandings with the clients.

438
00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:31,600
Do you mean I should fire
Zhou Shi and keep you here?

439
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,600
Yes. I think this is an obvious choice.

440
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:38,840
The trial is just wasting your time.

441
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,879
You're quite brave, aren't you?
You're questioning my decisions?

442
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:43,039
Chairman, it's not that.

443
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,840
I'm not questioning your decisions.

444
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,320
Just do your own job.

445
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,360
You don't need to worry
about anything else.

446
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,480
And, next time, you don't
need to send the documents here.

447
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,960
Ask Zhou Shi to send me the documents.

448
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,279
Okay.

449
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:20,200
Did you pick up any calls
when I was away?

450
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:21,279
I didn't.

451
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,039
Next time, I'll answer the calls.

452
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,239
If not, it'll be embarrassing.

453
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,200
People will think that
our employees can't speak English.

454
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:29,399
Okay.

455
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,919
And, don't say I'm bullying you
because I'm your senior.

456
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,159
Next time, you can send the documents.

457
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:35,919
Is this for real?

458
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm a generous person.

459
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,560
Since we've to work together
for one month,

460
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,320
we should work with each other.

461
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,800
Can I ask you about
things that I don't know?

462
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,919
Senior, I don't know all of these.

463
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,159
And,

464
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,560
I don't know all of these too.

465
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,119
Can you teach me?

466
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,159
Okay, you mean this?

467
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,159
Look.

468
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,440
Wait.

469
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,399
Do you have any manners?

470
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,519
This place is only for
the official models.

471
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,759
You're just a part-timer.
You have no right to be here.

472
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,600
Let's not talk about that first.

473
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,119
For today's shooting,

474
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,039
we have the same workload.

475
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,639
Since we did the same thing,

476
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,480
why can't I use this room?

477
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
And there's no sign that says
this room is not for part-timers.

478
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,159
It should be my turn since
I've lined up for this.

479
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,279
You.

480
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,399
How can you be so unreasonable
when you've cut the line?

481
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,360
I don't understand.

482
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,200
Why did Chairman He
sign someone like you?

483
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:38,399
Great words.

484
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,919
Our magazine is
created for celebrities.

485
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,119
Of course we need to consider
the qualities of our models.

486
00:27:45,879 --> 00:27:49,200
Your behaviour is
unfit for our magazine.

487
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,399
Chairman He, I...

488
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,159
Go back and reflect on your mistakes.

489
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,279
I'll employ you next time,

490
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,039
if you do reflect on your mistakes.

491
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:58,560
Fei Fei.

492
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,239
Let's go.

493
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:08,480
Are you okay?

494
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,639
Thank you for helping me.

495
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,039
I saw everything just now.

496
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm sorry for this too.

497
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:18,159
How about this?
You don't need to change.

498
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,399
Just wear it back.

499
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,119
I can't! This is a famous brand!
I can't afford this!

500
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm giving it to you.

501
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,960
Just treat it as my apology to you.

502
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:28,600
I can't take this.
This is too expensive.

503
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,680
No.

504
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,519
Do you want to work for me?

505
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,680
I need an editor here.

506
00:28:35,879 --> 00:28:38,919
Even though it's not
as flashy as a model,

507
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,119
but you'll still work
under me officially.

508
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:42,360
Are you interested?

509
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,360
Sure.

510
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Thank you for the chance.
I'll do my best.

511
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay.

512
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,600
We can meet up more often then.

513
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:55,759
Meet up often?

514
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,320
Do you need to give an
obvious hint like that?

515
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,200
Fine, I'll give you a chance then.

516
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
Are you still working?

517
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,399
Chairman.

518
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,279
I haven't finished my work yet.

519
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,399
Senior Ran Yu taught me just now.
I should write them down...

520
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:16,720
before I forget them.

521
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,440
I'll wait for you downstairs.

522
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,519
Now, it's after work hour.

523
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,919
No need to call me Chairman anymore.

524
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,560
But I'm still in the office now.

525
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,480
I need to address you as Chairman.

526
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,239
Fine.

527
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:34,639
Chairman,

528
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:37,600
do you think I can
be your personal assistant?

529
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:39,239
But today,

530
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:40,840
Senior Ran Yu did everything.

531
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,320
I can only watch her
because I don't know how to do them.

532
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,519
Why? You're giving up already?

533
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:50,279
It's not that. I just feel insecure.

534
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,239
Aren't you learning already?

535
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,960
If you think you can't learn
everything in one month,

536
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,560
you can leave now.

537
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,680
Yeah!

538
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:02,399
I still have one month to go!

539
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,399
I'm sure I can be
your personal assistant!

540
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,239
Don't say that first.

541
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,119
One month is not long.

542
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,519
You're still biting your pencils?

543
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,720
I can't wipe it off.
Wipe it off yourself.

544
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,519
I hired you personally.
Don't embarrass me now.

545
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,960
Don't worry. I won't embarrass you.

546
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:33,960
I won't embarrass you?

547
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,239
Why did I say that?

548
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,200
That's not the point.
I should memorise everything.

549
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,440
Chairman, it looks like
your plan is working.

550
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,999
This is just the beginning.

551
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,960
If she can last through the month,

552
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,320
maybe she can help me in the future.

553
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,039
You have another helper
besides Miss Zhou, right?

554
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,759
When I was down there,

555
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,999
the lights of the investment
department were still on.

556
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,159
Li Ming Cheng is still working too.

557
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,999
Hiring Li Ming Cheng is a risky move.

558
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,879
I hope I made the right decision.

559
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,560
Is Chairman He still at He Wei's place?

560
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,519
She has been staying there
for three days already.

561
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,840
She really knows how to hide.

562
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,879
Let's go. It's time to meet her.

563
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,039
She's learning English?

564
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,159
Yeah. Introductory English for business.

565
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,759
She's been studying that
since yesterday.

566
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,600
Is she for real?

567
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:56,999
Do you need to say that?

568
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,999
You are holding this everywhere you go.

569
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,440
I can't bear to part with it.
I have to return it soon.

570
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,720
Sit down. Don't go to her
when you're wearing this.

571
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,840
Fine.

572
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:27,759
Who's there?

573
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,999
Don't open the door.

574
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,039
You're so weird.

575
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:42,919
Hello.

576
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,039
Why are you here?

577
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,360
Are you finding for Zhou Shi?

578
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,159
Come in then.

579
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,480
Okay.

580
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,279
Zhou Shi,
your Brother Ming Cheng is here.

581
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,039
Brother Ming Cheng.

582
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,680
Shi Shi, good evening.

583
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,480
Aren't you going on a business trip?
Why are you still here?

584
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,759
I need some help.

585
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:05,560
That's easy. Just call me.

586
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,879
I'm not looking for you.

587
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,999
Who are you looking for?

588
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,399
Senior Qiu Jing, please open the door.

589
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,879
Brother Ming Cheng is looking for you.

590
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:24,039
I thought I'll return it
to you next week?

591
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,320
Why are you here already?

592
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,879
I'm not here for my globe.

593
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,720
I need your help with something.

594
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,159
With what?

595
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,560
Something private.

596
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,279
Can we discuss this in your room?

597
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,360
No.

598
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,840
Senior Qiu Jing,
please help Brother Ming Cheng.

599
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,639
Senior Qiu Jing.

600
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Come in.

601
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,239
You want me to check these accounts?

602
00:34:08,959 --> 00:34:13,880
I remember you said that
physics major may be good in general,

603
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,759
but their logics and calculations
are not strong enough.

604
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,840
In mathematical logics,
I can't win over you.

605
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:21,999
That's why I need your help.

606
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,360
These accounts are
obviously problematic.

607
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,800
But I can't understand the reason why.

608
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,080
That's why...

609
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,759
This is so troublesome.

610
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,519
You can keep the globe for another week.

611
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,600
Are all the accounts here?

612
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:43,400
Yeah. The annual and
financial reports are in the pendrive.

613
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,239
I've censored all the names
of the accounts.

614
00:34:46,439 --> 00:34:48,439
This is the company's secret.

615
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,800
That's why you need to
sign an agreement before reviewing them.

616
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,400
Senior Qiu Jing,
here's your favourite tea and...

617
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,999
Don't interrupt her first.

618
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,320
She's in a crucial moment now.

619
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:07,320
I'm thirsty.

620
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,679
Do you need some glucose?

621
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:26,199
Here.

622
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,920
How is it? Do you have any idea?

623
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,320
The data are correct.

624
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,880
The transactions have no problems too.

625
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,039
The expenditures of
the galleries are fine as well.

626
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:51,400
The only problems here
are the entries of the accounts.

627
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:52,999
Regarding the galleries' income,

628
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,959
besides the low entrance fee,

629
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,279
they'll depend on the sales
of the artists' products.

630
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:03,679
Direct sales, selling with
a commission basis, and auctions.

631
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,279
These are the main
incomes of the galleries.

632
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:10,279
Do the galleries get the money
straight away after selling them?

633
00:37:10,999 --> 00:37:12,199
This...

634
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,279
I know this.

635
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:16,719
It's not certain.

636
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,439
Few buyers would pay
the full amount at once.

637
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,880
Most of the buyers would
pay the deposits first.

638
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,880
After that, they'll pay by installments.

639
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,999
What about the duration of the payment?

640
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,759
The shortest takes about three months.

641
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,920
The longest takes about one year.

642
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,759
I understand now. It means that...

643
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:37,519
according to the accounts, many buyers
haven't pay the full sum yet.

644
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,679
But the entries written
were all in full sums.

645
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,719
I'll check this immediately
with the finance department.

646
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,519
I'll confirm the total amount
that the company received.

647
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:58,920
Director Xu? I'm Li Ming Cheng.

648
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:04,840
Yes. I need the entry details
of this year's sold products.

649
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,279
Please send me that.

650
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay, thank you.

651
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:13,880
-Have a look here.
-Is there a big problem?

652
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,959
This.

653
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,560
The fund for the repurchased products.

654
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,239
This is problematic too.

655
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,600
There are so many loopholes.

656
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,279
I can't fit in.

657
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,759
Look, there's a loophole here too.

658
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,759
Senior?

659
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,320
Why are you here?

660
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,719
Aunty told me to come.

661
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,400
You knew she was here?

662
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,880
Why are you here?

663
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,360
You brought him here?

664
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,160
Xiao Fei.

665
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,759
You guys are really comfortable
with intruding my place.

666
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,199
How did you know I was here?

667
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,679
You asked Xiao Fei to bring you here?

668
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:28,759
I don't need him to find you.

669
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:32,640
Do you think I can't find you
if you hide here?

670
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,719
Xiao Fei, come here.

671
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:40,320
Why should I hide?

672
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,120
I just wanted to avoid someone.

673
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:44,679
Am I wrong?

674
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,840
Do you think that by hiding from me,

675
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:50,640
I won't know that you've transferred
your shares privately to someone else?

676
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:54,560
Do you think the old guys
in the board are dumb?

677
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,239
Ask them to find me then.

678
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,160
They wanted to kick me out
of the board, right?

679
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,920
So that your family can take over.

680
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,120
I won't hinder you guys then.

681
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,320
I'm your son.

682
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,920
Even if I want to take over the place,
we're still a family, right?

683
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,120
A family?

684
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,400
Ever since my husband died,

685
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,439
I've lost my family.

686
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,600
I'm not talented in business,
I'm not like the chairman.

687
00:40:24,439 --> 00:40:25,840
I'm not ambitious.

688
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,959
I just wanted to help
some children who love to draw.

689
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,999
I don't want to lose
Yun Ma's initial goals.

690
00:40:31,719 --> 00:40:33,600
For the shares,

691
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,840
I did that because I have no choice.

692
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:40,239
My husband didn't leave much for me.

693
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,439
I don't want his things to be
tainted because of the company's goals.

694
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:49,360
Instead of that,

695
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:52,199
I'll rather end his legacy myself.

696
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,519
Because of the company?

697
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:58,199
Tell me then.

698
00:40:58,519 --> 00:41:01,360
Did I interfere with the operation
of the gallery these few years?

699
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,519
Even though there was always a deficit,

700
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:07,080
didn't I think of ways
to solve that problem as well?

701
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,840
Xue Zi is not into charity.

702
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,679
Do you think she'll buy
a business with negative income?

703
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,759
Snow Group is a group
that focuses on luxury items.

704
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,519
Do you think she bought the art centre
because she wanted to do arts?

705
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,320
She promised me that
she'll keep the art centre intact.

706
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,560
And she'll give space for artists
in the Yun Ma Artwork.

707
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,080
She won't let them mess the business up.

708
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,719
So, you'll believe
an outsider instead of me?

709
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,439
Outsider?

710
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:33,920
You used the name of Xun Ran
to attract people.

711
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,999
And did some business
crossovers with it.

712
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,600
And spoiled the art exhibitions.

713
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,439
Do you think I don't know
that because I'm not here?

714
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,600
I did the designs voluntarily.

715
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,719
I don't want Uncle's gallery
to be taken away.

716
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:50,239
Xiao Fei.

717
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,679
I didn't sell the art gallery away.

718
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,840
I just handed it to someone
who knows how to handle art.

719
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,360
You were brought up by two art masters.

720
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,719
You were born to draw.
