Stay still.

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,640
Zhou Shi?

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,319
Over here!

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,519
You are here too?

33
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,399
Are you sure they are here?

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,360
Yes, this is the place.

35
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,920
There are water and mountain,
a place far from the crowds.

36
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,800
This is how he used to date me.

37
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,519
It is our deal to make them break up.

38
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,920
You get Zhou Shi and I get Wei Qing.

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
Save it for after it's done.

40
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,720
Have some confidence.
You're the most handsome boy in your faculty.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,759
We wouldn't have made the plan
if my good look works.

What brings you here too?

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Bai and I are supposed to meet here.

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,640
Really? He is here too?

45
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,800
Not yet.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,319
He has something to do in school,
he will be here in a few days.

47
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,119
You must introduce me to him.

48
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:26,000
I want to see...

49
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,319
How is he look like
to be your online friend.

50
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,399
Zhou Shi?

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,759
Come over here.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,679
Did you arrange this vacation?

53
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,119
How do you know?

54
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,239
A psychologist pay her patient
for a vacation?

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,000
Only a fool like Zhou Shi
would believe that.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,000
What else do you know?

57
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,239
You are here because you
have something important to tell her?

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
A confession?

59
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,799
You are just as smart as
Zhou Shi said.

60
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,679
Are you interested in working
for the Yun Ma Group?

61
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,440
No, you have Zhou Shi and
Li Ming Cheng with you,

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,639
you don't need me there.

63
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,840
So, are you really in love with her?

64
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,799
Do you think she likes you?

65
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,079
What do you think?

66
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:41,519
She likes you, but she is
unsure of her feelings for now,

67
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:45,000
especially after you turned her down
when she confessed her love.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,399
That made the situation worse.

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,359
Please, enlighten me.

70
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,959
Reassure her feelings for you.

71
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,399
She will respond to it.

72
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,199
Are you sure about the job offer?

73
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,919
What a coincidence? You are here too.

74
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,440
It seems like fate brought us together.

75
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,959
Are you here with Wei Qing?

76
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
You two seem to be
getting along very well.

77
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,160
If my memories serve right,
you were looking after him...

78
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,679
while he was in the hospital.

79
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,720
Yes.

80
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,880
I heard you once dated Wei Qing.

81
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,160
No!

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,040
You weren't in a relationship?

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,679
Why would you care so much about him?

84
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,600
Or are you in love with my nephew instead?

85
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:32,639
Let me get things clear for you.

86
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,040
My nephew is  a playboy.

87
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,000
Do not be fooled by his trickery.

88
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,320
Zhou Shi, let's go.

89
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:47,799
You just do whatever he says?
How obedient of you.

90
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,519
He Wei.

91
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,119
That is enough.

92
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,239
I am simply trying to prevent a
pretty girl like to be fooled by you.

93
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,600
Sister, I think Miss Zhou Shi...

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,679
could make the perfect couple
with Xiao Fei.

95
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,199
Perhaps you could be their matchmaker?

96
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,799
Indeed.

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,239
Zhou Shi, over here.

98
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,160
What do you think?

99
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,480
Director He, I am nothing more
than a fan of Xiao Fei.

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,000
There is no unusual relationship
between us.

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
That is good enough.

102
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,959
That means you have common interests.

103
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,560
It's better than wasting your time
on Wei Qing anyway.

104
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,720
She is now my girlfriend.

105
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,079

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,639

Fei Fei?

118
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,320
Chairman He, I thought it through.

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,919
I don't see how we can
continue this relationship.

120
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,359
I am sorry to have taken
so much of your time.

Fei Fei.

122
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,639
What is going between you two?

123
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,000
Madam. He, he is not my boyfriend.

124
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:52,239
He was always trying to woo me,

125
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,600
but his actions disgust me.

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,799
Which is why I am drawing the line here.

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,560
Fei Fei, we'll talk about this later.

128
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,440
Come with me.

129
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,320
Come with me!

130
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,280
What do you want now?

131
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,119
Did you hear what she just said?

132
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,959
She is not interested in you.

133
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,840
You want to humiliate me
in front of everyone?

134
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,280
Lin Fei Fei,
I'll ask this one last time.

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,239
Are you coming with me or not?

136
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
Not a chance.

137
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,119
Well done.

138
00:08:42,079 --> 00:08:43,680
This is truly interesting.

139
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,399
Are you okay?

140
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,559
I am fine.

141
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,559
Why are you mad this time?

142
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:01,399
What do you think?

143
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,160
You kissed me in front of everyone.

144
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:05,879
You even said you like me.
What were you thinking?

145
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:11,519
I kissed you because I liked you.

146
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,559
That doesn't mean you could just...

147
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,519
You like me?

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,800
Yes.

149
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,480
But you told me
you weren't in love with me.

150
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,959
What changed your mind so suddenly?

151
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:34,680
I was unsure of how I felt back then.

152
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,639
But I thought it through now.

153
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,800
So, do you like me?

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,959
I...

155
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,199
Just say it.

156
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,360
You do like me?

157
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,720
You don't like me?

158
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,480
Do you like me or do you like me not?

159
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,280
I guess I like you.

160
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,360
You either like me,

161
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,759
or you don't at all.

162
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,879
What do you mean by "I guess"?

163
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,519
You just realized how you feel,

164
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,480
why can't I have time to think it over?

165
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,519
Fine, I will give you some time.

166
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,280
Let me know the answer tonight, okay?

167
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,040
Fine, I will give you more time.

168
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:21,800
Let me know when you have the answer.

169
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,240
But make it quick.

170
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,280
Okay.

171
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,160
No.

172
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:34,439
You mean this vacation...

173
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,439
was never about your treatment?

174
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,959
You and Dr. Chen planned this all along?

175
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,240
I trusted her so much!

176
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:45,280
How much did you pay her?

177
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,959
A barbecue.

178
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,600
She betrayed me for a barbecue?

179
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,720
We had it in Turkey.

180
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,439
What are you doing now?

181
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,120
Now I am certain
of my feeling for you,

182
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,280
I can't share the bed with you anymore.

183
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,160
I am afraid I couldn't help myself.

184
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,759
Of course, if you don't mind,

185
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,559
I would share the bed with you.

186
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,160
Just sleep on the couch.

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,559
So maybe you should get up.

188
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
-How was it?
-That was amazing.

189
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,800
Is this your first time?
You were great at it.

190
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:18,559
This is a gift.

191
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
You should join me.

192
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,439
No, I don't want to mess up my hair.

193
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,959
Senior, why don't you join me?

194
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,439
No, going too fast might make me dizzy.

195
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,439
You are here.

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,120
So, do you how to drive it?

197
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,999
Of course.

198
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,480
I watch the F1 Grand Prix
in America every year.

199
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
Xiao Fei, what about you?

200
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,079
I played Crazyracing Kartrider.

201
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,600
Why don't we have a race?

202
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,639
The loser buys the winner a meal.

203
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:51,280
-Sure.
-Okay.

204
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,360
Let's go.

205
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
Go luck.

206
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,319
One, two, three, go!

207
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,240
All the best!

208
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,999
Take a photo for me.

209
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Come on.

210
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,199
You need crouch down.

211
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,399
Make my legs look slim and long
in the shots.

212
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,759
You must understand, crouching down...

213
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,319
is not the only way to take the shot.

214
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,280
-It involves complex calculation.
-Stop!

215
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:43,959
I want none of your science lessons.

216
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,040
Crouch down.

217
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,399
Get ready.

218
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Madam He?

219
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,319
You are here too. Where is Xiao Fei?

220
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,999
He is driving the go-kart.

221
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,959
Which of them is Xiao Fei?

222
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,160
-That one.
-The one in blue outfit.

223
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,480
-Xiao Fei!
-Xiao Fei!

224
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,319
Are you all right?

225
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,399
-Xiao Fei?
-I am fine.

226
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,600
Xiao Fei?

227
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,240
Xiao Fei, are you all right?

228
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,160
Why did you bump his kart?

229
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,879
Let me have a look.

230
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:33,840
Is your hand hurt?

231
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,519
Try to move.

232
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:36,680
Stretch your hands.

233
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,079
-Let me see it.
-Maybe we should go back.

234
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,120
No, I am finishing the race.

235
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,079
How do you feel? Does it hurt?

236
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,040
Be careful.

237
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:53,959
Aunty.

238
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,680
My senior didn't mean it.

239
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,360
I know, I was too worried just now.

240
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,759
Are you all right?

241
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,600
Are you okay?

242
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
I am fine, I can keep going.

243
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,079
-No!
-No!

244
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,759
-We should go.
-Just another round.

245
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,800
It's too dangerous. Get off the kart.

246
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,480
You scared me!

247
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,280
Are you all right?

248
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,959
He Yun only ever cares about Ning Fei.

249
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,720
She doesn't care about Wei Qing.

250
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
So, the rumours are true.

251
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,280
Rumours?

252
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,519
People say because of Ning Fei,

253
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,319
Wei Qing had a fallout with his mother.

254
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,800
We make use of that.

255
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,079
I told you to come back sooner,
you shouldn't push yourself.

256
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,120
See? You fell off.

257
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,600
Now you know how bad it hurts.

258
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,999
How is your sense of balance so bad?

259
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,879
And you watched the F1
Grand Prix every year.

260
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,720
My legs are too long,
they don't fit well in there.

261
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,959
That is why I lost my balance.

262
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,879
People with short legs
will never understand.

263
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,160
Hey!

264
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,959
Fine, stop sitting there.
Come over here.

265
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,879
-What?
-Lie down.

266
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,199
Come on.

267
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:44,879
What are you doing?

268
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,720
You look like you are in pain,
I am giving you a massage.

269
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,639
What are you doing?

270
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,160
-What is the smell?
-Pak Fah Yeow.

271
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,519
Where did you get it?

272
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,600
My senior always carries
a first-aid kit with her.

273
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,400
That is a good habit.

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,199
Stay still.

275
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,159
Take it easy!

276
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,199
I am being gentle.
Just stay still.

277
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,159
Not bad, you are good at this.

278
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,799
Of course I am.

279
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,120
Other than my mother,
you are the only person...

280
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,000
that gets to enjoy my
premium massage service.

281
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,120
Not bad.

282
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,199
You should give me a massage every day.

283
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,880
Fat chance!

284
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,079
It's done, try to get up
and move your body.

285
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,319
Well done.

286
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,919
I never expect you to have
this secret skill set.

287
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,159
Are you going to the campfire
celebration later?

288
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,559
I'll pass, I don't want to
see the people I hate.

289
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,199
I am tired right now,

290
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,799
I need to get some rest.

291
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:56,600
I can stay here and keep your company.

292
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,000
Never mind, you barely get
a chance for vacation,

293
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,360
have some fun.

294
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,360
But stay away from Zhang Shuai.

295
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,000
-Why?
-Because he likes you.

296
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,360
Fine.

297
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,480
I'll be with Fei Fei and
my senior, okay?

298
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,720
Sure, go ahead.

299
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,400
I'll be going now. See you later.

300
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,840
Right, you have oil
all over your body.

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,520
You need to get a shower.

302
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,159
Cheers!

303
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,039
-Bottoms up!
-Let's drink!

304
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,199
That is disgusting, he just broke up
and is now dating another girl!

305
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,720
He is such a jerk!

306
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,439
We didn't break up. I ditched him.

307
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,919
Why do I always get the jerks?

308
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,559
Perhaps there is special scent
in your estratetraenol.

309
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,000
That scent attracts the jerks.

310
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,079
You just said another word
that I don't understand at all.

311
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:09,400
It's INCI.

312
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,319
Also known as Estratetraenol.

313
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,199
It's a kind of pheromone.

314
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,959
In short form, it's EST.

315
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,279
Pheromone?

316
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,159
I know that too.

317
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,840
It's the delicious chocolate.

318
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,679
That is Ferrero.

319
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,000
Miss, can you please
be more intelligent?

320
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,400
You mean I am born to attract the jerks?

321
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:33,000
That is possible.

322
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,679
Why? I don't want the jerks!

323
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,919
No way! Why can't I attract other men?

324
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,079
Oh my goodness!
Grant me a good man now!

325
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,439
Why did you bring me wine?

326
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:53,600
You reached out for wine, right?

327
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,679
I want a man, not wine.

328
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,720
You have a man right in front of you.

329
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,840
Xiao Fei may be young,

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,720
but he is a man.

331
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,919
Yes, Xiao Fei is handsome
and he makes a lot of money.

332
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,480
He fits all the requirements.

333
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,000
What are you talking about?

334
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
Fei Fei is now looking for man
she can rely on.

335
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Go ahead.

336
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,880
Quick, he is taking the initiative,
go ahead.

337
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,760
Can I really rely on his feeble figure?

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,840
You said I can rely on you.

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,360
I shall bear with it today.

340
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
Can I rely on you?

341
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,919
Get lost.

342
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,679
Wei Qing is not here,
he must be inside his room.

343
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,720
What is your plan?

344
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,240
I will go to him.

345
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,919
It's better to realize my dream of being with him.

346
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,799
You will stay here and stall Zhou Shi.

347
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,159
What are you waiting for?

348
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,039
Confess to her while
Wei Qing is not here.

349
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,039
If you don't have that courage,

350
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:08,279

Zhou Shi?

367
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,319
Wei Qing! I miss you so much.

368
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,880
I like you so much,
will you give me another chance?

369
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
-No!
-Let go of me!

370
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,120
You still won't accept me
even I threw myself to you?

371
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,919
Are you...

372
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,880
Sick?

373
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,039
What happened to you?

374
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
Yes, I am sick.

375
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,799
It's contagious.

376
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,279
I didn't want to be with you
because I want to keep you safe.

377
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:31,640
Now that it's done,

378
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,559
you are infected as well.

379
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,600
-Let's start this relationship.
-No!

380
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,319
I never expect the
rashes to be so useful.

381
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,840
Can't you keep it down?

382
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,640
What? You just took the third shower.

383
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,640
What is going on with you?

384
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,199
Wei Qing is sick.

385
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,880
You told her your illness is infectious?

386
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,039
What's wrong with that? I am sick.

387
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,120
I only lied about being infectious.

388
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
What if she spreads the words about it?

389
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,799
She is the kind that holds
her reputation very dearly.

390
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:35,520
If she tells anyone she tried
to seduce me,

391
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,240
but got infected with this illness...

392
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,039
Wait! Even if she turned
the word around,

393
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,079
saying that I tried to seduce her,

394
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,959
her reputation will be ruined.
No man would want her.

395
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,360
Don't make her sound so evil.

396
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,480
Can you please stop being so naive?

397
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,039
It is my little warning to her.

398
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,679
Let's hope she won't do it again.

399
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,679
You were infected because of a hug?

400
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,240
That's not possible.
No illness is so powerful.

401
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
How is it not possible?

402
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,640
You didn't see the rashes all
over his body...

403
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,959
and his hands.

404
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,039
So, why don't you have any rashes?

405
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,480
I...

406
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,799
Maybe I got away fast enough
not to get infected.

407
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,640
If he is sick and it's infectious,
that means Zhou Shi is...

408
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,199
All you care about is her,
don't you care about me?

409
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
What else do you want?

410
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,360
I want my revenge.

411
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,959
How do you do that?

412
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,079
Do you remember when we
went hiking earlier...

413
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,039
and I almost fell off the slope?

414
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,120
Sure.

415
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:37,480
You will impersonate Wei Qing...

416
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,159
and send a message to Ning Fei.

417
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:55,405
[We need to talk, from Wei Qing.]

418
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,159
Me?

419
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,279
Lure him to the slope.

420
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,000
Let him fall by accident.

421
00:26:34,199 --> 00:26:35,279
What about you?

422
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,480
I will lure Wei Qing
to the hill as well.

423
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,559
Everyone will suspect him
after the accident.

424
00:26:42,199 --> 00:26:44,520
He would tell everyone
you brought him there.

425
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,959
I don't care.

426
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,840
I will just deny everything.

427
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:52,039
Do you think they would
believe me or him?

428
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,919
No, what if Ning Fei fell
and become paralysed?

429
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,520
That is not possible.

430
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:16,039
The slope is not that high.

431
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,840
All he will get are
some minor scratches.

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,199
No.

433
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,039
I am your cousin.

434
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:24,520
You won't stand up for me
after he bullied me?

435
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:26,520
I can stand up for you,

436
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:28,400
but what if...

437
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,600
I just want to make Wei Qing
look like villain, how hard can it be?

438
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,199
You won't even help me out?

439
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,039
Forget it, I'll do it myself.

440
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Fine, I'll help you.

441
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,679
You deserved it.

442
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,799
You should have
some rest last night.

443
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,079
I didn't know I would catch a cold.

444
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:09,840
You played the go-kart at day
and had campfire party at night.

445
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,640
Those are all intensive activities,
of course you would fall sick.

446
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:14,319
You could have said...

447
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,079
I got ill from taking care
of you last night.

448
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:18,919
Fine.

449
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:21,919
You are sick because of me, okay?

450
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,959
Do you still feel cold?

451
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,600
Much better now.

452
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:29,799
You should keep away from me.

453
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,640
I don't want you to be infected.

454
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:35,319
Haven't you heard?

455
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:37,799
The best way to recover from a cold...

456
00:28:37,959 --> 00:28:40,120
is to infect someone else.

457
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,480
Don't be so stupid.

458
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:45,760
I asked the concierges,

459
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,640
they don't have any cold medicine.
I will go out and buy some.

460
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,279
That must be bothersome.

461
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,559
Maybe you can ask my senior,

462
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,919
maybe she has it.

463
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:57,799
Okay, rest well.

464
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,240
I'll get it from her.

465
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,840
What are you doing?
Seducing me while I am sick?

466
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,279
I wonder if I could
get infected by doing so.

467
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,279
What is he not interesting at all?

468
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:58,600
Maybe...

469
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:01,480
it would ruin our teamwork
as strangers.

470
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,480
Maybe I should call this off.

471
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,199
No.

472
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,439
Skipping off on him
is too despicable.

473
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,400
But I still need to meet him.

474
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,959
Just bear with it.

475
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
Bi Qiu Jing!

476
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,079
You? Why are you here?

477
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,600
Who are you having the chess game with?

478
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,240
A friend of mine.

479
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:41,159
So, is he here yet?

480
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,360
Not yet, but soon enough I hope.

481
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,520
So, before he arrives,

482
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,919
why don't we have a game?

483
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,480
Sure, I have the time anyway.

484
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,640
So,

485
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,000
are you Bai?

486
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,840
You plotted long for this game.

487
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,559
Let's keep going.

488
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,360
Who are you?

489
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,679
Why did ask me here?

490
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:08,880
I am sorry.

491
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,880
Open the door!

492
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,679
Ran Yu?

493
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,720
Bad news! Wei Qing
and Ning Fei are fighting.

494
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,279
They are arguing about their mother.

495
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,880
They are dragging each other
to the hill, I am afraid...

496
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,720
I...

497
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,880
I lost.

498
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,880
You are distracted.

499
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,520
You have been contemplating
about my identity.

500
00:33:19,079 --> 00:33:22,240
You are confused,
so were your gameplay.

501
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,439
Interesting.

502
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,159
You planned so well just to beat me?

503
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,079
You baited me to play
the chess with you online,

504
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:33,199
you made me become interested in you.

505
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,159
And then you asked me out.

506
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,079
You confused my thoughts,

507
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,959
and finally beat me at the game.

508
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:45,520
You finally became more interesting.

509
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,360
If this is about winning,

510
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,799
the whole game would
have become boring.

511
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,079
So why did you do it?

512
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,679
I did it for you.

513
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,840
Are you going to confess
your feelings for me again?

514
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,640
I just started to feel like
you are special.

515
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,760
Of course not.

516
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,680
While I like you,

517
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,279
I found some fun.

518
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,799
You think being in love is boring,

519
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,160
but I realized in order
to win your heart,

520
00:34:17,279 --> 00:34:20,719
I have done so many things
I never would have done.

521
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,640
It's like I am an
entirely different person.

522
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,920
The most interesting part
is the endless variables.

523
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,640
It's like entering a game
with countless outcomes.

524
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,079
Such is the fun only love can provide.

525
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,759
Now that you said it,

526
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,200
it does sound interesting to me.

527
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,680
However,

528
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,079
this is not enough to change my mind.

529
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,559
I don't want to be in love.

530
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:49,200
I know that. Which is why...

531
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,920
I am taking this to another level.

532
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,079
Marry me!

533
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,120
Compared with love,

534
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,680
a marriage is truly full
of possibilities.

535
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,640
The problems and issues
we will face...

536
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:17,319
is increased to a tremendous amount.
On the same proportion,

537
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,239
so will the fun of it.

538
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,559
Yes!

539
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:24,920
So, will you experience the fun of
a marriage with me?

540
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:39,239
I shall see if there is any trouble
I couldn't overcome.

541
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,120
-Chairman.
-Wei Qing?

542
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,920
Were you really proposing
to her just now?

543
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Yes.

544
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,479
Don't you think this is all too rash?

545
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,479
Not at all. I gave it
a long and careful thought.

546
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,960
Long and careful thought?

547
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:06,559
What was your thought on that?

548
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,319
Compared with socializing with others,

549
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,719
a marriage is indeed
much more complicated.

550
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:14,319
I want to accept the challenge.

551
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,079
People think of a marriage
as a child's play,

552
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:20,360
you two see it as a game instead?

553
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,239
But life is just a game
on larger scale, right?

554
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,440
We don't want to miss out its fun.

555
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,999
I am starting to like you.

556
00:36:32,759 --> 00:36:35,039
Fine, as long as it makes you happy.

557
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,279
Zhou Shi is having a fever,
do you have any medicine?

558
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:39,880
I have some.

559
00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:45,120
You two are indeed a match.

560
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,759
Xiao Fei!

561
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,239
Xiao Fei, where are you?

562
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,279
Xiao Fei! Where are you?

563
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:04,960
Xiao Fei!

564
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,559
Xiao Fei!

565
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,559
Xiao Fei!

566
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,360
Xiao Fei!

567
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,960
Xiao Fei!

568
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
Xiao Fei! Where are you?

569
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,519
Xiao Fei!

570
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,680
Zhou Shi?

571
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,479
Xiao Fei!

572
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,239
Zhou Shi!

573
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,079
Zhou Shi!

574
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:57,999
Xiao Fei!

575
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,519
Wait there, I am coming for you!

576
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,559
He went missing in this hotel.

577
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,120
How are you not responsible for this?

578
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:20,840
Madam He, we showed you
the CCTV.

579
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:22,960
Mr. Ning went out on his own.

580
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,079
We have no idea about
his exact location right now.

581
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,559
Why don't you give him a call?

582
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,759
I wouldn't need your help
if he answered the calls.

583
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,759
Perhaps he went out for a walk?

584
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,160
Maybe you can just
wait for another while.

585
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:35,440
Go get me He Wei.

586
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
I'll talk to him.

587
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,960
Chairman He is not here.

588
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,079
I want you to get him back here.

589
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,799
Xiao Fei wasn't with you?

590
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,519
No. Why? He went missing?

591
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,999
He is not in his room
and he wouldn't answer my calls.

592
00:39:00,112 --> 00:39:02,471
Calm down, I'll ask around for you.

593
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,360
Bad news, he is gone.

594
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,360
Who went missing now?

595
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,920
Zhou Shi, she is gone too.

596
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:10,360
What? She is not in her room?

597
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,039
No, I went to her room to see
if she knows where Xiao Fei is,

598
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,479
but she is not there and
she left her phone behind.

599
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't worry,
I will find the two of them.

600
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Do you have to go to America now?

601
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:48,160
Wei Qing is there all alone,
I am worried about him.

602
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,160
Come home soon.

603
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,960
Don't worry.

604
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:03,960
I am just checking on him and
I'll be back if he is fine.

605
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,279
You must come back.

606
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,559
You must come back.

607
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,719
They are not in the hotel.

608
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,440
We all came from the outside,
there was no one on the way.

609
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,200
So they must still be inside the hotel.

610
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,640
We should split up and search for them.

611
00:40:43,279 --> 00:40:44,759
The playground, the campsite,

612
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,079
let the others know
once you found any of them.

613
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,039
Sure,  but we need to sort
out the luggage.

614
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,479
We will catch up.

615
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,400
Zhou Shi is having a fever,

616
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,400
they couldn't have gone far.

617
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,759
Are you all right?

618
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,279
I am fine.

619
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,200
Are you okay?

620
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,160
You are burning up.

621
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:16,239
I am fine, it's just a fever.

622
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,440
Did you hurt your leg?

623
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,999
-What happened to your leg?
-I am fine.

624
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,600
Are you hurt?

625
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:29,799
How did you hurt your leg so badly?

626
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,039
It's nothing.

627
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,079
How did you fall down here?

628
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:40,200
My senior needed to talk to me.

629
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,079
But in the end...

630
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,120
Wei Qing?

631
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,200
No.

632
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,719
That man wasn't Wei Qing.

633
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,319
He covered every inch of his face,

634
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:55,559
but he ran away as soon as I fell.

635
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,920
My senior would never do that.

636
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,999
What did he want to talk about?

637
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,039
I don't know.

638
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,559
Could it be He Wei?
