Happy birthday!

-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

172

-Brother Ming Cheng.
-Leader,

173
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
This is your first birthday
since I've joined the club.

174
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:49,559
Here's a little gift.
I hope you'll like it.

175
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,759
She's really our senior.

176
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,280
She knows her stuff.

177
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,720
This is the latest edition as well.

178

Senior.

179
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,879
You treat our leader well.

180
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,160
Put it back.

181
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,240
I can't accept this.
This is too expensive.

182
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,199
It's nothing. You can just treat it
as the club's new addition.

183
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,759
It's only a camera.

184
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll be glad if you like it.

185
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:19,280
She'll be glad if he likes it?

186
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,439
Zhou Shi prepared a gift as well.

187
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,840
What gift?

188
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,879
You can take it out now.

189
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:29,879
What gift?

190
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:31,720
I have nothing else.

191
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,559
I wrote some calligraphy for you.

192
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
Calligraphy?

193
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,360
What is it?

194
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm really envious of
creative people like you.

195
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,600
Unlike me,

196
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,519
I can only buy gifts every time.

197
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,879
This is Shi Shi's masterpiece.

198
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,720
I must take a good look.

199
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,800
-Let's have a look.
-Yeah.

200
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,240
Open it.

[Forever alone]

202
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,480
This is amazing!

203
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,079
Your blessing is quite different, huh?

204
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,480
Zhou Shi, you're really funny!

205
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,120
Our leader will count on this then.

206
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:04,079
Li Ming Cheng, your junior
is really nice to you.

207
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,280
She's concerned about you!

208
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,600
What are you laughing at?

209
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,840
Let me have a look.

210
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,280
How is it? I'm sure it's nice.

211
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,959
I put a lot of effort in it.

212
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,240
You have a look.

213
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,040
I think it's nice.

214
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,199
It's better than before.

215
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,920
Thank you.

216
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,720

218
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,240
Thank you. I didn't know
it would be that cold tonight.

219
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,079
Yeah, it's cold tonight.

220
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,720
Should we go to my house?

221
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,199
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

222
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,399
Sure.

223
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:05,840
Let's go.

224
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,160
What are you looking at?

225
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,480
I pity the cat. It's such a
cold weather tonight.

226

Did your friend find her cat?

227

Sorry, I need to do something.

228

I'll go to your house next time.

229

Don't go away!
Let me send you there!

230

No thanks.
We can meet up next time.

231

I took the wrong gift.

238

This is something I wrote for fun.

I like him better than anyone else!

281

You can't even confess to him.

282

And you dare to say you like him?

283

Yeah.

303
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,480

304
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,480

It's hard for me to find you, you know?

310
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,640
You asked me to stay here, right?

311
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,240
I asked you to wait
at the convenience store!

312
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,799
Did you say that?

313
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,199
It's smelly.

How dare you say it's smelly?

315

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,039
Stop your wishful thinking.

336
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,880
How can you call him your first love?

337
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:33,120
That's only your puppy love.

338
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,120
You!

339
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,720
That's enough. Let's drink.

340
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,880
You're quite good at drinking.

341
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,279
Of course.

342
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,760
I only get drunk in front
of Brother Ming Cheng.

343
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Because I know he'll protect me
when I'm drunk.

344
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,640
But now, you're drunk in front of me.

345
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,959
Does that mean I'm on the
same level as Li Ming Cheng?

346
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,000
Who are you calling a drunk?

347
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,360
I won't get drunk even if I drink more.

348
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,000
Fine. Let's compete then.

349
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,480
Let's see who can drink more.

350
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,559
Sure!

351
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,679
Wait for me then.

352
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,159
Let me decorate the surroundings.

353
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
Can you do that on your own?

354
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,720
Just wait for me.

355
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:41,480
She didn't answer my call?

356
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,439
The leader sure treats a lady well.

357
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,240
Are you insulting me?

358
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:25,480
Is that obvious to you?

359
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,880
What do you mean?

360
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:27,919
What do I mean?

361
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:31,159
Your eyes were on
Zhang Ran Yu the whole night.

362
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,199
Didn't you see that Zhou Shi
is drinking alone?

363
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,039
Only now, you know she disappeared.

364
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,640
She really wasted her efforts.

365
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,600
Wasted her efforts?

366
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,480
What are you trying to say?

367
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Go and figure that out.

368
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,799
I'm going to find Zhou Shi.

369
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,240
You know her location?

370
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,520
Where is this?

371
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,279
Why is this on your computer?

372
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,720
I have Zhou Shi's location.

373
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,919
As long as I know where she is,

374
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,919
I can just tap into
the camera beside her.

375
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,880
And just use my software
to display her location.

376
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,640
Software? What software?

377
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,159
She had night shifts in the past.

378
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,720
I made a software for this
because I'm worried about her.

379
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,360
You are intruding her privacy, you know?

380
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,760
Delete the software now!

381
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,199
You know how to protect her privacy?

382
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:33,400
Why didn't you try to protect her?

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,919
Give me the password.

384
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,319
Power outage?

385
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,919
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

386
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,039
What candles are these?

387
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,199
These are leftover candles
from my previous activity.

388
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,120
I've put them in the store after that.

389
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,640
I thought I've no use for them anymore.

390
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,159
It was unexpected
that I would use them today.

391
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
They have a special smell.

392
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,480
I feel like jelly when I smell them.

393
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:52,279
The top note should be
Muscat Canelli and jasmine.

394
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,199
The heart note should be rose.

395
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:03,319
The base note should be Ambergris.

396
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,159
Wait. You can't smell this!

397
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,079
What's wrong? It smells nice.

398
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:12,760
I told you already!
You can't smell this!

399
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,959
If anything goes wrong,
you can only blame yourself.

400
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,319
Aren't you overthinking?

401
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,679
What's the worst that could happen?

402
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,279
I've only finished my words.

403
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,199
My head feels heavy.

404
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Just let me lie on you for a while.

405
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,679
You smell.

406
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,880
You smell like alcohol.
Get away from me.

407
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,319
Why are you staying away from me now?

408
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,079
What about the times when
you wanted to be your girlfriend?

409
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,799
Wooing you and liking you
are two different matters.

410
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:55,039
You must know how to draw the line.

411
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:58,120
Let's draw the line then.

412
00:27:59,079 --> 00:28:01,919
Do you like me or not?

413
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,279
I don't.

414
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,279
I don't believe you.

415
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,919
If you don't like me,

416
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,439
why do you need to be involved with me?

417
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:13,799
If you don't like me,

418
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,720
why do you keep pestering me?

419
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:20,079
What about the contracts and the debts?

420
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,919
You wanted us to start out
as friends, remember?

421
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,319
They're all nonsense!

422
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,720
Those are the traps
you guys like to lay for us.

423
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,679
I...

424
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,919
You don't need to explain to me.

425
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,000
Even if I'm the
dumbest girl in the world,

426
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,520
I can still understand
your feelings for me.

427
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,919
Besides, I'm so adorable.

428
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,959
It's normal if you like me.

429
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,919
So, you'll behave in this way
when you are drunk?

430
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:54,360
Since you're so full with confidence,

431
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,159
why don't you tell Li Ming Cheng this?

432
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:02,039
Tell Li Ming Cheng that you're
the perfect woman for him.

433
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
All the school belles and elites
can just stay away.

434
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,159
They can't fight with you.

435
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,439
Don't flatter me like that.

436
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,159
I'm embarrassed now.

437
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,679
Why do you like me so much?

438
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,799
I can't answer your question.

439
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,640
I'm so troubled.

440
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,480
Actually,

441
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:30,919
you're quite handsome.

442
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,959
But you're a bit old.

443
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:36,919
Your complexion is not bad.

444
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,640
I won't be embarrassed
if I bring you out.

445
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,679
That's enough already.

446
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,679
But it's a pity.

447
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,279
I have Brother Ming Cheng already.

448
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,199
Even if I'm perfect for you,

449
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,919
you can only give up on me.

450
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,480
Stop flattering yourself.

451
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,959
I need you because
I need to treat my sickness.

452
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,360
Treat your sickness?

453
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,520
What kind of sickness?

454
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,159
Are you love sick?

455
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,880
Such a poor child.

456
00:30:10,439 --> 00:30:11,720
How about this?

457
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,240
Since we're drinking tonight,

458
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:17,919
I'll let you confess to me tonight.

459
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,959
I'll treat your love sickness.

460
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,720
Come.

461
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
I'll listen to every word you say.

462
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,079
I have nothing to say.

463
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,120
I don't believe you.

464
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,799
You always lie to yourself.

465
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,199
Let me ask you this question.

466
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,679
Why do you like me?

467
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,600
Why are you always pestering me?

468
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,279
I like you because
I'm not allergic to you.

469
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,439
I like you because
you're young and beautiful.

470
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,000
I know all of these.

471
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,319
Tell me something I don't know.

472
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,959
I like you because you eat a lot
and you are strong.

473
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,079
I like you because you're frank.

474
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:08,120
You don't hide anything.

475
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,720
And then,

476
00:31:11,439 --> 00:31:14,079
I like you because you are tough
and down-to-earth.

477
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,480
You do everything on your own.

478
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,880
You don't take advantage of anyone.

479
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,079
And,

480
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,400
you're a coward.

481
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,640
But you're full with confidence
when you're drunk.

482
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,199
When you're not drinking,

483
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,159
you're a coward.

484
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,760
That's too much!

485
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,079
Actually, you don't need to change
because of someone else.

486
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,600
I'm sure there's someone out there
that will love the real you.

487
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,600
You don't need to be the very best.

488
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,760
You should just be yourself.

489
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,319
Give me some reactions.

490
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,079
It's my first time praising
other people, you know?

491
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,760
♪ My fringe isn't listening to me well ♪

492

493

Thank you for praising me.

494
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,720
Is this good enough for you?

495
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,039

00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,240
Just treat me as a crazy girl.

514
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,799
What is this? Are you crazy
when you're drunk?

515
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:55,159
Just treat this as a dream.

516
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
I've drank too much already.

517
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,159
I'll forget everything tomorrow.

518
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,720
Let's make your dream...

519
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,039

524
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:24,360
How is it?

525
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,600
I think they're fixing the cables.

526
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,160
All the areas here are experiencing it.

527
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:30,519
It may take around one hour
to return to normal.

528
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,799
Since we have nothing to do,

529
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:38,600
why don't we view the moon together?

530
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
There's a full moon today.

531
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:41,999
Full moon?

532
00:34:43,759 --> 00:34:44,920
When there's a full moon,

533
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,279
The moon will shift to the other side
of the sun and forms a 180° shift.

534
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,279
At the same time,
the tidal force will be the highest.

535
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,279
Rumour says that during these times,

536
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,440
the animals will come out and mate.

537
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,400
Why do we have a power outage now?

538
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:02,400
Humans have weak
control over themselves.

539
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,120
They surely can't control themselves.

540
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,079
No, I need to find them.

541
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,120
Where can you find her?

542
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,600
Do you know his house?

543
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,400
I'll search it with Baidu,
or I'll call the cops.

544
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,559
Call the cops?

545
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,039
How?

546
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:17,920
A man and a woman
are in a room together.

547
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,200
Let's not talk about what'll happen.

548
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,840
Even if anything happened,

549
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:24,640
it's too late for you to go there.

550
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,999
Why are you so calm?

551
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:33,759
Aren't you worried about Zhou Shi?

552
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:36,440
What if she was bullied
by Wei Qing because she's drunk?

553
00:35:36,799 --> 00:35:38,279
I believe Shi Shi.

554
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,360
She dares to drink with him.

555
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:42,999
It shows that she believes Wei Qing.

556
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,759
You do understand her well.

557
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,999
Of course.

558
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,920
I watched over her since she was small.

559
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,920
She's just like my own sister.

560
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,279
Your own sister?

561
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
It's ruined. It's impossible now.

562
00:35:58,479 --> 00:35:59,759
Impossible?

563
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:01,279
What do you mean?

564
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,640
It's nothing.

565
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,360
Let's go and view the moon.

566
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:06,239
Okay.

567
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:27,479
This is so comfortable.

568
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:42,880
When did my ceilings
become so high?

569
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,120
When did my room become so big?

570
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,440
There's milk too?

571
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:06,120
This is so nice.

572
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,999
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

573
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:22,640
Do you like me or not.

574
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:30,719
Oh no.

575
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,799
Yesterday, I went to the KTV.

576
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,519
And I got drunk.

577
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,239
Why did I wake up in Wei Qing's house?

578
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,279
I must be dreaming.

579
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,920
I must've been influenced by him.

580
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,319
When I wake up from this,

581
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,600
I'm sure I'm in my bedroom.

582
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:11,200
I didn't stay overnight in his house.

583
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,039
And nobody changed my clothes too.

584
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,960
I'm sure my undergarments are around.

585
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,920
Why did I drink?

586
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,559
Why did I drink with Wei Qing?

587
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,120
Wait.

588
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,079
Where's Wei Qing?

589
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,799
The hiring season is coming soon.

590
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:46,400
The HR department has already
chose some talents from top schools.

591
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,200
They may be placed in the
investment department and the SBD.

592
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,519
They'll handle the subsidiary
company's assets and the annual report.

593
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,279
They'll handle the branches as well.

594
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,559
I've sent the details to your email.

595
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:02,279
Okay, I'll view them later.

596
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,400
Mandy had applied for a maternity leave.

597
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,999
Is there anyone suitable
to be my personal assistant?

598
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't have one in mind yet.

599
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Do you want to choose someone
from the company?

600
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Don't be in a rush.

601
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,880
I may have someone in mind.

602
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,600
Is there anything else?

603
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,719
The board of directors are almost here.

604
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,160
Chairman He is absent
because he's unwell.

605
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,360
Okay.

606
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,039
That's all for now.

607
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,039
Tell everyone that the online
meeting will start in five minutes.

608
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,880
No!

609
00:39:32,999 --> 00:39:34,360
I must ask him!

610
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:43,999
Wei...

611
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,160
Wait,

612
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,880
I must not let other people hear me.

613
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:02,160
This is the operating condition of
Yun Ma Artwork in three years.

614
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,519
From the data,

615
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:06,360
we can see that
it's been incurring losses.

616
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:08,680
Last year, we had red numbers too.

617
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:09,920
I know.

618
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,559
I've seen the report already.

619
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,400
I don't need an analysis now.

620
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:14,880
I need solutions to this.

621
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,519
I want to listen to everybody's opinion,
regarding the operating condition...

622
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,120
of the art centre.

623
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,759
The gallery is the one that
incurred the most losses.

624
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,200
Although the art market
is constantly adjusting,

625
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,719
and it's normal for galleries
to incur losses,

626
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,680
under this circumstance,

627
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,880
our number of gallery is increasing.

628
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,039
I think this is a mistake from
the management team.

629
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,999
I recommend we should change
the management team.

630
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,840
You mean I should fire Chairman He?

631
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,400
And find someone else to lead the team?

632
00:40:55,799 --> 00:40:57,120
Even if we want to do that,

633
00:40:57,319 --> 00:40:59,079
we need suitable candidates.

634
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,400
In my eyes,

635
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,960
there's nobody else that understands
a gallery better than him.

636
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,479
But if anyone of you thinks
that you can take his place,

637
00:41:13,759 --> 00:41:15,600
you can recommend yourself too.

638
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:45,960
Fine.

639
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Since there's no candidate,

640
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,360
please stop thinking about the change
we need to make in the team.

641
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,400
And think of solutions.

642
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,880
In our industry chain,
our galleries can only incur losses.

643
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,160
According to what I know,

644
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,160
there are many people that
want to buy Yun Ma Artwork.

645
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,239
For example, the Snow Group.
