You are back. That's fast.

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,079
Did you take a bath already?

31
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,240
Of course. You can smell me if you want.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,240
Fine.

33
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:25,999
Goodnight.

Goodnight.

We haven't turned off the lights.
Let me turn them off.

00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
No need.

That's amazing.

I have to check my results

I won't go to the company with you.

Alright.

But I have a mission for you.

43
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:07,040
What mission?

44
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,880
You have to take the public elevator.

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,760
No. I can't take it without you.

46
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,800
I already told Assistant An.
He'll accompany you.

Why are you here?

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,079
We are worried about you.
So, we came here to see you.

58
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,520
No. He didn't.

What are you doing here?

61
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:15,840
Zhou Shi lives in your home.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,159
We need to check if you
have ill intention or not.

63
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,800
This is not her first time in my house.

64
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:23,280
This time is different.

65
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,960
You were studying last time
and had no time or other things.

66
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,919
This time, a man and woman are
all alone under the same roof.

67
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,199
And this is so far.
How can I be sure of your intention?

68
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,759
Goddess of study. Inspect her.

They smell the same cologne.

70
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,720
That's true.
And this is a man's cologne.

71
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,560
Tell the truth. What happened?

72
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,319
She is staying in my house.

73
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,879
It's normal that
she smells like me, right?

74
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,039
Yes. I happened to go pass him
when he was...

75
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,479
spritzing on his cologne.
It's normal if I smell like him.

76
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:16,879
That makes sense too.

77

The company's group chat is discussing
about you taking the elevator.

100
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:36,440
I became talk of the day
because I took an elevator.

101
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,440
So, do I have to take it
once in a while...

102
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,520
so that they'll have
something to talk about?

103
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,919
Looks like Miss Zhou's treatment...

104
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,359
is really effective.

105
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,280
Yes. Maybe I can
really recover completely.

Are you trying to go for a cute style?

126
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:59,279
Didn't you say that
I'm too ostentatious?

127
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,599
How is it?
This bike is low-key enough, right?

128
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,479
But a man like you riding a bike
like this is even more ostentatious.

00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:28,640
Hello, Director He.

140
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
Zhou Shi. Have a seat.

141
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
Director He.

142
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,320
Chairman. Have a seat.

143
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,519
Director He. The chairman is here...

144
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,519
to discuss with you about
Yun Ma Artwork's shares.

145
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,760
What are you thinking then, chairman?

146
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:58,000
He hopes that you can transfer
your shares to him.

147
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,320
No.

148
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,760
Director He.

149
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,479
You transferred
all your shares to He Wei.

150
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,240
But it has been proven that...

151
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,359
Regardless of the operational
or professional aspects,

152
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,560
he is not capable to
handle either of that.

153
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,640
Especially this time.
He had treated Xue Zi lightly...

154
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,120
and put Yun Ma Artwork into a crisis.

155
00:11:18,359 --> 00:11:20,479
If I transfer any more shares to him,

156
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,560
then I will set
Yun Ma Artwork to doom.

157
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,159
So, I need you to transfer
your shares to me.

158
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,760
I promise you.

159
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,440
You'll still have full control...

160
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,320
over Yun Ma Artwork.

161
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,760
I won't interfere.

162
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,399
Is this a plot you plan with Xue Zi?

163
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:39,880
Both of you are
conspiring in the dark...

164
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,359
in order to trick me from
giving you my shares.

165
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:43,839
In that way,

166
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,839
you'll be able to own
Yun Ma Artwork completely.

167
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,359
He Wei told you about this, right?

168
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,320
That's unimportant.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,599
You just need to answer me.

170
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,919
Yes or no.

171
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,359
No.

172
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,919
Director He. You knew that chairman
overrode all objections...

173
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,120
to organise an art exhibition
for Xun Ran.

174
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,479
He did it for the interest
of Yun Ma Artwork,

175
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,320
not to earn money only.

176
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,120
Moreover,

177
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,919
both of you are in
a peculiar relationship.

178
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,599
Give him a chance.

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,800
I believe that Mr. Wei Heng...

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
will want you to do that too.

181
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,519
About my husband,

182
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,039
if I could transfer my shares to him,

183
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,159
I would have done it 10 years ago.

184
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,440
As long as Yun Ma Artwork
is still in my hands,

185
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,320
I'll feel that my husband
is still with me.

186
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,640
If I really give it to him,

187
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,039
then my husband...

188
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:54,800
will truly be gone.

189
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:56,719
Mother.

190
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
If you can just give me your shares,

191
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,279
Yun Ma Artwork will still
belong to you and my father.

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Chairman.

193
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,279
Let me think about it.

194
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,519
Alright. Think about it then.

195
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,519
I hope that you can
make a decision soon.

196
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,320
So,

197
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,880
if I ask He Wei to transfer
the shares back to me,

198
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,640
are you willing to
transfer your shares...

199
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,880
to me as well?

200
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,479
I'm willing to do that.

201
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,359
Thank you.

202
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,479
Do you think she will transfer
the shares to you?

203
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,919
Of course not.

204
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,719
I already told Wei An.

205
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,800
As soon as He Wei
gives her back her shares,

206
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,680
I'll transfer my shares to her too.

207
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,440
You already planned this from the start.

208
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
Why don't you tell her that?

209
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,880
If I tell her that myself,

210
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:07,240
I'm afraid that she'll suspect me
for having another motive.

211
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,919
Things are so difficult for you.

212
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,560
You are ready to give
your shares to her willingly?

213
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,080
It's not about willing or not.

214
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,640
I kept Yun Ma Artwork's shares...

215
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,479
just in case that if
Yun Ma Artwork is ever in a crisis,

216
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,560
I can use my position as
a shareholder to save it.

217
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,560
So, of course I'm willing to do it.

218
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,599
Moreover, I'm giving them to my mother.

219
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,120
Not He Wei.

220
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:27,200
I never thought that...

221
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,919
you look quite handsome
when you are serious.

222
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,200
What is it?

223
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,320
You finally fall in love with me?

224
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,800
What an egomania.
Forget what I ever said.

225
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,159
But Xue Zi would have
thought about this already.

226
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,359
If that's the case,

227
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:46,880
why would she buy off
the shares in large quantities?

228
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,519
Maybe she hopes that she can
reap the profits while you and He Wei...

229
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,120
fight with each other.

230
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,719
It's not as simple as that.

231
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,039
Looks like I've met my opponent.

232
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,359
She is indeed good at this.

233
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,760
Forget it. Don't think about it.

234
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:04,159
You can't find a way anyway.

235
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
Let's think about
what we should do next.

236
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:08,719
I already know.

237
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,519
Watch a movie.

238
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,519
-I want the whole row.
-Are you trying to book the whole place?

239
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,200
It's just the two of us.

240
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,640
Why did you ask Assistant An
to buy so many tickets?

241
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:32,760
Do you think I'll sit together
with so many strangers?

242
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,578
[Don't you think we are here as
the guardians, Qiu Jing?]

243
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:01,578
[I agree. Say something, Zhou Shi.]

244
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:15,778
[I'm sorry.]

245
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,671
[I'll treat you to a meal later.]

246
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:29,086
[Conveyor belt sushi? We can each
take a side and stay out of his way.]

247
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:33,301
[Yes, good idea.]

248
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,080
Stop playing with your phone.
Watch the movie.

249
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,440
This is my first time having
a private meal in a restaurant.

250
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,919
And I'm not even full.

251
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,399
There are so many dishes.
You are still hungry?

252
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,560
You dare mention that?
When we eat with friends,

253
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,960
we should eat together, right?

254
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,039
Now, all friends were there.

255
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,639
But we each had a table.

256
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,919
It was like I was a lonely old lady
who cooked a meal...

257
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,119
and waited for my children to come back
and eat but they never did.

258
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,960
for which I didn't have the appetite.

259
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,800
You are exaggerating.

260
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,680
I'm not exaggerating it.

261
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,279
He is such a big shot.

262
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,680
He booked the whole
movie theatre and restaurant.

263
00:17:28,879 --> 00:17:30,360
He didn't fully book it, right?

264
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,639
Yes. He just reserved a dozens
of tables to surround us in.

265
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
Is this how he plays with his money?

266
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,840
I think he's not trying to flaunt.

267
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,759
He's ill.

268
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,960
He is always wearing gloves
when he goes out.

269
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,480
And he won't easily touch anything.

270
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,440
When we ate,

271
00:17:47,639 --> 00:17:49,279
he was extremely picky
about the cleanliness...

272
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,720
of the restaurant and the
appearance of the waiters.

273
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:54,519
This shows that he
has serious mysophobia.

274
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,039
But according to my observation,
compared with objects,

275
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,440
he fears being in contact
with humans more.

276
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,279
We've gone out so many times.

277
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,519
But he never took
the initiative to touch us.

278
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,680
It proves that he is aloof.

279
00:18:06,879 --> 00:18:09,999
No. He never even physically touches...

280
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,639
Assistant An who is always by his side.

281
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:14,080
Actually, more accurately,

282
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,960
he never touched anyone
other than Zhou Shi.

283
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,720
I think you are right.

284
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,239
But you said that he has mysophobia.
It's normal that he kept his distance.

285
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,639
I thought so too in the beginning.

286
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Until I noticed a detail
that I've never noticed...

287
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,119
a few days ago.

288
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
Wei Qing had never physically touches...

289
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,480
any of his ex-girlfriends.

290
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:38,440
No matter how close the paparazzi
sneaked in to take a photo,

291
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,399
you can see that they kept distance.

292
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:42,360
This is enough to prove that...

293
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:45,399
he fears bodily contact with others.

294
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,680
Or should I say,

295
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,239
he can't be touched by others.

296
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,480
You read the book about allergy
a few days ago...

297
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,879
because of him, right?

298
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,759
Is Wei Qing allergic to other humans?

299
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,279
It's true then.

300
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,879
But from what I can see,

301
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:08,039
allergy is not the only cause that makes
him keep away from others.

302
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,279
I think he has some mental issues.

303
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,879
I think you should put your
English name as Sherlock.

304
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,960
Is he really ill?

305
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,320
Come over here.

306
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:38,159
He's allergic to someone's touch.

307
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,200
And he'll have allergic reaction too
when his enochlophobia kicks in.

308
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,680
But strangely enough,
he is not allergic to me only.

309
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,480
So, he wants to use you...

310
00:19:47,639 --> 00:19:50,320
-to help him with his illness.
-Yes.

311
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,360
I think it has shown some results.

312
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,879
That's why I invited you both.

313
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,800
We know each other well.
So, he can be more relaxed.

314
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,080
But you need to act like
you don't know about anything.

315
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,919
I'm afraid that it'll stress him out.

316
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,279
Don't worry.
I'm an expert in acting dumb.

317
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,360
If you need anything
from now on, tell me. I...

318
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,759
love to help others.

319
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,320
I think you are just
interested in his illness.

320
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,600
Alright now. Since you are
just helping him out,

321
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,639
we don't need to worry.

322
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,480
If you face any difficulties
from now on, you can come to us.

323
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,639
Thank you.

324
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,239
I'm going to sleep now.

325
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,200
Wei Qing, thank you for
treating us tonight. Goodnight.

326
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,960
Let's play again when you are free.

327
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,680
You are very interesting.

328
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,399
Let me through.

329
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,440
I thought you still want to hang out.

330
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,200
I just parked my car and
it has already ended.

331
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Everybody is tired from the outing.
We'll hang out again next time.

332
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:08,800
Come on. Let's go home.

333
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,080
Good.

334
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,119
Now, you already think of
that place as your home.

335
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,759
That's great.

336
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,720
I mean your house.

337
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,919
Are you sure that you want
to sleep with me today?

338
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,279
That's because
you acted unscrupulously...

339
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,399
and wouldn't let me sleep
unless I sleep with you.

340
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,999
If it wasn't because of my back sore,
I won't sleep with you.

341
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,639
We are friends, right?

342
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,999
Friends should share
weal and woe together.

343
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,800
I warn you.

344
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,759
Don't think that you act willfully
just because I sleep on your bed.

345
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,480
No. Don't think that you can act rashly
just because I sleep with you.

346
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,320
We've already slept together.
Did I do anything to you?

347
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,999
-You didn't.
-That's settled then.

348
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,080
Why do you think
I'll do something to you...

349
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,399
just because we sleep
at a different place?

350
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,759
But I think it's very dubious
for two people to sleep together.

351
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,480
That's because you have something bad in mind.

352
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,200
I'm very innocent inside.

353
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:29,320
Don't blame the bed for your dirty mind.

354
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
You!

355
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,440
I'm going to shower now!

356
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,720
Interesting.

357
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,279
Fighting, Zhou Shi.

358
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,039
What he said is quite reasonable.

359
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,600
We are just at a different place.

360
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,279
Don't think it as a bed.

361
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
You can think it as a huge sofa.

362
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,600
Moreover, even if he has any
ill intentions towards you,

363
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,320
he's not your match.

364
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,159
The blanket, pillow, bedsheets
and the cover sheet...

365
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,639
are brand new.

366
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,119
But I'm used to sleeping at this side.
So, you'll have to sleep there.

367
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:11,919
Thank you for sleeping with me.

368
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,800
This kind of thank you
sounds so strange.

369
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,879
I still need to...

370
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,200
borrow one of your arms.

371
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,840
I should go to the university
and make you one in plaster stone.

372
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,639
Then, you can hug it to sleep.

373
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,840
No. A plaster stone is hard.
It'll be uncomfortable.

374
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,600
Alright then.

375
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,720
Turn off the lights.

376
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,879
One sheep, two sheep,

377
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,759
three sheep, four sheep...

378
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,560
This is bad. Why is my heart
beating so fast?

379
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,879
Why is my face so red?

380
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,639
Calm down. I need to calm down.

381
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:03,239
Good morning.

382
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,879
Good morning.

383
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,480
Did you sleep well last night?

384
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,999
It's quite well.

385
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,320
Me too.

386
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:13,279
It has been a long time since
I slept until morning.

387
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:16,879
Are you still going to use it?

388
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,039
Use what?

389
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:20,600
The bathroom.

390
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,600
Go ahead and use it.

391
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,879
The heater must have been too hot.

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,320
the air of an affair.

433
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,800
No need to think.

434
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,159
Something is going on between them.

435
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,399
I feel like it has been a long time
since we hang out together so leisurely.

436
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,800
Where is Xiao Fei?
I haven't seen him for days.

437
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,639
I thought you already forgotten
about your cat.

438
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,320
I thought you forgot about him
because you have a new pet.

439
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,720
That's not true.
I care for him a lot, alright?

440
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,239
Where did he go?

441
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,360
His aunty is feeling ill
because of Xue Zi's issue.

442
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,720
He went to accompany her.

443
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,600
Wei Qing already planned to
transfer her shares to Director He.

444
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,960
I think He Wei is unwilling
to give back the shares.

445
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,159
So, he had been busy with meetings
these few days to discuss it.

446
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:02,960
I was wondering about
why are you here now.

447
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,919
So, it's because Wei Qing
has no time for you.

448
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,039
Yes. He said that he'll
come back late tonight.

449
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,680
But I can't stay here for too long.

450
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:13,759
He texted me just now saying
that his meeting has ended.

451
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,360
The way you talk now is exactly
like how a housewife talks.

452
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

453
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,639
According to my observation,

454
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,320
in a closed space, the safety distance
for Wei Qing with others...

455
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,039
has decreased from two feet to 1.5m.

456
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,200
And his tolerance to strangers...

457
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:36,080
has gone from 10 people to 22 people.

458
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:38,080
Your treatment is very effective.

459
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,879
Of course. All my effort will be a waste
if it's not effective.

460
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,999
But the distance between...

461
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,360
you and Wei Qing in private...

462
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,759
has dropped from 5-10 cm to 1 cm.

463
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,879
And it's approaching zero very soon.

464
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,560
What do you mean?

465
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,239
What I mean is, even when you are alone,

466
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,560
you and Wei Qing
still cling to each other.

467
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,080
How is it possible?

468
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Take a look.

469
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,399
This can't prove anything.

470
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:11,159
This is the scary part.

471
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,200
You don't even think that
it is a problem.

472
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:17,039
Why are you like the
goddess of study now?

473
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
I can't understand you.

474
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:20,480
Zhou Shi, tell me the truth.

475
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,560
What's the relationship of you and Wei Qing?

476
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,279
We are friends.
I help with his treatment.

477
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,080
Is this how you treat him?
By bringing him out to play?

478
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:30,639
He is afraid of human contact, right?

479
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,639
So, I brought him to crowded places...

480
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,519
so that he can get used to the feelings.

481
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,399
But from what we saw,

482
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,480
you are just dating with Wei Qing
in another way.

483
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,119
That's not true.

484
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,159
Look at these photos.

485
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,320
These are photos of a couple.

486
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,919
It is nothing. I did the same thing
when I go out...

487
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,960
with you girls as well.

488
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,039
The eyes can't lie.

489
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,080
When you went out with us,

490
00:32:57,239 --> 00:33:00,239
you didn't look at us so lovingly.

491
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,279
You are exaggerating.

492
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,800
Both of you think too much.

493
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,919
Actually, I think Wei Qing
is quite a good man.

494
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,999
I think it's good for you
to be together.

495
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,560
We are just normal friends.

496
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,200
We have no feelings for each other.

497
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,200
It's hard to look clearly at yourself.

498
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,600
Believe me.

499
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:23,560
The chemical reaction that you two
showed for the past two days...

500
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,840
is more than what I saw in the
laboratory for one whole year.

501
00:33:30,248 --> 00:33:32,248
[Wei Qing]

502
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,159
You are back?

503
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,279
Alright. I'll go back now.

504
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,039
You are hungry? I'll go back
and cook noodles for you then.

505
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,279
Two poach eggs. 70% cooked.

506
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,639
Why are you looking at me like that?

507
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,879
I'll go back and
cook noodles for you then.

508
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,639
-Two poach eggs.
-Why did you take that video?

509
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,119
Take a look at it yourself.

510
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:06,480
Nothing wrong with this.

511
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,800
Nothing wrong?

512
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
You already thought
his house as your home.

513
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,239
You even use the classic line
from the eight o'clock drama,

514
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,759
I'll cook noodles for you.

515
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,759
You even add two eggs.
What else can you say?

516
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,479
We are staying together.

517
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,360
It's normal that we are intimate.

518
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:23,759
Nothing is wrong with it.

519
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,279
Tell us the truth.
Do you like him?

520
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,400
I don't...

521
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,759
You don't like him or you don't know.

522
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,759
I don't like him.

523
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,279
Does he like you?

524
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,320
No.

525
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,039
If it's really like what you say,

526
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,560
it'll be fine if you don't like him
and vice versa.

527
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,999
What's the scariest thing?
The scariest thing is...

528
00:34:48,999 --> 00:34:51,279
you or him having
special feelings to each other.

529
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,959
After all,you're not a couple
but living together.

530
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,999
That's so weird.

531
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:01,279
All in all, just think about
your relationship with him.

532
00:35:01,279 --> 00:35:03,640
How do you want it go?
Don't be a scatterbrain.

533
00:35:03,999 --> 00:35:05,840
After all, you don't
want him to become...

534
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,439
the next Brother Ming Cheng, right?

535
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,600
Why did you talk about him?

536
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,519
Brother Ming Cheng
is different from him.

537
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,759
You used more than 10 years to be sure
of your feelings towards Li Ming Cheng.

538
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,519
How can you be so sure about...

539
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:22,360
your feelings towards Wei Qing now?

540
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,719
I...

541
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,719
All in all...

542
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,360
How about this. Find out about
his feelings towards you first.

543
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:33,800
He already wants to take the next step
with you to go into a relationship.

544
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,880
But you still want to stay
in this friendship.

545
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,640
My thinking is different from Fei Fei.

546
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,600
I think rather than finding out...

547
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,479
Wei Qing's feelings towards you,

548
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,600
you should ask yourself instead.

549
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
Find out about your feelings
towards him.

550
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:51,969
[Wei Qing]

551
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:54,920
Alright. Go back first.

552
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,880
Be careful.

553
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,959
What do you think of this situation now?

554
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:16,719
What else?

555
00:36:17,479 --> 00:36:18,560
It's her spring.

556
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,160
But whether this is
a good one or a bad one...

557
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,880
will depend entirely on her.

558
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,600
Find out about his feelings
towards you first.

559
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:35,239
He already wants to take the next step
with you to go into a relationship.

560
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,320
But you still want to stay
in this friendship.

561
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,120
What are you thinking about?

562
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:00,920
Nothing.

563
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:02,959
How is it with the shares?

564
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,199
He Wei is still unwilling to
give back the shares.

565
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,320
I already asked Wei An to handle that.

566
00:37:11,959 --> 00:37:14,519
Xue Zi has already started
to make a move for the past two days.

567
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,160
If we delay it any longer,

568
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
my mother will be kicked out for sure.

569
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,199
What do you think about me?

570
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,199
This question is too awkward.

571
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,719
Why did you ask that suddenly?

572
00:37:32,439 --> 00:37:33,600
What I'm saying is,

573
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,160
we've been staying together for so long.

574
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:39,640
Do you have a different opinion on me?

575
00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:41,519
Opinion?

576
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,759
Stay the same.

577
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,600
What do you mean by that?

578
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,279
We are good friends now.

579
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,840
And we are considered as close friends.

580
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,160
I think you will feel differently
about me, right?

581
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,439
Feelings?

582
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:05,519
Of course I like you even more.

583
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,479
After all, the longer I know you,

584
00:38:10,439 --> 00:38:12,519
the better impression
I have towards you.

585
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,199
So, he has good impression on me.

586
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,920
So, how much do you like me now?

587
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,400
Is there a standard for this?

588
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,080
What are you trying to ask?

589
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,920
It's nothing. I'm sleepy.
I have to sleep now. Goodnight.

590
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,360
So, it's just good impression?

591
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,360
Then, I guess he likes me.

592
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,360
But what about me?

593
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,640
Do I have good impression on him too?

594
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,239
What are you doing?

595
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,479
What did you see in your dream?

596
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,959
Why are you smiling so happily?

597
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,160
I smiled?

598
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,959
Look.

599
00:39:49,439 --> 00:39:51,320
What did I dream about?

600
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Are you willing to marry this woman?

601
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,479
Are you willing to love her
and be loyal to her...

602
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,959
in health and sickness,
through sorrow and success...

603
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,279
until death draws you apart?

604
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:12,439
Yes, I do.

605
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,120
Are you willing to marry this man?

606
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,120
Are you willing to love him
and be loyal to him...

607
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,400
in health and sickness,
through sorrow and success...

608
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,800
until death draws you apart?

609
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,199
Yes, I do.

610
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,840
You may kiss the bride.

611
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,400
Are you alright?

612
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,759
Don't touch me.

613
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,439
Are you willing to marry this man?

614
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,479
Are you willing to love him
and be loyal to him...

615
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,759
in health and sickness,
through sorrow and success...

616
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,199
until death draws you apart?

617
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,120
Yes, I do.

618
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,719
This is too strange.

619
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,120
Zhou Shi, you need to wake up.

620
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,640
You can't continue to be like this.

621
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,519
Wake up.
