[Episode 8]

29
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:05,000
I won't go to class these few days.

30
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,719
Don't bother to wake me up.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,280
Why isn't she going to class?

32
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,119
You didn't read it on Weibo?

33
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,200
She has been the hot search
these past few days.

34
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,280
I think the university asked her
to stop because of bad influence.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,319
She really owes money to someone?

36
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,080
And from what she said, it's a lot.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,959
Could it be from the loan shark?

38
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,239
I don't know.

39
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,959
But from what she said, her creditor...

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,720
is someone who's ruthless and cruel.

41
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,479
If this goes on, I think Zhou Shi
is going to be doomed.

42
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,920
Help me.

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
Chairman.

44
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,160
How is it with Zhou Shi?

45
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,959
I think she really can't
keep it up anymore.

46
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,640
It's her first time experiencing it.
It's normal for her to break.

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,319
-Let her rest for two days.
-Alright.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,599
By the way,
has Xue Zi given me a reply?

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,160
I've already sent it to her.

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,239
And she has replied as well.

51
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,879
What did she say?

52
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,759
-She rejected the offer.
-Why?

53
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,160
I don't know the specific reason.

54
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:31,879
But from what her secretary said,

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,479
looks like she is not satisfied
with the designers...

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
that we've provided.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,039
Does she have any designers in mind?

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,519
Yes. But he's not from the world
of jewellery design.

59
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,560
Could it be...

60
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,479
Is this world going to
circle around Xun Ran?

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,800
I hear this name everywhere I go.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,879
Do you want me to contact Chairman He?

63
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,599
No need. I'll contact him myself.

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,119
Alright. I'll get the car ready.

65
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,560
So, you are hiding here.

66
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,320
What is it? Are you playing
with knife now after you're...

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,600
no longer starving yourself?

68
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,919
Madam He believes in you so much.

69
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,480
How can she put an emotionally unstable
person like you among the people.

70
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,880
Long time no see.

71
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,720
Senior.

72
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,239
That's right. I wish it'll be longer.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,919
Why did you come back?

74
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,040
Aren't you doing well in
America as a free artist?

75
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,600
Because of aunty.

76
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,840
Chairman He said that
she misses her life in China.

77
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,720
Actually, I'm fine with anywhere.

78
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,799
Yes. You are a parasite anyway.

79
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,480
It's the same for you everywhere.

80
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,600
Not that it's a rare thing for you
to pester my family.

81
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Who are you relying on now?

82
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,679
It's a woman again.

83
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,359
How long are you going
to depend on women?

84
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
Do you want to think about
changing your host?

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,399
I don't understand.

86
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,079
For example,

87
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:17,519
you can seek refuge from me.

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,600
I feel disgusting saying this.

89
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:23,239
After all, I'm the last person
who wants to be involved with you.

90
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,160
Anyway,

91
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,919
I need your paintings. Name me a price.

92
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,959
Paintings?

93
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,079
Your paintings are quite valuable
in the country now.

94
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,119
Even people from the fashion world
want to buy your paintings.

95
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,560
And many companies have requested
for you to design for them.

96
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,840
Several hundred millions of business...

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,239
will be dependent on you.

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I can't.

99
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,799
Since you already signed with Yun Ma,

100
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,480
you have to follow the
company's arrangement.

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,959
I'm not my mother. I won't spoil you.

102
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,480
What if I refuse?

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,720
You won't be able to stay
in this university.

104
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:05,040
No matter how many people
or connections my mother used...

105
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,720
to keep your identity a secret,

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,119
I'll have the same power to expose you.

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,919
You are going to be in the
hot search soon. Are you happy?

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,480
If you don't want that,

109
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,079
you better cooperate with me nicely.

110
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,119
You don't want your dark history
to be exposed, right?

111
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,880
As for what to do,
I'll ask Wei An to contact you.

112
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,519
Do it well.

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,919
This is the only value you have.

114
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,359
I just checked my temperature.
38.5 Celsius.

115
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,880
Lie down at home.

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,119
I'll get the medicine sent to you
and come back as soon as I'm done.

117
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,480
It's alright. I'll just
lie down and sweat it out.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,480
You know about my body's condition too.

119
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
I'm actually quite...

120
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:11,119
Enough. Stop trying to be strong.

121
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:12,560
Stay at home, you hear me?

122
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,399
I have to hang up now. Bye.

123
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:24,280
I never thought that a super
healthy girl like me will get a fever.

124
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,720
It's Wei Qing's fault for torturing me.

125
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,679
When can I finally escape that?

126
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,040
Who is it?

127
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:40,199
I'm here to send the medicine.

128
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,079
So fast?

129
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:47,480
Fei Fei is not here.
I'm here to send it instead.

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,399
-Thank you for taking the trouble.
-No need to be so polite.

131
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,720
You are Fei Fei best friend.

132
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,280
So, you are my sister.

133
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,840
It's a duty as a brother...

134
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,680
to send the medicine to his sister.

135
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,959
I'm quite sick.

136
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,120
I don't want you to be infected.
How about you...

137
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,680
Is it that serious? Let me see.

138
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,040
You are burning up.

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,519
Why are you running from me?
I won't hurt you.

140
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,480
You've sent the medicine.
You can leave now.

141
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,800
Why are you so impatient?

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,759
We never get to talk properly.

143
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,399
Gao Yang.

144
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,480
I let you in because
you are Fei Fei's boyfriend.

145
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,800
You better show some respect.

146
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,160
Stop pretending.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,959
Everybody knows about you and Wei Qing.

148
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,519
-Don't act innocent with me.
-Such nonsense!

149
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Nonsense? Can you say that there's
nothing between you and Wei Qing?

150
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,639
You are already with Wei Qing.

151
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,120
Why not be with me too?

152
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm quite a catch too.

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm good looking and
I have a good body too.

154
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,360
I'm warning you!

155
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,120
There's a limit to my patience.

156
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,879
If you leave now, I'll act like
nothing has ever happened.

157
00:09:51,999 --> 00:09:53,559
But if you dare come nearer,

158
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,800
Even Fei Fei won't be able
to protect you from me.

159
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,639
I like your feistiness.

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
If you are worried about Fei Fei, don't.

161
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,079
I can just dump her through the phone.

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,600
I think you are insane.

163
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,879
Since Fei Fei is not here,

164
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
let's do everything that we can.

165
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,480
Think carefully.

166
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,360
You'll be doomed when I get better.

167
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
Wei Qing won't forgive you too.

168
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,240
You've now admitted it.

169
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,680
You can do it with Wei Qing...

170
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,040
but I can't even touch you.

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,879
Yes. I'm not as rich as him.

172
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,600
But money is not important
between a man and woman, right?

173
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,160
I'm younger than him.
I have better stamina than him for sure.

174
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,079
Shameless! If you do this,
Fei Fei will be upset!

175
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,360
So what if she knows?

176
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,040
Usually, when women find out about this,
they'll only blame the women.

177
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:35,680
They won't blame the men.

178
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,120
Yes. You will lose your best friend.

179
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,199
But you'll be in good hands with me.

180
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,639
Moreover, Fei Fei is now
using my card...

181
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,999
to shop in the shopping mall.

182
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,399
She is with me for my money.

183
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,280
Do you really think she is serious?

184
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Gao Yang.

185
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
Fei Fei?

186
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,519
-Aren't you supposed to be shopping?
-Yes.

187
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,759
The bag I want is sold out.
So, I came back early.

188
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
What is it? You never
thought of that right?

189
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,999
Sometimes, I'll save up for you too.

190
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
How long do you plan
to stay on top of her?

191
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,120
Fei Fei, let me tell you.
We are just playing around.

192
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,120
-Don't take it seriously.
-Playing around?

193
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,160
You almost put your hands
into her clothes. Playing around?

194
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,959
Do you normally play
like this with other girls?

195
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:23,319
Or is this a special service
for your girlfriend's...

196
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,480
-best friend?
-I...

197
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,160
I don't want to do it too.

198
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,559
It's her fault.

199
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
She tried to seduce me.

200
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,160
Let me tell you.
Her fever is just an excuse.

201
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,720
-She just wants to get close to me.
-What are you...

202
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,360
Fei Fei, something is wrong
with your friend.

203
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,079
She clung to me as soon as I came in.

204
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,720
She said she couldn't walk
because of fever...

205
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
and asked me to carry her to the sofa.

206
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,360
I have no choice but to do it.

207
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,999
But she wouldn't let go.

208
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,720
She pulled me down to the sofa.

209
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,280
I can do nothing.

210
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm feeling despair too.

211
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,680
How could you do this?

212
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,600
Fei Fei.

213
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,639
Do you really believe in him?

214
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,240
Of course. I'm her boyfriend.

215
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,959
Is she going to trust you instead of me?

216
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,519
Lie down.

217
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:42,959
Are you trying to steam me...

218
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,519
or are you trying to make a sushi roll?

219
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,759
Is it uncomfortable?

220
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:49,280
I saw that they always
did it in the drama.

221
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,399
Fine. I can recover faster after
I sweat from being wrapped up tightly.

222
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,680
How is Fei Fei?

223
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,079
She is still in her room.

224
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,399
Although she hit Gao Yang,

225
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,040
she still has feelings towards him.

226
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:05,879
I think this is a huge blow to her.

227
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,519
It's entirely Gao Yang's fault.

228
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,439
Take care of yourself first.

229
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,759
You have something to tell me?

230
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,879
Tell me then.

231
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,280
With my condition now,

232
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,680
I won't be able to hit you
no matter what you say.

233
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,920
Why are you so tired?

234
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,639
Because of money.

235
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,240
Something baffling happened...

236
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,720
and suddenly I was in a huge debt.

237
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,240
I might have to use
my whole life to settle that debt.

238
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:41,879
Is it Wei Qing?

239
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,399
How do you know?

240
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
It's just my guessing.

241
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:50,040
Wei Qing is very smart.
You need to be careful.

242
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,600
Don't be tricked by him.

243
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,759
Sounds like you know him well.

244
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,559
I know a little bit about him.

245
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,120
Think about the reason
you are in a debt.

246
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,720
There must be a reason for it.

247
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,559
I'll leave now.

248
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,879
Why will I be in debt?

249
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:19,469
[Pottery and Porcelain Exhibition]

250
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,519
It's the same?

251
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,280
What is happening here?

252
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,639
I thought I already broke it.

253
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,720
Why will it be in the exhibition hall?

254
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

255
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,559
I want to ask some questions
about these items.

256
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,759
Sure, no problem.

257
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,999
Are you sure that
these are all authentic?

258
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,280
Of course.

259
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,399
Are you sure that they
haven't been broken before?

260
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:18,399
Yes, I'm sure.

261
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,559
-Miss Zhou! You can't go in!
-Let me go in!

262
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,559
-Let me go in!
-Miss Zhou!

263
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,360
Move aside!
I want to ask him a question!

264
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:26,040
Wei Qing!

265
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,999
What do you want to ask?

266
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,160
When I broke everything
in the storage room,

267
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
you purposely sent me the photos.
Do you remember?

268
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,639
Yes. What about it?

269
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,319
Didn't you say that they are broken?

270
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,480
Why will they appear in the
auction house and exhibition hall?

271
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,120
Which of them are real?

272
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,319
Have you tricked me
all these time with fakes?

273
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,800
How did you find out?

274
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,399
I searched it on the internet.

275
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,199
And I happened to find an
ongoing pottery exhibition.

276
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,519
Or else, how long are you going
to keep lying to me?

277
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,240
Not bad. You are not too dumb.

278
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,999
Which of your sentences are real?

279
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,399
Do you know what I've been through
for the past few days? This is fraud.

280
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,480
I never said that those vases
you had broken are real.

281
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,399
You are the one who panicked
and got yourself into this.

282
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,800
So, you just look on while
I jump into a fire pit?

283
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,319
Do you know how much courage
I had to muster to pay off this debt?

284
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,759
Is it fun to disrupt
other's life like this?

285
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,240
-I want you to apologise!
-I never apologise.

286
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:26,840
What?

287
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,199
If this thing happens again,

288
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,840
I'll still do the same.

289
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,639
Even without this reason,

290
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,600
I'll find other ways to bind you to me.

291
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:39,840
Because you are very important to me.

292
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,480
So, I have to do it.

293
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,079
Of course. You might
suffer some losses...

294
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,360
in the interim.

295
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,639
But I'll use other ways
to make it up to you.

296
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,920
Are you insane?

297
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,999
Not everything has to go your way!

298
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,240
No matter how important I am to you,
I'm not willing to do it!

299
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,999
Why are you so unwilling?

300
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,079
I don't want to follow you
around in a titular way.

301
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,720
I'm just like a puppet.

302
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,959
I have my own life and
I have someone I like.

303
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,720
I don't want to be involved with you!

304
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,400
I see.

305
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,480
Actually, besides the last sentence,

306
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,039
I can basically guess
what you want to say.

307
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,679
Since you don't want to be
a puppet with merely a nominal title,

308
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,760
let's make it into a reality then.

309
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,799
From now onwards, you've been upgraded.

310
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:37,400
Be my real girlfriend, Zhou Shi.

311
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
How did you come up
with this conclusion?

312
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,400
Are you listening to me?

313
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,720
What you say doesn't matter.

314
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,520
What matters is,
you are important to me.

315
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,600
So, you can't escape.

316
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,679
Don't come and harass me.
Or else, I'll call the police!

317
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,360
From tomorrow onwards,
no need to follow her by car.

318
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,400
By the way, inform those
entertainment media...

319
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,319
to stop reporting this gossip.

320
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,079
Alright.

321
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,439
So, everything will return
to normal for Miss Zhou.

322
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,559
Are you really going to give up?

323
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,760
Do you think I will do that?

324
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:28,319
Understood. Later,
I'll ask someone to get it done.

325
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:36,760
Return to normal? Not a chance.

326
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,439
What are you doing?

327
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,840
You are here right on time.
Pass those two to me.

328
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,760
Have you finally realised that
men are unreliable...

329
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:03,520
and you've decided to open an
online store to support yourself?

330
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,600
You are partially right.

331
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,079
Isn't this the bag from Gao Yang?

332
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,159
Yes, I plan to sell it in...

333
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:17,120
Second-Hand Luxury Net.

334
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,000
Isn't this your war trophy?

335
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,319
You are willing to sell it?

336
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,679
You want me to use this bag
from that useless man...

337
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,279
to look for my next Mr. Perfect?

338
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,000
You are still not done
with your Mr. Perfect?

339
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,039
This is called building experience.

340
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,799
I can't just discriminate
against the lot...

341
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,439
just because of one useless man.

342
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,959
My life goal is to find
a reliable Mr. Perfect.

343
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,959
Nothing wrong with paying the
school fees earlier, right?

344
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,000
Do you know where the tape is?

345
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,279
Are both of you trying to compete?

346
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,039
Is today a good day to pack?

347
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,400
How can you put your
Hermes in a cardboard box?

348
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,919
What's wrong with that?

349
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,840
-I'm just returning them anyway.
-Who are you returning them to?

350
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,000
Wei Qing from Yun Ma Group?

351
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,799
Are you really with him?

352
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:13,679
I'm not with him.

353
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,360
Haven't you seen Entertainment Push?
It's lit every day.

354
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,559
This Entertainment Push
is available every month.

355
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,640
I thought she's just an internet
celebrity who looks like Zhou Shi.

356
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,480
But he even gave you a birkin.

357
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,360
There must be something behind it.

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,959
Gao Yang wouldn't even
give me a basic one.

359
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,559
The feel of this and
the quality of the leather.

360
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:33,760
It feels so good.

361
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,919
It feels so good.

362
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,840
I thought you are in lovelorn mode?

363
00:20:38,959 --> 00:20:41,000
Lean back 45 degree to the wall...

364
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,120
and look at the ceiling now.

365
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,360
If you buy this kind of bag for me,
I can recover at once.

366
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:48,919
Coming.

367
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,199
My courier is here.

368
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,319
My Hermes.

369
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,439
-Hello.
-Hello.

370
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,880
I've already signed it.

371
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,600
Miss Zhou, right?

372
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,279
-Here's the receipt.
-Thank you.

373
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,159
Alright. Goodbye.

374
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,000
Finally, it's done.

375
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:37,079
Teacher Xiao.

376
00:21:39,439 --> 00:21:40,480
Teacher Xiao.

377
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,959
I can resume my classes? Really?

378
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,000
Thank you, teacher.
I won't be late tomorrow.

379
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,199
Great. Finally, I can go back to school.

380
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,240
I don't need to be coop up
at home anymore!

381
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:59,520
This is the first time I see someone
getting so excited for school.

382
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,760
My Hermes.

383
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,439
Look at that.

384
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
Zhou Shi? She is back for classes.

385
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,959
Why is she dressing up so manly again?

386
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,559
Is she giving up on herself after...

387
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,319
being dumped by Wei Qing?

388
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,640
I think she is just one of...

389
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,799
Wei Qing's many ex-girlfriends.

390
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,159
But looks like she's not
in his good graces.

391
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,439
That's right.

392
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,919
She didn't even get anything
after the breakup.

393
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,840
Who is Wei Qing?

394
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:07,600
Impossible that he'll be smitten
with a girl like her.

395
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,439
Maybe he has seen
too many perfect girls.

396
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:11,319
So, he wants to have
a change of flavour.

397
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,919
But normal vegetables...

398
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,480
cannot be compared to
delicacies of every kind, right?

399
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,919
She overreached herself.

400
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,480
I like your metaphor.

401
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,319
Yes. All of you are right.

402
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,600
I'm giving up on myself
and overreached myself.

403
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,559
So, please put in more effort...

404
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,120
and aim high for that
Wei Qing to take a fancy to you.

405
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,919
Then, you'll know how fun it is.

406
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,600
What happened to you?

407
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,959
I just fell down accidentally.

408
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,720
Fell down on a flat floor? Zhang Shuai.

409
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,079
When have you learnt
how to act cute like this?

410
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,279
You are here to steal
the show on purpose, right?

411
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,520
You are already handsome enough.

412
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,240
But you work so hard
to grab the limelight.

413
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Zhang Shuai.

414
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,679
Wait.

415
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,039
Zhang Shuai.

416
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,559
Wait.

417
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
I asked you to wait.

418
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:11,919
Anything?

419
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,919
Thank you for getting me out
from that tight spot just now.

420
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,600
You think too much.
It was just an accident.

421
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,880
I didn't mean to help you.

422
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
I see.

423
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,279
But I don't understand.

424
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,559
What is wrong with you?

425
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,360
Why do you keep showing me
the long face?

426
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,079
That's not true.

427
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,120
If you have any resentment towards me,
you can just give it to me straight.

428
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,360
I'm very bad in reading other's mind.

429
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,799
If I had done anything that
offended you before,

430
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:40,199
you can scold me.

431
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,439
Don't just ignore me like this.

432
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,799
We are classmates.

433
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,000
I don't want to cluelessly face this
cold violence until the year ends.

434
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,799
Tell me. What's in your mind?

435
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,400
What's in my mind?

436
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,959
Don't be so self-conscious.

437
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
Do you think I'm dumb?

438
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,919
With the gaze you gave me just now,

439
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,279
I felt like it can puncture
a hole through my face.

440
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,439
Even if you hate me,
you have to give me a reason for it.

441
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,199
We were doing fine before this, right?

442
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,079
Why did you change back
to yourself again?

443
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,720
Are you done being
Wei Qing's girlfriend?

444
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,279
As expected.

445
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,319
So, you think the
same way about me too.

446
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,640
Maybe it seems true
from other's perspective.

447
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,279
Yes. I've stopped being his girlfriend.

448
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
Just think of me as
being vain before this.

449
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,720
That's it. I'm done.

450
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,919
You can continue to despise me now.

451
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,760
Seriously?

452
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,439
Why do I need to explain this
to an outsider?

453
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,959
Have I really misunderstood her?

454
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,799
Eight minutes 47 seconds.

455
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,039
I'm still slower than her.

456
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,600
What kind of a girl is she?

457
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,880
Bi Qiu Jing?

458
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,880
She is not a Chess Club member.

459
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,199
Why? Is she very good in it?

460
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,600
How is she compared to you?

461
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,799
As for now,

462
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,959
she is better than me.

463
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:19,000
I remember that you are already
an amateur level 6, right?

464
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,559
How good is she to be recognised by you?

465
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,880
Bi Qiu Jing?
Why does it sound so familiar?

466
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:28,319
Bi Qiu Jing?

467
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:31,400
Could it be the third year student
from the Chemistry Faculty?

468
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,240
I heard, she didn't go for one subject
during the college entrance exam.

469
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,240
But she still managed to
get into Kwang Hua University.

470
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,720
By the way, besides the subject
that she didn't take,

471
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,799
she scored full marks
for other subjects.

472
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,559
That's right. Now, I remember.

473
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,840
Actually, it's not that
she didn't go for the exam.

474
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,959
I heard that she
finished it too early...

475
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:53,880
and fell asleep during the exam.

476
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:56,120
In the end,
she forgot to write her name.

477
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,000
You got rejected?

478
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,640
Bi Qiu Jing said that
she has to play games usually...

479
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,600
and has no time to
fool around in our club.

480
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,520
What? Fool around?

481
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,679
She even said that...

482
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,360
a club that can accept an empty shell
like Zhang Ran Yu...

483
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,400
must be a club with impure motives.

484
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,240
She said that she's not pretty.
So, she won't be coming...

485
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,240
to our unworthy club to waste her time.

486
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,079
Unworthy?

487
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,039
She said we are unworthy.

488
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,319
Brother Ming Cheng.

489
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:56,760
Brother Ming Cheng.

490
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,360
Shi Shi.

491
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,319
What are you doing on your phone?
You look so serious.

492
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,679
It's nothing. I haven't seen you lately.

493
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,959
Are you doing well?

494
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,439
Brother Ming Cheng.
You never scroll Weibo, right?

495
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,720
Yes.

496
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,840
And you don't scroll Entertainment Push?

497
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,120
Yes.

498
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,159
That's good then.

499
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,199
What is it? Are you alright?

500
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,520
I'm fine. I just had
some problems lately.

501
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,919
But I've resolved them.

502
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,079
Good.

503
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,559
Remember to tell me if you need my help.

504
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,000
I promised your mother
to take care of you.

505
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,439
Understood.

506
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,079
You came here right on time.

507
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,880
Can you help me?

508
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,079
How can I help?

509
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,600
What can I do...

510
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,199
to add a person into my friend list?

511
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:50,799
Look.

512
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:54,520
You've been blocked.

513
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,959
Blocked?

514
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,079
How many times have you added her?

515
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,159
About a dozen times if I count the ones
manually sent and the ones...

516
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,480
automatically sent through
an application.

517
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,240
Where to find an application like that?

518
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,880
I designed it myself.

519
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,760
You are trying so hard
to add her as friend.

520
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:15,760
Is it because you like her?

521
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,760
I don't think I like her.

522
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,840
Technically,
we don't even know each other.

523
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,559
That's good then.

524
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,640
But I like her way of thinking...

525
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,079
and her style in playing chess.

526
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,559
She has an unconventional gambit
and has many styles.

527
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,919
She is unlike any other
female chess players.

528
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:35,319
So, you wanted to add her...

529
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,240
just to discuss about chess?

530
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:38,959
You can say that.

531
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:43,240
Shi Shi, how can my friend request
get approved quickly?

532
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,240
Social applications are not my thing.

533
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,720
It's actually very simple.

534
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:50,480
She is very good in chess, right?

535
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:52,959
Then, she must be a very smart girl.

536
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,760
If that's the case,
why don't you cater to her likes...

537
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,439
and send some mind-challenging
messages to attract her?

538
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,279
Mind-challenging messages?

539
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,720
Here.

540
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
You are indeed smart.

541
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:19,720
He is so annoying.

542
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,439
Do I need to design
a plugin to block it?

543
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,720
Zhou Shi.

544
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,279
Why are you alone and looking so down?

545
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:28,480
You came right on time.

546
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,760
I'm now thinking about a question
that is outside of my IQ capability.

547
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,120
What question?

548
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:34,480
Let me ask you.

549
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,000
For a scholar-tyrant like you,

550
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,840
is studying the only thing in your mind?
Is there nothing else?

551
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,199
Besides studying, I play too.

552
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,159
Of course. Playing is a part
of learning too.

553
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,159
I forgot that you're not a study-tyrant.
You're a goddess of study.

554
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,240
Is Li Ming Cheng the study-tyrant
you're talking about?

555
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,799
What did he do now?

556
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,679
He has been trying to add
a female chess player's QQ.

557
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,240
But that girl wouldn't agree.

558
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,799
So, he's quite anxious about it.

559
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,880
It's just a chess player.

560
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
It's so far from being a girlfriend.

561
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,279
No need to be so gloomy about it.

562
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,400
I'm depressed because...

563
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,279
I taught him how to pursue her.

564
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,520
What if they really
became friends and...

565
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,600
develop feelings for
each other through chess?

566
00:31:16,199 --> 00:31:17,880
Then, I would have...

567
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,400
That won't happen.

568
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,959
It's him again.
One quarter multiplied by 4.85...

569
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:26,279
and divided by five over eight...

570
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,640
equals to 3.44 plus 6.15...

571
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,079
multiplied by three and
one over five equals to...

572
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,039
Does the message verification
come with a question now?

573
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,600
-What are you doing?
-Replying him with the answer.

574
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,079
If you reply him, then he'll be able
to add you as friend.

575
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,720
That's right. I can't reckon
with all eventualities.

576
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,439
I can't help but to solve a question.

577
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,159
Why do we have so many packages
sent to our house?

578
00:31:50,439 --> 00:31:53,240
Could it be from our shopaholic,
Lin Fei Fei?

579
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,000
You are right.

580
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,559
Let's go.

581
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,679
Finally, you are back.

582
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,199
Save me.

583
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,840
Are you insane?
Why did you buy so many things?

584
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:06,559
You can't just lose control like this
even if you just broke up.

585
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,480
I didn't buy them.

586
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,520
Zhou Shi. They are for you.

587
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,880
Impossible. I haven't been spending
a dime for a few months already.

588
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,799
This is really my name.

589
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:26,240
No. Isn't this the box I sent out?

590
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,600
Why is it back?

591
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,240
Don't tell me that
all the packages here...

592
00:32:30,439 --> 00:32:32,600
are for Zhou Shi?

593
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,039
That's not all.

594
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
Ladies. Don't go.

595
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,840
-You still have forms to sign.
-That's right.

596
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,120
See. The house is full of them.

597
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,039
Oh my goodness, Zhou Shi.

598
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:50,799
Who has you offended?

599
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,880
Wei Qing, are you insane?

600
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:24,919
Can't you spend your money elsewhere?

601
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:27,240
Why are you creating
so many obstacles in my house?

602
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,199
-Obstacles?
-Tiffany's bracelet.

603
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,279
That's right.

604
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,919
Thanks to you,

605
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,000
my house is now
a transfer station of couriers.

606
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,600
Send someone to take them away now!

607
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,039
Take them away quickly. Or else, I won't
be able to guarantee their safety!

608
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:52,199
My friends are going crazy
from all the packages.

609
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,400
Up to you.

610
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,279
You can deal with them however you like.

611
00:33:55,439 --> 00:33:56,919
They are my presents for you.

612
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,400
Why did you send me all these things?

613
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,480
Isn't this the mandatory procedure
before getting together?

614
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,079
Do I need a reason to send
my girlfriend some gifts?

615
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,799
Who is your girlfriend?

616
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,680
This is just your one-sided wish.

617
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,640
And for the debt you tricked me about,

618
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,079
it's done now.

619
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:14,400
So, I don't want to be involved
with you in any way.

620
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Besides, my house is not a florist shop.

621
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,799
Please take away all of that
Bulgarian roses, calla lilies,

622
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,039
peonies, lilies and pansies.

623
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,360
You don't like them?

624
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,880
-What flowers do you like then?
-I like...

625
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,079
Why do I have to tell you?

626
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,640
Anyway, no matter
they are flowers or gifts,

627
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:33,719
take them away.

628
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Stop flaunting with your wealth.

629
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:42,600
There are so many things.
How much will the courier fees cost?

630
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,999
Can't you choose COD instead?

631
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,559
No. Even if I send them back to him,

632
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,200
he will just send them right back.

633
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,519
This Wei Qing wants to make me pay.
He wants me to feel in debt to him.

634
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,200
I won't take the bait.

635
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,360
No matter how much money
I have to spend,

636
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,120
I'll send these packages back to him.

637
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:01,039
I don't want to be involved with him.

638
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,279
The gifts are easy
to be taken care with.

639
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,200
But what about the flowers?

640
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,039
Oh my roses.

641
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,200
Gao Yang had sent a lot of roses
to me too back then.

642
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,600
During Valentine's Day,
birthday and Christmas.

643
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,039
The most he sent were 1001 roses
that filled up the boot of his car.

644
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,840
What are you trying to convey?

645
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:36,519
Let me tell you.
I'm not in a relationship now.

646
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,960
But I can be in one anytime I want.

647
00:35:47,799 --> 00:35:49,759
Brat. Stop the music.

648
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:52,360
-No.
-I'll count to three.

649
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
One...

650
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,479
-Stop it.
-No.

651
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,239
Looks like I have to go to the flower
market early in the morning tomorrow.

652
00:36:03,479 --> 00:36:05,200
I just want to get rid of them quickly.

653
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,200
If only he's not the one who sent them.

654
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,920
-Or else, I could've kept some of them.
-What?

655
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,880
Nothing.

Zhou Shi.

676
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,920
Stop following me!

677
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,799
-Where are you going? I'll send you.
-None of your business.

678
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,279
You look so tired riding the bike.
Are you heading to the flower market?

679
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,079
What a busybody you are.

680
00:38:09,279 --> 00:38:11,160
You know the flowers are from me, right?

681
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,640
Is this how you treat other's feelings?

682
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:17,999
It's only feelings if I accept it.
You sent them without a care.

683
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,799
Even valuable things will become trash.

684
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,400
If you don't like them,
you can throw them away.

685
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,479
Why do you need to trouble yourself
to go to the flower market?

686
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,239
Throw them?
Where am I going to throw them?

687
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,279
You have the typical dandy boy mindset.

688
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,880
Wasteful and shameful.

689
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,360
Throwing flowers is
considered as wasting.

690
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:46,719
What about throwing away
other's feelings?

691
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,600
Or do you actually...

692
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,840
like these flowers and can't bear
to throw them away?

693
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,640
Don't think that you know me that well.

694
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,519
I'm planning to return these flowers
to the flower market.

695
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,920
It's good that you are here.
I don't have to go there now.

696
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:08,400
You can ride this bike.
It'll save me some troubles.

697
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,360
What are you doing?

698
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,680
If you have anything to say, say it.
Don't stare at me.

699
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,519
I know I'm not pretty. I won't pretend
to be your girlfriend after this.

700
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,600
This is how I'm going to look.
Just bear with it if you don't like it.

701
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,200
No.

702
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:27,079
You are beautiful.

703
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
Stop laughing. Pull me up.

704
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:43,239
-Are you sure?
-Quickly.

705
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,719
The city management officers
are here. Run!

706
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,039
You can even ride a pedicab?

707
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,160
There's nothing that I can't do.

He is just a useless man.

713
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,440
But why can't I forget about him?

714
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:43,960
So noisy.

715
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,960
Why are you here?

716
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,519
Sorrowful woman.

717
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:50,840
Who is the sorrowful woman you meant?

718
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,239
Take away your stinking hand.

719
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,719
My chin. Luckily my chin is real.

720
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,319
Give me a paper to sit on.

721
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,920
Is this a drawing of me?

722
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,479
So, I look so pretty in your eyes.

723
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,640
It's the wrong side up. This is you.

724
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,999
Why is it a rabbit?

725
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,400
I look so pretty.

726
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:35,640
I should be a fox.

727
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,319
And this rabbit is crying.
Not cute at all.

728
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,559
Willy hare has three burrows.
Do you know that?

729
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,519
This is such a cold joke.

730
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,319
It has nowhere to hide now.

731
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,079
So, it cries.

732
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,279
I thought you drew a carrot here.

733
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,400
So, it's just a burrow.

734
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,920
It has feelings towards it
because it lives in it for so long.

735
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:05,600
So, I'm so upset...

736
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,920
not because I like him...

737
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:09,519
but because...

738
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:11,680
I lost the sense of security
that he gave me.
