[Episode 2]

29
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:13,200
She's really buying that?
Is she dumb?

30
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,039
Chairman, what's your order?

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,080
The girl who is my personal housekeeper now,

32
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,000
I heard that you employed her.
What's her background?

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,399
She's nothing special.

34
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,599
She's an arts major.
She came here for her internship.

35
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,039
She doesn't want high wages too.

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,879
She said she must be here
until the 28th of August.

37
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,560
Until today.

38
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,840
Sack her.

39
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,679
She's suspicious.

40
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,479
I think she has some motives.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,959
Or she's a paparazzi.

42
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
I don't want to see her
in the hotel again.

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
She's really a rich girl.

44
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:00,119
She can have an endless
supply with all that money.

45
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:02,759
That Wei Qing is strange too.

46
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,039
He threw his chopsticks
during meal time.

47
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,679
He doesn't seem like a person
with high moral integrity.

48
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,560
Miss, how can I help you?

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
I'm finding for...

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,519
Usually, they're by the counter.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,560
They're add-ons.

52
00:03:47,119 --> 00:03:49,479
They come in small boxes.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,959
Are they chewing gums?

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
You're close.

55
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,959
They're both made from rubber.

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,119
But they're made for men.

57
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,959
And they're elastic.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,679
Usually, they're placed here.

59
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,399
Oh, that thing?

60
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,039
Yeah! It's that thing!

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,640
Someone called us this afternoon.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,239
And he bought all of it already.

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Who's that?

64
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,000
According to what I've heard,

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,119
everything is sold out
within a ten-mile radius.

66
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,639
I'm having Valentine's Day too,
you know?

67
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,119
Who is messing with me?

68
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,040
He made me so unlucky.

69
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,160
But, I did reserve some of them.

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,760
-Is that true?
-Yes.

71
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,239
I want them!

72
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,679
I'll get them for you.

73
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:43,160
-Thank you!
-Okay.

74
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,160
[Chairman]

75
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,000
Chairman.

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,239
Where are you?

77
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,840
I'm in a convenience store by the hill.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
It must be far then.

79
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,880
It takes 30 minutes to
reach there by bike.

80
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,000
It's quite far.

81
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:10,799
There's no need for you to come back.

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,959
What do you mean?

83
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,639
You created troubles for me
even when you're so far away.

84
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
What did I do?

85
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
It's because of your girlfriend!

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,440
Did I beg you for it?

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,880
You created many troubles
for me, you know?

88
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,320
But your girlfriend said...

89
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,239
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,840
What are you guys up to?

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,119
You don't need to know.

92
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,639
I'll ask someone to pack your stuffs.

93
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,239
And send them to your college.

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,919
I'll settle your wages
by two working days.

95
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:36,919
I'll give you one month's worth of wages
for the contract's penalty.

96
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,679
Can you repeat your words?

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
My signal here is bad.

98
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,639
I'm afraid that I heard it wrong.

99
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:45,959
You heard me.
You're fired.

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,119
Lady.

101
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,760
I've packed your things already.
Do you want them?

102
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,079
Are you leaving?

103
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,359
The office called me just now.

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,880
I have some urgent matters to handle.

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
Ask your assistant to do it for you.

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,239
Didn't you promise me that you'll
spend Valentine's Day with me?

107
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,760
The suite will still be here.

108
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:16,799
You can stay here whenever you like.

109
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,519
You can throw a party
with your friends too.

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,359
I'll arrange the transport for you.

111
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,079
When will we meet next time ?

112
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,359
There's no next time.

113
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,160
What do you mean?

114
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,639
You brought me here.

115
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,799
And now you're abandoning me?

116
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm not abandoning you.

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,519
I'm breaking up with you.

118
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,840
By the way, we're not dating anyway.

119
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,160
It's okay for you to be reserved.

120
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,840
I can't have a deeper
relationship with you.

121
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:51,399
Why?

122
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,720
Aren't we in a good relationship?

123
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,840
You invited me here for a vacation.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,480
And you sent some gifts to me.

125
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,959
Shouldn't we try something else now?

126
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,440
Did I do something wrong?

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,280
You did nothing wrong. I'm the one
who recognised the wrong person.

128
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,959
You're not the one that
saved me by the river, right?

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,000
I can explain that.

130
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,480
I'm not doing this on purpose.

131
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:24,079
That day, by the river,

132
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:26,280
maybe I did not explain
the situation in detail.

133
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,799
But this doesn't affect
our relationship, right?

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,079
I'm just late by one step.

135
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,679
If I were in that position that day,

136
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,639
I would save you too.

137
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,239
Why are you dwelling on this?

138
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,560
Wei Qing!

139
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,199
Wei Qing!

140
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,959
Wei Qing!

141
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,679
I'm not interested in your
internal struggles.

142
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,000
I found the wrong person
after such a long time.

143
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm upset too.

144
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,840
Just leave peacefully.

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,119
Before I say something that'll hurt you.

146
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
You...

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,079
You are such a bully!

148
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:18,600
Aren't you afraid of your karma?

149
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,760
Karma?

150
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:23,000
You're not the first person
I've dumped anyway.

151
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,880
Even if you want to take revenge,
you need to line up for that.

152
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
Where is Wei Qing?

153
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,519
Why are you back?

154
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,999
Didn't the boss tell you
everything already?

155
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,480
Where's Wei Qing?
And where's his girlfriend?

156
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,519
Is he in his room?
I want to find him!

157
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,439
You look like you could kill somebody.

158
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,920
Why are you finding for them?

159
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:49,600
Why are you asking me this?

160
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:51,600
Look at me!

161
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,600
I bought all these because of him!

162
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,240
And I got mud all over me too!

163
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,800
How can he just leave it like this?

164
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,639
I'll throw all of these at his face.

165
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,879
I'll let him know that
I'm not here for a month...

166
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,999
because of them!

167
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,959
He wants to sack me?
I'll quit by myself!

168
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:07,360
He's the boss here? So what?

169
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:08,759
He can't just take away my stuff!

170
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,959
And play me like
a fool with his girlfriend!

171
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,319
I know you're strong.

172
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,559
That's why I hired you!

173
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,639
Miss, please stop this.

174
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:33,659
You can't win against our boss.

175
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,959
Just go back.

176
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,519
Just you wait.

177
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,800
I'll get my revenge even if it means...

178
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,639
that I'll have to stay here
the whole night!

179
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,199
Wei Qing!

180
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,920
Wei Qing!

181
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,439
It's my fault for hiding this from you.

182
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,079
I know my fault already.

183
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,680
Can we start anew?

184
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,840
Didn't I say this already?

185
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,600
Just assume that
I'm tired of you already.

186
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,120
It's not my first time
being a playboy anyway.

187
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,879
It won't make any differences.

188
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,199
Wei Qing!

189
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,999
Wei Qing!

190
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,079
This is bad!

191
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,439
I got in the car accidentally.

192
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,840
What should I do now?

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,199
If he discovers me,

194
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,399
he'll surely thinks that I'm a stalker.

195
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,439
How can I let him believe me?

196
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,079
No matter what,

197
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,399
everything happened...

198
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,280
because I wanted to take back my stuff.

199
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
My phone is out of battery now.

200
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,680
Strange.

201
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
This girl didn't answer my call.

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,680
Hey! Can you drive properly?

203
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,319
You'll kill someone if you
brake like this, you know?

204
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:17,600
It's you?

205
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,439
Why are you in my car?

206
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,399
You think I wanted this?

207
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,759
What are you trying to do?

208
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,160
Why are you in my car?

209
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:26,160
I want to take back my stuff.

210
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
What did you left here? Your brain?

211
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,959
I'm speaking the truth.
You have my stuff.

212
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,240
Let me search for it.

213
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:31,840
Get out!

214
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:34,360
I'm not touching you on purpose.
Don't overthink.

215
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,639
Get out.

216
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,199
Please don't do this.

217
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,639
If you don't believe me,

218
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,519
just treat me as a passenger.

219
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,240
You can give me my stuff
when you reach your destination.

220
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,360
This is an isolated place.

221
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,120
I don't dare to go out.

222
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,240
Fine, you've said this yourself.

223
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:50,480
Sit tight.

224
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,439
Where are we going?

225
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,480
We're going to the police station.

226
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,360
What?

227
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,240
What's wrong? Isn't this normal?

228
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,559
You're a stalker, right?

229
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,439
Stop the car!

230
00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:06,040
It's too late. I gave you
a chance just now.

231
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,319
Now, it's too late.

232
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,759
Did I offend you?

233
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,999
Why are you doing this to me?

234
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,040
Are you doing this because
I went into your room last time?

235
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,519
Is it because I saw
the rashes on your body?

236
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,360
Stop talking!

237
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,439
Stop the car! I want to get out!

238
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,800
Stop the car!

239
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Watch out!

240
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
Your car!

241
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,120
My car.

242
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,759
Stop right there! Stop running!

243
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,879
Don't come near me!

244
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,040
Help me up.

245
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,879
Faster!

246
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,360
Are you okay?

247
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,160
You're dirty.

248
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,720
-Let me wipe your clothes.
-Don't touch me.

249
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,879
You're too smelly.

250
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,720
But you're smelly too.

251
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,040
Oh right. You have mysophobia.

252
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,480
This is awkward.

253
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,759
What are you looking for?

254
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,759
Where's my phone?

255
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,280
I think it's missing.

256
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,920
Why are you staring at me?

257
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,240
I'm in the same boat as you.

258
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,879
Besides, if you didn't chase after me,

259
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:26,999
I wouldn't be here anyway.

260
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,240
Now, we're equal.

261
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,199
Can you call the cops now?

262
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,639
My battery is flat.

263
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,040
You're really useless, aren't you?

264
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,600
This is an isolated place.

265
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,639
We're the only people around here.

266
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,199
Can't we just let bygones be bygones?

267
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,319
What should we do then?

268
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,399
It's easy. Give me back my stuff.

269
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,639
And I'll forgive you for everything.

270
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,439
Didn't I tell you this already?

271
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,160
I did not take your stuff.

272
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,680
Just tell me honestly
if you want to take advantage of me.

273
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,240
Who wants to do that?

274
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,360
Don't overestimate yourself.

275
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,720
Fine. I want your shirt.

276
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,920
Give me your shirt then.

277
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:09,079
Why should I listen to you?

278
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,199
Listen.

279
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:12,759
Get away from me
if you want to survive.

280
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,120
If you keep following me,

281
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,840
I can't guarantee I'll not tarnish
your name and dignity.

282
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:22,360
You can go but you must
give me my stuff!

283
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,680
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

284
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,600
Are you crazy?

285
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,999
Stop struggling!

286
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,480
I was into wrestling and weightlifting
during my high school.

287
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,879
Although I'm slim now,

288
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,160
but I can still deal with guys like you.

289
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,720
What are you doing?

290
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,800
Although it sounds weird,

291
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:43,840
but does a girl like you...

292
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,999
try to do something
to a man like me...

293
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,600
in the wilderness?

294
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:50,480
Where's the stuff inside your shirt?

295
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,240
I gave it away.

296
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,079
What?

297
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,600
But they returned it.

298
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,519
And then?

299
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,999
Why do you want that?
It's worthless.

300
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,160
What did you say?

301
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:00,559
That thing is very important to me!

302
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,519
Where did you put it?

303
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,759
Why should I tell you?

304
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,800
I told you it's not in my shirt.

305
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,879
Try and search if you don't believe me.

306
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,480
Sure! If I can't find it,

307
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,840
you can return this ten times to me!

308
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,800
Are you for real?

309
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,360
What? Zhou Shi was fired?

310
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,720
When did it happen?

311
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Around a few hours ago.

312
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
Are you Li Ming Cheng?

313
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,160
Yes, I am.

314
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,199
This is your room card.

315
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,639
It's a special offer.

316
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,959
Zhou Shi got this for you.

317
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,280
Okay, thank you.

318
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,319
Ming Cheng, try and call Zhou Shi.

319
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,959
And ask her what happened.

320
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,160
Call her.

321
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,120
Her number is not available.

322
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,439
Not available?

323
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,439
This is amazing!

324
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
This suite.

325
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,800
These furnitures.

326
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,759
Ming Cheng.

327
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,959
We can only stay in normal rooms
if there were only three of us.

328
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,280
But when it comes to you,

329
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,800
we get to stay in
a five-star luxury suite.

330
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,999
This is unfair.

331
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,480
This is...

332
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,040
totally unfair.

333
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,319
What can we say?

334
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,160
This is true love.

335
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,639
Ming Cheng, we'll stay
in the suite for you.

336
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Look at this view.

337
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,519
-Enough already.
-Best place for star-gazing.

338
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,959
What's wrong with her?
Her number is still unavailable.

339
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,360
It's fine if she's just working here.

340
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
But why did she have to
get herself into trouble?

341
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:01,680
I'm sorry!

342
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:05,679
That's enough!

343
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,559
Let go of me.

344
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,919
At least give me a chance to apologise.

345
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,439
I'll give you five seconds.

346
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Take your hands off me.

347
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,799
If not, I'll chop your hands.

348
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Okay.

349
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,439
What did I say just now?

350
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,279
I should stay one metre away from you.

351
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,600
I remember that.

352
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,840
Now, you're obedient.

353
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,520
Where did your drive go?

354
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,000
You dragged me into this mess.

355
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,760
And now, you're sorry for it?

356
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:37,559
I'm really sorry.

357
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,679
If that worked,

358
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:39,919
we won't have Gucci,

359
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,039
Armani, Versace and Valentino
in the world anymore.

360
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,439
You mean...

361
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,199
I accidentally tear your...

362
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,600
Accidentally?

363
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:48,360
Can you call your action an accident?

364
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
If what happened was an accident,

365
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:53,079
am I massaging you
if I slap you right now?

366
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,919
You're not avoiding it?

367
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,079
I hold true to my words.
I'll work under you.

368
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:00,360
I won't regret my actions.

369
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,919
Many people wanted to work under me.

370
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,360
Why should I hire you?

371
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,799
What if you're in a bad mood someday?

372
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:09,559
And you want to search my body again?

373
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,600
I won't do that anymore.

374
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,799
I've searched your body already.

375
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,199
Even if I was stubborn,

376
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,120
I should face the reality now.

377
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,159
My stuff is not with you.

378
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,000
I think it's missing.

379
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,679
I don't understand
what are you thinking.

380
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,360
Where did you get the confidence...

381
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,959
to search my body in a field?

382
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,679
Why do you think that a boss like me
would steal from you?

383
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,439
And it's only a letter.

384
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,919
You're right.

385
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,400
It's only a letter.

386
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,559
It's raining! Run!

387
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
Is this for real?

388
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:52,400
What's wrong with you?

389
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,079
I'll become lethargic when it rains.

390
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,360
There's a bus stop in front.
I'll take you there.

391
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,959
Who asked for your help?

392
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,600
I don't need your help.

393
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,159
What am I to you?

394
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,600
You're only a small girl.

395
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,439
Why do you think that you can help me?
I'm a big guy.

396
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,640
I don't need your help.

397
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,919
I'll get there on my own.
Even if I have to crawl.

398
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,240
-Zhou Shi!
-Shi Shi!

399
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,240
-Zhou Shi!
-Shi Shi!

400
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,520
Shi Shi!

401
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,480
How is it? Did you find them?

402
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:29,919
-We didn't.
-We didn't.

403
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,959
What should we do? It's dark now.

404
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
I think we should postpone our search.

405
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,760
You guys can go back first.

406
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:38,959
If there's any news, contact me.

407
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,039
It's raining so heavily.

408
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,520
I can't just leave her alone.

409
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,959
Is anyone there?

410
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,480
Shi Shi? Shi Shi!

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,279
Zhang Ran Yu?

412
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Senior Ran Yu? Why are you here?

413
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:00,760
So, Ming Cheng did see you today.

414
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,039
You came with your boyfriend?

415
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm in a bad mood.
That's why I came for a walk.

416
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,720
I slipped accidentally.

417
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
Now, it's raining heavily too.

418
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,439
I can't get back to the hotel.

419
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,360
Ran Yu.

420
00:20:18,199 --> 00:20:19,480
Do you still remember me?

421
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,720
Are you from the physics class?

422
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,840
Yes. I'm Li Ming Cheng.

423
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,120
We met before in the student council.

424
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,240
These three are from
Kwang Hua University too.

425
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,600
They're from the
astronomy club as well.

426
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
Can you still walk?

427
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,760
What are you waiting for?

428
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:42,000
Your idol is injured.

429
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,279
Can't you guys help her up?

430
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,079
-Here.
-Let me help.

431
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,159
Senior.

432
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,079
Slowly.

433
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:50,840
You guys send her back first.

434
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,559
I'll look for Zhou Shi.

435
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,159
Zhou Shi?

436
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,439
Zhou Shi is his junior.

437
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,279
She worked in the hotel before.

438
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,679
Aren't you going back with us?

439
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,199
It's raining heavily now.
It's dangerous out there.

440
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,799
Ming Cheng,
let's send our senior back first.

441
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,079
Yeah, we should go together.

442
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah, maybe Zhou Shi
returned to the hotel already.

443
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,679
Fine, we'll send you back first.

444
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:16,799
Let's go.

445
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,199
Senior, walk slowly.

446
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,600
Be careful of the steps.

447
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,679
Be careful.

448
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,439
You spilled your water all over me!

449
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:32,799
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:34,120
It's late already.

451
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,000
Can't you just control yourself?

452
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,760
But I can't bear it when my hair is wet.

453
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:40,640
Aren't you drying your hair?
You'll get a cold.

454
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,480
No need.

455
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,600
I'm in my worst condition already.

456
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,880
I'm really sorry!

457
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,159
Whenever I'm with you,

458
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,400
I'll face unlucky things.

459
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,319
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,640
I'm really sorry for this.

461
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
If you feel apologetic to me,

462
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,439
tell me about your unlucky adventures
and let me have a laugh.

463
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
You're really sick.

464
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,400
Fine. Don't tell me then.

465
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Tell me about the letter.

466
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,400
and its content...

467
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,959
that you've been chasing me for it.

468
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
It's...

469
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,400
just a normal letter.

470
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,880
A normal letter?

471
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,840
I'm sure it's a love letter to a guy.

472
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:23,159
It's not.

473
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:24,439
It's an IOU.

474
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,439
Yeah. An IOU.

475
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,559
An IOU?

476
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,159
An IOU with a pink envelope?

477
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,720
How did you know it was pink?

478
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,159
You saw my letter?

479
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,199
When I was cleaning the guest room,

480
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,559
I saw that letter.

481
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,919
And I threw it away.

482
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,480
You threw it away?

483
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah.

484
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,520
I think it's in the furnace now.

485
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,959
It's reduced to ashes already.

486
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:47,520
Do you know how much time
I've spent on that letter?

487
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,159
Everything is gone now!

488
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:51,959
How should I know
it was your love letter?

489
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Besides, why did you put it in my room?

490
00:22:55,439 --> 00:22:56,520
Wait.

491
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,799
Did you write that for me?

492
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,199
Of course not!

493
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,079
Who asked you to stay in my room?

494
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,439
You ruined my confession.

495
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,199
And you're the reason I'm here.

496
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:09,959
It's raining so heavily.

497
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,959
Where's the rain?

498
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:15,919
When did it stop raining?

499
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,919
After the rain,

500
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,840
we can see the stars now.

501
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,959
The weather report today is accurate.

502
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,240
Do you know this?

503
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,079
I was supposed to meet him here.

504
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:35,000
We were supposed to watch
The Perseids together.

505
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,840
And I was supposed to confess to him.

506
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,880
I didn't expect that
you'll be the one here.

507
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,520
Me too.

508
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,760
I should be drinking some wine
in a hot spring right now.

509
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,600
It's impossible for me
to be in this plight.

510
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,000
Impossible for me
to wait for a bus with you.

511
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,159
Besides, is confessing
your feelings that hard?

512
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,439
I guess the guy you liked
must be studying too.

513
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,439
Guys at this kind of age,

514
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,520
even if they're romantic,

515
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,520
it's an illusion conjured up
by teenage girls like you.

516
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,240
It's just like gift wrappers.

517
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,480
They're useless.
Why don't you be direct about it?

518
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,439
Stop!

519
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,159
Don't group him together
with playboys like you.

520
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,679
He's not that perverted!

521
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,120
I'm perverted?

522
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,919
Who's the one that pushed
me to the ground today?

523
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,760
Judging by your actions,

524
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,559
I think you're quite familiar
with being a pervert.

525
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,039
Stop that!

526
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:26,720
Girl.

527
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,360
What? Stop talking!

528
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,120
I know you're going to insult me again.

529
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,679
I don't want to see your annoying face.

530
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
You really don't want to see it?

531
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,039
I don't!

532
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,439
What are you doing?

533
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,520
Isn't it beautiful?

534
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,919
This is magical.

535
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,600
So, this is what
a meteor shower looks like.

536
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,799
It's my first time seeing this.

537
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:59,279
Oh right, I should make some wishes.

538
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,000
You're really naive.

539
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,559
They're only the garbages of the galaxy.

540
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:09,240
Maybe it's the space station's
toilet bowl?

541
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,480
You made a wish with a toilet bowl.

542
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,520
What a smelly wish.

543
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,840
Stop talking!

544
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,319
You are a dirty adult.

545
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,279
Can't you be more optimistic?

546
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:21,039
Fine. I'll make a wish too.

547
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,600
First, I wish there's a bus right now.

548
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,319
And the bus will bring me
away from this place.

549
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,679
What's your name again?

550
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,760
Why should you care?

551
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,480
Fine. My second wish is...

552
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,360
The bus is here!

553
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,079
Is this true? My wish is granted?

554
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,640
Look. The universe is magical, isn't it?

555
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:43,240
If that happened,
I think your second wish...

556
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,039
would be granted soon.

Let me see!

562
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,840
Let me see.

563
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,760

You have such a good head-to-body ratio.

567
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,199
But you're a scum.

568
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:51,360
Listen. When we get back to the hotel,

569
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,159
don't ride my car anymore.

570
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,959
In other people's eyes,

571
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,799
riding my car is just like being
in a relationship with me.

572
00:26:57,959 --> 00:26:59,039
What?

573
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:00,760
Of course,

574
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,600
if you want to be famous instantly,

575
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,199
you can do that as well.

576
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,720
What are you thinking about?

577
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,000
I have my own place.

578
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,640
I don't miss your palace.

579
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't want to wake up...

580
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,120
with a calendar at my face.

581
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:14,079
Calendar?

582
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,120
Yeah, the netizens say that...

583
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,640
you change your girlfriend monthly.

584
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,120
If you change your girlfriend monthly,
you can change your calendars too.

585
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,520
If you like to change things,

586
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,520
why don't you be a spokesperson
for disposable lenses?

587
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,360
Netizens nowadays like to
compliment people in weird ways.

588
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,319
But, a nameless person like you,

589
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,720
even if you were part of my calendar,
nobody would care you.

590
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,640
Who are you talking about?

591
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,319
I'm talking about you.
Tell me your name.

592
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:37,240
I'm Zhou Shi!

593
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,480
In the end, you told me your name.

594
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,079
You cheated me!

595
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,319
What's wrong with that?

596
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,520
Every debt has it's debtor.

597
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,000
Next time, when I see your name,

598
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,400
at least I can avoid you.

599
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:50,799
Did you know what I wished for?

600
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,880
Before the bus came?

601
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,240
How should I know that?

602
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,520
My wish is to never see your name again.

603
00:27:56,679 --> 00:27:58,600
In my whole life.

604
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,000
Thank god for this! Goodbye!

605
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
I don't want to see
anything about you too!

606
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,760
Not even a word or a pixel!

607
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,079
You are wasting our resources!

608
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,279
Be mindful of your own body!

609
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,640
You don't need to worry about that.

610
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:20,720
Excuse me.

611
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,279
Can I borrow your phone?

612
00:28:22,439 --> 00:28:23,319
Okay, here.

613
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,439
Thank you.

614
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
You...

615
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,919
Stop asking questions.
Just find a hotel for me.

616
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,480
By the way, how's Zhang Ran Yu?

617
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:40,159
After you left,

618
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Miss Zhang threw
a tantrum and she left.

619
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,559
She twisted her ankle by the lake.

620
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,679
Luckily, she was found
by her schoolmates.

621
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
She's back in the hotel now.

622
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:54,000
But her schoolmates are trying
to look for someone else.

623
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:57,199
I think it's the girl
that was your personal housekeeper before.

624
00:28:57,439 --> 00:28:58,760
She came to the hotel...

625
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,600
because she wanted to find
a good location for stargazing.

626
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,720
Although she's weird,

627
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,039
she's not a paparazzi.

628
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,799
Contact Manager Wang.

629
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Understood.

630
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,279
I didn't say anything yet.

631
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,840
I need to find something.
Although it may not appear,

632
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,000
but I hope they can find it for me.

633
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,679
Can I really stay here
for one more night?

634
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,279
Didn't you guys want to chase me out?

635
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:31,279
What's wrong? You don't want to stay?

636
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,720
It's dark out there.

637
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,120
If you want to leave now,

638
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,480
nobody would care.

639
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,360
It's not that! Thank you, manager!

640
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,679
That's enough already.

641
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,120
No need to thank me.

642
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,480
Listen.

643
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,279
Our chairman...

644
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,520
may look tough on the front,

645
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,480
but he's a nice guy.

646
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,760
He just asked his assistant to call me.

647
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,120
He wanted to cancel your punishment.

648
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,679
You can stay here again.

649
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,079
And you can continue to work here.

650
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm not doing this.

651
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,000
We're equal now.

652
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,919
Besides, I need to return
to college after tonight.

653
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,640
By the way, are my
collegemates here yet?

654
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,720
Shi Shi.

655
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:09,799
Brother Ming Cheng!

656
00:30:12,439 --> 00:30:14,319
Why are you so messy?

657
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:16,679
You didn't answer my call either.

658
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:18,799
I almost called the cops, you know?

659
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,799
Why are you smiling?
What happened?

660
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,039
It's a long story.

661
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,279
She's the one you're looking for?

662
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,480
Yeah. Let me introduce her.

663
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,000
This is my sister, Zhou Shi.

664
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,679
Shi Shi, she's...

665
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,880
I'm Ming Cheng's collegemate
in Kwang Hwa University.

666
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,159
Zhang Ran Yu.

667
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,840
Why does everyone
give me the same reaction?

668
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,600
Am I that popular?

669
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,360
She's been this way since young.

670
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,840
Why are you still standing here?

671
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,720
Follow me now.

672
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:53,559
Brother Ming Cheng.

673
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,039
It's useless even if
you try to be pitiful.

674
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:57,199
I'll interrogate you later.

675
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,520
Are you hurt?

676
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,840
This is impossible.

677
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:33,880
With this kind of contact,

678
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:35,400
it's impossible for me to be okay.

679
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,279
Come, I'll test you.

680
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,679
Give me another name for The Perseids.

681
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,400
I know.

682
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,480
It's...

683
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,279
Virgo.

684
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,840
-Virgo?
-Incorrect. Your turn.

685
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,919
My turn? I think it's...

686
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,799
something about gamma.

687
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,279
Tell me the answer then.

688
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,120
It's the Perseids gamma meteor shower.

689
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,720
He's truly an elite.

690
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,120
This is a simple question.

691
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,760
Of course our leader should know this.

692
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,240
Try this

693
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,240
Shi Shi.

694
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:11,480
-Let me have a look.
-Just put it there.

695
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,079
The room keeper
will collect it afterwards.

696
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,120
I'm the room keeper.

697
00:32:16,439 --> 00:32:18,199
I've worked here for a month.
I'm used to it already.

698
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,319
It's easy for me.

699
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,240
You reminded me of something.

700
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:24,520
Who asked you to book this suite for us?

701
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,159
You came to work
in such an isolated place too.

702
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,360
I'm not doing this for you guys.

703
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:31,520
I'm here for the money.

704
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,199
They have high wages here.

705
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,919
Since I'm working here,
I might as well get you guys a suite.

706
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,880
You helped me in the past.

707
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,279
Don't mention it.

708
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,679
Did I helped you in the past?

709
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,079
I can't remember.

710
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,039
By the way,

711
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,679
didn't you say you need
to tell me something?

712
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:52,600
I...

713
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,760
The meteor showers are coming again!

714
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,840
Let's go! They're waiting for you
to adjust the telescope.

715
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,880
-Come together with us.
-Faster, let's go.

716
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,159
Ming Cheng, you're here?

717
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,360
Look at this.
Do you know how to adjust it?

718
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,199
Are the meteor showers here?

719
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,919
Brother Ming Cheng, you're amazing!

720
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,760
We'll just wait for the second wave.

721
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:49,520
Here's the stuff you wanted.

722
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:51,959
Thank you.

723
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,919
I'll leave now.

724
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:39,519
Impossible.

725
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,400
Is she the one that
saved me by the river?

726
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
I think it's almost time.
Let's get ready.

727
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,600
Are they coming?

728
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,160
Someone once said that...

729
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,239
passionate love is just like
a meteor shower.

730
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,120
Although it ends in a flash,

731
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,640
it ignites the person inside out.

732
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,880
Puppy love is just like moonlight.

733
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,880
It's only a projection.

734
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,360
It's a secret unless the owner
wanted to reveal it.

735
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,680
It's so beautiful!

736
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,799
-Did you see that?
-Here, look in this direction.

737
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,120
-Let's take a selfie.
-Sure!

738
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,433
[Guanghua Vision University]

739
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,640
So, this is the legendary Maserati.

740
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,640
I think it belongs to a rich guy.

741
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,519
I hope the car isn't the same
as the previous car.

742
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,279
It breaks down when it hits a rock.

743
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,559
Give me another bottle.
With ice please.

744
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,719
That's so cold! Don't blame it
on others when your period is absent.

745
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,999
Fei Fei!

746
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,559
Do you miss me?

747
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,120
I missed you so much!

748
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,600
You changed again after two months?

749
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:21,960
Did you...

750
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,519
Why aren't you in college when
it's opened for two weeks already?

751
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,920
Where did you go?

752
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,759
I got a part-time job.

753
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,960
I don't need to come because
our block is under renovation.

754
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,400
You impress me.

755
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,719
It's my first time seeing
an arts major student like you.

756
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,759
Look at your coursemates.

757
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,360
They can just enjoy their lives.

758
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:47,759
Without any worries at all.

759
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,239
But you, you tried to work.

760
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,319
You are trying to become
a labour worker.

761
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,999
They can depend
on their parents for money.

762
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,400
I can only depend on myself.

763
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,920
You can't compare us together.

764
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,279
Some of them are
independent too, you know?

765
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,759
You are good-looking.

766
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,920
Why don't you use your looks
to your advantages?

767
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,319
Look at that guy.

768
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,719
The one with the black jacket.

769
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,479
Who's that?

770
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,840
He's my boyfriend.

771
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,160
You!

772
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:32,559
Believe me.
He's worthless but he's rich.

773
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,799
Goodbye.

774
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,559
Just find yourself a rich boyfriend.

775
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,960
Is this for real?

776
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,400
The cutest thing in the world
is a rich boyfriend.

777
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,680
You can keep him for yourself.

778
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,680
I can't stand him.

779
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:43,999
Don't do this!

780
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,440
He's my boyfriend, Gao Yang.

781
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,079
He's a lost sheep.

782
00:37:51,279 --> 00:37:53,600
She's a beauty.
Why haven't I seen her before?

783
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,319
All my friends from
the art courses are beauties.

784
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:57,239
She's beautiful, right?

785
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,079
Don't listen to her. I'm not
the most beautiful among them.

786
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,440
I can see that.

787
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,039
Your face is fine. But,

788
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,799
you need a makeover.

789
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,680
Don't be offended by my words.

790
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,799
What I mean is clothes make the man.

791
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,880
If you doll yourself up,
I think you will do fine.

792
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,279
Just ask Fei Fei...

793
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,079
to bring you to shop next time.

794
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,759
I have some things to do.
I'll go back now.

795
00:38:18,999 --> 00:38:20,120
Goodbye!

796
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:23,640
Big brother,

797
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,840
can you be cold and reserved?

798
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,880
-Let's have some tea later.
-Okay.

799
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,680
You guys are using
high voltage plugs at the same time.

800
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,120
Aren't you afraid that it'll blow up?

801
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:56,079
We've always did this since first year.

802
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,719
I'm sure all the dorms here
have water kettles too.

803
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,559
Yeah, don't use it if you're afraid.

804
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,479
While you were absent,

805
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,519
we took over your place.

806
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:12,039
You won't mind that, right?

807
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,479
Just put your things there.

808
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,160
We'll settle them for you later.

809
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,759
No thanks. I'll do it myself.

810
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,079
Fine then.

811
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:20,799
During the last two weeks,

812
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,759
we covered up for your absence.

813
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,239
When the dorm supervisor
checks our room,

814
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,079
we say that you went
to your boyfriend's house.

815
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,600
You have a boyfriend, right?

816
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,719
You must shoulder the blame...

817
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,920
if the supervisor finds out the truth.

818
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,960
Did Teacher give us any homework?

819
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,559
He wanted to collect
our summer homework.

820
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:39,400
We have to hand it in next week.

821
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,440
Let me have a look.

822
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,719
Let me have a look.

823
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,360
You don't know what you're dealing with.

824
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:48,360
What is this?

825
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:49,999
-This is her work.
-Give it back.

826
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,479
She got the highest mark last time.
This is worthy of a scholarship.

827
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,319
I heard that you can't afford
the painting materials now.

828
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,519
Even the papers
you used are the cheapest.

829
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:00,799
Even a drop of water
can spoil your work, right?

830
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Your scholarship is gone now.

831
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,680
What a waste.

832
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,840
By the way, while you're here,

833
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,160
let's settle our utility bills
for the last two months.

834
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:13,519
Yeah, you have to pay one-fourth of it.

835
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,799
Share it with us.

836
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,920
One-fourth?

837
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,719
Are you kidding me?

838
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:23,759
I'm not the same level with you scums!

839
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,160
Zhou Shi! What are you talking about?

840
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,759
-What are you doing?
-You must be crazy!

841
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,200
Are you crazy?

842
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,999
You must be crazy!

843
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,319
I'm sorry.

844
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,640
I shouldn't throw
the rubbishes on the ground.

845
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,960
I should throw them to the balcony!

846
00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:53,999
I don't want to stay
in this pig sty anymore!

847
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,479
You guys can keep
your dirty secrets here!

848
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,279
You must be crazy!

849
00:41:02,479 --> 00:41:03,279
Is this for real?

850
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,360
Are you going to let them go?

851
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,039
Should I fight them then?

852
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,719
I'm afraid that...

853
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,999
I'll bust their plastic bodies.

854
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,960
Yeah. Since young,

855
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,319
you only lose in verbal arguments.

856
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,479
You had never lost
a physical fight before.

857
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:22,680
Why do you have such a hard life?

858
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,039
What will you do next?

859
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,479
I'll ask the supermarket
that I've worked there before.

860
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,960
I'll try to be a security guard.

861
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,239
A security guard?

862
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,160
There's a living person
in front of you, you know?

863
00:41:34,279 --> 00:41:36,600
Why do you want to find someone else?
I'm speechless.

864
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,039
Aren't you staying with someone else?

865
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,840
Is there enough space for me?

866
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,759
No problem. I have a store room there.

867
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,120
Just clean the room.

868
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,680
I think you can fit in there.

869
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,799
Besides,

870
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,279
I'm sure it's cheaper than
the rooms outside.

871
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,719
But my housemate is quite weird.

872
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,360
I'm not sure she'll agree to this.

873
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,640
Never mind that.
We are desperate now.

874
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:01,120
We'll just try this first.
