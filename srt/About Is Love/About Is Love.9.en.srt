[Episode 9]

29
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,440
This rabbit is crying.

30
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,760
It isn't cute at all.

31
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:08,080
Do you know a clever rabbit
has three burrows?

32
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,599
It's cold, okay?

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,599
The burrow for it to hide is gone,

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
so it's crying.

35
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,399
I thought you drew a carrot.

36
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,720
Turns out it's a hole to hide.

37
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,039
You'll develop an attachment
to the burrow after staying in it.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,760
Turns out I was sad...

39
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,200
not because I like him a lot,

40
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,720
but because...

41
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,720
I lost the sense of security
he provided.

42
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,039
Sense of security?

43
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:42,879
At least you had it.

44
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,120
But, I didn't have it at all.

45
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,000
What is this?

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,159
Don't look at this.

47
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
You allowed to draw but I can't look?

48

Zhou Shi?

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,399
So you like Zhou Shi?

50
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,439
Stop staring at me.

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,159
Don't worry, I won't tell
your benefactor.

52
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080
But, you'll have to make me happy.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
To make a woman happy,

54
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,399
the easiest way is to...

55
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,640
swipe your card and buy a bag for me.

56
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,159
Then, I'll keep your secret.

57
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:40,879
I didn't bring it.

58
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,080
Why don't you say you don't have money?

59
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,560
Can you ask for something else?

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,039
If there is a way to make me happy...

61
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,720
without spending money,

62
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,480
I'll give you money, okay?

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,239
Okay.

64
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,760

65
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,239
Wait for me.

Yes.

My heart is beating so fast.

Don't complain when you're in the wrong.

88

You were moving around...

89

and made me trip.

90

Do you think I want to fall down?

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,640

-Let me take a look.
-Don't touch me.

93

Nothing will happen if I take a look.

95

-No.

What about this?

99
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,760
Of course it hurts if you press it.

100
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,999
It should be fine.

101
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:13,159
Don't walk for the next few days.

102
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,839
Rest at home well.

103

Don't walk? Are you joking?

104

If I don't walk, how can I go to school?

105

Not everyone is like you,

107
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,039
If you say yes,

108
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,279
you can have a driver too.

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,159
Say yes to what?

110
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,599
Is it that hard to be my girlfriend?

111
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,879
This isn't about saying yes or no.

112
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,879
I get it.

113
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,960
You have someone that you like.

114
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,719
So, you can't say yes.

115
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,640
You know yet you're still asking?

116
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
To be frank, you don't have any hope...

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,879
for this relationship, right?

118
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,960
Among all the flowers,

119
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,800
you chose to take
the sea lavender and daisy.

120
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:53,680
That means they are important to you.

121
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:58,719
You even carved them...

122
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
on the letter.

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,960
It's really with you?

124
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:04,319
That means that letter...

125
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:05,839
I read it.

126
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,960
Why did you read it?

127
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,240
There are many types flowers
to confess love.

128
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,839
But you chose
the sea lavender and daisy...

129
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,439
probably because they can either mean...

130
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,640
a long lasting secret love...

131
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,640
or a never ending friendship.

132
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:24,719
You prepared a backup plan.

133
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,119
If your confession failed,

134
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,439
you can get away by saying that
you're friends.

135
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:29,599
Stop it.

136
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,480
You don't even have confidence
in this relationship,

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,559
do you need to go on?

138
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,400
Stop it.

139
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,999
I heard that you chose
Guanghua Vision University...

140
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,279
because of Li Ming Cheng.

141
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,839
Studying fine arts needs a lot of money.

142
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
Your family shouldn't be able
to afford it, right?

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,159
For your own selfish desires,

144
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,680
you'd rather burden your parents
with the expensive tuition fees.

145
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,360
Your first love hurt you and others.

146
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,599
Shut up.

147
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,119
I earn my own money.

148
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:58,240
I never spent any of my parents' money.

149
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:00,559
You don't know me at all,
how could you say that about me?

150
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,640
So, you worked so hard...

151
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:04,480
for Li Ming Cheng?

152
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,599
None of your business.

153
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,039
Okay, I get it.

154
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:19,279
Good.

155
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,319
Don't pester me anymore.

156
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,080
Let's start by being friends.

157
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,200
Since you harboured a secret crush
on him since you were a teenager,

158
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,640
it's impossible for you...

159
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
to forget him immediately.

160
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,359
We can take it slow.

161
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,559
Did you listen to what I said?

162
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,040
I have to go back to the office to work.

163
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,319
Stay here, don't go anywhere.
I'll send my driver to pick you up.

164
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:40,919
I don't need your driver to pick me up.

165
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:47,319
This is for you.

166
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,879
Let's start from zero.

167
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:51,319
Be prepared.

168
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:56,200
I won't give up.

169
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,319
Give up, scoundrel!

170
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:12,840
Turns out in other people's eyes,

171
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm a rabbit.

172
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,160
No wonder I was always lied to.

173
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,960
What did you pour inside?

174
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,559
Detergent, glue, sugar...

175
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,879
and some glycerin.

176
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
What's the use of pouring all of that?

177
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,799
For fun.

178
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,439
Are you feeling better now?

179
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,400
So this is the way...

180
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,160
to make me happy without spending money?

181
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,720
Okay, I'll admit it worked.

182
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,359
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,879
How childish.

184
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,359
You played with bubbles
for the whole day.

185
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,119
He's the childish one, okay?
I merely went along with him.

186
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,640
He saw that you were in a bad mood...

187
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,999
and went to accompany you, okay?

188
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:01,359
Or else, why would
he go to that place...

189
00:12:01,359 --> 00:12:03,119
where you were drinking to draw?

190
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,600
-He purposely came to look for me?
-Yes.

191
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,239
You're still heartbroken,

192
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
but you tried to be strong.

193
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,359
If Xiao Fei didn't realise
something was wrong,

194
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:14,720
do you know how
dangerous it is for a girl...

195
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,879
to drink outside alone?

196
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,720
Okay, I'll reflect upon myself.

197
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,999
But, he's good.

198
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
He's good at studying people.

199
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,720
That's right.

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,879
Are you done?

201
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:31,479
Yes, I cleaned up.

202
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:52,559
It's all the same.

203
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,960
What are you looking at?

204
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,479
Just now, you went to take a shower.

205
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,359
After you came out,
I went in to wash my hands.

206
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,080
That time, I remembered
where everything was placed.

207
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,319
Why did you remember that?

208
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:03,280
I didn't remember that on purpose.
Don't interrupt me.

209
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,520
Now, everything is
in the same position...

210
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,239
just like when you
finished taking a shower.

211
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:09,919
So?

212
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,239
So that means after taking a shower,

213
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,799
he put everything back.

214
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
That's nothing.
Maybe he didn't use anything.

215
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,520
Did you mop the floor after showering?

216
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,439
No.

217
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
The mop was used.

218
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:26,479
This is too much.

219
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,239
He didn't dry the mop after using it.

220
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,479
This is where the contradiction lies.

221
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,520
He isn't good at doing that,

222
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,679
but he purposely cleaned everything.

223
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,319
He was afraid that his presence...

224
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,960
will cause trouble to others.

225
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,359
Don't you think he's
living too cautiously?

226
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:47,239
Is he...

227
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,479
a fugitive...

228
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,119
that is afraid of being discovered?

229
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,520
Did you go crazy because
you watched too many dramas?

230
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,400
Then, tell me.

231
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,840
Is he being cautious...

232
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,160
because he isn't used
to living with others?

233
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,160
No, I think it's exactly the opposite.

234
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,400
Living in someone else's house
may be normal to him.

235
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,200
I'm curious.

236
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,200
He's just a kid, there's nothing
mysterious about him.

237
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,919
He's not just a normal kid.

238
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:14,960
He's a wealthy kid.

239
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:17,080
What do you mean?

240
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,999
Let's talk in my room.

241
00:14:20,239 --> 00:14:21,520
Let's go...

242
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,960
Isn't this Ning Fei's card?

243
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,760
He asked for my help last time.

244
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,319
He said he forgot the password and
asked me to crack his PIN number.

245
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,840
I asked him for some hints.

246
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,999
Now, I successfully...

247
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,319
cracked the password.

248
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,239
Guess how much money is in this account.

249
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,359
How much money?

250
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:56,479
You're lying, right?

251
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,999
How could he...

252
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,999
Did you confirm it?

253
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,160
Did he take his benefactor's card?

254
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:05,400
I confirmed it.
This is his personal account.

255
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,799
Moreover, all transfers are normal.

256
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:10,600
Money was only transferred in.
Looks legit to me.

257
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,760
That's right.

258
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,960
His dad is a pottery master, right?

259
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:15,760
The price of the bowl
he made is expensive.

260
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,760
Do the money belongs to his dad?

261
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,559
I checked on his dad too.

262
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,200
His dad is the Van Gogh of China.

263
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,080
When he was alive, he was destitute.

264
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,160
After he died, he was not famous too.

265
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:27,479
A few decades after he died,

266
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,799
his work was discovered.

267
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,439
And, guess who owns all of his work?

268
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:33,640
-Who is it?
-Yun Ma Art.

269
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,960
The benefactor.

270
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,919
The Ning family and
Wei family are close friends.

271
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,280
So, Madam He treated him well.

272
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:46,760
From now on, stop calling him toy boy.
It's a bad nickname.

273
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,799
Xiao Fei is...

274
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,080
really wealthy.

275
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,479
Oh dear.

276
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
We asked a wealthy man to
sleep in our living room.

277
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,239
Oh dear.

278
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:13,919
What's wrong with her?

279
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,200
She's digesting.

280
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,200
Digesting what?

281
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,640
Search high and low to find nothing...

282
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
when that person is
staying in the same home.

283
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,960
She needs to digest that.

284
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,479
I don't get you.

285
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,799
By the way, did you see...

286
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,160
a blue wallet?

287
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,879
No. Did you lose it?

288
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
No.

289
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,319
I probably left it in my room.

290
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,559
I'll go and look for it again.

291
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,839
It isn't in my bag.

292
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,800
It isn't in my drawer.

293
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,959
Living room, bedroom, I searched
the whole house but couldn't find it.

294
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,400
Where did I leave my wallet?

295
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,479
My living expenses for this month.

296
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,160
No.

297
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,239
Recall where you went today.

298
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,800
There must be a clue.

299
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,680
Right.

300
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,999
I dropped it then.

301
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,359
Oh no...

302
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,440
It must be taken by someone.

303
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,599
My living expenses.

304
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,520
Heavens, it's fine if you hurt me.

305
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,400
Why did you hurt my wallet?

306
00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:06,760
Zhou Shi, we're having lunch.

307
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,520
You're being too
environmentally friendly.

308
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,440
I'm on a diet.

309
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,879
I thought only Lin Fei Fei...

310
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,400
will do something like that.

311
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,040
What did you say?

312
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
I never thought...

313
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
I'd see you eat fast food in my life.

314
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,719
Won't you regret eating it?

315
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:25,800
The calories are high.

316
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,359
These aren't mine.

317
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:32,040
Ning Fei, here.

318
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,359
She took action.

319
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,239
Don't nag. Help me if you're my friend.

320
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,719
Sister Zhou Shi.

321
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,320
Why are you eating so little food?

322
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,959
Women need to go on diets.

323
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,760
Zhou Shi finally realised it.

324
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,560
Yes...

325
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,560
By the way, you like to eat
fried chicken, right?

326
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,040
I bought an extra set.

327
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
Eat more.

328
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,040
Eat what others give you.

329
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:16,359
Why is Fei Fei suddenly...

330
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,520
Since she realised...

331
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,479
there's a oyster beside her.

332
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,560
What nonsense are you talking about?

333
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,839
Is it delicious?

334
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:29,959
You want to add me?

335
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,680
Come out with a question I can't answer.

336
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,479
90 seconds.

337
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,119
She didn't blacklist me.

338
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,959
That means I can go on?

339
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:03,800
Why does it feel like
a full blown competition now?

340
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,800
Is there any question
that she doesn't know?

341
00:20:15,199 --> 00:20:16,640
I'll ask Shi Shi next time.

342
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,479
Zhou Shi.

343
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:23,640
You ate so little food.
You need to work at night.

344
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,119
Can your body handle it?

345
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:27,400
Of course.

346
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,320
I can't stand this anymore.

347
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,959
What a waste.

348
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,959
Don't they know that
there are many people...

349
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,119
who don't get to eat in this world?

350
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,959
For example, me.

351
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,599
These need to be thrown away...

352
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,920
into the dustbin.

353
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,599
They are going to be thrown away anyway.

354
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,119
What are you doing?

355
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,239
Nothing...

356
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,800
You don't have to clean this up.

357
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,079
There are VIP guests coming soon.

358
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,520
Quick, prepare the drinks.

359
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,400
Yes.

360
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,079
Director Sheng.

361
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,680
I want to ask...

362
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,520
about my salary this month.

363
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:44,920
Salary?

364
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,479
The accounting manager is not in.

365
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,839
It'll probably be
delayed until next week.

366
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,079
What's wrong? Do you need money?

367
00:21:51,239 --> 00:21:52,959
No, as long as you can give it.

368
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,040
Hurry up and go.

369
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:04,320
Chairman Wei, I'm sorry.

370
00:22:04,479 --> 00:22:06,520
Sorry to keep you waiting.
The room will be ready soon.

371
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,879
It's fine. I can wait for a while.

372
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,199
At least I saw something interesting.

373
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:28,040
Who?

374
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,879
Hello, Miss Zhou Shi.
This is your parcel.

375
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,560
What are these?

376
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,440
What else? Presents.

377
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,999
Wei Qing again.

378
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,680
Who else?

379
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:49,359
Previously, you sent off a batch.

380
00:22:49,479 --> 00:22:51,119
Now, another batch is here.

381
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,400
Why don't you ask the deliveryman
to take them back?

382
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,599
I don't have money to do so.

383
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,560
When will he stop?

384
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,680
As expected, there's a reason why...

385
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:16,359
he became the new favourite
of the art world.

386
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,959
Hand these to the company's designer.

387
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,320
Ask them to use the designs...

388
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,160
for our new collection.

389
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,680
Then, use Xun Ran's exhibition
as a marketing tool.

390
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,760
Okay.

391
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,634
[Zhou Shi]

392
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,560
When will you stop?

393
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,280
When are you going to stop pestering me?

394
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,760
Why are you speaking so loudly?

395
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,479
Can you not be so rude?

396
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,879
Stop the nonsense.

397
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,440
When are you going to stop
sending me things?

398
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,440
The parcels have reached?
That's fast.

399
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,839
I'll give the shop a good rating.

400
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,839
Am I joking?

401
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:56,839
That day when you gave me flowers,

402
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,239
didn't I say clearly...

403
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,999
not to send me anything?

404
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,640
You're wasting money
for the delivery fee.

405
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,239
I can't hear you clearly.

406
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,719
I can't hear you.

407
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,199
The signal is bad here.

408
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,560
Tell me in person.

409
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,040
I'll send you the address.

410
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:17,959
Come here if you want to see me.

411
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:28,959
That far?

412
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,839
I don't even have money
to buy a screen protector.

413
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,560
Who gave you the courage
to throw your phone?

414
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,440
Heavens!

415
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,479
I was wrong.

416
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Please help me to punish Wei Qing!

417
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:54,640
We aren't compatible.

418
00:25:06,199 --> 00:25:07,160
This way, please.

419
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,839
You're here? That's fast.

420
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,760
I spend a lot of money
to take a taxi here.

421
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,839
Of course I'm fast.

422
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:18,359
You're sincere.
Here, take a sip of tea.

423
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,400
It's delicious.

424
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm thirsty.

425
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:28,239
I knew you'd be thirsty when you come.

426
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,999
So, I added honey and mint.

427
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,119
Thank you.

428
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,479
Actually, I'm here to say...

429
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,119
It's tea time now.

430
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,599
Let's eat before we talk.

431
00:25:57,719 --> 00:26:00,320
Can I eat them?

432
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,920
Of course.

433
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,479
Don't do this.

434
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,920
Don't think that
you can make me yield...

435
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,999
by giving me a sugar-coated bullet.

436
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,760
Let me tell you, impossible.

437
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,879
I hate to be lied to.

438
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,520
Don't think that by spending money
to make people happy,

439
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,719
they will forgive you.

440
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,640
Let me tell you.
Maybe it works for others,

441
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,320
but it won't work for me.

442
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,079
What do I have to do...

443
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,640
to forgive me?

444
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,119
Apologise to me.

445
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:28,640
Impossible.

446
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,479
Then there's nothing else to say.

447
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,359
You'd better find someone
to take away all the things.

448
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,239
Or else,

449
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,199
wait until I have money
to send them back.

450
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,879
Goodbye.

451
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,479
Don't blame me.

452
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,119
It's not that I don't want to eat you,

453
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,359
but I can't eat you.

454
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,959
Heavens,

455
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:57,239
why are you torturing me?

456
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,520
No.

457
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,760
Zhou Shi, you did the right thing.

458
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:03,560
You can't fall into his trap.

459
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,160
It's not like I haven't seen
good food before.

460
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:15,040
Take them away.

461
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,599
So troublesome.

462
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:24,879
I didn't expect for her
to be so stubborn.

463
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,680
Actually,

464
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,320
I think Miss Zhou...

465
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
is different from others.

466
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,920
What's the use of
being different from others?

467
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,839
Nobody has ever rejected me like that.

468
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,839
If it wasn't because of my body...

469
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,999
didn't have a adverse reaction
towards her,

470
00:27:40,199 --> 00:27:42,520
will I waste that much time for her?

471
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,239
Actually, it isn't hard...

472
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:48,959
to make her accept you.

473
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,760
What do you mean?

474
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,400
Apologise.

475
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,560
Impossible.

476
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:57,199
I've never apologise to anyone.

477
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,599
If you don't apologise,

478
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,999
she probably won't forgive you
for the rest of her life.

479
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
Think about it.

480
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
After 10 years,

481
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,640
you finally found someone like her.

482
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,520
Are you going to lose
because of an apology?

483
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:14,400
But...

484
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,760
But, I don't know how to apologise.

485
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:20,359
It's just three words.
It isn't that hard.

486
00:28:21,479 --> 00:28:23,079
If you go after her now,

487
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,119
you may be able to catch her.

488
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,079
It's all Wei Qing's fault.

489
00:28:37,239 --> 00:28:38,800
He chose a remote place.

490
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:40,920
There isn't a single bus here.

491
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,400
I have to walk back myself.

492
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,160
-Let me send you back.
-No need.

493
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
It's hard to get a taxi here.

494
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,680
Who said I'm going to get a taxi?

495
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,079
The scenery is beautiful here.

496
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:04,760
Can't I take a walk?

497
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,320
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,599
What did you say?

499
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,920
Are you going to say it or not?

500
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,440
If you won't say it, I'll leave.

501
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,440
I'm sorry.

502
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,879
You're apologising to me?

503
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,599
You're apologising, how rare.

504
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:34,680
Do you think I want to do so?
It it wasn't because...

505
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:35,959
If it wasn't because of what?

506
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:38,599
Anyway, I apologised.

507
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,359
We're even now.

508
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,520
You seem unwilling.

509
00:29:43,719 --> 00:29:45,199
I don't think you're sincere.

510
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,320
You...

511
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,359
Okay.

512
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:50,160
Let's move on.

513
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,239
Get in the car.

514
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,560
Are you getting in the car or not?

515
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:55,920
It's hard to get a taxi here.

516
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:57,160
If you're willing to walk,

517
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,040
I won't stop you.

518
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,199
I'll get in...

519
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,320
You look like you're suffering.
Be happy.

520
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:11,479
Let's go, Master Wei.

521
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:23,239
Here is the bus station.

522
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:24,879
Thank you.

523
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,079
By the way,

524
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,440
find someone to take the parcels away.

525
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,320
My wallet is empty now.

526
00:30:36,479 --> 00:30:37,839
I won't send them back.

527
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,599
Did you see the contents of the parcel?

528
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,239
Clothes, accessories and bags.

529
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:44,440
What else?

530
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,839
Look at the contents of the parcels.

531
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,359
If you don't like them,

532
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,760
I'll ask someone to pick them up.

533
00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:53,959
He is acting strangely.

534
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,920
Did he set a trap for me again?

535
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:00,359
♪ Was "you" as stated by her ♪

536
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,199
♪ The "us" that I yearn of ♪

537
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,879
♪ I was the only serious one ♪

538
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,640
♪ The "us" that I yearn of ♪

539
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:17,400
♪ If you didn't tell me firmly... ♪

540
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,320
What is he doing?

541
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,680
There are enough food
to last me for a month.

542
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,879
I received what you sent me.

543
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,400
Are you satisfied?

544
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,800
This time, they aren't expensive trash.

545
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,359
They are life saving to me.

546
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,599
Thank you.

547
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,839
This is the first time.

548
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:56,920
What?

549
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,640
The first time you're thanking me
for my presents.

550
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,959
The point of giving out presents
isn't to show off your wealth.

551
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:03,760
Presents don't have to be expensive.

552
00:32:03,959 --> 00:32:06,079
Anyway, I received your kind intentions.

553
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,359
After I get my salary,

554
00:32:07,479 --> 00:32:09,119
I'll return the money to you.

555
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,520
Why are you being polite?

556
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Aren't we friends?

557
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,440
Because we are friends,
I can't take advantage of you.

558
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,440
Fine, I won't talk anymore.

559
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,320
Goodbye.

560
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,680
Turns out...

561
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,280
she can be persuaded by reason
but isn't cowed by force.

562
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,479
Looks like I have to...

563
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,119
apologise more often.

564
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Zhou Shi.

565
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,719
Aren't you on a diet?

566
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
I've thought it through.

567
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,719
Being on a diet
isn't respecting the food.

568
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:59,959
Dieting? She's just stubborn.

569
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,400
You don't have enough money, right?

570
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,839
You're not even willing to eat now?

571
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:03,959
No.

572
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll be getting my salary soon, okay?

573
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:07,839
These few days are difficult for me.

574
00:33:07,959 --> 00:33:09,280
Then, don't push yourself.

575
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,680
You're overeating suddenly.

576
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,199
You'll gain weight easily.

577
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,560
And you, Xiao Fei.

578
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,040
Nobody is stealing food from you.
Eat slowly.

579
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,160
It's fine, we're going to...

580
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,440
gain weight in autumn, right?

581
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,879
The weather is getting colder.
Eat more so you can get through winter.

582
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,040
That's right.

583
00:33:26,719 --> 00:33:28,359
The temperature is dropping
since a few days ago.

584
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,599
I feel the cold sitting here.

585
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,520
Xiao Fei, isn't it cold to
sleep in the living room?

586
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,239
By the way, do you want
to sleep in my room?

587
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,079
There is a heater in my room.
You can use it.

588
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,719
She's trying too hard.

589
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,160
I'm telling the truth.

590
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,680
Xiao Fei had a problem with his rent,

591
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,839
but we let him sleep in the living room.

592
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:51,599
This is too much, right?

593
00:33:51,719 --> 00:33:52,479
Yes.

594
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,239
Why don't he sleep in my room?

595
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,479
No. Your room was
originally a storeroom.

596
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,599
It's small and narrow.

597
00:33:57,719 --> 00:33:59,359
My room is the biggest and brightest.

598
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,560
You can sleep there well.

599
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,879
Okay, I've decided.

600
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:04,199
You can move in tonight. You don't
have to bring anything along.

601
00:34:04,199 --> 00:34:07,079
Just bring your blanket. I'll...

602
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,679
Take your time and eat.

603
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,479
Take your time and eat.

604
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,840
Xiao Fei, you have a room
on your own now, are you happy?

605
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,199
There's something strange.

606
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,760
There's nothing strange.

607
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:29,439
Sister Fei Fei dotes on you.

608
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,679
You should thank her.

609
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,679
No.

610
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:33,080
Young man.

611
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,960
[Xiao Hei]

612
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Again?

613
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,479
What is this?

614
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,080
Making a story up from the picture?

615
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,999
Sleep in my room.

616
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,520
Go.

617
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:02,399
Go.

618
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:10,919
Sleep well.

619
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,360
He's good,

620
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,999
but a little silly.

621
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,639
Why is he that wealthy?

622
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:27,399
But, it's okay if he's a little silly.

623
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,600
I have to win his heart soon.

624
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,280
Today, it's Old Yan's public lecture.

625
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,999
If I'm late, my marks will be deducted.

626
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,999
I can't be late...

627
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:53,479
I'm doomed...

628
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:56,600
You're late.

629
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,959
Why are you here?

630
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,360
I'm here to send you to college.

631
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,280
I'll take a shortcut. Come on.

632
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:04,040
Are you sure?

633
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,120
Get on.

634
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:08,999
Sit well.

635
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,679
Snail! Come after me!

636
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,800
I can cycle better than you.

637
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,600
Didn't you say you'll take a shortcut?

638
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,919
Yes, the GPS said it's this way.

639
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,199
It'll only take five minutes.

640
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,959
That is if you drive, okay?

641
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,479
You're cycling so slowly.
When will we reach?

642
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:33,800
Really?

643
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,679
You're not the one
who's going to be late.

644
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,120
Don't you normally drive luxury cars?

645
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:41,639
Why did you cycle today?

646
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:44,719
I'm matching your lifestyle so...

647
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:47,639
-you won't say I'm flaunting my wealth.
-You...

648
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,719
Enough, I'll cycle.

649
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,600
Can you do it?
Your legs are skinny.

650
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,840
Stop talking nonsense.
Get down.

651
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,159
Okay.

652
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:00,719
Sit well.

653
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,280
I won't be responsible if you fall down.

654
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,479
Okay.

655
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,199
Cycle slowly.

656
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,880
If I'm not fetching you,
I can cycle faster.

657
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,999
Go slower, I'm dizzy.

658
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,600
I can't be late.

659
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,399
He sent a blank text message.

660
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,600
What does that mean?

661
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,399
Is he hanging my appetite?

662
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,600
Or did he run out...

663
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,080
of ideas,

664
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,840
so he sent me a blank message instead?

665
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,840
Forget it. it's useless to think.

666
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,080
I should take action.

667
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,560
Next, let's see how will he react.

668
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:17,080
When did you get here?

669
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,080
Since you entered.

670
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,679
Don't worry. I didn't hear...

671
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,159
what you mumbled.

672
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,679
Are you waiting for someone?

673
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,280
Yes, I was waiting for you.

674
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
Bi Qiu Jing.

675
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,239
Why are you looking for me?

676
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,919
It's not convenient to say it here.

677
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,840
Can you go to the Go Club with me?

678
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,040
Did you ask me to come...

679
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,880
to see you set up the pieces?

680
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:01,320
I'm sorry, wait a minute.

681
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:05,760
Do you think this looks familiar?

682
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,040
Previously, you touched
my Go game, right?

683
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:16,399
You were the one playing that?

684
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,959
I was bored,

685
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:19,479
so I made a few simple moves.

686
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,639
But, this is a simple
human versus computer game.

687
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,399
You don't have to
spend much time to win.

688
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,239
How long did you spend?

689
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
Five or eight minutes?

690
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,719
I forgot about it.

691
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:33,159
Do you know...

692
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,760
this is a famous endgame
on our college's forum.

693
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,679
For now, the shortest time
taken to crack it...

694
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,120
is two hours.

695
00:39:39,399 --> 00:39:40,320
I didn't know about that.

696
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:42,959
Who taught you to play Go?

697
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,159
Have you taken any test?

698
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,760
No.

699
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,600
So have you joined chess competitions...

700
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,840
or played against a professional?

701
00:39:48,999 --> 00:39:50,439
Why do I have to play against others?

702
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,800
Can't I play against myself?

703
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,239
If there's nothing else,

704
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,439
I'm leaving now.

705
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,320
Wait a minute.

706
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,120
Do you want to join the Go Club?

707
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,080
You're good at this.

708
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,639
No, you're talented at this.

709
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,520
If you can join the Go Club,

710
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,560
you may win the inter-school
Go competition...

711
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,679
for Guanghua.

712
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,880
I'm not interested.

713
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:18,120
I played Go just for fun.

714
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,159
For fun?

715
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,719
All competitive activities...

716
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,639
entertain me.

717
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,639
About getting ranked,

718
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,239
I'll leave that to others.

719
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,800
Why?

720
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:30,479
You're capable.

721
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,520
Do I have to do it if I'm capable?

722
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:34,439
Your club is that boring?

723
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,560
Then,

724
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,600
do you want to play against me?

725
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,399
Only winners can say...

726
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,120
they don't care about ranking.

727
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:44,880
Are you that confident?

728
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:47,479
Do you care about winning
and losing that much?

729
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:51,399
If I say that, it would seem that
I'm not open.

730
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,320
I do care.

731
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:56,280
Okay, no matter what the result is,

732
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,679
don't tell Zhou Shi about it.

733
00:40:57,999 --> 00:40:58,840
Okay.

734
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm doomed.

735
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,360
Old Yan's public lecture
started one hour ago.

736
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm terribly late.

737
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,399
What are you doing?

738
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:15,280
I'll be recorded as absent to the class.

739
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,199
Why is the time slower on your watch?

740
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,639
You phone's time is faster by one hour.

741
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,719
Since your phone is broken,
don't use it anymore.

742
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,159
I'll ask someone to
send you a new one later.

743
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,199
Give it back to me.

744
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,159
If you take it from me,
how will I tell the time?

745
00:41:41,479 --> 00:41:43,919
I'll lend this to you.
Use this first.

746
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:46,199
Return it to me
when you see me next time.

747
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,800
Next time?

748
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,719
Why are you standing here?

749
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,120
Go.

750
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,719
No.

751
00:41:58,399 --> 00:42:00,560
Why did he give me something suddenly?

752
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,919
You...

753
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,080
