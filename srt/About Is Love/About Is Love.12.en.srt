[Episode 12]

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,119
For normal people,

30
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,719
art might be very abstract to them.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,279
But the feeling of liking it is real.

32
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:17,359
So, to put a price to this "liking"...

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,160
and increase the business value
of the artworks...

34
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,279
are the purposes of our existence.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
The feeling of "liking"...

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,079
is very expensive.

37
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,320
A child can't understand...

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,279
this theory of the adults yet.

39
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:40,240
You'll understand that
when you meet him.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
Compared to a high price,

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,719
he would rather sell his artworks...

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,680
to someone who really likes him.

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,120
Xun Ran is a child?

44
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:53,559
You don't know?

45
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,279
How old are you?

46
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,760
Twenty.

47
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,919
Then, he is younger than you.

48
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,760
Xiao Fei didn't tell you about it?

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,960
Xiao Fei?

50
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:09,320
He knows Xun Ran too?

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,839
It's alright.

52
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,919
You'll know when you saw him
after you start working here.

53
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,800
Start working here?
Are you going to hire me?

54
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:18,880
Of course.

55
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,320
But I haven't done anything yet.

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,999
Don't I have to go through
a test or something?

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,559
Can I really work in
such a high-class place?

58
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,600
Of course you can.

59
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,279
Because you are recommended by Xiao Fei.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,999
In reality, you are already better
than 99% of the people out there.

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,240
That child's approval...

62
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,160
holds more authority over
any of the exams here.

63
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,719
I never thought that
he is so well connected.

64
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,680
Get ready and come to work tomorrow.

65
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,400
Tomorrow? So fast.

66
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,040
Why is it? You have things
to do tomorrow?

67
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:00,800
No. I'll come to work on time tomorrow.

68
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,960
-Alright then. See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

69
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,000
30th of October.

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,359
Brother Ming Cheng's birthday.

71
00:04:57,183 --> 00:05:00,442
[So painful! Why are you so vengeful?]
[My roots are going to fall off!]

72
00:05:02,293 --> 00:05:04,358
[I'm just stopping you
from making a mistake.]

73
00:05:08,337 --> 00:05:10,337
[No need to thank me.]

74
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,319
Where are you going?

75
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm doomed.

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,879
He is such a loyal cat.

77
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,840
How could I forget about this?

78
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,280
It's less than one week from
6th of November.

79
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,039
I haven't even prepared anything yet.

80
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,240
-What do you need to prepare?
-Present. Birthday present.

81
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,840
-Whose present?
-Who else?

82
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,240
Li Ming Cheng again?

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,919
It's the most important day of the year.

84
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,680
It's has been a tradition
for many years.

85
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,960
-How can I forget it this year?
-What tradition?

86
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,919
Brother Ming Cheng.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Brother Ming Cheng.

88
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,560
Your birthday is almost here.

89
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,000
What present do you want?

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,680
Full marks for Mathematics and English.
As for Language,

91
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,319
95 marks.

92
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,440
This is what you always got.
It's so simple.

93
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,240
I'm talking about you.

94
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:32,440
Brother, can you set
an easier wish for me?

95
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,159
Full marks for Mathematics then.

96
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,879
If you can realise that,

97
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,599
I'll fulfil any of your requests...

98
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,079
on your next month's birthday.

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,120
Really?

100
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,280
I promise.

101
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,599
But you failed, right?

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,240
That was the one time I had
full marks for a subject.

103
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,479
The test paper even fell into the water.

104
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,319
From then on, we made a promise...

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,520
to send each other birthday present
every year.

106
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
If I manage to guess what he likes,

107
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,599
he will send me something
I like during my birthday.

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,919
I was thinking that...

109
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:06,359
maybe he might realise it one day...

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,759
and give himself to me
as present during my birthday.

111
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,840
You think too much.

112
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,359
But the thing is,

113
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,359
I need to guess what he likes.

114
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,159
But I hadn't guessed it right
for many years already.

115
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,240
Is it that hard to guess?

116
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,039
The problem is,
his presents are too strange.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,840
Do you know what he gave me last year?

118
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,039
CET-4 vocabulary.

119
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,039
And he asked me to pass
the exam this year.

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,960
If I don't get it right again,

121
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
he might give me some
tuition audio cards...

122
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,960
and force me to listen to all of them.

123
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,599
It's so scary when I think of that.

124
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,159
Can't you just ask him?

125
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,400
I can't.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,400
It'll be pointless then.

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,800
That's not true.
You can ask his friends.

128
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm just a mediocre student.

129
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,159
Do you think I'll know any study-tyrant?

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,079
And I can't get into their club.

131
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,400
Moreover, they are trying to flatter
senior Zhang Ran Yu lately.

132
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,759
They treat me like air
every time I go there.

133
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,919
Looks like I have to help you myself.

134
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,560
Tell me, which guy
do you want to target?

135
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,039
Have you passed your CET-6?

136
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,240
Have you gotten a prize
from competition?

137
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,759
Looks is not the
only thing they look at.

138
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,479
Do I have to get my IQ
tested to join a club?

139
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:23,400
Those from his club...

140
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
don't have that high of an IQ anyway.

141
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,520
I'll ask for you.

142
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,240
Not only about the presents,

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,479
I can even find out the
number of dresses that he...

144
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,719
has lifted when he was young.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,359
He never played with his phone
before this. What is it with him lately?

146
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,440
I think he has hit it off
with a net friend.

147
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,159
They only play chess together.

148
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
I think that friend is
just a chess friend.

149
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,440
There are still people nowadays who
added someone just to play chess?

150
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,599
He has a very ancient ways of thinking.

151
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,399
The simpler the relationship,
the deeper he'll sink into it.

152
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,279
Look at him.
He even got dark circles now.

153
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,919
Can you imagine?

154
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
He lived like a veteran before this.

155
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
He'll sleep at nine every day
no matter what.

156
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,000
Do you know who that friend is?

157
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,839
I'm not really sure.

158
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,519
But he mentioned it before.

159
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,080
I think it's a girl.

160
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:24,471
[Confirm your surrender?]
[Yes.]

161
00:09:27,663 --> 00:09:29,513
[Do you want to play another round?]

162
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,560
[No. I'm busy today.]

163
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,262
[No wonder you seem hasty today.]

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,865
[Is it something very important?]

165
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:54,641
[Yes. I'm on my way
to destroy a dumb club.]

166
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,440
-Isn't that her? She is here.
-It's you.

167
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,760
I'm here to register.

168
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,760
I received a notice about admission.
It's still effective, right?

169
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,039
Yes, it is.

170
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,359
I never thought that
you'll be coming to our club.

171
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Can I go in now?

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,240
Of course.

173
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,640
We have a new member? Welcome.

174
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,000
-Let me introduce you to her. She...
-No need.

175
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
She is the face of Kwang Hua University.

176
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,359
Who doesn't know her?

177
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,320
You...

178
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,240
You are the one who called me barred...

179
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,760
Barred spiral galaxy.

180
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:39,039
-Senior.
-Don't be mad.

181
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,919
-Don't be mad.
-Don't think too much, Ran Yu.

182
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,440
It's just a code name.

183
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,080
How could you recruit her?

184
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,719
She got full marks for
the club admission test.

185
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,959
So what?

186
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,039
You can't be sure that she didn't cheat.

187
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:55,479
Calcium oxide, antimony,
copper sulfate pentahydrate.

188
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,640
What?

189
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,440
-What is she saying?
-It's nothing.

190
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
-That's right.
-You heard her wrong.

191
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,959
Bi Qiu Jing,

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,399
I have a newcomer information file
for you. Please come with me.

193
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,039
-It has now started.
-Let's see.

194
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,200
Our president is going to
teach her a lesson now.

195
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,240
Really? That's the least he could do.

196
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,719
Let me state this first. I'm not mad.

197
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm just worried that he'll be tricked.

198
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,159
-That's right.
-We understand.

199
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,880
-Senior, let's continue.
-Come.

200
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:30,680
Have a seat.

201
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,919
Your club is really shabby.

202
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,039
You don't even have a private office.

203
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,200
If I remember correctly,

204
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:47,839
you are a third-year student from
Kwang Hua's Chemistry Faculty, right?

205
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,159
Zhou Shi told you that?

206
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:53,039
Don't underestimate your popularity
in this campus.

207
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,479
The professor in the Chemistry Faculty
complains that if you are in the class,

208
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,719
it'll basically become
a mistake-correcting class.

209
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,440
In the end, you even taught
the class in his stead.

210
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,200
You are really one of a kind.

211
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,039
Is that so? Which professor it is?

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,880
The molecular formula of calcium oxide,

213
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,159
element code of antimony...

214
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,640
and the molecular weight of
copper sulfate pentahydrate.

215
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:14,800
You haven't forgotten
about these, right?

216
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,279
So, this is the translation of
what you said just now.

217
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,519
Bi Qiu Jing.

218
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,159
You shouldn't use
your knowledge like this.

219
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,800
After all, we are all in the same club.

220
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,399
Isn't it good to get along
with each other?

221
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:37,880
I didn't come here
to be friends with them.

222
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,680
I came here for you.

223
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,399
Me?

224
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Do you have a girl you like now?

225
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,399
No changes in your pupils.

226
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,800
Your heart is not beating fast.

227
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,719
Looks like the answer is no.

228
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,719
Okay. Your birthday is on the 6th.

229
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,240
What present do you want?

230
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,440
Bi Qiu Jing.

231
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,399
With our relationship right now,

232
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,120
don't you think this is
too early for that?

233
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,640
Relationship?

234
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,839
What kind of relationship you want?

235
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,560
At least a relationship where...

236
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,279
we can celebrate birthday together.

237
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,959
If you treat me to a meal, I'll go.

238
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,120
So, can you answer my question now?

239
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,560
A full set of deep space
photography equipment.

240
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,080
You want to capture the nebula map
in the suburbs, right?

241
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:44,880
It's going to be new moon soon.

242
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,719
It's a good timing for that.

243
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
Did you study about this too?

244
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,159
You need an equatorial mount
and a laptop too.

245
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes. I need optical axis calibration
equipment and guide mirror too.

246
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,159
Rejected. These are too expensive.

247
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,320
Can't you think about something simpler?

248
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,080
A reduced version of the
solar system star model.

249
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,519
It's still expensive.

250
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
And you can't find it here.
You have to purchase it overseas.

251
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,800
Change to another one.

252
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:14,919
Collection of NASA astrophotography.

253
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,279
I have to look for the source and
download it. So time-consuming.

254
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,080
Can't you think about something that
a normal person can get their hands on?

255
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,599
It'll be best if it's something DIY
that doesn't need money.

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,479
Is this Chinese
calligraphy writing yours?

257
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,800
Not bad.

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
-Yes. Sometimes, I'll write it.
-Good.

259
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,440
A Chinese calligraphy writing then.

260
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,000
Chinese calligraphy writing?

261
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,240
From now on,

262
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,640
it'll be your ideal birthday present.

263
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,800
If Zhou Shi asks you about it,
tell her that.

264
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,399
Understand? Say it exactly like that.

265
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,919
-Why?
-For no particular reason.

266
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,800
As for the expensive and troublesome
things that you want,

267
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,080
-I'll find a way to get them for you.
-Really?

268
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,359
I'll do my best.

269
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,479
But I'll be the one to decide
when and how to get them.

270
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,880
You can't have any objections.

271
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,359
Alright.

272
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,279
Come in.

273
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,680
Not bad. You look good.

274
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:33,599
It suits the environment of our gallery.

275
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,279
Thank you for giving me this chance.

276
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,359
Although I'm not really sure
what should I do exactly ,

277
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,080
from now on, I'll work hard.

278
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:43,159
No need for that.

279
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,560
As you can see.
Our business here is not doing well.

280
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,279
We only have customers once in a while.

281
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
And they are frequent visitors.

282
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,560
They know about paintings very well.

283
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,760
Even without your guidance
and recommendation,

284
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,200
they'll still buy it.

285
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,240
But I can't just do nothing.

286
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,519
You...

287
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,159
just need to stand
at the entrance and smile.

288
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:10,440
Another thing.
Don't wear heels tomorrow.

289
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,880
You have to stand the whole day.

290
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,599
Your legs will break.

291
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,440
-Thank you.
-Come in.

292
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,240
Director He.

293
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,560
He is here.

294
00:16:24,599 --> 00:16:25,640
Said that I'm not here.

295
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,279
I already told him. But Chair...

296
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,959
But he doesn't believe me.

297
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,919
So annoying.

298
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:36,919
Xiao Zhou.

299
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:38,880
Help me tell him this.

300
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,640
If he insisted on waiting,

301
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,039
tell him that...

302
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm feeling ill and not fit enough
to meet a client.

303
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,120
Alright.

304
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,640
That person...

305
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,880
sounds so cold.

306
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,680
Is he the one Director He hates?

307
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,519
-You?
-You?

308
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,919
Did you put a tapping device on my body?

309
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,720
You are here again on
my first day of work.

310
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:16,680
Why can't I get rid of you?

311
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,600
-Let go of me.
-This is really by chance.

312
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,639
I'm here to meet Director He.

313
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,759
So, that man is you?

314
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,600
-What?
-Nothing.

315
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,039
She feels ill today.

316
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,039
So, she can't meet you.

317
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,960
Her body is ill again.

318
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,720
Tell her this.

319
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,720
The chairman is here for official
business. Ask her to bear with it.

320
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:44,720
Chairman?

321
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
What? She didn't tell you this?

322
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,159
This gallery is under Yun Ma Artwork.

323
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,759
So, in the end,

324
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm still working under you?

325
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,039
Why is it?

326
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,800
You want to quit?

327
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,840
Why would I quit?

328
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:01,239
I'm hired by Director He.

329
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,200
Even if you are the chairman,
you can't just fire me.

330
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,600
Don't worry. I'm here this time...

331
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,720
to have a talk with Director He.

332
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,239
I don't care about other things.

333
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,680
No matter what, I have to see her today.

334
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,879
-Go now.
-Alright then.

335
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,680
Please wait. I'll tell her that now.

336
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:20,639
Quickly.

337
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,720
You and she are quite fated
to meet each other.

338
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,960
Yes. Every time she
tries to hide from me,

339
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,119
she'll always end up being by my side.

340
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,320
Director He asked you
to go to her office.

341
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,440
She said not to affect
the gallery's business.

342
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:53,200
Affect the gallery's business?

343
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:59,519
I don't think it needs my help.

344
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,279
Lead the way.

345
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,119
Oh my goodness. This is so suffocating.

346
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,879
Why are they so serious with each other?

347
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,720
Their relationship
has always been like that.

348
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,600
Seriously?

349
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,680
But from what I heard from Xiao Fei,

350
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,440
they are mother and son.

351
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,840
Is she his stepmother?

352
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:09,999
Biological mother.

353
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
Why are they so estranged then?

354
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,800
They call each other
chairman and Director He.

355
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,239
Those who don't know will
think that they are rivals.

356
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,720
Director He hasn't used his name...

357
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
for a very long time already.

358
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,239
Is it because...

359
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,399
Wei Qing is not filial?

360
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,279
If only it's that simple.

361
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,320
Their relationship is hard to explain
in a few words.

362
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,480
If there's a chance,

363
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,759
it's better if he tells you himself.

364
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,360
Forget it. It's so awkward
to even think of it.

365
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:48,360
Chairman, why are you here?

366
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,159
The girl who brought in
the coffees just now...

367
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,039
is hired by you, Director He?

368
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,519
Yes.

369
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,879
She is just an art student who
has yet to graduate, right?

370
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,879
With her experiences, she can't handle
the clients in the gallery, right?

371
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
She can learn if she is inexperienced.

372
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,360
Chairman, you are already quite busy.

373
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,600
No need to care about measly things...

374
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,399
like personnel recruitment.

375
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,919
Personnel recruitment is a measly thing.

376
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,560
What about deficit then?

377
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:35,119
The shareholder meeting
will be held next month.

378
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,720
With this kind of situation,

379
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,560
Are you planning to be held accountable
at the shareholder meeting?

380
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,560
If this deficit continues, during the
shareholder meeting next year,

381
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,840
they'll decrease the budget
for the gallery.

382
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,960
And they'll lay off
a large number of workers.

383
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
If it really comes to that,

384
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,999
sooner or later, you'll be stripped
from your position.

385
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,960
Chairman.

386
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:01,879
Are you here today
to warn me specifically...

387
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,480
or are you here to fire me?

388
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,919
I will never allow that from happening.

389
00:22:07,999 --> 00:22:10,960
Is that so? Then what is your plan?

390
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,560
Recruit more famous painters
to increase the gallery's turnover.

391
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,639
I disagree.

392
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,879
Ever since Yun Ma Artwork
was established,

393
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,999
we've never put profit first.

394
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,399
Instead, we focus on
cultivating new artists.

395
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,720
If you just care about
recruiting famous painters,

396
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:32,159
then what advantages
we'll have against other galleries?

397
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,680
All these years, I knew that you've
been putting a lot of effort...

398
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,320
in cultivating new painters
and new artists.

399
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:39,360
And what did you get?

400
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,840
How many Xun Ran will there be?

401
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,519
Moreover, Xun Ran's success
is just because of luck.

402
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,080
Think about all the marketing fees
that you had spent on him.

403
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,639
And because you are...

404
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,360
too partial to Xun Ran's artworks,

405
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,320
it leads to the losses of
many painters' resources.

406
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,639
Everything that Xun Ran has today...

407
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:04,320
is what he deserves.

408
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,960
His works are highly recognised
in the market.

409
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,440
I have no need to be partial.

410
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,560
What about this gallery?

411
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:15,039
This is such a huge place.

412
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
It must have costed a lot of money.

413
00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:20,879
Are all of our other galleries going to
bear the costs for this?

414
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,919
And then, some experts
who you've hired...

415
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,039
will put them in the account under
the name of various projects, right?

416
00:23:28,399 --> 00:23:29,919
What will you get from that?

417
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:33,039
You'll only drag the performance
of the galleries down.

418
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:36,080
You'll drag down the
entire gallery business.

419
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,639
You've said so much.

420
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,239
But it's still because of him, right?

421
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,879
You want to force Xun Ran to leave.

422
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,159
On the contrary,

423
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,119
since you already spent
so much money on him,

424
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,840
I'm planning to commercialise him...

425
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,960
and maximize his business value.

426
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,279
Only by doing so can I increase
the turnover of Yun Ma Artwork.

427
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,080
And the galleries' economy
won't be dragged down.

428
00:23:58,239 --> 00:23:58,919
You can't do that.

429
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,039
Xun Ran, his father and my husband...

430
00:24:03,239 --> 00:24:04,639
are real artists.

431
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,960
They should just focus
on their creations.

432
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,519
And you are just wallowing
in degeneration.

433
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,039
I don't care if money is
the only thing in your mind.

434
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,960
But I'll never allow you
to corrupt him with your...

435
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:17,200
-money-oriented mind.
-Artist?

436
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,239
You know it too.

437
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,440
His father, that artist,
passed away because of starvation.

438
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,239
And he ended up in the orphanage.

439
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,080
If it wasn't because
you and father took him in,

440
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,440
-he might be begging on the street now!
-Shut your mouth.

441
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,159
Don't forget this.

442
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,200
Yun Ma is so successful right now
because I'm money-oriented.

443
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
That's why you can play with
your art here without worries.

444
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,159
Leave. Leave now!

445
00:24:41,674 --> 00:24:44,200
Leave. Leave now!

446
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,919
Zhou Shi!

447
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,279
Zhou Shi.

448
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,159
Director He.

449
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,919
Send the chairman out.

450
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:56,320
From now on, don't allow him
to step into the gallery at all.

451
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,080
Understood.

452
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,279
Wei...

453
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,399
Chairman.

454
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:04,840
Alright.

455
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:06,919
I understand now.

456
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,159
You would rather be against
the entire board...

457
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
to protect your own selfishness.

458
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,200
I'll deal with this accordingly.

459
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,239
See you in the board meeting.

460
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:21,919
One more thing.

461
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:25,560
I won't come to this place ever again.

462
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,480
No. Should I say,

463
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,639
it won't exist anymore.

464
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,119
What are you going to do?

465
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,279
You know best about
what I can do, right?

466
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,239
Wei Qing, let me warn you.

467
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,039
You only have 30% of the gallery shares.

468
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,999
Don't think that you can
act as you please.

469
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,480
It has been so many years.

470
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:52,480
This is the first time
you called my name.

471
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:57,119
I never thought that
it'll be under this situation.

472
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,519
I know.

473
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:01,480
You've been wanting to get rid
of this burden, the gallery.

474
00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:04,039
But it is my husband's legacy.

475
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,840
I won't allow you to destroy it!

476
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,480
Don't forget.

477
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,279
Your husband is my father too.

478
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,560
The things that you told me...

479
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,080
are the things that
I want to tell you too.

480
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,480
I hope that you won't
destroy the gallery.

481
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,200
Don't care about him.

482
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,800
Let him be.

483
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,720
Zhou Shi.

484
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,560
Are you pitying him?

485
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:03,879
He treated you like that.

486
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:05,879
Don't be so kind-hearted.

487
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,680
Those are just crocodile tears.
Don't be fooled by him.

488
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
Cancel the board meeting this afternoon.

489
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,239
-We'll discuss about the time again.
-Alright.

490
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,039
By the way. About Xue Zi,

491
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,879
when is she coming back again?

492
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,680
She came back yesterday. And...

493
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,759
-And?
-She came to this gallery...

494
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:47,360
and purchase one of Xun Ran's
painting with a high price.

495
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,759
Go back first. I want to be alone.

496
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,680
Do you want me to leave the car here?

497
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,840
-You have to meet Miss Xue later.
-No need.

498
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,759
I'll call you if I need a car.

499
00:28:11,999 --> 00:28:13,200
This is not right!

500
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,320
I told you so many times already!
Why can't you change?

501
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,680
No matter what I draw,
you'll think that it's wrong.

502
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,919
You are bias against me.

503
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,119
I can never draw as good as
the child you picked up.

504
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,119
What nonsense is that?

505
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:29,279
Since you like the one you
picked up so much,

506
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:30,759
why did you give birth to me back then?

507
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,999
You have never trust me.

508
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,720
You only care about that bastard!

509
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:44,800
How old are you?
How could you drink every day?

510
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,600
-When are you going to practice drawing?
-None of your business.

511
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,360
You have no rights to discipline me.

512
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,919
You are too immature!

513
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,639
It's your fault that
your father is dead!

514
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,480
-Stand up!
-Yun Ma Artwork that was...

515
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,239
established by me and my wife...

516
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,680
will be took over by my son,
Wei Qing, after my passing.

517
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,119
He'll have full authority.

518
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,759
Impossible.

519
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,720
Yun Ma belongs to us.

520
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:10,279
How could you give it to him?

521
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,680
-Lawyer, have you gotten it wrongly?
-Mother!

522
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,159
♪ Do you know the meteor doesn't rain? ♪

523
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:36,519
♪ Heartache is just a crater
where meteorites fall ♪

524
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
♪ Do you know... ♪

525
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,320
♪ the meteor doesn't rain? ♪

526
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
What are you thinking?

527
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,840
Pull yourself together.

528
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,879
Heartache or lack of man or not,
I can't just fall in love with a brat.

529
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,320
Don't think about it.

530
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,800
So painful.

531
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,080
Are you alright?

532
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,639
Of course I'm not fine.

533
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,879
Didn't you see me?

534
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,800
So painful.

535
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:18,759
It's red.

536
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,480
Why is your face red too?

537
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,680
It's hot.

538
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:38,080
Are you having a fever?

539
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,239
Yes. Maybe I got infected by you.

540
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,159
I have medicine.
I'll give it to you later.

541
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,960
No need.

542
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:53,680
What is happening here?

543
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,360
No matter what,
I'm an expert in the arena of love.

544
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,039
I can't just get shy from
a touch on forehead by a brat.

545
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,800
No. It must be out of
a relationship for too long.

546
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:03,159
So, I've lost my touch.

547
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
I need to quickly find my next target.

548
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,759
Tina.

549
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,200
Tina.

550
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,399
Long time no see.

551
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,399
What? Studio photo shooting?

552
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,119
Of course I'm free.

553
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,960
Okay. I'll see you in two hours' time.

554
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,480
Alright. Bye.

555
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:33,080
Studio, lighting,

556
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,159
fresh flowers, applause.

557
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,239
I've recovered again.

558
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:41,639
Young and handsome? Get lose, Ning Fei.

559
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm going to look for real man.

560
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:53,680
Really. You just ask him like that?

561
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:56,159
Yes. No need to beat around the bush.

562
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,440
What did he say?

563
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,720
He said,

564
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,600
he wants a Chinese calligraphy writing.

565
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,399
Chinese calligraphy writing?

566
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,680
Brother Ming Cheng is
an astronomy enthusiast.

567
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,720
When did he start to care about art?

568
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,840
Starting this morning.

569
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,360
Anyway, don't care so much about it.

570
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,440
This is what you are good at, right?
Anyway, you just need to know that...

571
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,560
he likes Chinese calligraphy
so much now.

572
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,639
Alright. Thank you.

573
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,560
A study-tyrant and goddess of study
can indeed communicate better.

574
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,440
Alright. That's it.
We'll talk more at home.

575
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:28,800
Alright. Thank you again. Love you.

576
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,039
Chinese calligraphy?
What should I write?

577
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,480
Why is he here?

578
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:52,999
Dad!

579
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,440
Someone wants to buy my painting!

580
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,560
-Speak Chinese.
-Someone wants to buy my painting.

581
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,080
Burn it.

582
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,960
Why?

583
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,519
They said that my painting
can be passed for genuine one.

584
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,800
The gallery owner is willing
to pay me 1000 dollar.

585
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:16,800
A fake will always be a fake.

586
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,720
It can never be a genuine one.

587
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:20,919
Let me ask you.

588
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,879
How long did it take for you
to draw this?

589
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
-Two days.
-Two days?

590
00:33:27,879 --> 00:33:30,840
Do you know long it takes for a painter
to produce an original work?

591
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,519
Two years.

592
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:37,560
That's why others' painting can become
outstanding work to be passed on.

593
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,680
And your painting will always be trash.

594
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,159
Look at your drawing.

595
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,360
Every stroke in your drawing
shows only one thing. Money.

596
00:33:46,239 --> 00:33:47,600
I already told you.

597
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,879
I don't want my son's painting...

598
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,720
to be hung up in others' houses as...

599
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,519
decoration in the future.

600
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,080
Do you understand?

601
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:00,119
You can't do that.

602
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,200
Xun Ran, his father and my husband...

603
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,759
are real artists.

604
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,080
They should just focus
on their creations.

605
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,679
And you are just
wallowing in degeneration.

606
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't care if money is
the only thing in your mind.

607
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:16,120
But I'll never allow you
to corrupt him with your...

608
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,239
money-oriented mind.

609
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:29,999
What are you looking at?

610
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,120
Don't tell me that this lawn
belongs to you too.

611
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,679
I thought you don't want to see me.

612
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,759
I don't want to see you.

613
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,279
But you are like a fly...

614
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,560
that follows me around.
I can't get rid of you.

615
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,880
If you are followed around by flies,

616
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:50,800
then you must be not a good thing.

617
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,199
You! I know I shouldn't have
talked to you.

618
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,600
I'm in a bad mood.

619
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,959
Can you keep my company?

620
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,880
Sometimes, I'll be in a bad mood too.

621
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,800
And I will keep quiet.

622
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:15,199
But after that, I realised that
this solution is ineffective.

623
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:18,800
Because when I'm alone,
my mind will run even wilder...

624
00:35:18,959 --> 00:35:20,600
and I'll get even upset instead.

625
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,279
Then what should I do?

626
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,640
Distract yourself.

627
00:35:24,999 --> 00:35:26,759
Shop and eat.

628
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,120
It's best if you can shop
and eat with your friends.

629
00:35:29,439 --> 00:35:30,759
By doing so,

630
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,239
you'll only be worried
when you see the bills...

631
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:35,560
and you won't have the mood
to be upset anymore.

632
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,640
But I have nothing to buy.

633
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,679
Do you have anything you want?
How about I buy it for you?

634
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,600
Are you trying to trick me again?

635
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,999
I'm being sincere.

636
00:35:47,999 --> 00:35:50,519
Spending money is not
something fun for me.

637
00:35:50,959 --> 00:35:53,519
I'm thinking that if you
have something you like,

638
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,800
I'll buy it for you.

639
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:56,560
When you are happy,

640
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,239
maybe I can be happier too.

641
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,999
It's so annoying that you are rich.

642
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,080
You can shop for your friends.

643
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:08,320
You have a lot of
disreputable friends, right?

644
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,840
You already said that
they are disreputable friends.

645
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:12,479
What's the point?

646
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,920
Don't you have a true friend?

647
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,840
I had it when I was young. Now, I don't.

648
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,080
I never thought that
you are so eccentric.

649
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,959
Why don't you get into a relationship?

650
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Because I can't bear
the touch of others.

651
00:36:25,959 --> 00:36:27,600
Although you are great,

652
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,759
you can't be so aloof.

653
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:33,840
How did the poet say?
It's lonely at the top.

654
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,959
Although you are quite annoying,
you are not a bad man.

655
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,719
You need to get in touch
with more people.

656
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,679
You'll suffocate if you
don't have friends.

657
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,279
It's not that.

658
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,360
-I am...
-You are what?

659
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,279
Nothing.

660
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,039
Since you encourage me
to make more friends,

661
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,279
shouldn't you set an example first...

662
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:56,920
and be my friend?

663
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:01,719
I did wrong before this.

664
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,640
I didn't think about your feelings
and I had hurt you.

665
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,160
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,719
It's alright.

667
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:15,320
Then can we be friends now?

668
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
We can be friends.

669
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:30,080
But you can't go overboard.

670
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,120
And don't give me anything.
I want nothing.

671
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,999
Alright. I promise you.

672
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,640
You promised me so quickly.

673
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:39,479
I still feel like it's unfair to me.

674
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:42,560
Where do you feel that it's unfair?
Tell me.

675
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,439
Tell me and I'll promise
to make it better.

676
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,519
Such confidence.

677
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,719
I'll give you a challenge then.

678
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,920
You can't give me food,

679
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,600
gifts and flowers.

680
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:56,320
Don't give me anything but make me
feel touched at the same time.

681
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,959
If you can do that, I'll forgive you.

682
00:37:58,479 --> 00:38:00,400
How's that? You can't do it, right?

683
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,320
What's so hard about that?
I'll promise you.

684
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,439
It's a deal then.

685
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,279
Brother Sam,
when can I get my makeup on?

686
00:38:40,479 --> 00:38:41,719
You are just a reader model.

687
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,719
I'm not even done yet
with these still models.

688
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:56,679
Fei Fei. I want to tell you something.
Don't get mad first.

689
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,920
It's about Wei Qing.

690
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,679
Wei Qing again?

691
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,039
No. How many times are you
going to get fooled?

692
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:08,239
What pitiful?
You are the most pitiful one here.

693
00:39:08,439 --> 00:39:09,999
Keep quiet in the studio. Don't talk!

694
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,959
I can't talk now.

695
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,719
I'll deal with you when I go back.
Do you hear me?

696
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
Alright. I have to hang up now.

697
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:22,999
Bye.

698
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:34,719
Who gave me this coat just now?

699
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,400
Stop pretending.

700
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:39,759
You can't recognise Editor He's coat?

701
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,560
Editor He?

702
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,880
Pretending to be pitiful is so useful.

703
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,759
She can even fool the editor so well.

704
00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:47,519
She has a lot on the ball.

705
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:49,120
What are you talking about?

706
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,039
You don't make sense.

707
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,080
This is good.
Everybody looks beautiful today.

708
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,719
Sam.

709
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Darling. I'll help you
with the makeup first.

710
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,080
Fei Fei, perform well later.

711
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:21,640
By the way, his coat.

712
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,759
Help me thank him.

713
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,400
My facial features
are not very prominent.

714
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,080
Please pay more attention to that
when you apply the makeup.

715
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:35,439
Don't worry.

716
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,999
I'll make you into the most
beautiful woman tonight.

717
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,439
Thank you.

718
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,320
Although I don't know
what this is about,

719
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:44,560
this privilege from
the editor is so useful.

720
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:00,959
Can you please pull the zip up for me?

721
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,999
Anybody there?

722
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,920
Can someone give me a hand?

723
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,640
Editor He.

724
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:30,999
I saw that nobody is in the dressing
room and then I heard your calls...

725
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,719
You won't blame me
for being rude, right?

726
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,479
I won't. This is my problem.

727
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,920
Wait.

728
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,080
Let me do it.

729
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:00,160
This is now yours.

730
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,239
I don't think it's a good idea.
