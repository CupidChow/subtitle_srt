[Episode 29]

29
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,359
-What happened to your leg?
-I am fine.

30
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,240
Are you hurt?

31
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,439
How did you hurt your leg so badly?

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
It's nothing.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,639
How did you fall down here?

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,719
My senior needed to talk to me.
But in the end...

35
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,800
Wei Qing?

36
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,800
No.

37
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,199
That man wasn't Wei Qing.

38
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:33,960
He covered every inch of his face,

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,279
but he ran away as soon as I fell.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,400
My senior would never do that.

41
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,559
What did he want to talk about?

42
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,680
I don't know.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,760
Could it be He Wei?

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,999
Director He always hate Wei Qing.

45
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you know why?

46
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,439
She told me...

47
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,960
Uncle is dead because of him.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
What? What is going on now?

49
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,680
I don't know much about it either.

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I have always wanted to
apologize to my senior.

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,160
Uncle brought me back,

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,839
but I was afraid.

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,600
I was afraid with my senior there,

54
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,919
they would chase me out
if I make any mistakes.

55
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,359
Xiao Fei, stop talking.
You need rest.

56
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:29,040
In order to stay,

57
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,079
I have done many bad things ...

58
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,320
to make them resent my senior.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,040
The more they like me,

60
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,439
the more my senior became rebellious.

61
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:46,400
But I could never be happy.

62
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,999
Stop talking.

63
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,320
Wei Qing hates me to the bone.

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
He thinks I took his family from him.

65
00:03:56,559 --> 00:03:58,040
I want to apologize.

66
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,960
I want to apologize.

67
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,320
But I am scared that if I tell him,

68
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,359
he would chase me out!

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,800
I want to wait.

70
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,880
Just another while,

71
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,760
then I would return his family to him.

72
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,960
I would give him his parents back.

73
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,720
But I never thought...

74
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:24,079
Uncle would die.

75
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,599
I didn't mean it.

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,919
I didn't mean it.

77
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,639
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

78
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,199
Xiao Fei, open your eyes! Xiao Fei!

79
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,479
Xiao Fei!

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,639

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:04,280

-Zhou Shi!

-Shi Shi?
-Xiao Fei?

94
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,400
-Shi Shi?
-Zhou Shi?

95
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:30,879
Zhou Shi?

96
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,840
Zhou Shi?

97
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,840
-Shi Shi?
-Xiao Fei?

98
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
Zhou Shi?

99
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,400
Zhou Shi?

100
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:42,800
What took you so long?

101
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,240
Who is Bi Qiu Jing looking for?

102
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,000
I heard them calling to Zhou Shi.

103
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,560
Is your job done?

104
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,280
He fell off the slope on his own.

105
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
You didn't answer my question.

106
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,479
They could be looking for Zhou Shi.

107
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,759
What happened to her?

108
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,479
She knew about Ning Fei
and went after him.

109
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
How did she know about that?

110
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,159
You told her?

111
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,280
I only told her Ning Fei and Wei Qing
went up the hill.

112
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,840
Then, she went out for them.

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,720
Why did you drag her into this?

114
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,560
We agree to pull this plan on
Wei Qing alone!

115
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
It was meant for Wei Qing.

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,599
But Zhou Shi was with him all the time.

117
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,680
You didn't know?

118
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,520
Zhou Shi has been sleeping in
Wei Qing's room all along.

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,800
-No way!
-I didn't believe it either.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,919
Which is why I got mad
and told her about Ning Fei.

121
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:24,359
I must go to her now.

122
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,400
What is so great about her anyway?

123
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,280
All these men are obsessed with her.

124
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,440
Zhou Shi?

125
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
-Shi Shi?
-Xiao Fei?

126
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,000
-Shi Shi?
-Bi Qiu Jing?

127
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,560
Zhang Shuai?

128
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,560
I know where Zhou Shi is.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,879
-Zhou Shi!
-Xiao Fei?

130
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,319
-Zhou Shi!
-Xiao Fei?

131
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,120
What?

132
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
Okay, send me the location now.

133
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,000
Is there any news on Zhou Shi?

134
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:05,479
Qiu Jing said they know where she is.
Here is the photo.

135
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,759
Look.

136
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,240
This is the place.
Where did you get it?

137
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,560
Zhang Shuai sent it.

138
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,400
Zhang Shuai?

139
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,440
He set this up again.

140
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,159
-Zhou Shi!
-Xiao Fei!

141
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,639
Zhou Shi!

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,280
Wei Qing, over here!

143
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,639
-Xiao Fei!
-Zhou Shi!

144
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,120
Zhou Shi!

145
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
Xiao Fei is hurt. Help him up.

146
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,079
-Xiao Fei!
-Get up.

147
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,079
-Let me carry him.
-I can do it.

148
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,159
-Are you sure?
-I can handle it.

149
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,199
Too horrible.

150
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,479
Fei Fei's strength
is only second to mine.

151
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,599
Let's go.

152
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,479
Before Xiao Fei passed out,

153
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,560
he kept apologizing to you.

154
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,599
What did he said?

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,639
He shouldn't have taken
your parents from you.

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,359
He even mentioned your father's death.

157
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:26,840
What's wrong?

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,039
I am fine.

159
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,760
I get headache whenever
I heard my father's name.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,120
Let's not think about it.

161
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:36,800
You can ask Xiao Fei once he is awake.

162
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,279
He must know something.

163
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,839
I think your illness...

164
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,039
is related to your father as well.

165
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,000
I am sorry.

166
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,240
Xiao Fei? Are you awake?

167
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,760
Don't go, don't leave me behind.
I'll behave well.

168
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,880
I won't leave you behind.

169
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,680
Hang in there, we will be
at the hospital soon.

170
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,959
Xiao Fei, are you all right?

171
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,519
I am sorry, I was too clumsy.

172
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:11,320
Don't go, don't leave me behind.

173
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,839
Don't go.

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,399
I am not going anywhere,
I am not leaving you behind.

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,159
I will never bully you again
once you get well.

176
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,719
Don't worry, I won't leave you behind.

177
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:22,800
What happened to Ning Fei?

178
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,680
His leg is bleeding so badly.

179
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,159
Don't worry, he will be fine.

180
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,440
Let's get him to a hospital.

181
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,599
♪ It's from someone alien yet close ♪

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,120
♪ I won't let you guide me ♪

183
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:55,839
♪ How did you pierce the
armour I built from sorrow? ♪

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,080
You can just leave me here,
it's only a fever.

185
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,560
It's not serious.

186
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,599
Yes, you may go now.

187
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,039
I can stay here.

188
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,479
Stop pushing yourself.
Go back and get some rest.

189
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,800
And you too, Ming Cheng.
You may go now.

190
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,519
I can stay here with her.

191
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,039
I am fine.

192
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Brother Ming Cheng, when did your
become so intimate with her?

193
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:21,440
Since today.

194
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,399
Right, you want to know
who Bai actually is.

195
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,240
That's him.

196
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,320
What?

197
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
Brother Ming Cheng, so you are
the online friend she talks about?

198
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,440
Yes.

199
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,680
They are more than just
online friends now.

200
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,919
He proposed to her.

201
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,200
What?

202
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,919
Senior, you said yes?

203
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,880
No, hold on!

204
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,760
Who proposed? You proposed to her?

205
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,599
You put on the ring! You said yes?

206
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,479
My goodness! You are getting married!

207
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
Stop blushing, I need
to take a photo of this.

208
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,120
-Stop it.
-No way.

209
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,760
I know your darkest secrets.

210
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,000
Brother Ming Cheng, you need
to take good care of her from now on.

211
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,359
Otherwise, you know what I am capable of.

212
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,599
Don't worry.

213
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,919
In terms of wits and strength,

214
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,959
I can never best her.

215
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,760
I am glad you know that.

216
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,640
Xiao Fei?

217
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,320
Xiao Fei, what happened to you?

218
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,039
How did this happen?

219
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,560
Aunty.

220
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:44,560
It's okay. He took the medicine
and fell asleep.

221
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,599
I am glad he is fine.

222
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,039
What is wrong with you?

223
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
How did he fell off the slope?

224
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,760
Aunty, it's all my fault.

225
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,279
I asked him to take a walk
with me up the hill.

226
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,919
But the path was too slippery
and he fell.

227
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,719
It's all my fault.

228
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,880
Forget it.

229
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,359
How could you be so sloppy?

230
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:12,599
Mother.

231
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
I need to talk to you.

232
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,959
It's about my father.

233
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:28,479
I won't let you leave
unless you tell me.

234
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,120
We will speak about this outside.

235
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,000
What is your question?

236
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,320
How exactly did my father die?

237
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,359
Why would you ask?

238
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,039
Because I may not
remember the details,

239
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,479
but I feel I am
somehow connected.

240
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,200
You don't remember at all?

241
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,959
You are lucky to have
lost the memories.

242
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:26,039
I wish I could just forget it.

243
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,200
But the more I try to forget,

244
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,359
the more it haunts me.

245
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:35,479
As soon as I close my eyes,

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,719
I see your father
right in front of me,

247
00:13:41,479 --> 00:13:43,440
covered in blood.

248
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,000
I see that scene too.

249
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,919
I see it in my dream.

250
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,279
I don't remember what
happened back then,

251
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,440
but every time I fall asleep,

252
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:06,479
I see my father lying
dead on the ground.

253
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,519
It's been ten years,

254
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,000
it still haunts me.

255
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:15,080
So,

256
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:17,959
you suffer just as much as I do.

257
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,640
Do you know...

258
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,479
why I keep my distance from you
for all these years?

259
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:29,800
That is because...

260
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,880
I hate you.

261
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,719
I hate you for taking him from me.

262
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,919
You took him from me
before he even passed away.

263
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:45,719
The truth is, before he died,

264
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
he was suffering from cancer.

265
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:52,680
-Cancer?
-He refused to get treatment.

266
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,760
He told me there were some
matters to deal with in America.

267
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:57,919
But I knew it all along.

268
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,880
it was because of you,

269
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,880
he wouldn't come back to me.

270
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,839
You had always thought your father
was too strict to you,

271
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,640
that he loved Xiao Fei more than you.

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,200
But in the last moment of his life,

273
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,680
he chose you.

274
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,359
Despite my begging,

275
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:29,519
you hold a much
bigger place in his heart.

276
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,000
That's how it happened.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,200
He was gone.

278
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
He never came back.

279
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
I hate myself so much for it.

280
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,680
I should have insisted and
made him stay with me.

281
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,959
Or perhaps I should have gone
to America with him.

282
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,839
However,

283
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:00,399
I hate you even more.

284
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,320
If it wasn't for you,

285
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,120
he wouldn't have died in
a foreign land.

286
00:16:13,479 --> 00:16:15,399
But to my surprise,

287
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,440
he let you inherit the
whole Yun Ma Group.

288
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,479
In the end, he still wouldn't
trust me with the company.

289
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,279
Not only did you take him from me,

290
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,279
but also took the company.

291
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,200
How is it possible for me
not to hate you?

292
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,760
I went against you at every corner,

293
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,800
I want to prove him wrong.

294
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,080
I should be his only choice.

295
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,440
I was the most important person to him.

296
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,240
This is ridiculous.

297
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,639
You are both my family.
He is my husband,

298
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,879
and you are my son.

299
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,919
But ultimately,

300
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,159
I made you my enemies.

301
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,399
In the end, I lost my husband,

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,200
and my son left me.

303
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,039
Mother.

304
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,119
Your hand...

305
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,919
This happened since
your father passed away?

306
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,999
All these years, I thought...

307
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,879
money was all you ever care about,

308
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,440
that you led a voluptuous life.

309
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,800
But sadly,

310
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,879
all along...

311
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:15,840
you suffered just I do.

312
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,680
We both suffered.

313
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,720
If you wish the know the truth
about your father's death,

314
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,480
you need to find it yourself.

315
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,080
I didn't have the courage
to dig up those memories again.

316
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,600
After all I have done
to you over the years...

317
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,320
I hope you understand.

318
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,960
You are awake!

319
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:15,999
I am sorry.

320
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,879
You are awake.

321
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,800
-How long did I sleep?
-Very long.

322
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,440
Do you feel uncomfortable?

323
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,440
My leg hurts.

324
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:30,639
Of course it hurts.
You had dozen of stitches.

325
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,039
The doctor said it's not serious,
you'll be better in a few days.

326
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:35,840
Where is Zhou Shi?

327
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:41,119
You are hurt and you only
care about her.

328
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,039
Thank you.

329
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,879
-Why?
-For carrying me.

330
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
How would you know?

331
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,320
I am sorry.

332
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,639
Xiao Fei? Are you awake?

333
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,879
Don't go.

334
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,159
Don't leave me behind, I'll behave.

335
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:04,879
Your back felt so cosy.

336
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,239
Of course it is, you were just lying on me.

337
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,080
Poor me, you are so heavy!

338
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:13,879
Do you how that when
I was carrying you...

339
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,759
Who would have ever thought?
Xiao Fei and Fei Fei are now a couple.

340
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,960
They were always fighting
with each other,

341
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,999
So, all those fightings
were out of affection.

342
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,279
One is quiet and the other is outgoing.

343
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,800
They are a perfect match.

344
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,600
Ming Cheng and Qiu Jing
are getting married.

345
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,919
Xiao Fei and Fei Fei are in love.

346
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,519
They got love from this vacation,

347
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,159
but I got sick instead.

348
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,680
You can have love too.
I am right here for you.

349
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,279
You said I'll have the time to consider.

350
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,080
I am not urging you.

351
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,119
I'll get the car here.

352
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,680
Zhou Shi?

353
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,480
Why are you here?

354
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,800
I am here to apologize.

355
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,519
You should apologize
to Ning Fei instead.

356
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,119
I will apologize to him.

357
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,759
I was being foolish.

358
00:23:21,999 --> 00:23:24,879
I never thought he would
fall so hard that day.

359
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,960
Xiao Fei forgave you.

360
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,119
You should be grateful
for how kind he is.

361
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,600
You should feel sorry...

362
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:36,999
for hurting a kind person.

363
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,480
I know.

364
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:41,519
I know I don't deserve your forgiveness.

365
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,200
But I only did it to make you
leave Wei Qing.

366
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,759
I don't want you to be with him.

367
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,080
-Why?
-He is carrying infectious disease.

368
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,840
I bet you heard it from Zhang Lan Yu.

369
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,759
That is Wei Qing's fault.
He shouldn't have lied to her.

370
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,399
He is indeed sick,
but it's not infectious.

371
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,639
So what illness does he get?

372
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,519
I have no right to tell you.

373
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:07,159
You are still staying by his side
even after knowing his condition?

374
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,320
Yes.

375
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Why? What is so great about him?

376
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,159
Well, I am not sure either.

377
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,560
But I can't just leave him simply
because he is sick.

378
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,840
That too cliche for a reason.

379
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,480
Fine, that's all I have to say. Goodbye.

380
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,720
Wait!

381
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,759
-What do you want?
-You need to stay away from him.

382
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:26,080
He will only lie to you.

383
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,039
What are you trying to say?

384
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,519
What do you want?

385
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:39,320
Wei Qing, do you remember this woman?

386
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,080
She does look familiar.
What about her?

387
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,320
Her name is Zhou Xin Yao.

388
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,560
She is my first love.

389
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,039
You took her away from me,

390
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,759
and you left her heartlessly.

391
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,480
Because of you,
she tried to take her own life.

392
00:24:54,639 --> 00:24:57,039
Don't listen to his lies. Let's go.

393
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,759
See? He can't explain the details.

394
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,480
The guilt is written on his face.

395
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,399
What? Do you believe him?

396
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,800
Of course not.

397
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,399
I am just being curious.

398
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:13,999
Don't be so nosy.

399
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:18,200
You asked the same question last time.
I thought it was a waste of time.

400
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,720
But since Zhou Shi is curious
about the story, I will explain it to you.

401
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,440
Zhou Xin Yao has nothing to do with me.

402
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,239
Nonsense.

403
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,279
We once met on an event held by Yun Ma.

404
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,800
She came to me after the event ended.

405
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,239
She gave me a room card,
but I turned her down.

406
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,519
Then she told me she has a brother
studying fine arts who was sick.

407
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,200
She needed money for him
so she resorted to that lowly trick.

408
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:45,399
by the way.

409
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,200
The photo she showed me
was the same as the one you have here.

410
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,360
You seem to be the
brother she mentioned.

411
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
Nonsense!

412
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,440
I gave her some money to make her leave.

413
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:57,560
But then she came to me again.

414
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,320
She said her boyfriend broke up
with her because of me.

415
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,200
She would take her own life if
I don't agree to be her new boyfriend.

416
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,919
-You are lying.
-It wasn't easy to get rid of her.

417
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,560
That is not who she is.

418
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,440
You lied to her and broke her heart!

419
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,159
I gave you the explanation you want.

420
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,840
It's up to you to believe it or not.

421
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:19,560
Let's go.

422
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,159
Right.

423
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,320
If you still won't believe me,

424
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,080
you may ask Zhang Lan Yu yourself.

425
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,519
They are the same bunch.

426
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,440
They should know every
detail of the story.

427
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:52,720
This is the only way to find out
how my father died.

428
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,239
Are you sure about this?

429
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,360
This is the only way.

430
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Wei Qing.

431
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,600
The reason your brain chose to
seal  that part of your memory...

432
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,879
is because that memory once
brought you great pain.

433
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,119
Are you sure...

434
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:22,960
you want to resume it?

435
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,039
I can do this.

436
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:47,960
Fine.

437
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Right now, I need you...

438
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,440
focus on this metal ball.

439
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,320
Synchronize your eye movement
with the metal ball.

440
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,200
Do you even know
why I sent you to America?

441
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,519
I sent you here to study,
not to waste your life away!

442
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,840
You regret it now?

443
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:34,800
I thought you sent me here
to get rid of me.

444
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,320
-Go home if you regret it.
-Stop right there!

445
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,200
I am not done with you.
Take off your earphone.

446
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,519
Take it off!

447
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,440
I am tired, good night.

448
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:46,800
Stop right there!

449
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,960
Stop listening!

450
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,159
What now? Are you done with your rage?

451
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,639
You insolent child!

452
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,480
That kid is too senseless.

453
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:00,320
Father!

454
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,200
It won't open!

455
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,720
What is it that won't open?

456
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,560
The door won't open.

457
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,960
Be patient.

458
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,159
Try to find another exit
around the place.

459
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,840
Father!

460
00:30:20,239 --> 00:30:21,239
Father!

461
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:42,039
Father!

462
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:44,999
Father!

463
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,440
Father!

464
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,879
Father!

465
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:11,560
Father!

466
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,279
Father!

467
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Father!

468
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,639
Father!

469
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,840
Father!

470
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,800
Father!

471
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,840
I saw it.

472
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:46,999
I saw it!

473
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:48,239
-Calm down.
-I saw it!

474
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,360
What did you see there?
Take it slowly.

475
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,239
I saw my father's body.

476
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,800
The body is right outside my room.

477
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,639
But the door wouldn't open.

478
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,119
I jumped out of the window.

479
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,039
But when I arrived,

480
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,919
he was already dead.

481
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,639
But...

482
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,159
But if I hadn't got myself drunk,

483
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:24,879
maybe we wouldn't have that fight.

484
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,399
The door wouldn't have been locked.

485
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,519
Maybe I could have saved him.

486
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:37,320
Maybe he could still be alive!

487
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,800
My mother is right.

488
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:44,879
He is dead because of me.

489
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,239
She has every right to hate me.

490
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,399
According to Dr. Chen, that memory...

491
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,600
was chosen to delete by
Wei Qing because of his PTSD.

492
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,560
Maybe the cause of his allergy is
his guilt for his father.

493
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,840
Such a poor thing.

494
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,320
Perhaps it's better for him
to stay inside the room,

495
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,360
but he was right there.

496
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,039
That must be hard for him to accept it.

497
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:36,239
Yes. For years, he always thought...

498
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,999
he indirectly caused
the death of his father.

499
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,360
He has always been upset about it.

500
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,080
Dr. Chen said...

501
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,759
in order to cure him,
he needs to let go of the past.

502
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:50,519
Don't you think something strange?

503
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:52,919
Wei Qing said he locked the door.

504
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:54,720
But when he unlocked it,

505
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:56,320
the door wouldn't open.

506
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,239
Could it be that the lock was broken?

507
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,039
No, there is only one answer.

508
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,119
Someone blocked the door on the outside.

509
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,400
You mean someone blocked the door
to keep him inside?

510
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,840
Sister Zhou Shi.

511
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,560
I need to talk to Wei Qing.

512
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,320
What brings you to my house?

513
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:24,719
What is it?

514
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,679
Do you know why your father
went to America for you?

515
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,679
My mother told me.

516
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,679
He knew he was seriously ill.

517
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,640
So he wanted to see me one last time.

518
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,959
I know. Deep down inside your heart,

519
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:46,360
you think I took your family
away from you.

520
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,479
But I know one thing for sure.

521
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:50,560
I only borrowed them from you.

522
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:53,679
They were right there
for you all the time.

523
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,560
Now that Xiao Fei said it,

524
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,239
I remember something.

525
00:34:58,479 --> 00:35:00,759
Among the belongings
of your late father,

526
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:02,959
there was this drawing
you drew as a kid.

527
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,039
He must really miss the good old days.

528
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,640
Senior.

529
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:14,479
Uncle loved you a lot.

530
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,360
He praised you more than once
in front of me.

531
00:35:19,759 --> 00:35:22,920
He was strict to you for your own good.

532
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,479
I think...

533
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:35,120
he didn't blame you for not
saving him when he died.

534
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,360
He would be glad that you were safe.

535
00:35:40,959 --> 00:35:44,320
He never would have wanted you
to blame yourself for his death.

536
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,080
Do you remember what you said?

537
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,320
The door wouldn't open.

538
00:35:55,759 --> 00:35:59,679
We think someone blocked
the door from the outside...

539
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,320
to keep you inside the room.

540
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,160
Maybe your father did it.

541
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
There are files at the police station.

542
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,840
You should seek the truth.

543
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,999
Senior.

544
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,959
I have done some terrible things
when we were kids.

545
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,279
I am sorry.

546
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,840
Thank you.

547
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,759
This is the letter...

548
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:16,560
he left me back then.

549
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,920
My dearest son

550
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
If you are reading this letter,

551
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:45,039
it means I have passed away.

552
00:37:46,279 --> 00:37:49,560
You don't want to take
over the Yun Ma Group,

553
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:51,840
I am aware of it.

554
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,160
I forced you to focus
on drawing for years,

555
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:57,679
I demanded all sorts
of results from you,

556
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,719
my actions have brought you great pain.

557
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:03,640
Especially after Xiao Fei
arrived in our family,

558
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,039
I expected even more from you.

559
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,999
Sometimes, I was even unreasonable.

560
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,479
I hope you can understand.

561
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:16,039
Please forgive my selfishness.

562
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:20,360
I only wanted to shape you
into a great artist.

563
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,120
You possess great talent,

564
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,600
yet you fail to see it for now.

565
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
I am so worried for you.

566
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:32,239
But then I realized,

567
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,080
you love the art,

568
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,600
but you never liked drawing.

569
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,719
Rather than forcing you
to do something you don't like,

570
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,080
and make both of us upset,

571
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,880
I might as well let you
pursue your own interest.

572
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,320
At least by doing so,
you won't hate me as much.

573
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,400
But alas,

574
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,320
the realization came too late for me.

575
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,880
You would rather be alone in America...

576
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,840
than staying here with your parents.

577
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:07,920
I know, you are truly hurt.

578
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,999
It was my fault.

579
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,600
I hope that after you read this,

580
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,239
your resentment for me could fade away.

581
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,360
Now, let's talk about Yun Ma Group.

582
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:24,759
Yun Ma is the fruition of
your mother and I.

583
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,360
But honestly, we manage it badly .

584
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:33,039
Your mother and I are no expert
in running a company.

585
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,679
But we managed to survive because
of the support from our friends.

586
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:41,800
But without me,

587
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,920
your mother can never handle
the company all by herself.

588
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:49,759
But you are different.

589
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:54,719
You secretly worked with a few
gallery behind my back.

590
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,120
You sold the painting for your friends.

591
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,679
You even got a little famous.

592
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,080
I know all about it.

593
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:05,479
You have the mind of a businessman,
which I lack.

594
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,039
You will make Yun Ma great someday.

595
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,519
If you can't be an outstanding artist,

596
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:17,600
please be a successful businessman.

597
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,239
Hold on to Yun Ma for me.

598
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,800
Of course, I am aware it's not fair
to make this request,

599
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,320
but even if you turn me down,

600
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
your decision will be respected.

601
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,160
I only wanted you to have a good life.

602
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,759
But if you agree to take over,

603
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,239
please look after the company
and your mother for me.

604
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:43,360
You have my gratitude.

605
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:45,920
Lastly,

606
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,679
do not feel sad for my death.

607
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:50,880
I am not afraid of death.

608
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,880
I am afraid of losing you.

609
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,479
I want to give you one last hug.

610
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,560
Then,

611
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,519
I shall gladly accept my fate and leave.

612
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,959
I hope that when you read this letter,

613
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:08,800
I got the chance to give you a hug.

614
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,679
Right, don't let your mother read this letter,

615
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,679
Otherwise, she would be upset.

616
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:22,560
From: The father that loved you
but couldn't tell you.

617
00:41:23,759 --> 00:41:25,160
Wei Heng.

618
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,360
In the end,

619
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,239
I never gave him a hug.

620
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,800
Maybe this is his greatest regret.

621
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,880
I miss him so much.

622
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,360
I miss him so much.

623
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,560
I miss him so much.
