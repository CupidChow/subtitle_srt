[Episode 21]

29
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,480
Don't tell me you didn't hear
what I was talking about?

30
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:06,520
I did.

31
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,279
Repeat what I said.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,439
Something about response...

33
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,680
and something about
the questions?

34
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,639
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,400
I was absent-minded and didn't hear it.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,040
Can you explain it again, Chairman?

37
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,279
Mr. Wei.

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,639
I said, I'll show you
all the exam questions...

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,960
and create a framework.

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
Lastly, we'll practise
your adaptive response to stress.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,279
What's adaptive response to stress?

42
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,680
To make it simple,
it's like training a dog.

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
You'll have to do 20 sets
of questions per day...

44
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:43,279
until you're tired of it.

45
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,240
You don't have to remember
with your brain,

46
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,839
but with your body instead.

47
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,760
Once you see the questions
you can write the answers immediately.

48
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:53,960
Do you have to be so cruel?

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,760
Do you know how a circus trains a tiger?

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,719
By hitting it?

51
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,600
By starving them.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,439
Hunger is an animal's natural instinct.

53
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,999
Most of the time, people would
do anythng just for food.

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,999
I'll train you in the same way.

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,359
My goodness.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,680
Are you ready?

57
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,960
I am.

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,919
Louder!

59
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,359
I'm ready!

60
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,199
What is this?

61
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:30,719
This?

62
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:33,680
I found it two days ago.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,400
When I was a kid, if I did something wrong,

64
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,359
my father would beat me with this.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,240
Look. My name is on it.

66
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,199
It's worn out. I'm sure
you got beaten a lot.

67
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,760
Now, I'll use it on you.

68
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,719
Why is also a word here?

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,839
Okay.

70
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,279
I don't care how other people teach you.

71
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,960
As long as I'm your teacher,

72
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,999
I won't be merciful.

73
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
For today, you don't have much to do.

74

75

76
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,840
you don't get to sleep.

77
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,280

[Long time no see.]

79

[I'm sorry. I'm quite busy lately.]

00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,005
[Did you settle your things already?]

81
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,604
[Yeah. Luckily, I got some help
from my friend.]

82
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,797
[You must thank your friend then.]

83
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:13,984
[Yeah. She's unique.]

84
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,440
[ If I thank her directly,
she'll think that I'm boring.]

85

[This is interesting.
Is she interesting?]

[She's the most interesting person
I've ever met.]

[You regard her highly.
I think she's your special one.]

88
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,840
Did I say something wrong?

89
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,759
Never mind.

90
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,282
[Yeah.]

91
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,199
I think he's shy.

92
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,126
[Does she know that?]

93
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,593
[I don't know. I'm afraid that
she'll think I'm boring if I say this.]

94
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,363
[Confession is boring.]

95
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,960
[But staying undecided is more boring.]

96
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,022
[Just try.]

97
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:50,406
[You're right. It's late now.]

[Rest earlier. Good night!]

99

[Good night.]

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,079
Where are you going?

102
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,639
I'm going to work.

103
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,879
What time did I sleep yesterday?

104
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
Around 3 a.m..

105
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,240
I slept for less than five hours?

106
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,520
You can go to work.

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
But I don't need to work, right?

108
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,720
Wake up, revise your homework.

109
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,000
These are the papers
you need to do today.

110
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,199
it is too much

111
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,400
Assistant An, I'm so sleepy.

112
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,759
Can I just sleep for a while?

113
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,479
Just for an hour?

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Why did he give this to you?

115
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,560
Wei Qing is overdoing !

116
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
He doesn't want me to rest.

117
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,120
Assistant An, why are you
against me by his side?

118
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,919
It's all for you to pass the exams.

119
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,359
You have to go through this.

120
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,159
Wei Qing.

121
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,639
Chairman slept at the same time with me.

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,599
Why is he not sleepy at all?

123
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,959
When Chairman first
took over Yun Ma Group,

124
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,560
he stayed up the whole night for a few days.

125
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,919
He's not sleepy at all.
the more work he does, the more energetic he is.

126
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,240
He's a monster.

127
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,119
Perhaps only a monster...

128
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,050
could help Yun Ma Group
to be successful in a short time.

129
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,279
But now, even if he wants to sleep,

130
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,159
he can't.

131
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,760
Why?

132
00:08:58,359 --> 00:08:59,839
Didn't he tell you this?

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
He always had nightmares.

134
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,440
I think I've heard about this.

135
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,359
He looks glorious on the outside.

136
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,320
But in reality, it's hard for him too.

137
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:13,800
Yeah, that's why you must work hard.

138
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,120
I can do it!

139
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,959
This is?

140
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,719
Chairman,

141
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,279
For this season, the galaxy series
jewelries designed by Xun Ran...

142
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,359
has been booming in sales
since the pre-booking stage.

143
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,359
When the series got launched,
they sold all out at once.

144
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,800
Now, the series is out of stock.

145
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,519
But we've notified the factories
to hasten their productions.

146
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,120
By next month,

147
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,359
the second batch will be out.

148
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,959
We've discussed this with the
marketing department as well.

149
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,039
We think that we should create a
second series while the hype is around.

150
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,039
We've developed
some new designs as well.

151
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,880
Chairman, please have a look.

152
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,839
Are you done?

153
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,640
Yes.

154
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,120
Stop the factory's production first.

155
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,399
And delay the launching
of the second series.

156
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,479
-Why?
-Why? They're popular.

157
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,680
Did you guys think about Xun Ran?

158
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,919
He's a popular artist now.

159
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,760
The galaxy series is his masterpiece.

160
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
The galaxy series
had such a good sales...

161
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,279
because they have artistic value.

162
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,839
If you mass-produce them,

163
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,200
their artistic value will be lost.

164
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,120
By then, they would be worthless.

165
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,279
You guys don't even know this?

166
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:33,800
Publicity department.

167
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:34,839
Chairman?

168
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,839
Put Xun Ran's exhibition on our agenda.

169
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,279
And hold it at Xun's Galleria.

170
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:40,359
Yes. I'll arrange it immediately.

171
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,240
About Director He...

172
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,880
I'll speak to her.

173
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm not sleeping!

174
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,479
I just took a nap.

175
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:10,080
Ask Assistant An
if you don't believe me.

176
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
Is that true?

177
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
Okay, I'll forgive you this time.

178
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,039
You can eat now.

179
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,359
eat!

180
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,959
This is your meal.

181
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:26,680
What do you mean by this?
Are you discriminating me?

182
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,080
You only did three sets of questions
for the entire morning.

183
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,640
You should be thankful
I gave you something to eat.

184
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,839
You are bullying me!

185
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,279
You're not eating?

186
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,519
Wei An, take it away.

187
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,159
Okay! I'll eat!

188
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,760
What expression is that?

189
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
I have something for you
in the afternoon.

190
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,839
You're giving me work again?

191
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,320
Mind your attitude.

192
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,279
Chairman, do you have any orders?

193
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,320
Your beloved Xun Ran is
holding an art exhibition soon.

194
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,760
Really? Is that true?

195
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,839
Yeah.

196
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,399
He drew many paintings already.

197
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,800
He should hold an exhibition.

198
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,839
How did you know that he...

199
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,000
He told you, right?

200
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,760
That's better.
Saves me from all the trouble.

201
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,399
Just call him then.

202
00:12:24,599 --> 00:12:26,599
Ask him to go to Xun's Galleria.

203
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,440
And arrange his own exhibition.
His exhibition will be there.

204
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,159
I'll go immediately!

205
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Does she need to be so excited?

206
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,959
He's holding an exhibition for Xiao Fei?

207
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:56,159
Yes. Chairman told me
to pass this message.

208
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,399
Director He,
you'll arrange the exhibition.

209
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,440
And our company will
surely cooperate with you.

210
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:06,080
Why didn't he tell me this personally?

211
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,839
Chairman is afraid that...

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,120
you won't talk to him.

213
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,880
If you need to talk to him, I...

214
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
No need for that.

215
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,800
By the way, Director He,

216
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't know if I should say this...

217
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,719
Don't say it then.

218
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,839
I know what you're trying to say.

219
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,159
But it's our family affair.

220
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,680
How can an outsider know the truth?

221
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,839
Aunty.

222
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,120
Xiao Fei, you're here?

223
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,279
Have a seat.

224
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,120
Xiao Zhou, you can sit too.

225
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,159
I didn't expect that Xiao Fei
told you this already.

226
00:13:57,359 --> 00:14:01,039
I didn't expect that I could
be around my idol as well.

227
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,919
Oh yeah,

228
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
I still remember what
you said to me when I came.

229
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,039
You said I would meet Xun Ran someday.

230
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,640
That really came true.

231
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,240
Yeah. Fate is a mysterious thing.

232
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,719
Xiao Zhou.

233
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,120
Xiao Fei doesn't like to talk much.

234
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,479
He doesn't have any friends either.

235
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:20,279
I'm quite worried about him.

236
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
I encouraged him to go out often.

237
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:24,880
But he doesn't listen to me.

238
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,159
But now, you guys are good friends.

239
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,519
I feel relieved.

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,880
Not just me,

241
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,959
my housemates like Xiao Fei too.

242
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Xiao Fei is sensible.

243
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,120
He's talented as well.

244
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm really happy.

245
00:14:40,599 --> 00:14:44,080
I've always hoped that Xiao Fei
could be someone normal.

246
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,320
I hoped that he can
interact with someone else.

247
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,440
When I saw you guys together,

248
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,680
I'm really happy.

249
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:53,719
Xiao Zhou.

250
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,240
Please take care
of Xiao Fei in the future.

251
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,839
If you need any help or money,
just tell me.

252
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:05,320
No problem.

253
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,919
Xiao Fei is just like my brother.

254
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,640
I will take care of him.

255
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,039
Xiao Fei, did you hear that?

256
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,880
You must listen
to Xiao Zhou in the future.

257
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,200
Okay then.

258
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,560
Let's talk about the exhibition.

259
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,519
Director He is quite kind.

260
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,080
I was afraid of her in the past.

261
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,080
But now, I think she's kind.

262
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,760
Aunty is a kind person.

263
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:37,440
She's just not happy with my senior.

264
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,599
Nice painting.

265
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,000
You like my paintings so much?

266
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,240
Of course! I would buy all of them,

267
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,039
if I had the money.

268
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,719
I'll give them to you then.
All of them.

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,279
You can't do that!

270
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
You need to sell them.

271
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,599
I don't want to sell them now.
I want to give them to you.

272
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,519
Silly boy.

273
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,279
I appreciate your sincerity.

274
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,640
Besides, you drew
a painting for me already.

275
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,039
It's a special one for me as well.

276
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,640
I'll draw them for you next time.

277
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,080
Sure.

278
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,839
By the way,

279
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,080
why does the word 'Ran'
appear in all of your paintings?

280
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,519
And why are you called Xun Ran?

281
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,399
Because my brother is Ning Ran.

282
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,680
I want to find him.

283
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:33,919
This is Ran. It's my name.

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,159
Remember that.

285
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,399
Write it for me.

286
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,320
Good job.

287
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,519
Did you notice anything about the word?

288
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,119
Here! It lacks a dot here.

289
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,560
He wrote the wrong word.

290
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,360
Only you two know about this?

291
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,119
What happened after that?

292
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,200
How did you guys get separated?

293
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,800
Xiao Fei? Xiao Fei!

294
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,399
Why are you hiding here?

295
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:29,039
The headmaster is looking for you.

296
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:30,639
Your foster parents are here.

297
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,119
Come on! Come with me.

298
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,480
I don't want to!

299
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,999
Why?

300
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,919
Xiao Fei, be obedient.

301
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,239
Your foster parents look rich.

302
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,560
You can leave the orphanage
if you follow them.

303
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:48,119
Do you want to be trapped
here forever?

304
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,159
Why didn't you go with me?

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,239
My father asked me to wait for here.

306
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,519
You've waited for more than
one year already.

307
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,440
They would've come by now.

308
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Be obedient. go with me.

309
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,320
If you don't want to go with them,
I'll go with them then.

310
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,399
I don't want to stay here anymore.

311
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,239
I want to leave.
I want to lead a good life.

312
00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:19,039
Big Brother, please don't go.

313
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,680
Xiao Fei, I'm sorry.

314
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm leaving now.

315
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,519
Please don't go.

316
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,200
Big Brother, please don't go.

317
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,519
Xiao Fei, if I lead
a good life in the future,

318
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,519
I'll come back for you.

319
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,800
If you do leave here in the future,

320
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,639
remember to find me.

321
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,560
And don't forget my name.

322
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,159
Did your big brother come for you?

323
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,759
After about a month,

324
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:48,440
my uncle came for me.

325
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,360
You've been searching
for him ever since?

326
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,440
Don't worry. I'm sure you can find him.

327
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:56,560
Besides, you're famous now.

328
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:57,999
If he sees your works,

329
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,680
he'll come to you.

330
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,879
Senior.

331
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
I'll leave first.

332
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
How is it?

333
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:10,960
I've settled it already.

334
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,360
Director He said that she'll
send the proposal soon.

335
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,080
I think Director He has
a different view of you now.

336
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,399
Because you hold
an exhibition for Xiao Fei.

337
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,080
She's quite touched by that.

338
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:29,600
And I told her that you stopped
Xiao Fei from designing jewelries.

339
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,119
She smiled because of that.

340
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,639
Is that true?

341
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,919
Why are you telling me this?

342
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,519
I'm not interested.

343
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,800
You just don't want to admit it.

344
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,800
I've done a good job.

345
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,759
Shouldn't you reward me?

346
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,680
Fine. I'll give you an extra
ham for tomorrow's sandwich.

347
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,919
You're so stingy!

348
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,200
I want to sleep!

349
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,119
Did I make many mistakes?

350
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,320
Mistakes?

351
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,119
Why didn't you ask me about the
number of questions you got right?

352
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:09,039
You can't blame me for this.

353
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,560
When I don't sleep well,
I can't memorise things.

354
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,360
When I can't memorise them,
I'll do bad in the exam.

355
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,080
Where did you get all these?

356
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,279
I've bought every related book
from the market.

357
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,119
Don't worry. You'll do a large amount
of them every day.

358
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,519
And I can make sure that
you won't repeat a question.

359
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,519
Just kill me already.

360
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,800
You must finish them by tonight.

361
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,039
If not, you can't sleep.

I don't want to do them anymore.

377
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:50,639
Time to eat noodles.

378
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,159
I haven't finished them. I won't eat.

379
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,840
Why shouldn't I eat them?
I'll eat them now!

380

It's okay if I fail.

385
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
I've finished my noodles already.

386
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,800
You can do whatever you like.

387
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,279
You got 48 marks even though
you only completed two-third of them.

388
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:56,960
You have one-third of them left.

389
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,680
As long as you don't make
too many mistakes,

390
00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:00,440
I think you can pass your exam.

391
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,119
Looks like...

392
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,360
your efforts are not wasted.

393
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,720
Good luck.

394
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,919
There are more noodles upstairs.

395
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,879
If you want them, you can go and take.

396
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,600
Yes, Mr. Wei.

397
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,039
Why do you bring me here again?

398
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,119
Your body is used
to the questions already.

399
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:43,800
Now, it's time to train your brain.

400
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,999
Although there are not many collections here,
it has everything you need.

401
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,999
Just look at them.
It's beneficial to you.

402
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,639
Do you know about Pu Yi's story?

403
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,039
I don't.

404
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,600
Pu Yi and Wang Guo Wei, the collector,

405
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,519
were best friends.

406
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:02,200
Wang Guo Wei had
collected some antiques.

407
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,800
And he asked Pu Yi to view them.

408
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,239
After viewing, Pu Yi said
that the antiques were fake.

409
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,999
Wang Guo Wei was upset about that.

410
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,039
He used various evidences and viewpoints
to prove that they were not fake.

411
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:15,320
Pu Yi didn't say much about that.

412
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,919
After that, Wang Guo Wei
examined them closely.

413
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
He discovered that
the antiques were fake.

414
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,360
He asked Pu Yi.

415
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,039
how did you differentiate them.

416
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,680
He wanted to learn something.

417
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,320
Guess what Pu Yi said to him?

418
00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:31,200
Pu Yi said,

419
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:34,480
I don't have the theories
and evidences like you,

420
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,840
I just feel like your antiques are
different from the one at home.

421
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,119
That's why, sometimes,

422
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,119
having direct contact with something...

423
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,759
is better than reading books about them.

424
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:48,680
-Look at them.
-Okay.

425
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,119
My painting?

426
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,680
I didn't do a good job.

427
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
Why did you buy my painting?

428
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,200
Look at the paintings beside you.

429
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,039
And think of the place you're in.

430
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,600
Do you think I would put
worthless paintings here?

431
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:06,360
Although your foundation is weak,

432
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,159
you're not as useless as you think.

433
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,200
You're very talented.

434
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,919
In painting and designs.

435
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,759
I bought your painting
before I knew you.

436
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:20,200
Is that true?

437
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,759
Although you don't have
great techniques and vast experiences,

438
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,399
you can become better if you
work hard in the future.

439
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,080
I'm sure you'll be a great painter
in the future if you work hard.

440
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,279
That's why, with my professional view,

441
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,639
I bought your paintings.

442
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:38,360
I'll use them in the future
when they are valuable.

443
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,879
In the end, you bought them
for the money.

444
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,800
Money is a good way of determining
the worth of something.

445
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:47,759
If someone bought something,
it doesn't mean that it's good.

446
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,960
But if no one bought that thing,
I'm sure it's not a good thing.

447
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,200
Appreciation give art their lives.

448
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:55,600
But money gives art their worth.

449
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,320
It's all nonsense.

450
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,080
That's why,

451
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,879
you must be more confident.

452
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,560
Although you're not as good as
Bi Qiu Jing or Li Ming Cheng,

453
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,720
in art,

454
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,840
you're the clear winner.

455
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,360
You can even compare yourself
with Xun Ran.

456
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,999
Do you mean that?

457
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,639
Or do you just trying to motivate me?

458
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,600
I promise you with my professional view.

459
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:25,919
You will become a great painter.

460
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
I know that.

461
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,800
Fine. Stop praising yourself
in front of your painting.

462
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,239
View some other paintings.

463
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,639
I'm in the storage room.

464
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay, I'll send it to you now.

465
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,200
I need to do something.

466
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,840
Take a look around.

467
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,279
Go then.

468
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,840
Be careful.

469
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,999
This is different from last time.

470
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
These are all the real deals.

471
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,440
I understand.

472
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,320
It is so much!
There's a secret room here?

473
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,720
Wei Qing?

474
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,399
Wei Heng?

475
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:35,399
Do all these belong
to Wei Qing's father?

476
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,960
Are you done?

477
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,680
I didn't do it on purpose.

478
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,080
Get out.

479
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,720
But the pictures...

480
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,119
Get out!

481
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,646
[I'm sorry.]

482
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,119
You're back?

483
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,480
Wei Qing said
I'm almost done learning them.

484
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,759
I can just do my revision
with the questions.

485
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:28,399
Let me look at your face.

486
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,840
You look okay.
Your face is still chubby.

487
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,720
I almost died of starvation.

488
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,720
I can only eat sandwiches
these few days.

489
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,480
He doesn't allow me to sleep either

490
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,119
I'm so hungry.

491
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,999
Fei Fei, I want to have a nice meal.

492
00:31:42,999 --> 00:31:45,560
Okay. I'll buy some food later.

493
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,399
We'll have hot pot tonight, okay?

494
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:49,279
Fei Fei is the best!

495
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:58,239
These comments are written by Wei Qing?

496
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,560
Yeah. Everyone thought
he only knows about business...

497
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,600
and he is clueless about art.
Actually, he's very knowledgeable.

498
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,639
Let alone he reads extensively

499
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,600
he knows about the history of
the paintings and the painters as well.

500
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,480
He's smarter than our professors.

501
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,399
If he taught me in the past,

502
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,399
I wouldn't have to resort
to cramping myself with books.

503
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,919
Now you're worshiping him?

504
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,519
I'm not worshiping him.

505
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,759
I just think that he's amazing.

506
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,440
When you talk about him,
your eyes is glowing.

507
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,239
Just like when you talk about
Li Ming Cheng and Xun Ran.

508
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,999
So, do you know...

509
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,119
his position in your heart?

510
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:41,960
But this time, he's serious.

511
00:32:42,239 --> 00:32:44,119
I thought he was just playing with you.

512
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,480
Yeah, I thought of that too.

513
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,960
I thought he just wanted to
monitor me when I was studying.

514
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:51,879
I didn't expect him to make
the notes for me personally.

515
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,960
Zhang Shuai made some notes for me too.

516
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,879
But he only highlighted
the important parts.

517
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,440
Wei Qing is different.

518
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,279
Besides highlighting them, he also
made some charts and diagrams.

519
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:04,279
He's so busy.

520
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,279
How did he find the time for this?

521
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:07,720
Silly girl.

522
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:09,800
Of course he made them
when you didn't notice him.

523
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,399
Maybe he made them during your sleep.

524
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,600
Maybe he's making them
for you right now.

525
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,039
Anyway, you must thank him this time.

526
00:33:17,239 --> 00:33:19,680
He did put a lot of effort into it.

527
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:23,080
I should thank him.

528
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,360
Okay then. I'll go and buy food now.

529
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,919
You do your papers, okay?

530
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,320
Goodbye.

531
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,639
I slept at 4 a.m. these few days.

532
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,039
Now, I can't sleep when
it's not that time.

533
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,120
Silly girl.

534
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,840
Of course he made them
when you didn't notice him.

535
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:11,640
Maybe he made them during your sleep.

536
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,800
Maybe he's making them
for you right now.

537
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,400
Anyway, you must thank him this time.

538
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,840
He did put a lot of effort into it.

539
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,759
Get out.

540
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,120
-But the pictures...
-Get out!

541
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,360
Who's there?

542
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,160
I'm coming.

543
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,719
Did you sleep well?

544
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,239
You're here?

545
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,400
What's wrong?

546
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:42,920
Do you think you have revised
your homework already?

547
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,920
No. I thought that...

548
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,279
You thought what?

549
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,999
Change your clothes now.

550
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,320
And go upstairs.

551
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Okay.

552
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:17,120
Now, your professional knowledge
is good enough already.

553
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:18,199
For the next task,

554
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:20,800
we'll focus on CET-4.

555
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:21,920
Of course.

556
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,439
I'll spend two hours per day
to help you do revision as well.

557
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,640
So that you can remember them.

558
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:29,120
Are you sure you want to write that?

559
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,239
What's wrong?

560
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,199
Did it wake up your inner trauma?

561
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,959
Did this remind you of the horror?
which the College Entrance Exam brought to you.

562
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:41,360
You look very excited about this.

563
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,080
I didn't take the  the College Entrance Exam.

564
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,840
I can experience it with you this time.

565
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:47,560
Besides,

566
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,560
it can awaken the memories inside you

567
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,920
It's good for you.

568
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,759
When you're reminded of that,
you can learn better.

569
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:54,640
Anyway,

570
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:56,679
we don't have much time left.

571
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,039
You will have a hard time.

572
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:00,400
Are you ready?

573
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,640
I'm ready. I know I won't get to sleep.

574
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,039
It's best if you know that.

575
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,920
There's no shortcut in learning English.

576
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,719
But we do have shortcuts
in memorising words.

577
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,080
There are many methods
available in the market.

578
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:11,959
To sum them up,

579
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,759
they're the affixes mnemonics,

580
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,800
categorization mnemonics,
associative mnemonics,

581
00:37:15,959 --> 00:37:17,160
and pictogram mnemonics.

582
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,239
I'll try to combine all of these
methods for you to learn better.

583
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,279
What is this?

584
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,199
I've asked the technical department
to total up the words used...

585
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,999
in the last 10 years of the CET-4.

586
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,800
And categorised them accordingly
so that you can understand better.

587
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,479
This is amazing.

588
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,160
You should've teach in the
New Oriental Group.

589
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,679
Please go ahead

590
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,759
Besides memorising them,
you need to answer questions.

591
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,120
But you've done that before.

592
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,439
I'll skip that then.

593
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,039
When you wake up in the morning,
you have the best memory.

594
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,360
We'll focus on memorising.

595
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:56,759
Although you may be tired
in the afternoon, I can help with that.

596
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,039
During the night,
we're the most focused.

597
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,880
I'll give you pop quiz during that time.

598
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,719
Do you have any questions?

599
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,840
Tell me.

600
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,959
Do...

601
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,600
I need to starve again?

602
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,840
If you're full, you're easy to get tired.

603
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,759
My goodness.

604
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,519
Director He.

605
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,239
Do I have anything in the afternoon?

606
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,360
You don't.

607
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,679
I'll confirm that later.

608
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,959
No need for that.

609
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,560
Just help me cancel everything.

610
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,719
Later, you must go to an event with me.

611
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:41,640
Okay.

612
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,320
Director He, I thought we were
going to a shooting event?

613
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,920
You'll know that shortly.

614
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,679
This is...

615
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,199
Today is the first month
since we've known each other.

616
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,320
In this month,

617
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:24,759
we knew each other,
we had misunderstandings,

618
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:26,479
and we had feelings for each other.

619
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,959
No, I had feelings for you.

620
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,080
Honestly speaking,

621
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,759
I had never fell so deeply in love
with someone.

622
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,080
Although we didn't
spend much time together,

623
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,999
your every actions and words...

624
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:39,679
were deeply imprinted in my heart.

625
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,479
Fei Fei, will you be my girlfriend?

626
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:57,400
Director He.

627
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,120
I think I need some time.

628
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,360
Of course.
As long as you don't reject me.

629
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,120
I'll wait for your answer.

630
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,360
Let's go. I've booked
a restaurant already.

631
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,880
We can go there now.

632
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,800
What's wrong?

633
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,759
You don't want to go with me for dining?

634
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,800
It's not true. Let's go then.

635
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,360
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

636
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,160
Time to wake up.

637
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,080
to resist.

638
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,320
Withstand.

639
00:41:07,439 --> 00:41:11,360
W- I-T-H-S-T-A-N-D.

640
00:41:11,999 --> 00:41:13,719
A workshop or a factory.

641
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:14,999
Workshop.

642
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,719
Workshop!

643
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,920
To injure someone.

644
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,600
Where did you get these two guys?

645
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,400
Yun Ma Group is a big company.

646
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,320
Is it very difficult to find
two foreign employees?

647
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,479
But there is no oral test for CET-4.

648
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,719
I'm training your listening now.

649
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,840
Isn't this too much?

650
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,719
Can't I just listen to the recordings?

651
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,759
Recordings are dead,
but humans are alive.

652
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:49,560
I hired them because
I want you to learn faster.

653
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,160
If you do well, during your exam,

654
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,759
you will have images in your mind.

655
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,719
And it's good for your memory.

656
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,920
