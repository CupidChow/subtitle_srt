Lin Fei Fei, your taste...

30
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,800
Isn't he too young for you?

31
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:32,479
None of your business.

32
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,760
The both of you are the same.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
-Let's go.
-Someone got hit!

34
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,400
Go after them.

35
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,240
I was hit.

36
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,680
Quick, come out.

37
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,479
-Where are you?
-We are now being chased by others.

38
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,120
Quick, find someone to help us.

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,079
You're hit by others?

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,760
Catch them.

41
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,719
Quick, let's go.

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,639
Hit him.

43

Ning Fei!

44
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,839
Stop it.

45
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,600
Stop it.

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,559
You scoundrels.

47
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,199
Stop it.

Zhou Shi.

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
Xiao Fei.

50
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,520
Don't go, you'll only
add to the trouble.

51
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,800
Xiao Fei!

52
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,479
Why is he here?

53
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,319
Zhou Shi called him and
asked him to come.

54
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,199
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

55
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
Ladies, leave first.
If you're afraid, you can leave too.

56
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,800
-I won't leave.
-Can you handle it?

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280
When I was involved in fights,

58
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,199
they were still good students.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,879
Xiao Fei!

60
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,919
Stop it.

61
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,479
Why are you still here?
Do you want to die?

62
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,800
You want to leave
after hitting my brothers?

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,800
I'll have to call the police.

64
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,319
If you don't want to
make things big, leave now!

65
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,319
Let's go.

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,440
Forget it...

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,199
You have an allergic reaction again.

68
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Does it hurt?

69
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,800
A little.

70
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,479
No need.

71
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,479
Since you've reached home safely,

72
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,960
we should leave.

73
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:56,280
Ning Fei.

74
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,479
Since you fought with me tonight,

75
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,159
I'll send you back.

76
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,159
No need, he's staying here.

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,759
What does that mean?

78
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,680
You want him to stay here for tonight?

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,840
Not tonight, he has been
staying here for a while.

80
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,079
Here?

81
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,560
Where? With who?

82
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,680
With you?

83
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,720
No, he sleeps in the living room.

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,919
So, he moved from
upstairs to downstairs?

85
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,840
Yes, where would he live...

86
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,039
since you kicked him out?

87
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,079
-He's not allowed to stay here.
-Why?

88
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,039
He paid us rent.

89
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,599
Because I said so.

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,560
The whole building belongs to me.

91
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,400
If I don't allow him to stay here,
he can't!

92
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,879
Wei Qing, you went too far.

93
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,240
You've already kicked him out once.
What else do you want to do?

94
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,159
Moreover, what did Xiao Fei do wrong?

95
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,240
Why do you have to do this to him?

96
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
Ning Fei!

97
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,000
You asked her to come?

98
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,639
She's the only guardian of Xiao Fei.

99
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,120
Of course I have to ask her to come.

100
00:06:58,359 --> 00:06:59,759
-Auntie.
-Where's Xiao Fei?

101
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,520
Xiao Fei...

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,039
Auntie.

103
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,240
Oh dear.

104
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,800
What happened, Xiao Fei?

105
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,759
-I'm fine.
-Why are you hurt so...

106
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
Oh dear.

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,359
Why is your hand badly hurt?

108
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,400
Your hand can't be hurt.

109
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,280
Who did you fight with?

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,919
You did it, right?

111
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,800
Auntie, this has nothing
to do with Wei Qing.

112
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,840
Stand right there!
Make it clear.

113
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,120
Why do you always bully Xiao Fei?

114
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,879
If I say it wasn't me,

115
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,479
will you believe me?

116
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
Auntie, it's not like that.

117
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
Wei Qing and Xiao Fei fought to save us.

118
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Just blame us.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,599
You don't have to explain to her.

120
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,960
Since young,

121
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,359
she has always thought of me as a bully.

122
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Are you not?

123
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,879
Since young, you've been in troubles
for countless times.

124
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,280
You're a scoundrel.

125
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,359
You caused your dad's death,

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,840
now you want Xiao Fei to die too?

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,639
Will you be satisfied after...

128
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,440
killing everyone close to me?

129
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,240
Open your eyes and look closely.

130
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,680
I'm your son!

131
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,440
I should be the one closest to you!

132
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
I wish Xiao Fei was my son instead!

133
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,680
Then,

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,839
everything wouldn't happened.

135
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,279
My husband wouldn't have to die.

136
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,320
You and I...

137
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,959
You and I wouldn't need to be in pain.

138
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,000
Auntie.

139
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,279
Auntie, are you okay?

140
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,479
I'm okay.

141
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,880
You're a scoundrel.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,959
You caused your dad's death,

143
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,440
now you want Xiao Fei to die too?

144
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:15,560
Will you be satisfied after
killing everyone close to me?

145
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,359
I'm your son!

146
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,120
I should be the one closest to you!

147
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,200
I wish Xiao Fei was my son instead!

148
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Chairman He,

149
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,560
I came to solve this problem.

150
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,800
You can't keep avoiding me.

151
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,640
This problem between you and I...

152
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:34,919
can't be solved.

153
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
Because of you,

154
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,479
your dad and I went to the States.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,039
Or else, he wouldn't die.

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,080
You caused his death.

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,959
I really don't know how to face you.

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,919
Let's calm down.

159
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,399
Mum!

160
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,919
Mum!

161
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,000
Mum!

162
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,039
Are you okay?

163
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:09,519
My head hurts.

164
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,719
I tidied up your bedroom upstairs.

165
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,479
Why don't you go up and rest?

166
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,080
Come on.

167
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,479
Get out!

168
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,800
Out!

169
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,200
Don't forget,

170
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,959
your husband was my father too.

171
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,240
I want to tell you...

172
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,919
what you've told me too.

173
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,159
Please don't ruin the art gallery.

174
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,560
Was I...

175
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,399
too harsh?

176
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,440
Here, take a seat.

177
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,240
Take a rest.

178
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,240
I'll bring the first aid box over.

179
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,560
No, this isn't right.

180
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,000
How many times have I told you?

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
Why can't you change it?

182
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,959
No matter what I draw,
you'll think it's wrong.

183
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,320
You are prejudiced against me.

184
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,039
I can't win over
the kid that you picked up.

185
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,760
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,120
Get out.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,959
Don't make your dad angry.

188
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:28,919
Shit!

189
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,719
-Senior.
-Don't touch me!

190
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,680
What are you doing?
Why did you get mad at him?

191
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
He's still a kid, get it?

192
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,039
Yes, I got mad at him.

193
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,599
I don't like the look of him.

194
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,880
Before he came, everything went well.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,680
After he came,

196
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,120
no matter what I do,
it's wrong for the both of you.

197
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,599
Shut up!

198
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,959
Enough, stop it.
Leave now.

199
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:50,120
Do you want your dad to die
in a fit of rage?

200
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,560
Enough, calm down.

201
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,760
You'll get angry no matter what I do.

202
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,479
I'll go back to the States tomorrow.

203
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,519
Where are you going?

204
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,000
None of your business!

205
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,440
Uncle.

206
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,959
He's still childish.

207
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,640
After so many years,

208
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,680
he still kept this painting.

209
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,800
Wei Qing.

210
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,200
Wei Qing.

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,680
He wouldn't commit suicide, right?

212
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,839
Are you a pervert?
Why aren't you wearing any clothes?

213
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:18,279
You're the pervert.

214
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:19,680
How did you get in?

215
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,159
I knocked the door
but you didn't answer.

216
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,640
I thought you committed suicide.
I came in through the window.

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,640
I was taking a shower.

218
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,800
I didn't hear the bell ring.
Can't you wait for a while?

219
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,680
Quick, wear your clothes.

220
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Wait.

221
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,080
Are you done?

222
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,680
Can't you take a shower later?

223
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,159
You're putting on
medicine for me, right?

224
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,760
Of course I have to take a shower first.

225
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
Forget it. Don't tell others about it.

226
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,719
Don't I want to save face?

227
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,240
Don't tell others about it too.

228
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:01,159
Where do you want me
to put the medicine on?

229
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,440
Upstairs.

230
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,919
Do you often climb through windows?

231
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,159
I'm not a thief,

232
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,279
why would I need to do that?

233
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:26,919
Then, when he was staying here,

234
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,359
did you climb through the window?

235
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,760
Yes.

236
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,839
Don't move, I'm putting on medicine.

237
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,560
Why did you do so?

238
00:15:34,719 --> 00:15:36,359
That time, our kitchen had a leak.

239
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,200
So, I wanted to see what was
happening upstairs.

240
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:40,640
I found Xiao Fei unconscious in the tub.

241
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,519
He broke his bowl and
went on a hunger strike.

242
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,359
So that was it.

243
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,200
Xiao Fei told me all about you.

244
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,599
It was unfair for you.

245
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:52,000
I got used to it already.

246
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:56,080
Actually,

247
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,479
Xiao Fei felt guilty.

248
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,240
Moreover, he was just a kid.
He didn't know anything.

249
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:04,120
You shouldn't blame him.

250
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,680
He sent you to win me over?

251
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,359
No, I just think...

252
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,919
your relationship shouldn't
end up like this.

253
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:14,760
I'm just an outsider.

254
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,159
I can't say anything.

255
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,599
I just hope you won't despise him.

256
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,039
He's pitiful too.

257
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,399
I don't get...

258
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,039
what is his charm.

259
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,719
Why is everyone on his side?

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm not siding him.

261
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,080
I just say whatever is on my mind.

262
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,200
Okay, it's done.

263
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,599
I'm going back now.

264
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,800

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,360

Yes, I did.

Then what did she say?

286
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,360
She was happy, and said thank you.

287
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,960
Congratulations then.

288
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,720

Zhang Shuai.

305
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,759
The teacher is looking for me?

306
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:20,680
I'll head there now.

307
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Goodbye.

308
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,399
We slept here last night?

309
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,039
Where else?

310
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,999
You fell asleep when we were talking.

311
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:30,440
I didn't dare to move.

312
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,519
I lied on the sofa for the whole night.

313
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,560
My back aches.

314
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:38,560
I haven't slept so comfortably for ages.

315
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,080
Your legs are comfortable to lay on.

316
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:43,560
Why don't you let me lay
on them for two more days?

317
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,080
Impossible.

318
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,960
I'll head to college now.

319
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,759
Wait a minute.

320
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,119
I'll change and send you there.

321
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:08,200
The teacher asked me to come in a hurry.
What is it about?

322
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,560
It may be about your credit hours.

323
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,200
You've been interning outside...

324
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,560
and didn't go to class.

325
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,879
But, there aren't much classes left.

326
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,279
Moreover, I checked my credit hours.

327
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,720
Even if I can't get good grades,

328
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,159
I should be able to
pass all the subjects.

329
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,440
I don't know about that.

330
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,639
We're here.

331
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,360
Let the teacher
tell you himself. Let's go.

332
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,320
Sir, Zhou Shi is here.

333
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:32,879
Sir.

334
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,080
We haven't met in a while.

335
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,919
Yes.

336
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,639
It has been at least six months.

337
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:40,639
I heard your teacher said that
you haven't been to classes in a while?

338
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,560
Is that right?

339
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,999
Yes, recently I'm busy working.

340
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,080
So, I didn't come often.

341
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,360
But, I handed up all the assignments.

342
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,639
Zhou Shi,

343
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,360
our college won't stop
students from interning,

344
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,159
But, you can't skip classes.

345
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,200
There will be an exam soon,
can you pass it?

346
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,919
I think so.

347
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,879
You have to pass it.

348
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,560
If you failed that exam,

349
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,360
you may be delayed
from graduating, get it?

350
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,720
I'll be delayed from graduating?

351
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,879
That serious?

352
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,159
You're a top student that passed CET-6.

353
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,960
You can't let me failed CET-4.

354
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,560
Help me.

355
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,440
There isn't much to teach.

356
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,039
Just memorise the vocabulary
and you'll pass.

357
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,840
If you can help me pass CET-4,

358
00:21:32,999 --> 00:21:34,440
I'll buy you snacks.

359
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,639
How many words did you memorise
the vocabulary list of CET-4?

360
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,560
Abandon(the first word on the list).

361
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,039
Sister Fei Fei,

362
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,039
you're the only one
that can help me now.

363
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,879
I can help you.

364
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,519
But, how should I do so?

365
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,320
Did you pass CET-4?

366
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,720
Yes, in my second year.

367
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,119
How is that possible?

368
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,200
You rely on pinyin
to sing English songs.

369
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,759
How did you pass the CET-4?

370
00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:04,440
You talk a lot.

371
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,440
I have my own ways.

372
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,480
Top student, help me.

373
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:14,919
Help me take the exam.

374
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:21,360
I was wrong.

375
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,879
Help me once.

376
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,800
Go to Li Ming Cheng.

377
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,720
Ask him to help you revise for CET-4.

378
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,200
Maybe your relationship...

379
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,600
can get closer.

380
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,440
Yes, what a good idea.

381
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:36,759
Good luck.

382
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,999
CET-4?

383
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
Yes, Brother Ming Cheng.

384
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
You're the only one that
can help me right now.

385
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:48,320
Didn't I give you...

386
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,879
a book on CET-4 vocabulary last year?

387
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,159
-What is your progress now?
-A.

388
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,600
What?

389
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:55,119
I finished memorising that.

390
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:58,480
I'm almost done with B.

391
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,200
Brother Ming Cheng, stop scolding me.

392
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,560
I know I was wrong.

393
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,239
It's not that I don't want to help you,

394
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:07,360
but, the company arranged for me...

395
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,519
to go on a business trip.

396
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,159
I'm flying out this afternoon.

397
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,879
For how long?

398
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,279
About half a month.

399
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,759
That long?

400
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:17,999
Can you stay?

401
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,720
This is the company's arrangement.

402
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,680
I can't make a decision.

403
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:24,919
Don't worry.

404
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,639
Actually, the CET-4...

405
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,399
is about vocabulary.

406
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,279
Now, go back and memorise.

407
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,279
Memorise as much vocabulary as you can.

408
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,080
By the way,

409
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,879
the date of the CET-4
falls on the day after your birthday.

410
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,960
You have to focus on...

411
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,480
preparing for the exam.

412
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,239
Cancel any birthday plans for now.

413
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,560
After I return, I'll celebrate with you.

414
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
Get it?

415
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,159
Yes.

416
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,399
Good luck.

417
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,840
You can only rely on memorising
if you want to pass CET-4.

418
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:15,080
What about the exams for your major?

419
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,519
Don't look at me.

420
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,440
Although I like to go to art galleries,

421
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,399
but exams and appreciating art
are two different things.

422
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,519
Your books are new.

423
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:33,320
You didn't read them since
they were given to you, right?

424
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,239
You can't blame me for that.

425
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,960
There are too many words.

426
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,600
I feel sleepy when I read them.

427
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,239
If I knew, then I would've
gone to class.

428
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,200
Getting a few key points
is better than knowing nothing at all.

429
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,879
There are so many people in your class.

430
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,080
Nobody can help you?

431
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,720
I think they are struggling themselves.

432
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,840
They don't have time for me.

433
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,759
Your class monitor, Zhang Shuai.

434
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:00,999
He has good results, right?
Ask him to help you.

435
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,560
Yes, why didn't I think of him?

436
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,800
Help you revise for the exam?
No problem.

437
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,159
I know that...

438
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:12,480
I can rely on you.

439
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:14,360
Then...

440
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,360
What subject should we start from?

441
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,800
You can make the decision.

442
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:19,480
I don't know anything.

443
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,560
Okay then.

444
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,600
I'll make a study plan.

445
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
From tomorrow onwards,
we'll start with the revision.

446
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,680
I think for the next 15 days,

447
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,279
you'll have to stay in the study room.

448
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,399
I'm prepared to sleep in the study room.

449
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
Can you take leave from your company?

450
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,919
I remember that your job
is quite important.

451
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,720
If it doesn't work out,
I'll have to resign.

452
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
You want to take a 15 days leave?

453
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,519
Yes, my exams are starting soon.

454
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:50,960
And the CET-4 too.

455
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,999
So, I have to focus on revising.

456
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,440
Now that you say that,

457
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,800
I almost forgot that
you're still a student.

458
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,440
But, you're my personal assistant.

459
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,159
If you leave, what about work?

460
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,039
I know that this will delay work,

461
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,560
but I have no other way.

462
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:09,119
If I don't pass my exams this time,

463
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,879
I may be held back from graduating.

464
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,320
So, if I can't take a leave,

465
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,879
I'll have to resign.

466
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,480
What's the difference between
resigning and taking leave?

467
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,999
You can't work either way.

468
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,960
If you're busy,

469
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:25,039
why don't you hire Senior Ran Yu again?

470
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,879
You come out with good ideas.

471
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,960
Fine, don't say that I'm cruel.

472
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,999
I'll approve your leave.

473
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,080
But, you'll have to handover
your work to Wei An.

474
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,999
Thank you, chairman.

475
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,720
And,

476
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,080
the treatment may need to be delayed.

477
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:46,800
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,999
It's fine.

479
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,680
I waited for 10 years.

480
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:52,399
Half a month is nothing.

481
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
Take your exam in peace.

482
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,080
Yes, thank you Chairman.

483
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,759
This is the study plan.

484
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,480
Memorise all of them.

485
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,919
How can I memorise all of them?

486
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,320
This is only for one subject.

487
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,519
I didn't have much time,
so I only prepared these last night.

488
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,759
Oh dear, just kill me.

489
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:23,239
Why do I have to memorise
so much vocabulary for CET-4?

490
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,480
I won't finish memorising them.

491
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,440
It's useless to worry.

492
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,519
We can make last minute preparations...

493
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,999
and cram as much as we can.

494
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,999
Enough, let's start.

495
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:38,279
♪ I might lose the courage
of the sun sometimes ♪

496
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,039
♪ Even if I fall and my wings are wet ♪

497
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:50,080
♪ I'll never stop dreaming ♪

498
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,960
♪ We'll cry sometimes ♪
♪ Just like the heavy rain ♪

499
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,200
♪ I'll walk with you under the rain ♪

500
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,840
♪ We'll look at the rainbow

501
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,800
♪ And look while happiness

Wei An.

513
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,639
What's wrong?

514
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,840
Is there a problem with the document?

515
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:46,759
No.

516
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,759
How many days has it been
since Zhou Shi left?

517
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,279
About five days?

518
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,200
Just five days?

519
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,440
Why do I feel like she has been
gone for a long time?

520
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,560
Do we have anything scheduled
this afternoon?

521
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,999
No.

522
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:03,320
Great.

523
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,600
Then, go to the college with me.

524
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,320
A few days have passed.

525
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,279
But, you only memorised
the contents of two lectures.

526
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,560
If this continues,

527
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,759
you won't be able to finish memorising.

528
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,600
I did try my best to memorise.

529
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,759
I stayed up until 2 to 3 a.m.
for the past two days.

530
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:26,519
I clearly remembered it all then,

531
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,759
but I forgot everything
when I woke up in the morning.

532
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,239
It may be my problem.

533
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,999
I can't help you out anymore.

534
00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:36,159
Don't do this.

535
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,879
Sit down.

536
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,919
It's all my fault.

537
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,720
I'll memorise them all now, okay?

538
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:46,999
Let's go.

539
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,639
We'll go and visit Professor Yan.

540
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,519
What? You won't help me revise anymore?

541
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,320
Yes.

542
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,399
Professor Yan needs me for a
temporary observation project.

543
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,680
I couldn't reject him.

544
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,080
Then, what about me?

545
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,159
Why don't you ask Teacher Xiao?

546
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,919
Actually, delaying graduation
for one year is nothing serious.

547
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,200
You'll have one year to revise.

548
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,519
That way, you're more
likely to pass the exams.

549
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,200
Moreover, you have a job now.

550
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:16,680
Even if you don't have
your graduation certificate for now,

551
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,200
it won't affect you.

552
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,440
But...

553
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,919
It's my bad.

554
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:22,919
Well,

555
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,800
you can have the notes.

556
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,039
Memorise as much as you can.

557
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,080
I can only help you this much.

558
00:31:28,239 --> 00:31:29,399
I'm sorry.

559
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:34,239
No one wants to help me?

560
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:37,560
What should I do?

561
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:39,680
Miss Zhou.

562
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,039
Assistant An, why are you here?

563
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,999
I have something to do here.

564
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,440
What's wrong?
Did you run into a problem?

565
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,399
What else? Exams.

566
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,360
I think I'll be delayed from graduating.

567
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,639
Delayed from graduating?

568
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,080
Why?

569
00:32:00,239 --> 00:32:03,360
Didn't you find someone
to help you revise?

570
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,560
They are busy and
don't have time for me.

571
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,999
I know someone...

572
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,840
who majored in arts...

573
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,039
when he was studying in the States.

574
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,279
His English is good too.

575
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,960
Maybe he can be of help.

576
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,999
Of course, who is he?

577
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,200
Come in.

578
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,080
Hello, Chairman.

579
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:58,800
You've been hanging outside
the door for a long time.

580
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,399
Is it that hard to ask for my help?

581
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,039
Assistant An told you all about it?

582
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,119
Yes, he did.

583
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,239
But, I want to hear it from you.

584
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,200
Well, Chairman,

585
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,680
can you please...

586
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,239
help me revise for my major?

587
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,800
-Sure.
-Really? You agree to it?

588
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:17,440
Do you want me to reject you?

589
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:18,840
No, I didn't expect you to...

590
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,279
agree that fast.

591
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,800
Of course there is a condition.

592
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,960
From now onwards,

593
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,159
you have to obey my orders...

594
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,320
24/7 no matter what.

595
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:30,239
If you disagree or fail to do it,

596
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:32,999
the revision will
stop immediately, okay?

597
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,639
Fine, if you disagree, forget it then.
You can leave now.

598
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,840
No, I can do it...

599
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,999
Okay, we'll start tonight.

600
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,320
Come to my house tonight.

601
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,919
I'll let you experience
training from hell.

602
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,159
Hell?

603
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,279
By the way, I'll help you
with the CET-4 too.

604
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,320
What is this?

605
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,480
A test...

606
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,239
to test your level now.

607
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,919
Where did you get the questions from?

608
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,720
I set the questions myself. Okay.

609
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,480
I'll give you 20 minutes...

610
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,680
to finish this.

611
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:09,199
You can start now.

612
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,840
Five minutes have passed.

613
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,320
Eight minutes.

614
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,840
10 minutes.

615
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:59,199
Five more minutes left.

616
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,120
Five, four, three, two,

617
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,199
-one.
-Wait.

618
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,040
[CET-4]

619
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,360
-Your handwriting is terrible.
-It won't affect my marks.

620
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,439
If your handwriting can't be read,
marks will be deducted.

621
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,160
There's only half a month left, right?

622
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:47,400
If it won't work, forget it.

623
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,239
I'll just delay from graduating.

624
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,759
It's not for you to decide now.

625
00:35:53,959 --> 00:35:56,199
From today onwards, stay here.

626
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,080
I don't think you have...

627
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,719
much time to sleep.

628
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,800
Do you have to
do this just for revising?

629
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,519
Do you have to stay at his house?
It'll be more convenient for revision.

630
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,360
He lives upstairs
and you live downstairs.

631
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,039
How inconvenient can that be?

632
00:36:12,959 --> 00:36:15,279
Is he trying to use this opportunity
to get closer to you?

633
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:18,279
Maybe.

634
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,160
Why are you so calm?

635
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,039
Since he moved here,
I thought that was abnormal.

636
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,560
He has a huge mansion
but wouldn't stay there.

637
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:26,199
He insisted on living in this old house.

638
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,759
-Is he still thinking of pursuing you?
-Don't worry.

639
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,600
He wouldn't think of that.

640
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,759
That was all a misunderstanding.

641
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,999
Now, it's all resolved.

642
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,999
We're just friends.

643
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:40,360
Don't let your guard down.

644
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,519
This is a classical technique
used by men...

645
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,199
by pretending
to be the girl's best friend.

646
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,560
Moreover,

647
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,439
you have Xiao Fei now, right?

648
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,080
Aren't you worried that
he'll be jealous?

649
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,840
Why will Xiao Fei be jealous?

650
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:54,120
Don't pretend.

651
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,800
Xiao Fei told me all about you.

652
00:36:55,959 --> 00:36:57,400
He told you everything?

653
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,120
He told me to keep it a secret.

654
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,519
As if.

655
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,719
Who do you think planned the meeting?

656
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,840
If I didn't plan it well,

657
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,600
will he say it?

658
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,679
Really? Thank you.

659
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,360
Do you know how long did I wait for him?
He refused to say it.

660
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,160
You knew it already?

661
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,719
I was waiting for him to say it.

662
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,279
Fine, you knew about it.

663
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,999
I was foolish...

664
00:37:21,999 --> 00:37:23,560
not to discover anything.

665
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,640
I even fantasized.

666
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,800
It's different, since you
didn't really notice him.

667
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,199
Fine.

668
00:37:30,439 --> 00:37:31,880
I can't be compared to you.

669
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,160
This is good.

670
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,719
I thought you'll only like
Li Ming Cheng in this lifetime.

671
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,479
How can they be the same?

672
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,080
Xiao Fei...

673
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,560
has always been my idol.

674
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:50,600
No matter what, all the best to you.

675
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,439
Thank you.

676
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,279
Well, be careful of Wei Qing.

677
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,999
Don't worry,
I'm just going to revise there.

678
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,600
I'll be back after half a month.

679
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:06,880
If you miss me, come up anytime.

680
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:16,439
Where are you going?

681
00:38:17,439 --> 00:38:18,959
Your Sister Zhou Shi
is moving upstairs...

682
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,759
to live with Wei Qing.

683
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,039
Are you not going to stop her?

684
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,800
Live together?

685
00:38:23,999 --> 00:38:25,519
Don't listen to her talking nonsense.

686
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:27,279
Your senior is helping me with revision.

687
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:29,120
So, I'm staying with him.

688
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,360
But, I'll be back after half a month.

689
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,840
So,

690
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:35,640
you'll have to depend
on Sister Fei Fei to feed you.

691
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,959
Take care.

692
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,360
It's fine, I'll order delivery food.

693
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,479
-Good boy.
-What do you mean?

694
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,959
How much do you dislike my cooking?

695
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,840
I improved a lot, okay?

696
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Okay, I'll leave now.

697
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,920
Help me say goodbye to the top student.

698
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,439
Don't miss me too much.

699
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,320
Leave, no one will miss you. Go!

700
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:03,560
Well, you have a big heart.

701
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,920
Your Sister Zhou Shi
has moved upstairs...

702
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,999
to live with another man,

703
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,679
but you're still in the mood
to read a sketchbook?

704
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,160
What's wrong with that?

705
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,360
Do you trust Wei Qing or Zhou Shi?

706
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,039
I trust the both of them.

707
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,320
Fine, you're all innocent.

708
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,360
You all have big hearts, okay?

709
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,439
I am the one who think too much.

710
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:22,759
By the way, do you want supper?

711
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,160
You'll cook?

712
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,840
-Food delivery.
-Okay.

713
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,959
I...

714
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:40,479
What are you doing?

715
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,759
Disinfecting you.

716
00:39:43,439 --> 00:39:45,120
Did you clean up my room?

717
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,199
Your bed was so comfortable.

718
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,840
Will I have the same bed?

719
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,039
If you want,

720
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,759
you can sleep on my bed too.

721
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,199
Quick, bring me to my room.

722
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,679
After seeing my room,

723
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,920
I can take a shower and put on a mask...

724
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,800
before sleeping.

725
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,479
Who said you can sleep?

726
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,999
These are notes
given to me by Zhang Shuai.

727
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:10,640
See if they are useful.

728
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,800
What are you doing?

729
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,640
Don't give me...

730
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,360
useless rubbish like these anymore.

731
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:28,519
How are these useless?

732
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:30,600
What did you remember
after memorising them for a few days?

733
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,999
I...

734
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,840
How did you know
I memorised them for a few days?

735
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,120
We don't have much time
to complete this mission.

736
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,360
The traditional way of learning...

737
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,800
isn't useful for you anymore.

738
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,999
I plan to...

739
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,719
show you all the exam questions...

740
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:45,920
and circle key points.

741
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:47,400
Even if you don't understand them,

742
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,920
you must memorise them.

743
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,880
Then,

744
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:52,640
I'll guide you to create
a framework of every subject.

745
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,039
After that, you'll know how
the questions will be asked.

746
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,519
Lastly, we'll practise your
adaptive response to stress.

747
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,279
What are you thinking about?

748
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,080
What?

749
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,600
Don't tell me you didn't hear
what I was talking about?

750
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,640
I did.

751
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:10,160
Repeat what I said.

752
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,519
Something about response...

753
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,800
and something about
how the questions?

754
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:17,759
I'm sorry.

755
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,560
I didn't pay attention.

756
00:41:19,759 --> 00:41:23,199
Can you explain again, Chairman?

757
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,679
Teacher Wei.

758
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,759
I said, I'll show you
all the exam questions...

759
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:34,080
and create a framework.

760
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,600
Lastly, we'll practise
your adaptive response to stress.

761
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,400
What's adaptive response to stress?

762
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,640
To make it simple,
it's like training a dog.

763
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,719
You'll have to do 20 sets
of questions per day...

764
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,479
until you throw up.

765
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,320
You don't have to remember
with your brain,

766
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,039
but instead remember it with your body.

767
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,160
Once you see the questions,

768
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,920
you'll be able to write
the answers out immediately.

769
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,199
Do you have to be so cruel?

770
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Do you know how a circus trains a tiger?

771
00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:00,999
By hitting it?

772
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,679
By starving them.
