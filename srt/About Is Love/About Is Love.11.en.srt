[Episode 11]

29
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,399
This is a cheque.

30
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,879
Write whatever amount you like.
After that, be my girlfriend.

31
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,519
Go back and take your time.

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,039
Wait.

33
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,920
I'll return the money to you.
I'll do it even if it'll cost me.

34
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,679
It's impossible that
I'll agree to your terms!

35
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
Chairman, she...

36
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,560
I want to see...

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,519
how long can she endure it.

38
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,239
Who is Wang Yu Qi?

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,119
Please come with me.

40
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,119
Well, this is awkward.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,280
Your bag looks quite nice.

42
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,160
My boyfriend gave it to me.

43
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,720
This hasn't been sold yet in China.

44
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,720
Where did you boyfriend get it from?

45
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,679
Paris, Milan, Hong Kong...

46
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,280
or Vancouver?

47
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,399
I don't know where he bought it from.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,879
But if you...

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,920
suspect that you've bought a fake one,

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,720
I can help you check.

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,599
After all, there are too many fakes...

52
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,119
on the market nowadays.

53
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,280
Are you kidding me?

54
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,319
I bought it through standard channels.

55
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,759
Is that so?

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
Do you have the receipt?

57
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,000
Have you checked the serial number?

58
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,879
The letter on the authentic bag
has a deeper impression.

59
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,959
And the hardware is shiner.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,080
It won't be as crude as a fake one.

61
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,519
Besides, the biggest feature
of this bag is,

62
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,599
you can only open it with two hands.

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,440
You can't open it single-handedly.

64
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
How is it? Do you want me
to check it for you?

65
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,200
I have no time for that.

66
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,319
It's indeed a fake.

67
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,920
That's why you lack confidence.

68
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,119
Patek Philippe? Is she for real?

69
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,600
Tina.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,959
Who is that girl in pink?

71
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,079
She is Lin Fei Fei. She graduated
from Guanghua Vision University.

72
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,280
She worked as a model
in some exhibitions before.

73
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,079
She has some experiences in fashion.

74
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,959
But compared to other candidates,
I think she is not professional enough.

75
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,919
Everybody starts from zero.

76
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,880
But it's all about having potential.

77
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,320
That watch is an antique, right?

78
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,399
I think Chairman Wei from
Yun Ma has one of it.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,519
What background does this girl have?

80
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,079
This is getting interesting.

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,040
No need to interview?

82
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:15,720
Yes. Our chief editor has read
about your information.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,399
He thinks you are suitable for this job.

84
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,720
-If this is the case...
-You are hired.

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,040
We have a shooting plan next week.
And back and wait for our notice.

86
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,160
Thank you. I will treasure
this opportunity well.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,160
This is a good watch.
Is it from your boyfriend?

88
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,600
Alright. Go back and
wait for our notice.

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
Alright. Thank you.
I'll be leaving now. Bye.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,600
-Bye.
-Bye.

91
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,119
Wei Qing.

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,760
Since you are giving me a new toy,

93
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,919
I will definitely live up
to your generosity.

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Xi Xi.

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,760
Director Sheng is looking for you.

96
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,440
-I'll go now.
-Alright.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,320
Chairman Sheng. Can you say that again?

98
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,239
Maybe I didn't hear it
correctly just now.

99
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,519
Xi Xi. I know it's hard
for you to accept it.

100
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,320
But somebody has taken over your place.

101
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,639
She'll be a full-time waitress and
has a more stable working hour.

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,320
You know this too.
Our bar is not that big.

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,160
And we don't need that many people.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,519
But before this, you told me that
you need more workers.

105
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,560
You even asked me to
work in the morning.

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Time is different now.

107
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,480
A bar is all about connections.

108
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,399
It's not up to us to decide
the people who'll be working here.

109
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,239
Xi Xi. It's not that
I don't want to help you.

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,919
But I'm working under others too.

111
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,720
I have no choice.

112
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,840
Wei Qing did this, right?

113
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,440
Xi Xi.

114
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,160
There is something that
I have to tell you.

115
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,919
It's normal for a girl to have a temper.

116
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,399
But look at who your partner is.

117
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,480
You can't just offend a God of Wealth.

118
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
You are still young.

119
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,639
You need to know when to yield.

120
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,519
Wait.

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,519
I'll return the money to you.
I'll do it even if it'll cost me a lot.

122
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,079
It's impossible that
I'll agree to your terms!

123
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,880
Understood.

124
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:38,239
It's good that you know.
Looks like you are...

125
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,959
a girl who knows how to be flexible.

126
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,199
Thank you for your care.

127
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:43,919
We'll do it this way.

128
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,840
Go back first.

129
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,679
I'll ask someone to transfer...

130
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,760
you your pay for these few days.

131
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,359
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

132
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:04,959
Where are you looking at?

133
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:06,679
Zhou Shi?

134
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
Chairman He? Why are you here?

135
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,239
Why are you here?

136
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,040
Xi Xi. How did you offend Chairman He?

137
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Xi Xi?

138
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,519
Stop right there!

139
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,560
Chairman He. I'm sorry.

140
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,880
She is a temporary worker.

141
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,919
I just fired her.

142
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,720
She has been working for you?

143
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,519
She has worked here for a few months.

144
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,879
Do you know who she is?

145
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,120
How would I know?

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,480
She is Wei Qing's girlfriend.

147
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,160
Impossible.

148
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,800
More accurately, his ex-girlfriend.

149
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Ex-girlfriend?

150
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,759
No wonder he asked me to fire her.

151
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,680
Wei Qing asked you to fire her?

152
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,999
So interesting.

153
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,280
My nephew is so heartless.

154
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:01,759
Now that he has a new girlfriend,
he's so ruthless to his old girlfriend.

155
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,800
That's right.

156
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,399
Well, Chairman Wei has
that kind of qualification.

157
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,319
For people like us who
work for Chairman Wei,

158
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,879
we can only follow orders.

159
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:14,120
-It's the same for me.
-Chairman He.

160
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:17,399
You can't say that.
Let's not talk about this today.

161
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:20,559
Today, let me introduce you to some
young and pretty ladies.

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,999
Let's go.

163
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,519
You want to wipe me out?

164
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I don't believe that...

165
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:28,759
I won't be able to find
other jobs by myself.

166
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,040
Come. Let's sing karaoke today.

167
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
I never thought that Wei Qing
can be so generous.

168
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,399
Of course.

169
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
He is the boss of a huge company.

170
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:40,439
This is nothing to him.

171
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,519
He can earn it back within
a cup of coffee's time.

172
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
But this Wei Qing is so strange.

173
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,120
He already settles her debt. But why
did he ask us to continue harass her?

174
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,160
You won't understand.

175
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:51,519
Wei Qing wants us to
give that girl a fright.

176
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,680
So, when he pays the debt for her,

177
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,280
that lady will be so grateful to him.

178
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,959
Then, Wei Qing will be able
to do whatever he wants.

179
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,199
Where is my bag?

180
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,759
Miss Zhou. Your bag.

181
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,519
I was so worried. Thank you.

182
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,079
Haven't you heard that it's hard to
become frugal when accustomed to luxury?

183
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,720
When she is used to extravagance,

184
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,160
do you think she can still
revert back to her old life?

185
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,199
Write whatever amount you like.
After that, be my girlfriend.

186
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,120
Rich people have so many
tricks up their sleeves.

187
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,079
That's right.

188
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:26,680
So, I think we've done a good thing.

189
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,040
That's right. He'll have to
invite us to his wedding.

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,840
Let's go.

191
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,079
Oh my goodness!

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,879
Tell me. What is happening here?

193
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,199
It's Wei Qing.

194
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,559
-He told you himself?
-Impossible that he'll meet us.

195
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,280
It's his assistant.

196
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,959
-That's right.
-Mr. Zhou owes you money, right?

197
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,600
Yes. Why is it?

198
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,280
I think this should be enough.

199
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,959
It's more than enough.

200
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,519
The debt is paid off.

201
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,040
But I still need you
to do something for me.

202
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:06,759
-Tell us.
-Go to their house to collect the debt.

203
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,319
-But you already pay the debt.
-That's right.

204
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,160
Just do as I say.

205
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,600
Don't ask so many questions.

206
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,280
-Alright. No problem.
-This is the address.

207
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,120
Listen to me carefully.

208
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,120
You are only allowed to scare her,
you can't hurt anybody.

209
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,600
And you can only go to their house once.

210
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
After that, don't harass them anymore.

211
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,360
If Mr. Zhou borrows money
from you again,

212
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,360
don't lend it to him.

213
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:39,439
When the time comes, Mr. Zhou's...

214
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,399
daughter will pay you
another sum of money.

215
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,240
Think of it as fees for your hard work.

216
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,559
Understood. We only care about money.

217
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,079
We don't care about the rest.

218
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,999
Besides, our discussion today...

219
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,319
has to be kept among
the three of us only.

220
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,999
After you are done,

221
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,240
send a message to this phone.

222
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,600
Alright. I'll send a message to you
after I'm done with the task.

223
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,879
That is what happened. That's all.

224
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:05,600
We are just taking money from others...

225
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,160
to help them solve their problem.

226
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
-That's right.
-Brother.

227
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,240
How did you know he's the assistant?

228
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:11,879
I saw it in the news.

229
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,759
He always comes forward on
Wei Qing's behalf.

230
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:16,439
Besides, you've been in the headlines
for the past few days.

231
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,959
So, after my reasoning...

232
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,600
Since you already got the money,
stop harassing my mother, understand?

233
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,319
Understood! I won't harass her again!

234
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:25,120
Get lost!

235
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,999
-Let's go!
-Get lost!

236
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,879
Wei Qing. I'll fight you to the end!

237
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:38,680
The full design line for the new
season's main series is complete.

238
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,480
Now, they are rushing to produce
the first batch of samples.

239
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:44,879
Because this is a cross-industry
collaboration with new artist, Xun Ran,

240
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,920
we've attracted a lot of
the media's attention.

241
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,999
So, the new products will be launched
during Xun Ran's art exhibition.

242
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,079
Wei Qing! Come out!

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,559
Please have a rest first.

244
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,160
-Go and take a look.
-Alright.

245
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,639
Wei Qing, you scoundrel!
Come out if you are a man!

246
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Miss Zhou, Chairman Wei is in a meeting.
You can't scream here.

247
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I want to scream.

248
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,519
Come out now! I know you are in there!

249
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,519
Miss Zhou. Chairman Wei is in a meeting.

250
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:22,879
Who else?

251
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,680
Miss Zhou. Chairman Wei
is waiting for you inside.

252
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,079
You are screaming outside
so early in the morning.

253
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,079
-What is it?
-Stop pretending.

254
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,959
You sent the debt collectors
to my house, right?

255
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,439
-Yes.
-I already told you. You can attack me.

256
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,040
But don't harass my family.

257
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:49,600
Why did you do that?

258
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,519
I'm the one who sent them.

259
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,120
But your father is the one
who borrowed the money.

260
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,999
I already pay the debt for him.
I sent someone to give him a scare...

261
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,199
so that he won't do it again.
Is it that wrong?

262
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:05,999
I don't care if you want to scare him.

263
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,199
But you already hurt my mother.

264
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,840
Do you know how scared she was
for the past few days?

265
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,399
This is my mistake.

266
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,519
I'll personally apologise to her now.

267
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,920
-Wei An, ready the car.
-Don't do this!

268
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,600
Wei Qing. When did I offend you?

269
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,999
Why would you do this to me?

270
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,920
If you could just agree
to be my girlfriend,

271
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,680
these things wouldn't have happened.

272
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,399
I have no other way.

273
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,999
-I like you too much.
-Don't come near me!

274
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,199
Let me tell you.
I won't believe in you again.

275
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,800
From the antiques before this
until the debt now.

276
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,559
And you've destroyed all my jobs.

277
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:39,480
Everything is planned by you.

278
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,240
No. From the moment I got...

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,280
Yun Ma's scholarship,

280
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,040
I had already fallen into your trap.

281
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:47,639
You are too scary.

282
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:50,480
What is your reason
for planning all of these?

283
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,720
To own you.

284
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,759
I'll give you one last warning.

285
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,240
Stop harassing me.

286
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,040
And stop harassing my family.

287
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,439
I'll transfer the money
to you every month.

288
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,559
I don't want to see you again.

289
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:02,720
Zhou Shi.

290
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,999
I won't give up.

291
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,399
Be my girlfriend.

292
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,999
It'll be good for you and for me.

293
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,680
Think about it.

294
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,199
Miss Zhou.

295
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,280
So, you'll get scared too.

296
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,600
Stay away from me if you are afraid.

297
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:29,639
Or else, I can't promise that
I won't hit you.

298
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,280
Teacher Xiao.

299
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,079
Come to my office.

300
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,519
Alright.

301
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,319
Zhou Shi. You haven't paid for...

302
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:06,800
this year's schooling fees?

303
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,759
We already received notice from
Financial Department.

304
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,439
They are asking those who
haven't paid to do so.

305
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,199
There are quite a few from our class.

306
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,800
It'll be troublesome if you lose
your credits in the end.

307
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,720
Don't delay it anymore.

308
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,439
Alright, teacher.

309
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,280
Sorry for troubling you.

310
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,240
I'll pay up as soon as I got the money.

311
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,240
You can leave now.

312
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,079
How am I going to pay?

313
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,439
I don't know how long I have to
wait until I get the money.

314
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,759
I'm too unlucky lately.

315
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
Why did bad things happen
one after another to me?

316
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,240
Goad, can't you at least give me
a chance to live?

317
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,199
Director Sheng?

318
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,279
You want to introduce me
to a part-time job?

319
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,439
I can do it no matter how hard it'll be.

320
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,079
Alright. I'll come right away.

321
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:21,959
You are Xi Xi?

322
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,840
You have quite a good image.

323
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,799
I've heard about you.

324
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,079
Don't worry. Others are
scared about Wei Qing.

325
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,240
But not me.

326
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,079
And our hourly salary here is the
highest among other peers the industry.

327
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,279
You've came to the
right place to work.

328
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
That's great. When can I start?

329
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,000
Calm down. Let me find someone
to get you changed into...

330
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,520
something more beautiful.

331
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,079
You have great assets. Don't waste them.

332
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,679
No need. I can just wear
the waitress costume.

333
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,959
After all, I'm just serving
the drinks outside.

334
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,840
You'll get more tips by going into
the private room.

335
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,959
The clients we have...

336
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:05,000
are very generous.

337
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,120
With the tips together with
commission from the drinks,

338
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,640
you'll earn more than
standing outside for a month.

339
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,400
You lack money, right?

340
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,240
This is a rare chance.

341
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,799
Grab your chance.

342
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,520
Think about it. Don't reject
the way to earn money.

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,760
100 per cup.
Are you going to drink it or not?

344
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:32,039
But I really can't drink.

345
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,959
These will all be yours
if you finish them.

346
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,880
Do you want to get this money?

347
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,279
-Drink it!
-Drink it!

348
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,000
Quick. Drink it.

349
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:43,559
Drink it and these will be yours.

350
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Really. They'll be yours.

351
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,799
-Drink it!
-Drink it!

352
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:58,880
-Drink it!
-Drink it!

353
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,079
-Drink it!
-Drink it!

354
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,360
-Drink it!
-Drink it!

355
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,250
[Your ex-girlfriend is quite a drinker.]

356
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,480
Where are you?

357
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:51,199
Why are you here?

358
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,120
You forgot the passcode again?

359
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,199
I'm waiting for Sister Zhou Shi.

360
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,480
Your Sister Zhou Shi
found a new part-time.

361
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,919
I think she'll be quite late.

362
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,400
Come back to the house first.

363
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,199
Why is you hand so cold?

364
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,120
Are you sick?

365
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,319
You are burning up. Come,
get into the house with me.

366
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,240
Let's go.

367
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,840
38.9 degree?

368
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:31,079
-I'm fine.
-No, you are not. Lie down properly.

369
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,000
Or else, I'll call your Sister Zhou Shi,

370
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,159
One thing conquers another.

371
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,559
Lie down properly.
I'll call your Sister Zhou Shi now.

372
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:53,600
What are you doing, Zhou Shi?

373
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,199
Where are you going?

374
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,679
-To look for Sister Zhou Shi.
-Come back.

375
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,600
All of you are so worrisome.

376
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,720
-Great!
-Great!

377
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,480
You can hold your liquor well.

378
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,120
As long as you are happy.

379
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,679
Because you've served us well,

380
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,760
tonight, I'll buy the most
expensive liquor here, alright?

381
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,600
-Great!
-Great!

382
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,720
Please wait. I'll get you the liquor.

383
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,039
Don't go.
Let's play something thrilling.

384
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
You are a pro.

385
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:43,720
300 for this glass.

386
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:45,799
Are you going to do it?

387
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,159
-500!
-Alright!

388
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,279
-It'll be 500 then!
-I accept your price!

389
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,480
Will your money be enough?

390
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,559
If you drink without restriction,

391
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,240
you can have as much
money and liquor that you want.

392
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,279
Let go of me! Don't disturb me
from earning money!

393
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,959
-Let go of me!
-Chairman Wei.

394
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,319
Why are you here?

395
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,159
Let go of me. Don't disturb me
from earning money!

396
00:22:25,439 --> 00:22:27,439
-If you want to drink, drink with me.
-Let go.

397
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,520
I'll pay you.

398
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:32,400
My money!

399
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:54,520
I really don't understand you.

400
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,159
You don't want the cheque I gave.

401
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,279
But you drank until you vomit like this
for just some hundreds Yuan.

402
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,039
Is this the pride you want?

403
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,720
That's right.
Laugh at me however you want.

404
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:05,799
You are here to laugh at me anyway.

405
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,079
I'm here to help.

406
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,720
Thank you.

407
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,959
But I'll be grateful already
if you don't harm me.

408
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,600
Right. I haven't taken that money.

409
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,720
It's all your fault for making me
drink for nothing.

410
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,679
I'll give you the money.

411
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,880
I don't want your money!

412
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,319
I have such bad luck.

413
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,319
Anything else? If not, I'm leaving now.

414
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:45,439
Looks like I won't be able
to work here as well.

415
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:49,039
Why is he everywhere?

416
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,279
I'm so unlucky.

417
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,919
Are you going to oppose me too?

418
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
Director Chen.

419
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,799
Why are you here?

420
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,880
I should be the one to ask you this.

421
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,079
Isn't this the female changing room?

422
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,240
Female changing room?

423
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,279
I'm sorry.

424
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:51,319
I've gotten it wrongly.

425
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,840
I'll leave now.

426
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,360
Director Chen.

427
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,159
Can you go out first?

428
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,439
You can come in after
I wear my clothes.

429
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,959
No need to wear.
It'll be easier like this.

430
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,439
Don't come near me.

431
00:25:15,959 --> 00:25:17,159
Don't come near me.

432
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,439
Why did you drink so much?

433
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:25,120
-Look at your face.
-Don't touch me! Go away!

434
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:26,840
Go away.

435
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,720
-You have quite the temper.
-Go away.

436
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,840
Did Wei Qing dump you...

437
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,720
because of this?

438
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,640
It's alright.

439
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,799
I like that.

440
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,480
Let go of me!

441
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,679
Don't move.

442
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,000
-Don't come near me.
-You want to run?

443
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,840
Don't come near me.

444
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,000
Don't come near me.

445
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,919
-Chairman Wei.
-You dare touch my woman?

446
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,240
I thought you broke up?

447
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,000
She'll still be my woman
as long as I say so.

448
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,439
You've dirtied my gloves.

449
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,679
-I don't want this!
-You want to let him look his fill?

450
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,319
Let go of me.

451
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:49,279
-Let go of me!
-Stop your racket!

452
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
My racket?

453
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,240
You almost got sexually assaulted.
Do you know that?

454
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,760
-If it wasn't because of me...
-If it wasn't because of you,

455
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,439
I would still be doing my part-time
in Director Sheng's bar.

456
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,799
If it wasn't because of you,

457
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,760
I wouldn't have hundreds of thousands
of debt without reason.

458
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,559
If it wasn't because of you,

459
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,240
I wouldn't be the talk
of the university.

460
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
Until now, they still thought that I'm
a pitiful lady who got dumped by you.

461
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,679
It was my mistake in the past.
I'll apologise to you.

462
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,120
Apology again.

463
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,439
Is this your new tactic?

464
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,279
Then, should I forgive you...

465
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,480
and crawl deeper into your trap?

466
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,199
I'm really sincere this time.

467
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,120
Do you think I'll believe you again?

468
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
Do you think I'll dare
believe in you again?

469
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,600
Wait.

470
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:34,720
How do you know I'm here?

471
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,520
Today is my first day working here.

472
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,400
Is this another one of your plots?

473
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,439
Trying to be heroic?

474
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,079
You think too much.

475
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,600
I think too little.

476
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,679
I've underestimated you.

477
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
That's why I trust you again and again.

478
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
Because I think too little,

479
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
I've treated you as a friend!

480
00:27:55,439 --> 00:27:57,480
I really treat you as my friend.

481
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Is this how you treat your friend?

482
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:03,480
You'll be smiling one second...

483
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,720
and then plotting against me
in the next.

484
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,240
As your friend,

485
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,120
do I have to be on guard all the time...

486
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:12,199
to fight a battle of wits with you?

487
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,039
I can never tell what cunning scheme...

488
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,120
you'll have behind your smile.

489
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,880
Your plot is too deep.
I can't win against you.

490
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,720
I beg you. Please let go of me!

491
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,039
Forget all the things
that happened before.

492
00:28:25,199 --> 00:28:27,199
If you want to work, come to Yun Ma.

493
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,279
Can't you understand a word I say?

494
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,159
I don't want to see you forever.
I don't want to see you anymore!

495
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,600
Let go of me!

496
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,439
Why are you here?

497
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,799
You know her?

498
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,279
Xiao Fei. Let's go.

499
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,279
Let's go.

500
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,919
Wait.

501
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,600
You can't leave.

502
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,919
What rights do you have
to bring her away?

503
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,400
Move aside.

504
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,520
You can't leave.

505
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,880
Are you alright?

506
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,439
Fei Fei, I want to go home.

507
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,959
Come. Let's go home.

508
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,640
Xiao Fei. Get her home first.

509
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
What do you want?

510
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,039
You already hurt her like this.
Why won't you let her go?

511
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
I just want her to be my girlfriend.

512
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,559
You want that? What about her feelings?

513
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,919
Are you being spoiled by women?
Do you think that by giving money,

514
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,439
everybody will listen to you?

515
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,400
Yes. There are some who likes money.
For example, me.

516
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,679
But not Zhou Shi.

517
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,039
She needs money too.

518
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,480
But she needs respect as well.

519
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,400
If you really want to pursue her,

520
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,559
Get down from your high horse...

521
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,199
and think for her.

522
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,319
Of course.

523
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,720
I hope that you'll stay away from her
and don't hurt her again.

524
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:56,840
That's it. I'm done talking.

525
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,799
Let me warn you. Don't follow us.

526
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Wait.

527
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,079
What is it?

528
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Help me apologise to her.

529
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,959
By the way,
I already oiled up your watch.

530
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,360
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

531
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,520
COD.

532
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,000
♪The "us" that I yearn of.♪

533
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,600
♪I was the only serious one.♪

534
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,520
♪The "us" that I yearn of.♪

535
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,959
Do you really need to drink that much?

536
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:33,679
Xiao Fei!

537
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,480
Xiao Fei. Are you alright?

538
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,120
Don't scare me, Xiao Fei!

539
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,319
I have to take care of
two patients in one night.

540
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm the epitome of women.

541
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,559
Why is the study-tyrant not here?

542
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,520
What should I do? He's burning up.
Do I need to send him to the hospital?

543
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,640
The one who knows how to
take care of others is down.

544
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,799
So troublesome.

545
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,279
I'm cold.

546
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,240
-I'm cold.
-You are awake?

547
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,400
How do you feel? Is it bad?

548
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,240
Let me get you to the hospital.

549
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,039
I won't go. I beg you.
Please don't chase me away.

550
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,679
I promise that I won't
trouble you again.

551
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,360
I won't fight with you anymore.
I won't do it again.

552
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,279
Please don't chase me away.

553
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,959
Don't worry. Nobody is chasing you away.

554
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,559
This is your home.

555
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,319
I won't go anywhere.
I'll accompany you here.

556
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,959
You should sleep now.

557
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,159
You'll recover when you wake up.

558
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,159
Be a good boy.

559
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,319
He's not good with these...

560
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,480
but he purposely cleans up everything.

561
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,240
He is scared that people
will notice his existence.

562
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:55,840
He is scared to trouble others.

563
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,880
Don't you think
he's living too carefully?

564
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,039
Do you think he's being
so careful because he's...

565
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:01,480
not used to staying with others?

566
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,559
No. I think it's the opposite.

567
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,959
Maybe he has...

568
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,240
always been living
under another's roof.

569
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,279
What has he gone through?

570
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,880
Is this how you treat your friend?

571
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:39,760
You'll be smiling one second...

572
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,959
and then plotting against me
in the next.

573
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,439
As your friend,

574
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,319
do I have to be on guard all the time...

575
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,319
to fight a battle of wits with you?

576
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:51,279
I can never tell what cunning scheme...

577
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,279
you'll have behind your smile.

578
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,760
Your plot is too deep.
I can't win against you.

579
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,679
I beg you. Please let go of me!

580
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:16,439
-You are here.
-Why are you sleeping here?

581
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:18,760
I don't want to go back.

582
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,720
I'll be alone too even if I go back.

583
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:22,400
I can't sleep too even if I go back.

584
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,439
And I'll have nightmares.

585
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,919
When is the company's shareholder
meeting for this afternoon?

586
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,240
Two o'clock.

587
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,840
Chairman He is already back.

588
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,279
She will join the shareholder meeting
this afternoon too.

589
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,000
I've read the company's
monthly quarterly report last night.

590
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,760
As expected,

591
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,480
everything is in deficit.

592
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,039
My mother is a genius in dragging
the company's performance down.

593
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,120
Our company's annual report
has yet to be finalised.

594
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,480
I think we still have other ways
to save the situation.

595
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,039
I hope so.

596
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:52,679
By the way,

597
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,559
get me the company's
monthly reports later.

598
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,360
I want all of last year's report.

599
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,679
Do you need the company's accountants?

600
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,439
No. I trust only you.

601
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:07,559
Alright.

602
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,160
Wei An.

603
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,600
Am I a very selfish person?

604
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,999
If you keep quiet,
it means you agree.

605
00:34:21,279 --> 00:34:23,999
You are just socially awkward.

606
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,600
Socially awkward?

607
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,559
You really know how
to find an excuse for me.

608
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,319
Looks like I'm really
spoiled by all of you.

609
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:35,360
Is it because of Miss Zhou?

610
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,600
Besides her,

611
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,640
who else can make me so anxious?

612
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,600
Looks like I really did wrong this time.

613
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,200
Maybe she'll not forgive me forever.

614
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
I don't think she is someone so petty.

615
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,840
If you apologise sincerely,

616
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,880
she will forgive you.

617
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,360
But no matter what I say now,

618
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,160
she'll think that I'm lying to her.

619
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,360
Even if I give her my sincerity,

620
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:58,239
she'll see it as ill intent.

621
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,519
Are you really sincere?

622
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:03,640
Yes.

623
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:05,759
It's good then.

624
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,960
She is a very naive person.

625
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,519
We were too impatient before this.

626
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,840
So, we made her loses her trust in us.

627
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:16,479
You need to take
the initiative to apologise.

628
00:35:16,759 --> 00:35:18,279
No matter she accepts it or not,

629
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,799
you have to at least
show your sincerity.

630
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,680
And then, we'll find other ways
to save this situation.

631
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,840
We need to stand from her point of view.

632
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,200
We need to help her solve
her real problem.

633
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,719
Her problem is the lack of money.

634
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,200
But she doesn't want my money.

635
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:37,640
It won't be a problem if
it can be solved with money.

636
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:41,960
If you really want to gain her trust,

637
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,559
then you need to fix...

638
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,519
her problem that she can't solve
even with money.

639
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,039
What problem is that?

640
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,479
About that...

641
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,239
I don't know it yet.

642
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,559
Then it's pointless.

643
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,160
Are you cats?

644
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,079
Your recovery rate is shocking.

645
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,039
Of course. We won't beak.

646
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,999
Enough. Stop acting cute. Eat up.

647
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:18,239
Zhou Shi.

648
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,640
Have you thought about your next step?

649
00:36:22,479 --> 00:36:23,920
I'll continue to find part-time job.

650
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:25,920
But I won't go to a bar anymore.

651
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,680
I can work in a convenience store
or a fast food restaurant.

652
00:36:28,999 --> 00:36:30,600
Just that the pay is lesser.

653
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,120
What are you doing?

654
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:42,600
-What is this?
-A job.

655
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,319
He Yun?

656
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,079
Madam He?

657
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,039
-I thought she went overseas.
-She came back.

658
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,999
Brat. Why didn't you introduce
the job to her earlier?

659
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,600
I forgot.

660
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,960
Thank you, Xiao Fei.

661
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,999
The company's monthly deficit
is so serious.

662
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,279
But I can't even find
a single mistake in the report.

663
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:20,559
You suspect a problem with the account?

664
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,840
You know my mother.
She is an artist to the core.

665
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,680
She has the business mind of a baby.

666
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,039
With her alone, she won't be able to...

667
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,120
make a report that
has no mistake at all.

668
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:32,719
I suspect that there's
an instigator behind her.

669
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,400
The head office allocates
a huge sum of money to her every year.

670
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,239
Where had she been spending it?

671
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,840
Where did she go while
she was in America?

672
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,920
Beside some art exhibitions
in Boston and New York...

673
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,840
and a meeting with the local artists,

674
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:53,600
she spent the rest of her time in
the old manor at Philadelphia.

675
00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:54,920
The old manor at Philadelphia?

676
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:00,279
I remember that the villa there
has been abandoned for a long time.

677
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:03,039
Now, I don't even have
a single memory about it.

678
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,719
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

679
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,719
The company had so many deficits
for the first half of the year.

680
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:27,319
And she still has the mood
to open up a new gallery.

681
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,920
What is she thinking?

682
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,719
I think it's here.

683
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,960
Miss Xue?

684
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,759
Who are you looking for?

685
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,920
I'm here to apply for a job.

686
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,319
Yes, name card.

687
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,559
Xiao Fei is the one who
recommended me to come here.

688
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:32,360
He said that you are
looking for a part-timer.

689
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,120
You are Xiao Fei's friend?

690
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,200
You are right on time.

691
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,640
Some paintings just came in just now.

692
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,960
Let's take a look together.

693
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,600
Xun Ran?

694
00:39:53,799 --> 00:39:55,120
Am I seeing this correctly?

695
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,559
This is really his Starry Sky series.

696
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:01,279
This is the first time I've seen
his paintings so closely.

697
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,400
Moreover, these are
his larger art works.

698
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,039
The price must be over the roof.

699
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:10,039
These are not for sale.

700
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,880
These are his latest works.

701
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:14,960
His drawing techniques...

702
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,960
are the most matured here
amongst all his other works.

703
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:22,759
In terms of business value,

704
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,400
it's indeed impressive.

705
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,600
Unfortunately,

706
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,960
Xun Ran really dislike...

707
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,559
the "business value" phrase.

708
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,440
I'm sorry.

709
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,719
I've spoken out of thought.

710
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,079
How can the value of an artwork
be measured by money?

711
00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:44,039
My words are too disrespectful
for the creator.

712
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:45,719
You are wrong.

713
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,640
Only artworks that can be
measured by money...

714
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,479
have the value to be exhibited.

715
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,719
Is that so?

716
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,880
For normal people,

717
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,600
art might be very abstract to them.

718
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,160
But the feeling of liking it is real.

719
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:07,079
So, to put a price to this "liking'...

720
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,039
and increase the business value
of the artworks...

721
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,319
are the purposes of our existence.

722
00:41:16,479 --> 00:41:17,360
The feeling of "liking"...

723
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:19,960
is very expensive.

724
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,840
A child can't understand...

725
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,759
this theory of the adults yet.

726
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,840
You'll understand that
when you meet him.

727
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,239
Compared to a high price,

728
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
he would rather sell his artworks...

729
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:38,279
to someone who really likes him.

730
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,559
Xun Ran is a child?

731
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:43,960
You don't know?

732
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:46,759
How old are you?

733
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,279
Twenty.

734
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:51,479
Then, he is younger than you.

735
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,200
Xiao Fei didn't tell you about it?

736
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,640
Xiao Fei?

737
00:41:58,279 --> 00:41:59,719
He knows Xun Ran too?
