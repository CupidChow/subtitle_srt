They started out as rich guys.

143
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,680
It's common for them
to buy expensive things.

144

That accounts for your

So do you have a plan for next month?

153

to me. They can last for some time.

Of course. What's with that question?

159
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,879
He sent food to you when you're hungry.

160
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,280
He gave you a watch
when your phone is broken.

161
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,759
Isn't this too much of a coincidence?

162
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,360
You must be careful.

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,759
Be careful of what?

164

Just like the girls that he chased
with his money before you.

167
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,319
Don't group us together!

168
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,199
I didn't take his gifts.

169
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:14,240
You didn't?

170
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,399
How do you explain the things
that he gave to you?

171
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,240
My wages aren't out yet.

172
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,840
I'll return them immediately
when I get it.

173
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,360
Let me tell you a story.

174
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,600
In the past,

175
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,439
your senior, the ex-girlfriend
of Wei Qing, said the same thing.

176
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,399
But after she became
Wei Qing's girlfriend,

177
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
she became a materialistic woman.

178
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,040
Can you guess the results?

179
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,040
Wei Qing dumped her within one month.

180
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,399
After he dumped her,
the girl was not happy with it.

181
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,079
She wanted to kill herself for it.

182
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,639
But in the end, she still got dumped.

183
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,079
And then?

184
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,639
Have you ever heard of this?

185
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:48,079
It's easier to go from rags to riches
than riches to rags.

186
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,519
When she's used to being rich,
she can't go back anymore.

187
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
This is more complicated than it looks.

188
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,240
If you want to be with him,

189
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,199
just ignore my advice.

190
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,999
If you don't want to
be involved with him,

191
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:03,840
you better don't accept
the things he gave you.

192
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,160
Think about this carefully.

193
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,480
I only thought about myself
when I ate them.

194
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,840
Now I forgot everything that I've ate.

195
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,280
How can I return this to him?

196
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,879
Never mind that.
I'll return this watch to him tomorrow.

197
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,439
How's your progress?

198
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,600
I've settled everything.
They're almost there already.

199
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,240
Good job.

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,240
But they must not create any troubles.

201
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:10,959
I've ordered them already.
They will be in check.

202
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,199
But,

203
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,519
I think this is risky.

204
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,559
I know.

205
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,519
But I don't want to follow her rhythm.

206
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,480
I want to let her know that
I'm in charge of this game.

207
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,720
What if she finds out the truth?

208
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,759
I can just apologise to her.

209
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,079
Chairman, Miss Zhou Shi
wanted to see you.

210
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:51,759
Ask her to come to my office.

211
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,959
Ask her to go to his office.

212
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,160
Okay.

213
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,720
The chairman asked you
to go to his office.

214
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
Can't I go to the meeting room?

215
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,519
I'll leave after I give him this.

216
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,120
No can do. Do you need
assistance to the lift?

217
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,079
No thanks. I'll find it out myself.

218
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,639
This is for you.

219
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,759
-What is this?
-Your house.

220
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:18,280
I mean your watch.

221
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,800
I'm not in a hurry to use it.
You can use it first.

222
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,519
No thanks. It's too expensive for me.

223
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,120
If I accidentally scratch it
or damage it,

224
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
I can't pay for the fees.

225
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,680
Please inspect the watch.

226
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,079
Anything else is invalid
after this offer.

227
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,879
Why did you wrap it up?

228
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,399
It's safer this way.

229
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,840
Is there anything else?

230
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,879
What is this?

231
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,319
I've finished the food that
you've sent to me.

232
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:53,720
This is the money for them.

233
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,600
I can't remember how much I've eaten,

234
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,959
but please count them.

235
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,759
If this is not enough,
I'll give you the rest later.

236
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,079
Aren't we friends?

237
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,600
Do we need to do this
if we're friends?

238
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:06,480
I don't like to owe things.

239
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,360
Even if we're best friends.

240
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,639
And now, we're not
considered as friends, right?

241
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,280
We'll see about that in the future.

242
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,079
I'll leave first.

243
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,600
Here's your phone.

244
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,680
How much did you spend on it?

245
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,399
Do you have extra money on you?

246
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:31,680
I don't.

247
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,999
Case closed then.

248
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:35,720
I'll surely return
the money in the future.

249
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,800
We can talk about that in the future.

250
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,160
We won't necessarily
become friends, you know?

251
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:43,360
You like to be involved with me?

252
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,559
Just treat it as my loss this time.

253
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,999
You don't need to pay me back.

254
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,920
Why is this phone so new?

255
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,639
Are you sure it's my phone?

256
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
It's fine as long
as it's functional, right?

257
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,999
Why are you upset about this?

258
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,559
Mum, what happened?

259
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,079
I'm listening.

260
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,920
My phone was in the repair center.
Now it's fixed.

261
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,399
What happened to your voice?

262
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,240
Did anything happen?

263
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,680
Those guys are back.

264
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Who?

265
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,240
How did they know about us?

266
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,439
I think...

267
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,160
they saw you on the Internet.

268
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,040
Shi Shi, what happened?

269
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:28,160
Why are you on the Internet?

270
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:33,280
Mum, don't worry.

271
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,360
I'm fine.

272
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,680
Where's Dad? He's not around?

273
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,120
Your father...

274
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,079
Shi Shi, tell me.

275
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
What did we do wrong exactly?

276
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,040
Mum, please don't cry.

277
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,800
We can talk about this.

278
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,999
Where's my bag?

279
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,360
Miss Zhou, here's your bag.

280
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:55,319
That scared me to death!
Thank you!

281
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,720
Chairman.

282
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,959
Is she suspicious of us?

283
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,959
She was making an urgent call.
She didn't suspect us.

284
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,519
Now you know
why I'm risking this, right?

285
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,240
She wants to get rid of me.

286
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,840
But I need to bring her to my side.

287
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:17,759
And this is the only way.

288
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,999
I understand.

289
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,680
Where are you going?

290
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:29,360
I'm going back. Something happened.

291
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Is it serious?

292
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

293
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:33,439
For how long?

294
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:36,040
For one or two days.
I'll be back by Monday.

295
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,199
Xiao Fei, please take care
of the house for me.

296
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,199
Zhou Shi.

297
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,439
Did your father...

298
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:52,800
Can you handle that?

299
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
Don't worry, I can handle this.

300
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,800
This is not the first time anyway.

301
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,480
Okay. Return as soon as possible.

302
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,759
If you need any help, just tell us.

303
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,319
Don't worry.

304
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:09,600
Sister Zhou Shi will be fine, right?

305
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,039
Rich fellows like you won't
understand Zhou Shi's pain.

306
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
Mum, I'm back.

307
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,360
Why are you in my house?

308
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,760
Take a guess then.

309
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,439
The contract has listed everything
that you've owed me.

310
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,439
Everything is listed down.

311
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,079
Aren't you trying to get rid of me?

312
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,199
You can.

313
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Just give me back the money
that I've spent on you.

314
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,640
Didn't I give them back already?

315
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:00,360
You only returned a small
fraction of them to me.

316
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
How about the antiques
that were broken?

317
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,640
Those are fakes!

318
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,360
Fakes have costs too.

319
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,079
If you don't pay me back,

320
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,840
I'll find your parents for it.

321
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:11,240
It's between us!
Find me if you need anything!

322
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Don't touch my family.

323
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,159
Return the money then.

324
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,120
I...

325
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,079
How about this?

326
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,799
You can return the favour
with your body too.

327
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:19,919
What do you mean?

328
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,240
You and I are
the only people around here.

329
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,919
There's nobody else.

330
00:18:25,199 --> 00:18:26,559
What are you doing?

331
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,799
Take a guess.

332
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,959
Don't you know what I want?

333
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:32,279
We're adults.

334
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:36,799
-Stop pretending already.
-Stop it! I'll call the cops!

335
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:41,120
He has a nice body.

336
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,120
What are you doing?

337
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,840
I'm dreaming?

338
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,360
What did I dream of just now?

339
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,159
Why did I dream of him?

340
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,079
It must be from the trauma
when he kissed me.

341
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:16,840
That's why I had a dream like that.

342
00:19:44,199 --> 00:19:45,559
Mum!

343
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,720
Shi Shi.

344
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,319
I was just absent for one semester.

345
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,199
How did our house turn into this?

346
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,439
Did Dad just abandoned you?

347
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
I can't blame him.

348
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,000
He can't afford to repay his debts.

349
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,840
I'm not in a good condition either.

350
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm just a burden to him.

351
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,279
But didn't we repay
all the debts already?

352
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:09,640
Why are we in debts again?

353
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,279
You know your
father's personality, right?

354
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,120
He likes to boast.

355
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:17,279
Ever since you went on
the news with that guy,

356
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,919
he has been boasting
to others about him.

357
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,079
You mean Wei Qing?

358
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,199
Yeah.

359
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,120
He said Wei Qing is his son-in-law.

360
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:30,799
With that, he managed to
get a loan without a guarantor.

361
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,439
But your father
is not cut out for business.

362
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,840
His business collapsed in a few days.

363
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,120
The debtors,

364
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,600
they came after that.

365
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,159
Shi Shi.

366
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
Thank you for visiting me.

367
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,760
But I'm fine.

368
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,319
Just leave before they come back.

369
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:51,439
How can I do that?

370
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:52,959
They're so smug.

371
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:54,919
Nobody knows what
they'll do to you next time.

372
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,880
Mum, we should call the cops.

373
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,279
Call the cops?

374
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,319
Just you wish!

375
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,840
Are you Old Zhou's daughter?
Not bad at all.

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,880
You look like a rich lady.

377
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,600
Our efforts were not in vain.

378
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:15,159
His daughter is way braver than him.

379
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,199
I warn you guys!

380
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,799
Don't try to do anything to us!

381
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,079
If anything happens to us,

382
00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:21,400
you guys can't get anything!

383
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,760
Miss, you're smart.

384
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:27,799
You know what to do
in situations like these.

385
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,439
We're just here for the money.

386
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,720
If your father didn't run away,

387
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,679
things wouldn't have to be like this.

388
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,600
Since you're back,

389
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,199
let's settle the debts once and for all.

390
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,199
Dad is out of his mind.

391
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,880
How can he borrow so much money?

392
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,520
The amount listed here
includes the interests as well.

393
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,559
Do you want to pay it
by the full amount?

394
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,240
Or by installments?

395
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:03,079
Are you looking down on her?

396
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,840
She's the girlfriend
of Yun Ma Group's boss.

397
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,319
The girlfriend of Wei Qing.

398
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,199
She can repay this by just
selling off her clothes.

399
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,959
I'm poor.
And I'm not his girlfriend too.

400
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,199
You're poor? Why are you here then?

401
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,120
Brother, this was not meant to happen.

402
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,039
I'm sure you were
Wei Qing's girlfriend, right?

403
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,000
Wei Qing is famous for his generosity.

404
00:22:28,199 --> 00:22:31,120
All his exes have houses and cars.

405
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,720
How can you get nothing out of him?

406
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,039
He should at least give you money
for breaking up with him.

407
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,159
Yeah.

408
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,919
All my assets are in here.

409
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,480
You guys can search it.

410
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,000
Search it!

411
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,039
Okay.

412
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:55,840
This...

413
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,679
Brother, there's nothing inside.

414
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,079
Why did it turn out like this?

415
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,000
Shall we ask her again?

416
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,159
What are you guys mumbling about?

417
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,480
What's inside your bag?
Give it to me!

418
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,520
Give it to me!

419
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:15,400
You're troublesome!

420
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
There's money inside!

421
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,640
There's money inside?

422
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
Shi Shi.

423
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,760
We're rich!

424
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,319
Where's my bag?

425
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,760
Miss Zhou, here's your bag.

426
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,679
That scared me to death! Thank you!

427
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,159
Shi Shi.

428
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,079
Where did you get the money?

429
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,400
Do you have anything to say?

430
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,919
These are not mine.

431
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:42,240
Give them back!

432
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,799
-You said you were poor?
-Don't hurt her.

433
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,840
This accounts for half of the debts.

434
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll give you one month
for the other half.

435
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,240
One month?

436
00:23:56,279 --> 00:23:58,319
Your boyfriend is very rich.

437
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
You can just request the money from him.

438
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,919
One month is more than enough time.

439
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,439
I told you I'm not his girlfriend.

440
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:07,439
That doesn't matter to me.

441
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,279
Next month, we'll be here.

442
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,279
To collect the remaining debt.

443
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,679
You can try to run away.

444
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,199
But your boyfriend is famous.

445
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,720
If you run away,
we'll find him for the money.

446
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,679
Yeah, we'll find him.

447
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,360
Let's go!

448
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,600
You have one month!

449
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,480
Remember that!

450
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:36,400
Shi Shi.

451
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,039
Are you really Wei Qing's girlfriend?

452
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,640
Mum, I can't explain
this to you in a minute.

453
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:46,720
I thought I was finally rid of him.

454
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,480
Now, it's back to square one again.

455
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,439
Why must I be involved with him?

456
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,919
Hello, Director An.

457
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,640
Good morning, Director An.

458
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,199
Good morning, Director An.

459
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,199
Good morning.

460
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:11,296
[Done]

461
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:23,720
After Zhou Shi left,
he has been sitting there all day.

462
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,439
He's really obsessed with her.

463
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,400
It's good to be young.

464
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:32,159
Do you think he likes Zhou Shi?

465
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
-Why are you wooing him then?
-I...

466
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:37,319
Zhou Shi doesn't like him yet, right?

467
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,600
Puppy love doesn't count.

468
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Besides, I'm not wooing him.

469
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,799
I'm just trying to
build a relationship with him.

470
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,199
Just like the relationship
between Zhou Shi and him.

471
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,079
To the point where I can send
him some gifts during his birthday.

472
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,880
You're good in calculating your steps.

473
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:52,919
Don't talk about me.

474
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,840
How about you?
Where did you go last night?

475
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:57,840
Don't think that I didn't
notice your black eye circles.

476
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,959
I went to play chess.

477
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,439
Chess?

478
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
Is he the one that sent you the CAPTCHA?

479
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,600
Why didn't you block him?

480
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,559
Why should I block him?

481
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,799
He is interesting.

482
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,039
That's enough.

483
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,079
You send him a map
with a black dot on it.

484
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,199
And he sent you a location?

485
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,199
What are you guys doing?

486
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,439
Look.

487
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,279
He send me a blank sheet.

488
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:02,079
He's asking me for some questions.

489
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,679
I drew a dot in the middle.

490
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,039
He can interpret the meaning of that.

491
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,959
But in a game of Go,

492
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,400
it means the tengen,

493
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:14,039
which is also known as
the tenth row of the tenth column.

494
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,880
This guy knows what he's doing.
Interesting.

495
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,480
He chose to reply me at 3.04 am.

496
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,199
He placed the chess at komoku,
it's the fourth row of the third column.

497
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,679
He has some sort of OCD.

498
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:47,159
-Look.
-Stop. That's enough.

499
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,559
It means you guys are in sync.

500
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:52,000
You're a weird girl.

501
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,640
He's weird too.

502
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,120
Congratulations!

503
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,240
You finally found a friend
besides your computer!

504
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:01,240
You can play with him happily next time.

505
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Friend?

506
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,679
Actually,

507
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,319
although Zhou Shi and I
have a good relationship with you,

508
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,400
we don't really understand you.

509
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,760
Just like your chess and your questions.

510
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,520
We really can't understand them.

511
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,640
So when you meet a person
who can understand you,

512
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,919
I'm quite relieved.

513
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,760
Just add him as your friend.

514
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,600
Don't miss the opportunity.

515
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,400
If not, I don't know when's
the next time you can meet one.

516
00:28:28,959 --> 00:28:30,079
Sister Zhou Shi.

517
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,159
Sister Zhou Shi!

518
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,880
No need to go and look.
That's our neighbour.

519
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,039
Your Sister Zhou Shi
will only be back by Monday.

520
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,279
You miss her, right?

521
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,640
Why don't you go and find her?

522
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:51,760
I'm bad with directions.

523
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,000
Call for a car then.
I'll give you the address.

524
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,199
I'm poor.

525
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:56,959
Don't give me that.

526
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,600
Didn't you get the password already?

527
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,159
Let's not talk about a car.

528
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,159
You could fly to
her house with your money.

529
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,199
I've donated them.

530
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,559
What?

531
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,120
Sister Zhou Shi doesn't want the money.
I donated them.

532
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,199
What?

533
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,079
Why did you do that?

534
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:13,279
Why didn't you donate them to me?

535
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,039
From today onwards,
sleep in the living room.

536
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:21,480
You dummy.

537
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,360
What do you mean?

538
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,679
You're a dummy!

539
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,079
I wish you luck.

540
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:33,240
What's going on?

541
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,439
Is he dumb?

542
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,360
Why is he on my bed?

543
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,840
Wait. He was still
sleeping here yesterday.

544
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:53,600
I think the living room is too cold.

545
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,720
He's used to my bed.

546
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,640
I think he came here in his sleep.

547
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,520
Why am I helping him?

548
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,000
He's quite handsome though.

549
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,799
But he's dumb.

550
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,439
Why are you on my bed?

551
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,400
This is my room! Get out!

552
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:32,720
Get out!

553
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,279
Get out! It's my room.

554
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:40,559
Sister Zhou Shi, you're back?

555
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,559
Xiao Fei, you woke up already?

556
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:47,240
You guys slept together?

557
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,279
No.

558
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,919
This is still my room.
I swapped our positions already.

559
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:51,760
You scared me.

560
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,199
Zhou Shi, you're back?

561
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,959
How's your matter at home?

562
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,919
I've settled half of it.

563
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,760
I'll go to sleep first.

564
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,520
My house doesn't even have a bed.

565
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:02,120
I didn't sleep the whole night.

566
00:32:08,199 --> 00:32:10,720
Look at you! It's because
you donated all your money!

567
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,319
If not, you can still help
your Sister Zhou Shi, you know?

568
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,880
Why are you angry?

569
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,159
Don't blame Xiao Fei for this.

570
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,159
He didn't just spend them randomly.

571
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,799
He used them for a good deed.

572
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,880
Good deed?

573
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:34,159
What does it mean?

574
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,120
Autism.

575
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,520
Autism?

576
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,319
To put it simply,

577
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,240
it's a center for children with autism,
located in the U.S..

578
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,720
It's a NGO.

579
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,520
They need donations from outsiders.

580
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,799
From Ning Fei's card,

581
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:53,480
he has been donating anonymously
to the center for five years.

582
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:55,000
What are his motives?

583
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:58,039
That doesn't matter. At least
he's doing a good deed.

584
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,439
Fine. I understand now.

585
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,439
I'm the only layman around.

586
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:10,079
Tell me. Why did I try to woo him?

587
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,199
Actually, Xiao Fei is a nice person.

588
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,120
He's honest and attentive.

589
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,640
Since he can donate all his money,

590
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,600
I'm sure he can earn them back.

591
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:23,279
Are you giving up already?

592
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,120
No.

593
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,279
Only Zhou Shi can handle him.

594
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,959
I think he doesn't like me.

595
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,720
I don't need to waste my effort on him.

596
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,120
Besides, I have
some serious things to do.

597
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,439
Serious things?

598
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
Are you sure about that?

599
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Can't I just be serious for once?

600
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,360
I'll be going for an interview.
I'll work as a model.

601
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,640
Are you serious?

602
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,600
You need to be optimistic for that.

603
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,400
It doesn't suit you.

604
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,319
Where can I get the money then?

605
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,279
Shall I just wait for the money to come?

606
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,799
Listen. When I went for the interview,

607
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,079
the producer of the magazine
was the golden retriever among them.

608
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,559
I mean golden bachelor.

609
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,400
Even if I can't be his girlfriend,

610
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:15,600
at least I'll be able
to meet some new friends.

611
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:20,719
Besides, my next boyfriend must
be better than Gao Yang.

612
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,079
I understand it now.

613
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:26,479
Wait.

614
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,279
Which one looks better?

615
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,840
This? Or this?

616
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,719
They're counterfeits.
They look the same.

617
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,759
Can you tell me that in a nicer way?

618
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,559
I wanted to have the real deal too.

619
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:46,200
I sold them last month.

620
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,719
It's because I'm poor.

621
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,360
I wanted to use the real deal too.

622
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,319
Okay. You can choose them yourself.

623
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,479
-I'm going to play chess with Bai.
-Wait.

624
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,440
Who's Bai?

625
00:34:57,559 --> 00:34:59,200
He's my friend in QQ.

626
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:00,479
He uses the white pieces.

627
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,120
You have a nickname for him?

628
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,239
Fine. I'll not interrupt your date.

629
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,120
Go now.

630
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:11,999
Enjoy.

631
00:35:15,319 --> 00:35:17,799
Should I use this one?

632
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,640
If I wear that...

633
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,759
No. I'm going for an interview
in the fashion industry.

634
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,880
I need something flashy.

635
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Who can I get it from?

636
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:47,479
Next month,
we'll come back for the rest.

637
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:50,799
You can try to run away.

638
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:52,319
But your boyfriend is famous.

639
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,079
We'll find him for the money then.

640
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,559
Zhou Shi, are you asleep?

641
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,519
I'm not. Come in.

642
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,880
Fei Fei, what's wrong?

643
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,400
Did you return the
Patek Philippe watch already?

644
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:20,039
I wanted to.

645
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:29,759
But...

646
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,960
Why is your watch in my bag?

647
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,039
You wore it already.

648
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,400
Of course you need to
bring it for maintenance.

649
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,519
But now, you don't have money, right?

650
00:36:38,759 --> 00:36:40,079
I'm not in a hurry to take it back.

651
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,719
How about the money in my bag?

652
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:43,239
I'm in a meeting now.

653
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,999
We can talk about that
when you come back.

654
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:52,440
Thank you. I'll only use it today.

655
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,160
After that,
I'll send it for maintainence.

656
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,120
I promise I won't break the watch.

657
00:36:56,279 --> 00:36:57,880
You must be careful.

658
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:00,559
I don't want to offend Wei Qing anymore.

659
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,759
If anything happens to this watch,

660
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,640
my entire life will be ruined.

661
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,759
Why?

662
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,039
I thought you guys were friends?

663
00:37:09,759 --> 00:37:12,239
I wish that was true.

664
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,680
I'm afraid you were right all the time.

665
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:19,160
What happened?
Did he do something to you?

666
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,440
He can try it if he dares!

667
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,360
It's much more complicated than that.

668
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:27,279
I can't explain it
to you in a short time.

669
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,559
This is troublesome.

670
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,559
Never mind then.
I won't wear this anymore.

671
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,200
If something happened,

672
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,600
I would cause you trouble.

673
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,880
Never mind that. Just take it.

674
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:41,640
I don't have the money
for it's maintainence anyway.

675
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,759
If it can help you with your interview,

676
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,640
Wei Qing would be doing a good deed.

677
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,559
Thanks then. I'll treat you next time.

678
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,519
Go now.

679
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,479
I'll get ready now.

680
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,640
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

681
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,759
Chairman.

682
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,400
Chairman.

683
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:13,880
Come in.

684
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,440
Finally, you followed the rules.

685
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,039
You're not that rash now.

686
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,640
I need to tell you something.

687
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,519
It must be the money in your bag, right?

688
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:31,600
That day, you were nervous
when you were taking the call.

689
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:33,120
I figured you would need some money.

690
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:35,239
That's why I put the money in there.

691
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,120
You used the money?

692
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,479
I can't tell you everything.

693
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,759
But I did use your money.

694
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,360
Although this is not convincing,

695
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:47,120
I'll repay the money later.

696
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:48,200
Repay them?

697
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:51,479
With what?

698
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,719
Although I'm not sure
what you did with the money,

699
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,519
you look like you're short on cash
since the first day I've met you.

700
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,680
And I'm rich.

701
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,160
Why don't we make a deal then?

702
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:10,239
What deal?

703
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,680
Be my girlfriend.

704
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,440
Besides being by my side all the time,

705
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,719
you need to complete the duties
of a girlfriend as well.

706
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:22,120
Of course. When I don't need you,

707
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,279
you can do your own stuff.

708
00:39:24,479 --> 00:39:25,920
But when I need you,

709
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,400
you need to appear immediately
and complete your duties.

710
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,519
This won't last for too long.

711
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,200
As long as you fulfill my requests,

712
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,840
I will give you freedom.

713
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,360
Of course, to compensate you,

714
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,640
I'll give you a large sum
of money every month.

715
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,239
Consider this carefully.

716
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,880
If you take my offer,

717
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,640
you can escape from
this plight of yours.

718
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,120
You can even help your family with this.

719
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,799
Many people want to be in your place.

720
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,039
You better be careful.

721
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:56,360
Be careful of what?

722
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,200
Be careful that...

723
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,360
he'll reel you in like the others.

724
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,920
Just like the girls that he chased
with his money before you.

725
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:10,999
Don't group us together!

726
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:13,039
I didn't take his gifts.

727
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,079
You didn't?

728
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,239
How do you explain the things
that he gave to you?

729
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,079
My wages aren't out yet.

730
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,960
I'll return them immediately
when I get it.

731
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,440
Let me tell you a story.

732
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,759
In the past,

733
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,600
your senior, the ex-girlfriend of
Wei Qing, said the same thing.

734
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,400
But after she became
Wei Qing's girlfriend,

735
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,519
she became a materialistic woman.

736
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,239
Can you guess the results?

737
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,200
Wei Qing dumped her within one month.

738
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,200
After he dumped her,

739
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:37,559
the girl was not happy with it.

740
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:39,200
She wanted to kill herself
because of it.

741
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:40,719
But in the end, she still got dumped.

742
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,239
And then?

743
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,719
Have you ever heard of this?

744
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,640
It's easier to go from rags to
riches than riches to rags.

745
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:53,160
When she's used to being rich,
she can't go back anymore.

746
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,400
You like to tie people down
with your money, don't you?

747
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,239
This is the fastest way.

748
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,160
Everyone seems poor.

749
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,559
Yeah. Most of us are poor.

750
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,519
You're rich.

751
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,360
You can aim for
other people's weaknesses.

752
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:07,360
And just insult them with your money.

753
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,960
You're right. I'm short on cash.

754
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,640
And I do owe you some money.

755
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:13,479
I don't know when I can
repay all of my debts.

756
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,160
But do you think you can
make me submit to you?

757
00:41:16,279 --> 00:41:18,160
What can you do besides that?

758
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,360
What if I wanted you
to repay your debts now?

759
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,880
I admire your character.

760
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,079
Here's a cheque.

761
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,079
You can write the amount you want.

762
00:41:36,279 --> 00:41:38,559
After that, be obedient about it
and be my girlfriend.

763
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,120
Go back and take your time.

764
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,640
Wait.

765
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:47,519
I will repay my debts.

766
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,440
Even if it costs me my life!

767
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,079
But I'll not accept this offer!

768
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,600
Chairman, this...

769
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,239
I want to see how long
she can stand on her own.
