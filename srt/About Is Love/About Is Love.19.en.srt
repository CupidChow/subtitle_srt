29
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,359
Assistant An.

30
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,960
Can you help me to plead with him?

31
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,879
Brother Ming Cheng's phone is still off.

32
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,959
He has yet to be arrested, right?

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,440
Do you think that your
Brother Ming Cheng is a villain?

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
Of course not.

35
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,679
Then continue to believe in him.

36
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,039
The worries you have now
prove that you don't trust him.

37
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,280
Assistant An.

38
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,519
You are here.

39
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,000
-Come with me.
-Alright.

40
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,319
He is here.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
The one who betrayed my company is here.

42
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,280
Chairman, I...

43
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,920
Wei An. Go out first.

44
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,720
Alright.

45
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:17,319
Have a seat.

46
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:26,360
How is it?

47
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,720
Just like what you've presumed.

48
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,759
These are connected to Director He.

49
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:36,720
Continue.

50
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,920
A few months ago,
when she came back to China,

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,080
she had been looking for buyer
to take over Yun Ma Artwork.

52
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,319
In the end, under He Wei's
recommendation,

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,920
she came to know about Xue Zi.

54
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,479
He Wei?

55
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,599
He is indeed involved in this.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,720
Actually, not only
Yun Ma Artwork, but...

57
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,319
all these years, He Wei had been giving
Director He a lot of suggestions.

58
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:02,200
He had instigated her to make
a lot of useless investments.

59
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,879
And these investments...

60
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,200
will be recorded under
his name in the end.

61
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,759
He's really keeping
the goodies for himself.

62
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,039
But I had just asked you
to investigate...

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,919
and you are already accused
for stealing company's information.

64
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:19,079
Looks like he had planted
a lot of spies around me.

65
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,840
What are you going to do then?

66
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,840
What am I going to do?

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,480
Can I tell others that my mother and
uncle are ganging up to steal my money?

68
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,440
If this thing is made known to public,

69
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,600
it'll only bring shame
to Yun Ma Artwork.

70
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,440
By that time, not only
our business will be affected,

71
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,639
I think I'll become the
joke of the year as well.

72
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,440
So, are you planning...

73
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,560
to sweep this under the carpet?

74
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,440
What are you going to do if it's you?

75
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,639
The Go game focuses
on the overall situation.

76
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,959
Sometimes, in order to
achieve overall victory,

77
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,280
we have to sacrifice some chess pieces.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
What kind of tactic is that again?

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
Sacrifice of the pawn.

80
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,359
Especially...

81
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,000
those nameless pawns
without any backgrounds.

82
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,840
Brother Ming Cheng.

83
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,040
Shi Shi, I made you worry again.

84
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,840
Don't worry. I won't let
anything happen to you.

85
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,480
Shi Shi.

86
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,160
Chairman.

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,199
Let's negotiate. If you are willing
to free Brother Ming Cheng,

88
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,359
I'll do anything you want
besides murder and arson.

89
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,079
Are you really willing to do anything?

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,959
But you can't ask for something
too outrageous.

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,840
I already told you. Don't meddle
with Li Ming Cheng's matter.

92
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,919
You know about my relationship with him.

93
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:02,160
Even if we can't be together,
he's still like my real brother.

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,399
So, I won't let him get hurt.

95
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:08,320
So, if I end up punishing Li Ming Cheng,
are you going to...

96
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,480
stop helping me with my treatment?

97
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,320
I'll still help.
These are two different things.

98
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,480
Since I've already promised you,
I'll keep my promise.

99
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,880
But if you do that, I'll be upset.

100
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,160
If I'm upset, it'll affect the
effectiveness of the treatment.

101
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:26,560
If the effectiveness of the treatment
is affected, your recovery will be slow.

102
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,280
Are you threatening me
in a subtle way so that...

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,959
I'll forgive Li Ming Cheng?

104
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:35,000
No. This is not a threat.
This is a request.

105
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,799
Although I know that this is related
to the company's profit,

106
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:42,199
if Brother Ming Cheng really did
something wrong, he has to be punished.

107
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,679
I just hope that you can
give him another chance.

108
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,519
Alright. I promise you.

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,600
I'll use the fairest way to settle
this issue with Li Ming Cheng.

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,840
Thank you, chairman.

111
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,880
Leave now.

112
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:04,560
Are you really not going
to tell Miss Zhou?

113
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Let her worry for a few more days.

114
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,040
By the way, have you cleaned up
Ning Fei's drawing room?

115
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,519
I want to move in soon.

116
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,399
Alright.

117
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,799
So many trucks.
Is someone going to move in?

118
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,679
Why are they moving those things
into our house?

119
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,560
These are not gifts
from Wei Qing again, right?

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,359
Hello. Are these things supposed
to be delivered to Zhou Shi?

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,679
We don't know.
We were just told to send them here.

122
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,639
Miss Zhou.

123
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,480
Assistant An?

124
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,679
You are going to move into here?

125
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,799
It's not me. It's the chairman.

126
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,600
This time, he just sends
himself over instead.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,079
Perfect.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,760
Brother Ming Cheng.
You have settled your issues, right?

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Don't be too upset.

130
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,679
No. This is too depressing.

131
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,799
Brother Ming Cheng,
let bygone be bygone.

132
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,720
Tomorrow will be a new day.

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,600
No. This is too casual.

134
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,959
Forget it. I should just call him.

135
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,639
No. I scared that I can't form
my sentence well if I call him.

136
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,240
I better use WeChat.

137
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,559
No. WeChat is too informal.

138
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,240
I should call him instead.

139
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,559
Forget it. I can't call him.

140
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,319
What are you trying to do?

141
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,519
You've been ranting for a whole night.
What are you trying to do?

142
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,879
I just want to call Brother Ming Cheng
to comfort him.

143
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,160
If you call him at this time,

144
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,280
you'll be sprinkling salt on his wound.

145
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,840
During time like this,
you should leave him alone.

146
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,600
-Let him calm down.
-That's right. It's something shameful.

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,519
Moreover, he might not want you
to know about that.

148
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,519
Tell me. Why would Wei Qing move here?

149
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,519
He even gave up his fantastic villa...

150
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,160
that has a swimming pool.

151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,920
How did you know that his villa
has a swimming pool?

152
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,959
Qiu Jing told me about it.

153
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,399
When we can't find you last time,
I used software to track you.

154
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,480
What did you see?

155
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,480
-We saw both of you drinking together.
-After that?

156
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,879
-After that, the lights went out.
-And then?

157
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,639
And then we didn't see anything.

158
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,959
What did you do after you drink?

159
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:53,840
You didn't tell us about it that day.

160
00:09:55,079 --> 00:09:57,399
We just drank. Nothing else.

161
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,920
Then, why are you panicking?

162
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:00,959
I'm not panicking!

163
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,559
Tell me the truth. Did Wei Qing
move here because of you?

164
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,999
How is that possible?

165
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,040
Maybe he's tired of staying in a villa.
So, he wants a change of taste.

166
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,920
I think he really wants
a change of taste.

167
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,559
Why is it so hot in here?
Didn't you turn on the air conditioner?

168
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,199
Forget it.
I better call Brother Ming Cheng.

169
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,319
Something is wrong.

170
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,399
That is for sure.

171
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,360
Shi Shi.

172
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,800
Brother Ming Cheng.

173
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,639
Don't be too upset.

174
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,920
People make mistakes.
It's not scary to fall.

175
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,680
You'll still be a warrior as long as
you stand up again.

176
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,079
What are you talking about?

177
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,680
Why can't I understand you?

178
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,439
Maybe you can't understand now
but you will, in the future.

179
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,319
Don't worry. I'll stay
by your side no matter what.

180
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,759
Pull yourself together!

181
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,399
Alright. I will.

182
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,600
But I'm confused.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,319
Shi Shi, what are you trying to say?

184
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,680
It's normal that you are confused.

185
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,199
After all, termination is
such a serious matter.

186
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,680
What? Who told you that
I'll be terminated?

187
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,999
Wei Qing!

188
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,079
Zhou Shi. Be careful with your words.

189
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,639
-Why did you lie to me?
-What did I lie to you?

190
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,759
Brother Ming Cheng
didn't betray the company.

191
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,879
-This is all a set-up.
-That's right.

192
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,559
Why didn't you tell me about it?

193
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,519
Why should I tell you?
You are just an intern.

194
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,199
This is the company's vital secret.
You have no rights to know.

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,160
When I came in here last time,

196
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,240
why did say that you will terminate him?

197
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,319
When did I say that I'll terminate him?

198
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,399
You are the one who thought
that I'll terminate him.

199
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,559
-I just never corrected you about it.
-Why didn't you correct me?

200
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,280
You didn't give me a chance.

201
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,199
Last time, you just came in and
negotiate with stern righteousness.

202
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:02,519
Why would I stop you?

203
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,720
I...

204
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,800
You should blame yourself
for overreacting.

205
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,800
You are the one who
doubted Li Ming Cheng.

206
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,360
That's not right.
You are manipulating me again.

207
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,240
I've always believed in
Brother Ming Cheng.

208
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:17,840
I'm afraid that you'll abandon him
after you used him.

209
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,120
In your eyes, I'm this kind of
ungrateful person?

210
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,559
-No.
-Let me tell you.

211
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,840
Not only didn't I terminate him,
I gave him a promotion.

212
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,759
In the end, not only
are you not thankful,

213
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:33,120
you even ran here to scream at me.

214
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,559
Chairman.

215
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,040
This is my mistake.
I was too impulsive.

216
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,399
Please forgive the young
and inexperienced me.

217
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,519
Do you think I'll forgive you
just because you say that?

218
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,720
If you need anything in the future,
just tell me. I'll do it for you.

219
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:50,879
Alright.

220
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,559
I'm going to move to the floor
above your home soon.

221
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,319
Someone will clean it up
within these two days.

222
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,720
Keep an eye on them.

223
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,040
Why do you want to move
to the floor above us?

224
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,959
I can treat myself easier
if I'm near to you.

225
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,439
I'll give you a leave. Go now.

226
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
What is it? You want me
to send you home?

227
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,480
No. I'll do my best.
Goodbye, chairman.

228
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,319
I don't need this nonsense!

229
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:25,280
Did he find out about anything?

230
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,480
That Li Ming Cheng has investigated
the account thoroughly.

231
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,399
Including yours.

232
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,959
I think Wei Qing
will pay you a visit very soon.

233
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,879
Where did this Li Ming Cheng come from?

234
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
Haven't you noticed him before?

235
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,879
He just came here for half a month.
I never thought that...

236
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,079
Wei Qing will hand over
such important task to him.

237
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,959
Chairman He.

238
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,680
I'm fired.

239
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,360
Like what you had promised...

240
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
You didn't foil my plan
when I promised you that.

241
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,999
I don't need a good-for-nothing here.

242
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,480
He...

243
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,399
Such a scoundrel.

244
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,480
We'll be leaving now.

245
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,959
-Bye.
-Bye.

246
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,759
Drink with me tonight.
I'm in a bad mood.

247
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,040
Chairman He.
It's already after working hours.

248
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,999
Besides, drinking with you is not
entailed in my job scope, right?

249
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Fei Fei. That's enough.

250
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,199
I knew that I've embarrassed you when
I didn't attend your gathering.

251
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,959
But I really have things to do that day.
It's vital for my future development.

252
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:36,840
If things go well for me,
it'll go well for you too, right?

253
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:40,382
[Let's meet up later.]

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,319
Besides, I'll let you arrange
my working schedule from now on.

255
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,519
You can even arrange for our dates.

256
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,199
We can go on a date whenever you want.

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,319
And you can go wherever you want.
Sounds good?

258
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,639
Alright. Let's go on a date now.

259
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,720
-I can't do it today.
-What is it?

260
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,160
You have another date tonight.

261
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,840
Do I need to refer to the schedule
of your other girlfriends?

262
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,680
How about you make a timetable?
Or use the odd and even days.

263
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,240
-This is not what you think it is.
-He Wei.

264
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
Many people think that
I'm a gold digger.

265
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,120
They think I don't care
as long as my partner is rich.

266
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,079
But I'm not like that.

267
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,800
I put my whole heart into
every relationship I was in.

268
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,879
I hate to be lied to.

269
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,480
I understand you.
I'm just like you too.

270
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:24,079
Everybody thinks that I'm a Casanova.
But I know that...

271
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,079
I just haven't met someone
who can make me settle down.

272
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:28,680
But you are different.

273
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,199
Fei Fei, I saw
a different future with you.

274
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,720
My life...

275
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,199
is only complete when I am with you.

276
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,840
Or else, I'll always be someone
who has a crippling relationship.

277
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,639
Fei Fei, I think we should
talk properly.

278
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,280
Let's overcome this misunderstanding.

279
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,519
Alright. We'll talk tonight.

280
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,199
I really can't do it tonight.

281
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm sorry then.
I'm not free tomorrow.

282
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,199
I already gave you a chance.
You blew it.

283
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,879
It's time for me to get off work.
I wish you a wonderful night.

284
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,439
The elders are not here yet
and you already start to eat.

285
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,280
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

286
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,280
You ate my food without
waiting for my permission.

287
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,559
Don't you think it's inappropriate too?

288
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,720
There are so many dishes here.

289
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,519
I just ate a few bites.
You won't starve to death.

290
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,039
Me not giving you permission to eat...

291
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,279
is different from you
stealing my food from me.

292
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,360
We are family.

293
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,159
How can you call that stealing?

294
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,480
It's just that you are
eating the meat...

295
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,240
while I have to drink the soup.

296
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,640
I'm afraid that with your appetite,

297
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,079
you won't be full with just soup, right?

298
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,959
Will you share your meat with me?

299
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,959
What if I say no?

300
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,679
Then, I'll take that meat myself.

301
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:42,120
As expected. If it's not your meat,

302
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,439
you won't be able to
eat it too in the end.

303
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,480
Wei An.

304
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,000
Here. This is a feast for you.

305
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:17,959
I can overlook what
you've done in the past.

306
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,439
And I can use a high price...

307
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,919
to purchase your company's shares.

308
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,480
From now on, don't poke your nose
into the company's matter.

309
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,279
And about me and Xue Zi's collaboration,

310
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,079
you won't be able to satisfy her
with your kind of level.

311
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
If you persist,

312
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,240
you'll just fail miserably in the end.

313
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,279
So many years have passed.
Looks like you are still the same.

314
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,199
You like to fight with me...

315
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
but in the end, you get nothing.

316
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,520
I just want to get back what
your family owes me.

317
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,159
What did we owe you?

318
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,799
Back then, my sister and
your father built Yun Ma together.

319
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,159
Why does the Wei family
owns everything now...

320
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,880
while my sister is left with
only some half-dead galleries?

321
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,919
Looks like you are
as childish as my mother.

322
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,880
When Yun Ma is still in their hands,

323
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,600
it's already struggling to survive.

324
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,799
I'm the one who strengthened it
one step after another.

325
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,159
And it has nothing to do...

326
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
with my mother, your sister.

327
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,720
And it has even less thing
to do with you.

328
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:43,480
The spies that you put by my side,

329
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,679
I'll get rid of them one by one.

330
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,279
From now on, don't play
this kind of trick on me again.

331
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,319
I'll treat you to this meal.

332
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,919
You can eat it however you like.

333
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,360
Enjoy.

334
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,959
Trying to intimidate me?

335
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
I'll eat it.

336
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,559
It's good to be rich.

337
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,319
I remember that when Xiao Fei was here,
this place had nothing.

338
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,520
It has totally changed
within these two days.

339
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:36,880
Look at how many had cleaned
this place for the past two years.

340
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:38,319
Of course it'll be clean.

341
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,439
This sofa is so soft.

342
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,079
Get up quickly! Wei Qing has mysophobia.

343
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,319
He'll nag me again if he sees it.

344
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,279
I don't care about his mysophobia.

345
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:54,679
You don't like Wei Qing, right?
Introduce him to me then.

346
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,959
Didn't you say that
he's not a Casanova...

347
00:20:57,959 --> 00:20:59,039
like his looks suggested?

348
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,520
He's indeed not like that.

349
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,679
But you still can't touch him.

350
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,720
What do you mean by I can't touch him?

351
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,439
Are you protecting your own?

352
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:09,799
I'm not protecting my own.
I'm just saying that...

353
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Forget it. I can't explain it to you.

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,039
Fei Fei.

355
00:21:16,439 --> 00:21:18,679
Can you don't just think about
marrying into a rich family?

356
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,120
Can you be more realistic...

357
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,480
and find a good man
to spend your life with?

358
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,319
Tell me then. What is a good man?

359
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,880
Many people think that
an honest man is a good man.

360
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:32,360
But frankly, they are just
mediocre people. I don't want that.

361
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,000
Moreover, all men are unfaithful.

362
00:21:35,199 --> 00:21:37,720
It's just that they are not
qualified to be unfaithful.

363
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,199
And I didn't say that
I won't look for a good man.

364
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,640
But I have a precondition
for the good man that I want.

365
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,480
He has to be rich.

366
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,959
These are just false reasoning.

367
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,400
Who said that good men can't be honest?

368
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,840
Brother Ming Cheng and Xiao Fei...

369
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,480
are both good men, right?

370
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,919
Xiao Fei?

371
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,559
Are you kidding?
He's just an ungrateful cat.

372
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,400
I think he only treats you well.

373
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,360
He's always baring his teeth at me.

374
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,880
He likes to fool around with you
but he's quite concerned about you.

375
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,159
He even helped you out
during the last gathering.

376
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,000
I've never seen him being
so serious towards anybody.

377
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,079
I think you are right.

378
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:19,520
Besides, when He Wei promised
to go to the gathering with you,

379
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,360
Xiao Fei just left the house in a fit.

380
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,959
I think he was jealous.

381
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:25,159
I don't think so. You think too much.

382
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,319
The onlooker sees most of the game.

383
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:31,039
Anyway, I think Xiao Fei is quite good.

384
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:34,159
And you suit each other.
Think about it.

385
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,640
I can't believe this Xiao Fei.

386
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,000
He went for still life painting
but it has been two days.

387
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
He disappeared after he sent
a message saying he's fine.

388
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,000
And I can't reach him through phone.
He's fine, right?

389
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,959
-When did it change into this?
-You are back.

390
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,400
So high-class.

391
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Xiao Fei! I just swept the floor!

392
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,840
Get out!

393
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:08,360
Go out.

394
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:11,159
Your shoes are so dirty. Get out!

395
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,480
Is this me?

396
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,959
You like starry sky.

397
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,880
Wherever I go, I want to draw
that starry sky for you.

398
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,959
So, this is the legendary...

399
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:38,959
'plucking the stars from
the sky for you' tactic.

400
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,039
Artists really have unique ways
to flirt with women.

401
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,439
This is for you.

402
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,679
I have one too?

403
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,679
Are you afraid that Sister Fei Fei will
be hungry? You put her among wheat.

404
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
I thought of her when
I saw the rippling wheat.

405
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,840
What do you mean?
Are you saying that I'm lascivious?

406
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,240
This means vitality.

407
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,400
What vitality?

408
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,840
Of course you have vitality.

409
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,919
You are so energetic every day.

410
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,159
Remember what I told you?
Xiao Fei understands you.

411
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,199
You need to seize your good man.

412
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
Good man?

413
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,039
I think he's just a smelly man.

414
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,319
Take a sniff at him.
He stinks of sweat.

415
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,159
You haven't showered
for how many days?

416
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,240
-Two.
-How can you be so disgusting?

417
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,919
Let's go now. Go and get a shower.

418
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,079
Wait! Xiao Fei.

419
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,439
Why didn't you put the word' Ran'
on this painting?

420
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,760
These are gifts for you.
So, I don't need to put the word.

421
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,600
-Let's go. You are so smelly.
-These are for us?

422
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,880
It's not in this painting too?

423
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,919
-What is not in the painting?
-It's nothing.

424
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,360
-I'll go back into my room now.
-But this one has it.

425
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:18,120
The ones for us
don't have the word 'Ran'.

426
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,279
Who's he going to give the ones
with the word 'Ran' to?

427
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,039
Even if he's just copying him,

428
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,000
isn't it too strange to copy it
in this drawing?

429
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,880
Xun Ran is a kid?

430
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,319
You don't know that?

431
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,120
Xiao Fei didn't tell you about it?

432
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,120
Why do you have a word 'Ran' here?

433
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
How did you know?

434
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,319
Xun Ran's fan told me about it today.

435
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,880
That fan said that not many
knew about it.

436
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,159
I...

437
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:53,760
I'm just copying him.

438
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,000
You are amazing!

439
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,159
I tried so hard but I still can't
unclasp it. But you did it in a flash.

440
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,640
This is not a combination lock.

441
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,679
It has a small hook at the side.

442
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:04,079
You can unclasp it that way.

443
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,000
How did you know?

444
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,840
I saw it just now.

445
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,159
Could it be?

446
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,760
Zhou Shi.

447
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,720
It was so obvious.
How can you miss that?

448
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,039
I'm too dumb.

449
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:34,799
What are you doing?
Are you going to peek?

450
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,840
Fei Fei, do you know?

451
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,480
Oh my goodness.
Am I dreaming right now?

452
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
Are you alright? You have a fever?

453
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,240
Have you ever thought of being
in the same house with your idol?

454
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:47,880
Idol?

455
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,360
I'm not interested in idols.

456
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,000
Then try to imagine...

457
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:54,360
the suffocating sense of happiness.

458
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,919
It's like I'm in a drunken dream.

459
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,720
I better get you the thermometer.

460
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,959
Fei Fei. Do you know who's
the one showering inside?

461
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,559
-Xiao Fei.
-No. He is...

462
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,720
When will I be able to meet Xun Ran?

463
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,159
When he's ready.

464
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,760
What is it? Who is he?

465
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:20,079
He's a future artist.

466
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,559
He'll be a rising new star
in the world of art.

467
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,240
Are you insane?

468
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,039
Xiao Fei. Come here.

469
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,360
Sister Zhou Shi.

470
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,720
Here. Eat some fruits.

471
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,760
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

472
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,959
It's a waste to arrange them so nicely.
You even use your bowl to eat fruits.

473
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Xiao Fei. Thank you for the painting.

474
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,959
I understood the message
in your painting.

475
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,720
Do you have anything to tell me?

476
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,439
Thank you.

477
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,319
What for?

478
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:18,720
I'm not talking about the fruits.

479
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,880
Forget it. Eat the fruits.

480
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,199
I know you are actually
a very shy person.

481
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,039
I know you feel embarrassed to say it.

482
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,000
But it's alright.
You can just give it to me straight.

483
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:33,559
Don't just keep it in. That's bad.

484
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,319
I don't like to bottle up anything.

485
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,919
Fine. Take your time to think about it.

486
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,919
Tell me about it when
you made a decision.

487
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,640
I'm ready.

488
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,799
I'll go back to my room now.

489
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,880
Anyway, I think Xiao Fei is quite good.

490
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,679
And you suit each other.
Think about it.

491
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,039
Ungrateful cat.
What if I really try it with you?

492
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:32,640
-Who is it?
-Me.

493
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,400
Come in.

494
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,360
Anything?

495
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,199
I need your help.

496
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:49,039
Alright. Since you gave me a painting,

497
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:50,480
tell me. What is it?

498
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,319
Can I sit down by your side?

499
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,840
I have something
to tell Sister Zhou Shi.

500
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,840
But I don't know how to say it.

501
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,360
What do you need to say that
is so mysterious? Is it hard to say it?

502
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Because I never told anyone
about it before this.

503
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,959
Is he going to confess?

504
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,559
Is it related to Zhou Shi.

505
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,600
-Why do you want to say it suddenly?
-Because I think she knows.

506
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,919
She is hesitating to ask me about it
but I want to tell her.

507
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,319
It's a two-sided love.

508
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,240
Impressive. You've grown up.

509
00:30:33,439 --> 00:30:36,000
The most important thing
is the atmosphere.

510
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,000
Maybe we can all hang out
one day to drink.

511
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,880
And when everybody is tipsy,

512
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,679
you can tell her then. And it'll be
easier for her to accept it.

513
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,079
Really?

514
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,760
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

515
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Thank you.

516
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,240
-Alright then. Go and sleep now.
-Alright.

517
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,279
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

518
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:02,840
Good man.

519
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,279
Unfortunately, it's not mine.

520
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,000
Good day, Chairman He.

521
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,600
It's not working hours yet.

522
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,199
No need to call me Chairman He.

523
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,159
What is it? You want me
to be your driver?

524
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,120
This is your car.

525
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,279
-I'm just here to carpool.
-My car?

526
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,039
What is it? You don't like it?

527
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,120
No. You've overestimated me,
Chairman He.

528
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:19,799
I can't accept such expensive gift.

529
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,159
Fei Fei, let bygone be bygone, alright?

530
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:24,880
Can we start over again?

531
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,720
-He stays here too?
-He is my...

532
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,600
-boyfriend.
-Xiao Fei, don't fool around.

533
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,840
Don't worry.
He's just here to take me to work.

534
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,279
He is my roommate.

535
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,360
Fei Fei. We are almost late. Let's go.

536
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,439
I won't let you hurt her.

537
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,000
In a relationship,

538
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
it takes two to tango.

539
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:09,760
You heard her just now.

540
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,360
You are just her roommate.

541
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,439
You have no rights...

542
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,880
to meddle with the relationship
between us.

543
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,679
Xiao Fei.

544
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,240
It takes two to tango.

545
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,919
Shi Shi!

546
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,039
Brother Ming Cheng.

547
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,079
I was too busy lately.
I didn't have time for you.

548
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,760
-You won't be mad at me, right?
-Of course not.

549
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,919
-That's good.
-Your birthday is almost here, right?

550
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,880
There's still half a month to go.

551
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:06,079
You've guessed my birthday present
correctly this time.

552
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,079
So, for your birthday,
I'll do as you say.

553
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,840
-Really?
-Of course.

554
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,640
This is a promise between us.

555
00:34:13,279 --> 00:34:15,960
-Have you thought of how to celebrate?
-No, I haven't.

556
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,600
-I'll tell you when I've decided.
-Alright.

557
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,079
How are you feeling after
you start to work here?

558
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,559
I'm good. It feels strange at first...

559
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,400
but I'm starting to get used to it.

560
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,960
It's good then.
Work well with the chairman.

561
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,039
You'll be able to learn
a lot of things from him.

562
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,559
Him? It's good that
I'm not badly influenced by him.

563
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,079
He has nothing good to learn from.

564
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,559
Let's take you for example.
He knows that I'm worried about you.

565
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,960
But he still tries to scare me.

566
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,519
He made me felt so worried
about you getting a termination.

567
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,360
He's like watching a drama.

568
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,160
He just watches while I make a fool
out of myself. And he moved his house.

569
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:50,319
Not only have I had to monitor the
workers, I even have to clean his room.

570
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,600
Why would I? I'm not his nanny.

571
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,559
He always asked me to do this and that.

572
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,279
If I don't, he'll put on
his chairman act to lecture me.

573
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,239
If it wasn't because you're here,
I would've quitted a long time ago.

574
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,960
Actually, the chairman is quite nice.

575
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,440
-He's not like what you say he is.
-Brother Ming Cheng.

576
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Don't believe in him just
because he promoted you.

577
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:10,719
Let me tell you.
He is a very cunning person.

578
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,479
His best tactic is punish you first
and then giving you sweets.

579
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,279
So, you can't trust him.

580
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,400
Stay away from him.
Be careful not to be his weapon.

581
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,680
I...

582
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
-Good morning, chairman.
-Good morning.

583
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,440
The HR department is on
the 12th floor. I'll press it for you.

584
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,840
I'm sorry, chairman.

585
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:43,999
I was too frank just now but
I didn't really mean it.

586
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,200
If you feel so unjustly treated,
you are free to leave anytime.

587
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,360
I don't feel unjustly treated,
I'm full of spirits.

588
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,440
If you think the way
I speak is problematic,

589
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,640
-you can tell me about it too.
-There's no problem.

590
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:57,799
Everything you said is just
a way to motivate me.

591
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,400
Have you cleaned the room?

592
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,200
Yes, I have. I'm airing the place now.
It still smells a little bit.

593
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,239
I think you can move in after one week.

594
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,960
This is so scary.

595
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,200
We really can't talk bad about others
behind their backs.

596
00:36:30,185 --> 00:36:33,360
[The ungrateful cat is going to treat us

if any of you...

616
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,200
have any secrets or sincere words,

617
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,120
say it out now while
you have the chance.

618
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:35,239
Come on. Let's go to the toilet.

619
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,559
-I haven't sung the English version yet.
-Sing it when you come back.

620
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,519
Sister Zhou Shi,
I have something to say.

621
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,759
Say it then.

622
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,999
I am Xun Ran.

623
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,559
I knew it!

624
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,279
You already knew it
since the start, right?

625
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,079
I just found out recently.

626
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,440
I thought that you are not ready.

627
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,120
So, I didn't point that out.
That's great.

628
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,880
Finally you admitted it. My idol.

629
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,400
My aunty wouldn't let me say it.

630
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
She worries that it'll
affect my normal life.

631
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,559
But I don't want to hide it from you.

632
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,200
Thank you for your trust, idol.

633
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:19,960
If I had known that I'm staying
with Xun Ran for so long,

634
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,640
-I would have even smiled in my dream.
-But we need to keep this a secret.

635
00:38:25,279 --> 00:38:26,360
No problem.

636
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,519
What is wrong with you today?
You drank so much.

637
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,559
I'm happy.

638
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,999
My bag.

639
00:38:52,319 --> 00:38:53,999
It's alright. I'm fine now.
Go back first.

640
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,440
-I'll keep you company.
-No need.

641
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,160
By the way, when you go back,

642
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,559
-remember to knock.
-Don't disturb them.

643
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,840
What do you mean?

644
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,239
Nothing.

645
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,559
I'll ask the attendant to
get you a cup of hot water.

646
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,279
Alright.

647
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,960
Lin Fei Fei.

648
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,759
You are not having a heartbreak.

649
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,840
Why are you drinking so much?

650
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
You are dumped by a man?

651
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,600
You have a loose tongue, little girl.

652
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,559
You haven't got hit before?

653
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,079
You are insane. What did you say?

654
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,920
You don't like that, right?

655
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,960
Try to speak the human language then.

656
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,120
No wonder no man wants you.

657
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,160
Let me teach you another thing.

658
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,920
Don't always talk about men.

659
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,400
Having a man is not
something to be proud of.

660
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,759
A woman has to choose the man.

661
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,960
Not the other way around. Understand?

662
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,600
Have more pride.

663
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,120
Fei Fei.

664
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,160
Long time no see.
Don't leave so soon.

665
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:21,400
Baby, what took you so long?

666
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,600
Darling, this crazy lady bullied me.

667
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,160
Why do you have such a foul mouth?

668
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,920
Did she get that from you?

669
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,239
Lin Fei Fei,
who are you insulting about?

670
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,079
Lin Fei Fei?

671
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,360
Darling, she is the one...

672
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,479
who was dumped by you before this?

673
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,799
I saw her vomiting inside just now.

674
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,559
Old woman without love is so pitiful.

675
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:45,840
Is that so?

676
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,840
Fei Fei. If you had known that
you'll live so depressingly,

677
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,600
you should have come to me.

678
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,519
You can beg me well.
I don't mind to take you in as well.

679
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,239
My baby is very generous.
She won't mind.

680
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,960
Come. Let's drink together.

681
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,519
Go to my house tonight.

682
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,400
Who are you?

683
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:10,600
I am her boyfriend.

684
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,960
What?

685
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,279
Lin Fei Fei, your taste...

686
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
He is too young.

687
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,039
None of your business!

688
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,120
Both of you are birds of a feather.

689
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:56,960
-Let's go.
-He hits him!

690
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,680
Let's chase them down.
