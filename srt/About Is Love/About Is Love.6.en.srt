[Episode 6]

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,280
This vase from Qing Dynasty
costs around 6.58 million yuan.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,360
This crackle glaze whiteware
costs around 8.43 million yuan.

31
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,879
You should repay your debts.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,399
Don't think that you can avoid this
because your men fled.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,679
If you don't repay us by today,

34
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,840
we'll wreck your house!

35
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,720
Mum!

36
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,360
Mum!

37
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,280
Stop it already!

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,679
She is young.
But it is rumoured that...

39
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,440
she's one of the successor
of the Snow Group.

40
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,039
But she's discreet
with her social media.

41
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,720
That's why we don't
have much info on her.

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,599
He Wei is some big shot now.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,599
He actually invited the higher-up
of a foreign luxury brand.

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
In the past, we only went there
to show our face.

45
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,519
This year, we might have to stay there.

46
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,399
But I need a female partner for this.

47
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,759
What is Zhou Shi doing right now?

48
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,039
She wanted to meet you just now.

49
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,840
I led her to the reception room.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,360
I wanted to tell you this too.

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,200
She got the nerves to meet me?

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,160
Interesting.

53
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,879
Is there anything else?

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,879
Ning Fei is out of the hospital today.

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,720
Is he staying in my father's
drawing chamber for now?

56
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:31,879
Yeah.

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,759
Mr Wei hangs around there
all the time when he was alive.

58
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,119
Does he think it's suitable
for him to stay there?

59
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,440
Help me do something.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,599
The chairman is at the eighth floor now!

61
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,560
Good morning, chairman!

62
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,079
You know how to act accordingly.
Have a sit.

63
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,119
Why are you here?

64
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,440
Take this.

65
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,560
Isn't this our Yun Ma scholarship?

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,880
Yeah, I got this from the college.

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,199
Here you go.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,239
Did you owe me any money?

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,239
It's for the antiques that
I've broken yesterday.

70
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,239
And for the bowl too.

71
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,320
Here's the compensation.

72
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
Oh, it's for those antiques.

73
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,959
For those,

74
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,399
I don't think this is enough for them.

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,840
I know it's not enough.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,519
But these are all I have.

77
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,239
But don't you worry,

78
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,480
I'll pay for them even if
I have to be a labourer.

79
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,560
With your current income,

80
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,040
if you want to pay back the money,

81
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,639
I think you have to pay...

82
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,000
until your grandchildren are born.

83
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,840
But girls with debts like you,

84
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:15,560
I think nobody would marry you either.

85
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,480
So this is a paradox.

86
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,119
What should I do then?

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm here already.

88
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,119
I don't have any money.
I only have my body to work with.

89
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,760
If you want to use me, just tell me.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,359
Why should I use you?

91
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,160
But you do have some backbones.

92
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought you would
hide from me forever.

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,919
I don't like to owe money.

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,560
Even if I went to jail for it, I would
still bear the responsibilities.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,840
Fine, I'll give you a chance.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,799
If you take this chance,
your debts are clear.

97
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,239
What do I need to do?

98
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,760
Sign a contract with me.

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,040
A contract for you to stay by my side.

100
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,119
A contract?

101
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:51,799
What do you mean?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,480
Is it a part time job or what?

103
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,239
What do I need to do?

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,239
You need to follow my every order.

105
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
I'll test you for a month.

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,160
If you manage to get through that,

107
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,079
I'll give you this amount every month.

108
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,320
Are you sure?
That's a lot of money!

109
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,280
Although it's far from
what you've owed me,

110
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,320
if you earn this amount monthly,

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,440
at least you can clear
your debts in this lifetime.

112
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,119
And not trouble your family for it.

113
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,519
Isn't this great for you?

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,399
So, this means that I need
to follow you for my entire life.

115
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:36,959
That means I can't be with
Brother Ming Cheng anymore.

116
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,440
If you think this deal
is restricting your freedom,

117
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,480
it's fine too.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,880
Just bank in some money
to Yun Ma's bank account monthly.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,359
Around this sum.

120
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
I wanted to see as well.

121
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:49,359
Which guy will want to marry
a girl with huge debts like you?

122
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,280
If the guy does appear in the future,

123
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,399
remember to tell me.

124
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,119
I'll be the first to give red packets.

125
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,160
Great expression.

126
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,519
And great punches too.

127
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:02,160
Go and earn some money
with this drive of yours.

128
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,079
I'll be expecting your money later.

129
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,040
Wait!

130
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,239
Can't you just let me
think about it first?

131
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
Fine, I'll give you some time.

132
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,639
Give me the answer by tomorrow.

133
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,359
Are there any questions?

134
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,280
Yes, I have.

135
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,600
Speak.

136
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,359
Why did you kiss me yesterday?

137
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
I was experimenting.

138
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,840
Why do you need to kiss me
for an experiment?

139
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,000
You're not compulsory for that.

140
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:28,359
It's just that you were there
at the time.

141
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,160
What kind of reasoning is this?

142
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,199
How can you just kiss me
like that because of this?

143
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,799
Did you ask for my permission?

144
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Why are you reacting in such a big way?

145
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,919
Impossible.

146
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,040
Is that your first kiss?

147
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,160
I...

148
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,799
It's not that!

149
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,480
I think it is then.

150
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,320
What has that got to do with you?

151
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,480
Listen.

152
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,799
I broke the antiques yesterday
because you kissed me!

153
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,280
You are responsible for them too.

154
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,000
Fine, let me give you a discount.

155
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,079
Just repay your debts for
30 years instead of a lifetime.

156
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,079
Take this back.

157
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:16,600
Spend them while you still can.

158
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,720
Are there any questions left?

159
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,160
No.

160
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,639
I found someone interesting.

161
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,879
You're here?

162
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,360
How's my painting?

163
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,639
Aunty.

164
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,399
Aunty.

165
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:15,840
Whenever I'm here,

166
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:18,519
I'll reminded of your teacher.

167
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:21,040
You.

168
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
You have the same temper as him.

169
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
You don't like to be restricted.

170
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,519
You like to follow your heart.

171
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,959
And just immerse yourself in arts.

172
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:34,639
In comparison,

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,720
Wei Qing is all about money.

174
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,079
He's selfish too.

175
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,840
He doesn't listen to us at all.

176
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,480
-If not, your teacher wouldn't...
-Did you meet Brother?

177
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,759
I did.

178
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,680
Never mind him. Let's skip this topic.

179
00:09:57,199 --> 00:09:59,600
Are you going to stay here alone?

180
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,999
Shall I stay here as well?

181
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,559
No need.

182
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,079
Fine.

183
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,920
I know you don't like
to be taken care of.

184
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:10,920
But,

185
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,999
I did request help from
the ladies from the lower floor.

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,639
I think they're nice people.

187
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,600
I'll leave for a business trip later.

188
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,399
If you need any help, please find them.

189
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,280
This is troublesome.

190
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,639
That's the whole point.
You need to trouble them.

191
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,600
Xiao Fei, sometimes,

192
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,959
you need the help of other people too.

193
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,280
Even if you need to pay them for it.
Understand?

194
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,879
I'll leave now. Take care of yourself.

195
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,720
Okay.

196
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,720
Goodbye, aunty.

197
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,600
Goodbye.

198
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
I've cleaned up the museum already.

199
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
I've counted the
broken antiques as well.

200
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,360
Do you want to have a look?

201
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,559
No need for that.
You can handle that yourself.

202
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,759
This is unexpected.

203
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,120
Miss Zhou wanted to
compensate them by herself.

204
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,680
Yeah. If it weren't for this,

205
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,360
I wouldn't know how
to keep her by my side.

206
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,600
What's wrong?

207
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,399
Do you think I'm
taking advantage of her?

208
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,600
You've been with me for a long time.

209
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,600
You should know my personality.

210
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,160
I'll do whatever it takes
as long as it gets the job done.

211
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,280
Moreover,

212
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,680
she helped the person I hated the most.

213
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,840
Did you do what I've asked you to?

214
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,240
I did. He'll be moving out after this.

215
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,559
Did you buy the clothes with the money
given by the aunty upstairs?

216
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,680
How is it?

217
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,319
Thanks to our financial supporter,

218
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,680
I can buy them without any worries.

219
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,079
Return the money to her.

220
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,559
Why should I?

221
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,120
I didn't steal the money.

222
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,040
She's willing to give them to us.
What's wrong with spending them?

223
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,759
You did spend the money.
But can you take care of him?

224
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,720
You can't even cook instant noodles.

225
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,559
Are you kidding? I can still cook them.

226
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,559
At least I didn't treat him like
a guinea pig, unlike you.

227
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,879
She's the only one left
in our house then.

228
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,720
The one that knows how to
take care of people.

229
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
Wait.

230
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,999
After she gave me this bowl yesterday,

231
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,480
she's always been in her room.

232
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,519
She's not out for supper too.

233
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,879
What's going on?

234
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,879
She went out this morning.

235
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,480
And she hasn't come back yet.

236
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,360
I think something happened to her.

237
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:28,480
Is it because of my bowl?

238
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,079
Chairman He said that
there's another set of it.

239
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,680
And they're quite expensive.

240
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:34,160
They're expensive.

241
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,959
Even if you fill the entire house...

242
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,639
with the Hermes bowls
that you've bought,

243
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,399
we still can't afford that set of bowls.

244
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:41,759
They're so expensive?

245
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,800
Where did she get it then?

246
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:44,920
I have to call her now.

247
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:45,920
No need to call her.

248
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,319
You won't know anything
if you call her like that.

249
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,439
Why?

250
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,759
Zhou Shi doesn't like to trouble people.

251
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,999
Unless she's really desperate.

252
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,439
Even if she wants some help,

253
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,639
she won't think of us first.

254
00:13:58,879 --> 00:13:59,879
Who will she approach then?

255
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,399
She'll find her senior first.

256
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,639
I think her senior is participating
in club activities today.

257
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,920
I'll have a look there.

258
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,120
Okay.

259
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,800
By the way, I'll keep the money first.

260
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,240
Don't worry, I promise you.

261
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
I won't spend the money.

262
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,800
Believe me.

263
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,439
Goodbye.

264
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,680
No, I mustn’t use it.

265
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,999
What should I buy? Some clothes?

266
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,240
You have the wrong password.

267
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,879
Can't you just reset it?

268
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,920
I only have one password.

269
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,319
Someone must've changed it then.

270
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,360
What happened?
Did you offend the landlord?

271
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,659
[This place belongs to Yun Ma Group.]
[Please leave in 24 hours.]

272
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,559
Did your landlord text you?

273
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,120
It's nothing.

274
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,280
How did you enter my house last time?

275
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,759
I climbed the wall.

276
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,879
Bring me there.

277
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,079
Wait for me.

278
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,680
It's there.

279
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,720
Where?

280
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:40,759
Are you a cat? You're so slick.

281
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,720
What did you say?

282
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,280
I told you to be careful.

283
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,280
Everyone is worried about you.

284
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,879
Next time, I won't let them be worried.

00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,800
this isn't the place for me.

295
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:25,880
I think it's here.

296
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,720
The real astronomy club is
smaller than I expected.

297
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,439
Hello.

298
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
Someone is coming!

299
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,159
My goodness! It's a girl as well!

300
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,480
Hello!

301
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,720
Are you here to join the club?

302
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,000
-I'm finding for Li...
-Of course she is!

303
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,079
Didn't you see the flyers on her hand?

304
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,199
Do you like astronomy?

305
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,439
It's fine. I'm finding for...

306
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,039
I'm glad that you like it.

307
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,679
We don't have many rules here.

308
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,000
But the entrance exam
is troublesome though.

309
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:01,600
Here, I have a set of 100 questions.

310
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,679
If you can answer
90% of them correctly,

311
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,520
You can become a member of our club.

312
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:08,039
Here.

313
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Come here!

314
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,240
It's rare for someone to come.

315
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,520
We must let her be at ease.

316
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,079
How can you ask her to do the exam now?

317
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,880
Aren't you scaring her like that?

318
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,799
You know the 100 questions
are quite tough, right?

319
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:20,840
What should I do then?

320
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:22,600
Our boss is very strict.

321
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,000
If she doesn't know anything,

322
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,959
she'll be kicked out anyway.

323
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,199
How about this?

324
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,880
We'll guide her through the exam.

325
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:31,720
That's the only way.

326
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you have a pen?

327
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,679
-Pen?
-Are you doing it?

328
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,600
Yeah.

329
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,520
Here.

330
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Did you notice that her eyes
are glowing when she's writing?

331
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,120
She's just like Li Ming Cheng.

332
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:51,520
I wonder what course is she taking?

333
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,000
Senior Ran Yu?

334
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,760
-Senior.
-You're here?

335
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,640
Nice to meet you.

336
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm here to hand in the paper.

337
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,600
The questions are too hard.
I didn't finish them.

338
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,640
Sorry for that.

339
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,520
Never mind.

340
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,120
The questions are too hard.

341
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,079
Even the astronomy majors
can't finish them.

342
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:07,480
Senior, it's normal
if you can't finish them.

343
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,880
I'm relieved then.

344
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,640
I thought I was too stupid for this.

345
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,039
Senior, that's not the case.

346
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,919
You are Kwang Hua University's icon.

347
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:19,199
Even if our university's icon
can't finish the questions,

348
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,480
I know you still have
some common sense in you.

349
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:22,480
Please sit.

350
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,520
-Senior, come here.
-I'll have a look.

351
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,159
Please sit down.

352
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,799
Senior, you...

353
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:35,880
What's wrong?

354
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,039
It's nothing.

355
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:38,400
The questions are too hard for you.

356
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
Senior, I'll ask you
some simple questions.

357
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,279
How many planets
do our solar system have?

358
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,520
Of course I know.
There are nine planets.

359
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,919
We have Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Mars,

360
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,439
Mercury, Earth, Neptune and Pluto.

361
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,480
My guardian planet is Pluto too.

362
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,760
What's the brightest star?

363
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,319
It's the Polaris.

364
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,319
In the Book of Songs, which planet
does the phrase July's fire refers to?

365
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,520
It's Mars.

366
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:07,600
What does Cassiopeia means then?

367
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,520
They're the fans of TVXQ.

368
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,319
Did you laugh at me just now?

369
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,600
Am I wrong?

370
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,840
What's so funny?

371
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:20,360
You are wrong in many ways.

372
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,679
In 2006, the IAU has classified Pluto
as a dwarf planet.

373
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,480
It's not a planet anymore.

374
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,799
Now, our solar system
only has eight planets left.

375
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:32,279
Not nine.

376
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,919
The brightest star is called Sirius.

377
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,079
Sirius.

378
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:41,559
The Polaris is only the 47th
brightest star in the world.

379
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:45,959
The phrase July's fire
refers to the α Sco,

380
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,919
or also known as Alpha Scopii.

381
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:50,400
It's not referring to Mars.

382
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,959
For the last question,
it's about common sense.

383
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:55,880
I guess you're correct then.

384
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
Kwang Hua University's icon,

385
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,840
the famous and talented lady,

386
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,360
I didn't expect that you would
be a barred spiral galaxy.

387
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:09,079
I learned something new today.

388
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,439
Where can I find Li Ming Cheng
besides this place?

389
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,919
Maybe at the Go club.

390
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,400
You're not here to join our club?

391
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,559
What's going on?

392
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:26,159
What did she mean by that?
The galaxy thing?

393
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,799
Barred spiral galaxy
is a spiral galaxy...

394
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,120
with a central bar-shaped
structure composed of stars.

395
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,760
And,

396
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:34,640
according to Hubber's classification,

397
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,000
the symbol is SB.

398
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,760
I'm going to kill her!

399
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:58,279
Which guy will want to marry a girl
with huge debts like you?

400
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
If the guy does appear in the future,

401
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,400
remember to tell me.

402
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,159
I'll be the first to give red packets.

403
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,039
You scared me to death!

404
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,279
Why are you so sneaky?

405
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,600
Shi Shi.

406
00:22:16,439 --> 00:22:17,720
Are you finding for me?

407
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
It's nothing.

408
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm just here to visit you.

409
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,799
Stop pretending. You would've
come in if you wanted to.

410
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You waited at the door
for 10 minutes today.

411
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,919
You must be in some trouble.

412
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,240
Tell me what's wrong.

413
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:44,919
Take this.

414
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,439
I'm sure the college is
pressing you for the fees now.

415
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,760
And it's the end of the month too.

416
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
I'm sure you're poor now.

417
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,199
I don't have much inside.

418
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,919
But it's enough for you to get by.

419
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,679
No! I can't take your money!

420
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,600
No!

421
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,319
The money is not under my name anyway.

422
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,679
Why are you rejecting my help?

423
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:02,240
If I can't help you with this,

424
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:04,319
how can I still be your brother?

425
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,199
I don't want your help!

426
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,120
Shi Shi.

427
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:11,919
What's wrong with her?

428
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,159
Did a stranger just glare at me?

429
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,279
Zhou Shi!

430
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,079
What's wrong with you?
Did Li Ming Cheng say anything to you?

431
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:28,319
I'm fine.

432
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,039
I just thought of something else.

433
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,240
It's this late already?
I haven't bought groceries yet.

434
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,400
What do you guys want to eat?

435
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,319
Hot pot.

436
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,199
Wait. Why are we talking about this?

437
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,360
Szechuan style or Cantonese style?
Spicy or mild?

438
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,279
Spicy, with some peppercorns.

439
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,520
Okay, I'll buy them now.

440
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
You go home first.

441
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,559
Wait, there's something
else I need to say.

442
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,279
She distracted me again.

443
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,400
Someone won?

444
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,279
I only left for a short while.

445
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:09,240
Who's the winner then?

446
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,840
Zhou Shi! Stop running!

447
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,000
She's just like her dad.

448
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,439
She's too fast.

449
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,520
Here!

450
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:52,159
Ning Fei?

451
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,840
Why are you here?

452
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,319
Did you run away from home?

453
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,959
But wait, you're staying alone, right?

454
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,880
You got chased out by the landlord?

455
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
-It's none of your business.
-Where are you going?

456
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,959
The park? Or the bridge pier?

457
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,840
Is there any decent place for you?

458
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,319
I'm sure you can't find one.

459
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,840
If I didn't find you,

460
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,959
will you just stay here for the night?

461
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,880
How long have you been squatting here?

462
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,199
Have you eaten?

463
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,799
I have.

464
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,840
Follow me.

465
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:30,959
Where are we going?

466
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:33,039
Of course we're going home.

467
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:34,720
Let's eat first.

468
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,720
I think the mushroom is cooked.
I'll have one.

469
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:04,120
I want beef.

470
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,039
I'll take the shrimp paste.

471
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,199
Who told you guys to eat?
Put down your chopsticks!

472
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,000
Aren't you guys
explaining anything to me?

473
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,559
There's an extra person in the house.
What's going on here?

474
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,319
How can he just blend in like that?

475
00:26:17,319 --> 00:26:18,880
This is ridiculous!

476
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:21,199
You. Who asked you to eat?

477
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,319
Put down your chopsticks!

478
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,959
You dare to take my beef?

479
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,520
You!

480
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,760
Okay, calm down.

481
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,319
I brought him back.

482
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,760
Just scold me if you want to.

483
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,000
Why are you angry at a kid?

484
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah, I was preparing to scold you.

485
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,439
It's fine if you bring him home.

486
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:38,679
But what's with his luggage?

487
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:40,319
Is he staying in our house?

488
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,400
If the lock is broken,
find someone to fix it.

489
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,480
Why are you staying
in your neighbour's house?

490
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,720
It's not that simple.

491
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,679
He was evicted from his place.

492
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,520
And Madam He is
on a business trip right now.

493
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,799
Just let him stay here for tonight.
If not, he'll sleep in the streets.

494
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,159
He can stay in a hotel, right?

495
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
The madam is so generous.

496
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,120
I'm sure he has a lot of pocket money.

497
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,159
She gave us 10,000 yuan per month
to take care of him, right?

498
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,360
10,000 yuan? What do you mean?

499
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,520
Fei Fei.

500
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,840
Are you taking care of Ning Fei
since you took her money?

501
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,559
If you send him back,

502
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:14,400
you won't get any money.

503
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:16,919
How much did you take from her?

504
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,720
It's not much. It's around 30,000 yuan.

505
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,919
You're quite daring, huh?

506
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,199
How much do you have left?

507
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,520
There's nothing left.

508
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,840
What?

509
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:28,959
Actually, there's some money left.

510
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:34,600
But I have nothing left after I bought
some clothes and a branded bag.

511
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,480
30,000 yuan?

512
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,799
We can pay our rent for
half a year with that money.

513
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,760
And you just spent it like that?

514
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,039
Fine.

515
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,880
Just let him stay here then.

516
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,559
But where can he sleep?

517
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,520
You're really capable.

518
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,880
You took the curtain from my wardrobe.

519
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,159
We should not waste resources, right?

520
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,159
With this, the living room
can be cut off.

521
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,199
And he can stay here then.

522
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,840
You're right.

523
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:05,959
Slowly.

524
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,840
Done.

525
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:12,240
I'm fine.

526
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,279
How is it, Xiao Fei?

527
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:19,799
This sofa can be your bed.

528
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,240
If you want to sleep at night,

529
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,640
just pull the curtains.

530
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,919
I'll get you some blankets later.

531
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,360
You just sleep here for tonight.

532
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,959
I'm doing things for him
yet he has the nerves to sleep now?

533
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,199
He's been outside for the entire day.

534
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,039
Just let him sleep.

535
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,439
Look at him.

536
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,039
He looks like the cat that comes
to our house occasionally, right?

537
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,840
You mean the cat
that does this to me?

538
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,720
Yeah, he looks like it.

539
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,799
The cat doesn't want to
be friendly to me even if I fed it.

540
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:59,760
He's closer to you than anyone else.

541
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,480
I'll not interrupt you guys then.

542
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,679
What are you talking about?

543
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,893
[Mother]

544
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:13,679
He's just like a cat.

545
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,360
Mum?

546
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I'm fine. How are you?

547
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:28,400
Dad, he's...

548
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,919
Don't worry, I'll settle the money.

549
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,240
I got the scholarship recently.

550
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,760
I'll send them home tomorrow.

551
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,919
Just use them first.

552
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,959
I'm really fine. Don't worry, mum.

553
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,480
Goodbye, mum.

554
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,319
Oh no.

555
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,159
Even with the scholarship,

556
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,880
I can only last until next month.

557
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,799
And I need to send some money back too.

558
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,199
And I'm not working too.

559
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:26,760
My goodness! This is frustrating!

560
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,360
I thought I could give back
Wei Qing his interests.

561
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,079
But now,

562
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,559
I think this is just
my wishful thinking.

563
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,439
The door is not locked.

564
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,079
What's wrong?

565
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,079
I'm hungry.

566
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,159
The noodle's here!

567
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:56,480
You ate a lot just now.

568
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,240
Why are you hungry already?

569
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,679
Aren't you hungry?

570
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,600
Now that you say it,
I'm quite hungry now.

571
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,400
You didn't eat much just now.

572
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,919
How did you know?

573
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,439
I was looking at you.

574
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,520
Why are you thinking so much?

575
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,000
You even count the amount you could eat.

576
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,079
Aren't you tired?

577
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,120
If you don't eat, you'll get nightmares.

578
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,199
You're so smart.

579
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,640
I want that egg.

580
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,840
Hey.

581
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,199
I don't like my surroundings
to be quiet when I eat.

582
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,880
Can you make some sounds?

583
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,439
I don't mean that.

584
00:31:51,439 --> 00:31:52,640
Never mind.

585
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:55,799
How about this?

586
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,559
I'll speak and you'll listen.

587
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,480
You can forget everything after this.

588
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,679
Don't take it to your heart, okay?

589
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:12,319
My dad owes a lot of debts.

590
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,679
I was eleven when that happened.

591
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,679
Every day, someone will come
and demand their payments.

592
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,199
My mum would hug me
and cry when that happened.

593
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,199
After that, we started
to avoid the debtors.

594
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,720
And we came to Ninghai County.

595
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,799
After that, I don't believe
in free lunches anymore.

596
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,880
And I hated to owe people things.

597
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,120
But what I hated the most is...

598
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
involving my family in troubles
because of my own mistakes.

599
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,439
But now, I committed
some serious mistakes.

600
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,199
Now I have more debts than my dad.

601
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,520
I think I couldn't
repay them in this life.

602
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,480
Unless...

603
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,240
I were to give something up.

604
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:56,760
Should I...

605
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,840
No.

606
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,640
Don't agree to that.

607
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,640
I think the same way.

608
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,039
That's enough for today.
I spoke too much.

609
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,000
I'll go to sleep first.

610
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:13,039
Just forget everything.

611
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:08,600
Should we wait longer?

612
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:09,999
Maybe she'll be here.

613
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:11,640
She doesn't know her situation.

614
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,479
She can only blame herself
if she loses this chance.

615
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,680
I'm here!

616
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,640
I was caught in a traffic jam!
I'm sorry!

617
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
It's too late.

618
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,799
I reached here just in time, right?

619
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,600
You are late in my heart.

620
00:35:26,759 --> 00:35:27,920
I have a meeting later.

621
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,160
Wait.

622
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,239
I promise you this.

623
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,440
Before I repay all my debts,

624
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,999
I will stay by your side.

625
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,239
You will follow my every order.

626
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
Fine.

627
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,360
You must stay within my 10 metre radius.

628
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,559
Fine!

629
00:35:44,479 --> 00:35:45,440
Deal.

630
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,239
What are you doing?

631
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm helping you to get used to this.

632
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:00,200
You will encounter this in the future.

633
00:36:00,479 --> 00:36:03,319
But don't worry, I won't
do anything too much.

634
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:07,279
Are you really signing
the contract with me?

635
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,799
You will give me the money, right?

636
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,360
Go and make a card at the counter.
You will need it in the future.

637
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,960
What card?

638
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:28,360
This is your temporary
authorization card. Please take it.

639
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,039
Can I retake the picture?

640
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,719
Please follow the instructions.

641
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,400
And take the chairman's lift.

642
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,120
Have a pleasant day.

643
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:40,440
Please follow me.

644
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,880
I take it as a no then.

645
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,840
Miss Zhou, please follow me.

646
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:04,872
[Is she his girlfriend?]

647
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:12,999
Hello, Assistant An.

648
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,319
Follow me.

649
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,319
I think I came to somewhere unexpected.

650
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,719
What now? Should I turn back?

651
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,120
Miss Zhou.

652
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,999
The chairman is waiting for you.

653
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,239
Let's go.

654
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,239
Why are you standing there?
Do I need to invite you here?

655
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:11,640
Celebrities' Charity Night?

656
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:17,479
It's the famous charity night with
many celebrities attending it, right?

657
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:21,519
What has this got to do with me?

658
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,160
You are cordially invited alongside
with your partner.

659
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:35,880
Partner?

660
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,200
Do you understand?

661
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:42,120
Am I your partner for this?

662
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:43,999
The charity night will start tomorrow.

663
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
Come to the office by afternoon.

664
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,440
No, I can't handle this.

665
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,559
Please find someone else.

666
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,880
Why do I need you then?

667
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,079
I thought I was here as an office girl.

668
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,479
I can make some tea for you.

669
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,160
But this event is too high-class for me.

670
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,120
I can't handle it.

671
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:58,360
Of course you can't handle it.

672
00:38:58,479 --> 00:39:02,479
It's impossible for you
to be a lady in one day.

673
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,640
You are too much.

674
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,039
But with my help,

675
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,640
although you can't be a lady in one day,

676
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:13,799
I can still turn you into a vase.

677
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,079
You don't lack them here, don't you?

678
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,759
Why do you need me for this?

679
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,360
Besides, even if you were to
put thick makeups on me,

680
00:39:21,479 --> 00:39:22,600
I can't be a vase.

681
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,640
I think you still haven't
understand the situation now.

682
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,360
I'll get straight to the point.

683
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:29,440
I don't care who you are.

684
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,640
I just need you to be within my reach.

685
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,039
Just like this tool.

686
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,719
It's for the best if it works well.

687
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,039
If it doesn't, I still have to use it.

688
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:41,640
But it must be you.

689
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,479
Of course, to you,

690
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:45,799
this is only a job.

691
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,600
You don't need to think too much.

692
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:48,920
Just follow my orders.

693
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,719
I don't understand.

694
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,640
Why must it be me?

695
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,680
You don't need to know that.

696
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,999
What you need to do now is
to memorise everything I gave you.

697
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
I will test you tomorrow.

698
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,160
If you're lazy about it,

699
00:40:03,759 --> 00:40:07,200
our contract will end here.

700
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,799
That's all I have for you.

701
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,120
Go and work hard on it.

702
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,519
Xi Xi, 22 years old.

703
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:21,960
A top student from
the Beaux-Arts de Paris.

704
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Specializes in oil paintings
and sculptures.

705
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,519
Both her parents are artists.

706
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,920
Signed by Yun Ma after
graduating from her studies.

707
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,600
She's a diamond in the arts world.

708
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,640
This setting is ridiculous.

709
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,039
Nowadays,

710
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:42,719
we need to package ourselves
even if we're just office girls.

711
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,920
Besides your identity,

712
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,799
you must remember the names
of all the guests as well.

713
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,719
This includes their faces,

714
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,440
identities, occupations
and relationships around them.

715
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:05,479
How can I remember all of that?

716
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,279
Why must a vase
memorise all these things?

717
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,600
And they all look the same to me.

718
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I can't remember their faces.

719
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,759
I can't remember them!

720
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:26,600
What's wrong with Sister Zhou Shi?

721
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,120
Just ignore her.

722
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,279
She's been like this ever since
she got involved with you.

723
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:34,440
What do you mean?

724
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,880
Finish your food and think about it.

725
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:40,960
Your master is too busy
to feed you today.

726
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,640
I'll take her place today.

727
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,200
You're a lucky kid.

728
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,880
Many people wanted
to taste my food, you know?

729
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,360
What's wrong? Is the food bad?

730
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:00,999
Your noodles are poisonous.
