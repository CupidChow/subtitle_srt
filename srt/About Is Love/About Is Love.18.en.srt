[Episode 18]

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
Why are you here?

30
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:09,479
I should be asking you that.

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,239
Shouldn't you be in
a gathering with Fei Fei?

32
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,679
Gathering?

33
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,239
I've forgotten about it.

34
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,399
Forgotten about it?

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,599
Do you know that Fei Fei
is waiting for you?

36
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,239
It's just a gathering.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,399
There's an even more
interesting show here.

38
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,479
You...

39
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,840
No, I have to tell Fei Fei now.

40
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,360
Wei Qing!

41
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,119
You want to escape?

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,959
Sister Zhou Shi.

43
00:02:58,119 --> 00:02:59,920
Xiao Fei. Has Fei Fei come back yet?

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,239
No, she hasn't.

45
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,879
What should we do then? Do you know?

46
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,160
That scoundrel of He Wei
didn't go to her gathering.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,440
-What?
-She is out of reach now...

48
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,280
and my phone is almost dead.
Help me call her.

49
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,360
Where is she? Send me the address.

50
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,479
-Wei Qing!
-Wei Qing!

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,920
Why do you like to swim so much?

52
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,080
You already swam twice
within these few days.

53
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,399
Twice?

54
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,879
-When was the first time?
-In your house.

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
You remembered.

56
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,879
When did you remember?

57
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,200
Two days ago.

58
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,759
-Why didn't you tell me that?
-What do you want me to say?

59
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,280
I can't say that we hug
each other after getting drunk.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,679
Why did I say that?

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,639
It's clear now. Let's go.

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,280
Wei Qing!

63
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,239
This way.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,320
Wei Qing!

65
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,600
My leg is cramping.

66
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
What should we do?

67
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,799
This way.

68
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,079
Did you ask me to come here
to watch this show?

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
Isn't this show interesting?

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,840
Even if it's interesting,
what had it got to do with me?

71
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,199
Wei Qing is always wearing gloves.

72
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,799
Have you noticed that?

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,399
Those are his ex-girlfriends.

74
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,959
From what I know,

75
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,519
they will hold hands
in the beginning but that's it.

76
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,079
That is the extent of their
body contact.

77
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,880
And, they will break up very quickly.

78
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,840
Don't you think there's
a problem with that?

79
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,519
Even if there's a problem,

80
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,919
what has it got to do with me?

81
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,880
We are all adults.

82
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,079
I know that you have affection
towards my nephew.

83
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,119
But I'm afraid that
he'll trick you and...

84
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,239
affect the collaboration between us.

85
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:53,760
Besides, he can't give you everything.

86
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,040
But I am different.

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,840
For the things that you want, I can...

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,119
You won't be able to...

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,199
give me what I want.

90
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,560
Don't worry.
It won't affect our collaboration.

91
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:23,639
Fei Fei. Everybody is
almost done with their food.

92
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,799
Don't tell me that your boyfriend is
still stuck in a jam at the viaduct.

93
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,160
He might be too busy to come today.

94
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,399
-We can just leave after we are done.
-You didn't lie to us, right?

95
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,880
You didn't just took a photo
with a colleague...

96
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,079
and pass him off
as your boyfriend, right?

97
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,199
Why do I need to do that?

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
Why do I need to lie to you?

99
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,320
Who knows.

100
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:47,760
You like to lie ever since
you were in high school.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,320
You always said that...

102
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,720
someone's boyfriend gave you a note...

103
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,040
or the handsome boy in school
confessed to you.

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,799
That's right. Back then, you were a
shot put player from the sports team.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,560
You were so tall and muscular.

106
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:01,760
Why would the handsome boy
in school fall in love with you?

107
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,799
That's right.

108
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,280
Fei Fei.

109
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,679
So many years have passed.

110
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,679
Why do you still have this habit to lie?

111
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,639
You are unbelievable.
Just admit that you are still single.

112
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,760
No need to act like
you have a boyfriend.

113
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,880
Look at you now.
You've embarrassed yourself.

114
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,199
Did you rent this dress as well?

115
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Let me take a look.

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
Let's see if the tag is still there.

117
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,840
You plan to return it tonight, right?

118
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,639
Are you done?

119
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,119
What is it? You want to hit us?

120
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,160
You practised shot put with these hands.

121
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,119
If you really hit us,

122
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,280
we won't be able to take it.

123
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,959
I'm sorry for being late.
I was stuck in the jam.

124
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,760
-Who is he?
-Who is he?

125
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,440
-Why is he here?
-I don't know.

126
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,280
Fei Fei, who is this?
Aren't you going to introduce him?

127
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:03,600
He is...

128
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:04,919
I'm her boyfriend.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,799
Boyfriend?

130
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,679
You are Fei Fei's boyfriend?

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,239
Why do you look different
from the photo?

132
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,199
He's not only different.
He's even more handsome.

133
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
Why do you keep quiet?

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,519
-Fei Fei.
-Don't call me.

135
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:30,440
Why are you here now?

136
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,040
Do you know what time it is?

137
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,480
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,639
Do you know how my dear friends...

139
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,759
talked about me because you are late?

140
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:39,600
They said, I'm a pitiful single woman...

141
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,680
who has to pretend that
I have a boyfriend...

142
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:43,480
and a liar who haven't cut the tag...

143
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,439
on my dress so that
I can return it anytime.

144
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,680
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

145
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,439
Go away. Don't stick to me.

146
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,120
-Go and pay the bill.
-Alright.

147
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,600
He knew that I hate it when he's late.

148
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,559
I won't forgive him tonight.

149
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,040
Fei Fei. He is really your boyfriend?

150
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,199
What is it? You don't believe me?

151
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,720
Of course I do.

152
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,759
Just that he's too handsome.

153
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,199
That's right. He's so tall.

154
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:13,920
Is he a model?

155
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:16,160
No. He's into art.

156
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,199
He's an artist?

157
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
He looks so young.

158
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,319
He's not even 19 yet.

159
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,360
May-December romance?

160
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,399
May-December romance?

161
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,040
I'm like his mother.

162
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,439
I have to take care of everything.
So annoying.

163
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:35,999
I've paid the bill.

164
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,959
That's more like it.

165
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,559
I'll be leaving for today then.
You can continue to eat.

166
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,360
Why are you leaving already?
Sit down for a while.

167
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:45,879
Yes. Your boyfriend just came anyway.

168
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,040
-Sit down for a while.
-That's right.

169
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,879
No need. Maybe next time. I'm tired.

170
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,399
You are tired? I'll carry you then.

171
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,720
What are you talking about?
There are so many people here.

172
00:09:55,999 --> 00:09:56,800
Let's go.

173
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,959
Don't think that I'll forgive you
just like that.

174
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,879
You can only sleep in
the living room tonight.

175
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:03,840
Do you hear me? Don't laugh. Hold it in.

176
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,800
-How do you know I'm here?
-I found it out from Sister Zhou Shi.

177
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,999
Nice suit. You borrowed it?

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,079
This is from aunty.

179
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,999
I never thought that
you can act so well.

180
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,559
Then, can I don't sleep in
the living room today?

181
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,680
In your dreams.
Sleep in your living room.

182
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,399
Your hands...

183
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,480
No need to hide it from me.

184
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:02,920
I've seen it many times.

185
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,959
What is wrong with your body?

186
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,800
Ever since I first saw you,

187
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,720
you've been acting strange.

188
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,360
Sometimes,
you want to get close to me...

189
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,800
and sometimes, you want to pursue me.

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,720
But the things you did were not
something that'll be done by a pursuer.

191
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:26,639
And today,

192
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,160
You avoid contact with others
because of this too.

193
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,360
You are so smart at times like this.

194
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,999
You look like you are
having an allergic reaction.

195
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:51,199
And a serious one at that.

196
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
My coursemates have allergies too.

197
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,079
Some are allergic to food...

198
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,639
and some are allergic to pollen.

199
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,920
What are you allergic to?

200
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,199
Could it be human?

201
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,240
More or less like that.

202
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,759
There are many reasons
for allergic reaction.

203
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,639
Human is just one of the reasons.

204
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,120
I think the hospital will be able
to find out the cause.

205
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,439
I won't go to somewhere like
hospital which is full of bacteria.

206
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,759
One time, Wei An knocked me
unconscious and...

207
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:28,360
sent me to the hospital to get checked.

208
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,439
In the end, they found out that there
are many causes for allergic reaction.

209
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,559
They need to check it one by one.

210
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,959
But he can't always do that.

211
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,199
So in the end,
the matter is left unsettled.

212
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,680
I'm really speechless with the way
you run away from your problem.

213
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
Are you born with it?

214
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,879
My body turned out to be like this...

215
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:52,639
after the age of 18.

216
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,199
I'll have rashes if I touch someone.

217
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,999
No matter it's male, female,
old or young.

218
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:04,120
There was no exception.

219
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,439
Except you.

220
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,319
Really?

221
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,040
No matter it's to hold hands,

222
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,759
to hug, to kiss...

223
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,840
-or to do more intimate things...
-Wait.

224
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Who wants to get more intimate with you?

225
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,439
In a nutshell,

226
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,680
you are the only one I'm not allergic to
even after I touched you.

227
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,079
So miraculous?

228
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,559
So, it means that...

229
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,920
the things that happened between us...

230
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,600
were just ways for you to test it out.

231
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,399
It was just for experiment...

232
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,559
and you don't have any
feelings towards me?

233
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:00,360
No.

234
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,160
So, it means that...

235
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
you don't really like me.

236
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,600
You are just doing an experiment.

237
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,319
I...

238
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:13,879
I knew it.

239
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,160
At first, I thought that you
are a psychotic person.

240
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,120
So, this is the truth.

241
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,120
Now that you know about my illness,

242
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,439
will you cooperate with my treatment?

243
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,840
No!

244
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,759
No way!

245
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,879
Don't think about it.

246
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,999
Then what you said just now
will be pointless, right?

247
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,759
Now I know.

248
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,160
You are just an allergic patient who's
in need of urgent treatment,

249
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,559
not a psychotic and perverted man.

250
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,959
Does it mean that...

251
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,480
you change your girlfriend
so frequently...

252
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,600
because...

253
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,600
Keep quiet.

254
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:08,879
I get it now.

255
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,840
Your body...

256
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
is not fully developed yet.

257
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
So, every time you have
physical contact,

258
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
you will reject that touch.

259
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,319
You have so many girlfriends...

260
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,759
because you want to hide...

261
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,199
Do you want to try me?

262
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,559
-I...
-I'm not allergic to you at all.

263
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,480
In order to further confirm the results
of my experiment, I need to...

264
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,999
have more intimate contacts with you.

265
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:45,199
Who are you trying to scare?

266
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,280
Let me tell you.

267
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,079
Don't be so arrogant.

268
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,920
Enough. Let's stop.
I'm having a cramp already.

269
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,079
Why did you keep running then?

270
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,920
Actually, it's not that
I don't want to help.

271
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:37,999
But whenever I remember that...

272
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,280
I need to do that if I want to help you,

273
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
I feel like I won't be able to do it.

274
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,160
Actually,

275
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,439
you don't need to do to
that extent to help me.

276
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,439
What other solutions are there?

277
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,639
My doctor had told me.

278
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:59,759
My illness is mainly because of
my psychological illness.

279
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,800
It's because deep down,
I'm rejecting others' touch.

280
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,799
That's why my body
will be allergic to it.

281
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,520
If I can...

282
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
If I can solve my psychological issue,

283
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,799
my body will get better too.

284
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,919
What do I need to do then?

285
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,039
You are the only one
I'm not allergic to through touch.

286
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,600
If you are willing to help me
to accept others,

287
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,279
maybe I can get better when
my psychological issues are solved.

288
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,840
This is easy. I can do that.

289
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,079
So, you've agreed to help me.

290
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,840
Maybe I owed you this
in my previous life.

291
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,120
But, only touch is allowed.

292
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,039
Don't worry.

293
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,319
As long as you don't force kiss me
when you get drunk,

294
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,439
I won't do anything to you.

295
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:48,919
You!

296
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,799
-It's painful. Let go!
-Are you going to mention it?

297
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,959
I won't mention it anymore!

298
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,760
This is so painful. You virago.

299
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:03,600
Please let me meet the chairman.
I can explain.

300
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,959
The chairman is not here.

301
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,279
I can wait.

302
00:18:06,439 --> 00:18:10,120
Miss Zhang, I think you know
the chairman's temper too.

303
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,159
He won't change the decision
that he had made.

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,959
I already informed the
financial department.

305
00:18:16,159 --> 00:18:19,199
As compensation, you can get
13 months' worth of your salary.

306
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,600
-Goodbye.
-Assistant An, I...

307
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,039
Senior Ran Yu?

308
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:25,360
Are you satisfied now?

309
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,919
Don't be so pleased with yourself.
One day, he will eventually dump you.

310
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,959
I was scolded early in the morning
without a reason.

311
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,120
I'm so unlucky.

312
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,360
-Good morning, Assistant An.
-Good morning.

313
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,079
Why isn't the chairman here yet?

314
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,559
He is parking...

315
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,240
Why is there only one table?

316
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:53,919
By the way,

317
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,959
from today onwards,

318
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,480
you've officially became
the chairman's special aide.

319
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,559
Senior Ran Yu is not
working here anymore?

320
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,279
This is the chairman's decision.

321
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:06,360
I don't know about the
specific reason as well.

322
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,840
Did anything happen when you
went to the salon yesterday?

323
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,000
Everything is fine. He has me.

324
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,720
Why didn't you wait for me, Zhou Shi?

325
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:19,400
Good morning, chairman!

326
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,520
Good morning.

327
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,640
Do you need anything?

328
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,240
No.

329
00:19:31,959 --> 00:19:32,959
You've worked hard.

330
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,400
This is nothing.

331
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,319
Just tell me if you need anything.

332
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,199
Is there anything wrong
with both of you?

333
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,199
-We are fine.
-We are fine.

334
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:51,439
What wrong can there be with
the both of us? You are so funny.

335
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,439
You must be hiding something from me.

336
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,240
Brother Ming Cheng.
You are back from business.

337
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,640
Shi Shi. Please notify the chairman.

338
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,679
Chairman. Brother Ming Cheng
is here to meet you.

339
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,480
What Brother Ming Cheng?
Ask him to come in.

340
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,079
Please go in.

341
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
This is the information.

342
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,520
Why does he look so serious?

343
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,039
Is he in any troubles?

344
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,159
Good morning, Director He.

345
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,159
Fei Fei. You look so beautiful when
you are so serious in your work.

346
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,600
I already did the programme flow
for this cocktail party.

347
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,159
Take a look at it when you are free.

348
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,919
No need to rush. Fei Fei, last time...

349
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
I don't have space for this.
Take it back.

350
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,480
You've pricked me.

351
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,480
Fei Fei. I did wrong that day.

352
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,000
I want to return your calls
but it died on me.

353
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,919
I know that you are busy.
This is my personal matter anyway.

354
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,039
So, no need to worry about it.

355
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,439
I know that you are angry.

356
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,159
I've reserved a table at
your favourite restaurant.

357
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,360
How about we eat together...

358
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,480
while I review your work with you?
Can we do that?

359
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,880
I already send the programme flow
to your e-mail. Remember to check.

360
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,159
Alright. I'll look at it now.

361
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,199
Director He.

362
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,959
Return this dress to the brand owner.
I shouldn't keep it.

363
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,760
Fei Fei. You are overreacting.

364
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,600
Although I don't know what grudges
you had with Wei Qing,

365
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:26,720
I hope that you won't drag me,
an outsider into it.

366
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,480
What did Wei Qing tell you?

367
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,199
He didn't tell me anything.

368
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,919
He Wei likes to bully
my senior since young.

369
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,760
He likes to take his things.

370
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,600
But after that,
my senior got better and better...

371
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,360
and he couldn't bully him anymore.

372
00:22:41,439 --> 00:22:42,760
I understand.

373
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,520
They are only two years apart.

374
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,959
Wei Qing already has
a business empire...

375
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,840
while He Wei has just
a magazine publisher.

376
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,760
-Or course he'll be jealous.
-That's why He Wei refuses to accept it.

377
00:22:53,199 --> 00:22:56,039
He always thought that my senior's
success of because of his father.

378
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,480
So, he kept on instigating his
own sister to suppress my senior.

379
00:23:00,199 --> 00:23:01,959
This is really the
grievance of the rich.

380
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,400
So melodramatic.

381
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,480
But what has it got to do with me?

382
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,039
Has He Wei pursued you?

383
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
I don't think he's pursuing me.

384
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,000
He's just flirting around.

385
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,120
Whenever my senior has a girlfriend,
he will try to make her his.

386
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,919
And then, my senior
will have a breakup.

387
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,159
After He Wei got the woman,

388
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,600
he'll break up with
that woman very soon.

389
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,480
But I am not Wei Qing's girlfriend...

390
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,480
That day, I wore his watch
to the interview.

391
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
No wonder he hired me.

392
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,039
So, everything he did for me...

393
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,159
was not because he likes me...

394
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,240
but because he thought that
I'm Wei Qing's girlfriend.

395
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,600
My value is even less
than that of a watch.

396
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:53,240
Lin Fei Fei, you are such a joke.

397
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,319
You are just a toy in his eyes.

398
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,279
But you are so smug about it.

399
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,120
It's his fault, not yours.

400
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:05,760
Are you pitying me?

401
00:24:05,959 --> 00:24:07,919
Of course I know that it's not my fault.

402
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,640
I just want him to know that...

403
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:12,439
I'm not someone that he can play with.

404
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm going to kill him if this continues.

405
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm not that close with Wei Qing
and I'm not his ex-girlfriend.

406
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,679
If you misunderstood because of a watch,

407
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,559
then I really need to apologise to you.

408
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,240
You've been chasing
a fake all these while.

409
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,959
If you think that you've
swallowed a gudgeon,

410
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,480
I can leave right away.

411
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:42,279
Don't go.

412
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,520
Alright. Since you already told me
the truth, I'll do the same too.

413
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,760
That's right.

414
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,400
I pursued you before this
because you are...

415
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,559
Wei Qing's girlfriend.

416
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,439
But now, I'm getting more and
more interested towards you.

417
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,360
It wasn't because you are
somebody's girlfriend.

418
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,240
It was because of you.

419
00:25:00,439 --> 00:25:02,959
You are the one and only unique you.

420
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,199
Stay here properly.

421
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:06,760
I won't let you go.

422
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:33,565
[Current Account]

423
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,159
You did well. I was not wrong about you.

424
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,279
Have you found out where the funds went?

425
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,319
I'm still investigating about it.

426
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,919
I think they already know by now that
you are investigating on the account.

427
00:25:45,199 --> 00:25:47,679
I believe that they'll set up
a countermeasure soon.

428
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:50,159
I want to lure them out.

429
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,600
But for the time being,
don't stay in the company.

430
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,159
-Wei An, make the arrangement.
-Alright.

431
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,000
That's it for now.
You can go back first.

432
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,240
If you have anything,
you can just contact Wei An.

433
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:03,559
Alright, chairman. I'll get going now.

434
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,120
Wait. Ask Zhou Shi to come in.

435
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
But don't tell her about this.

436
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,720
Alright.

437
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,799
Brother Ming Cheng.

438
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,199
Shi Shi, the chairman
asked you to go in.

439
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,439
I'll be leaving now.

440
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:37,000
Chairman.

441
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:39,079
What did you ask
Brother Ming Cheng to do?

442
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:41,159
Why did he look so out of it?

443
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,159
I already told you.
It's none of your business.

444
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,039
Take care of your own things first.

445
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,039
My things? What are they?

446
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:51,480
Thank you for willing to help out
with the treatment.

447
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,120
Chairman has already told me
about your things.

448
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,760
You told him everything?

449
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,120
Are there any other things?

450
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,279
-No!
-No!

451
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,559
Since you already decided
to do the treatment,

452
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,000
let's talk about the treatment plan now.

453
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,640
Treatment plan?

454
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,919
I haven't thought of that yet.

455
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,919
That's why you're here
to brainstorm with us.

456
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,079
Forget it. Go and eat first.

457
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,720
That's right. Eat.

458
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:38,880
Do you usually eat alone?

459
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,720
You want to have contact
with others, right?

460
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,000
How about you eat with me today?

461
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,600
I'll let you experience the crowd.

462
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,039
Let's go. I'll protect you.

463
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,640

00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,480
Could he be someone important?

487
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,959
You think too much.

488
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,959
He must be a famous actor.

489
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,039
-That is his assistant.
-Actor?

490
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,000
Actor? Let's take a photo of him then.

491
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:20,439
You can't take a photo of him!

492
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,279
I'm talking about you! You too!

493
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,199
You can't take a photo of him!
I'm talking about you!

494
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,760
Wait! Stand here. Don't move.

495
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,360
What do you want to eat?

496
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,559
You.

497
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,880
Where did you import your
food ingredients from?

498
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,079
Is it clean? Is it hygienic?
Is it up to standard?

499
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Do you change your oil every day?
Is it normal oil or recycled oil?

500
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,679
Did you clean the place yourself
or did you outsource it?

501
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,720
Tell me.

502
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,600
Forget it.

503
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,039
Chairman!

504
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,319
You better bring me to
your kitchen to have a look.

505
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,600
Chairman, do you want to get treated?

506
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,360
Since you brought me here to eat,

507
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,079
you should be clear
about the hygiene here.

508
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,279
But you always eat out too.

509
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,159
The restaurant I go, from the
pots and pans to the tableware...

510
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:12,079
that hold my food are made for me alone.
And before I eat,

511
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,799
I will go to the kitchen
to check their hygiene first...

512
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,880
and then I'll eat it.

513
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,279
You win. Do as you please.

514
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,159
Bring me to the kitchen.

515
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,400
Alright. This way please.

516
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,400
Hello, chairman.

517
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,799
Let me tell you.
My throat is itchy right now.

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,039
The oil in that restaurant
must be problematic.

519
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,840
How is that possible? I'm the
only one who ate all of the food.

520
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
-How do you know that it's problematic?
-I've breathed in the fume.

521
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,600
-The oil must be problematic.
-You better eat alone then from now on.

522
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,600
What are you talking about?
Although I didn't eat anything,

523
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,559
it's already a great breakthrough
that I've sat through the meal.

524
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,600
Stop circling around me.

525
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,120
-Stop taking photo of him!
-I'm talking about you!

526
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,360
-Stop taking photo of him!
-What are you doing?

527
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,319
I'm protecting you.
There are many people here.

528
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,480
No need. Why are you
still standing here?

529
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:39,959
Go back to work!

530
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:47,760
No need to go in.

531
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,159
Are you saying that
I can go back and rest now?

532
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,039
In your dreams. Go and buy me a coffee.

533
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,600
You...

534
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,439
Are there any other departments
that want to report?

535
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,159
Chairman, our department...

536
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,840
has faced some issues recently.

537
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,319
Tell me.

538
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,520
I just found out just now.

539
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,159
A newbie in our department
is suspected...

540
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,319
for reselling the company's
stock research report...

541
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:19,319
and leaking the company's secret.

542
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,559
-A newbie?
-Yes.

543
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
What is his name?

544
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:27,840
Li Ming Cheng.

545
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:31,799
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

546
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,840
Be careful.

547
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,520
Enough.

548
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Leave.

549
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,640
But Brother Ming Cheng...

550
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,400
I told you to get out first.

551
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,159
Alright.

552
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,079
Continue.

553
00:32:55,002 --> 00:32:57,002
[Brother Ming Cheng]

554
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,159
Why did he answer?

555
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,520
What can I do?

556
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,480
Brother Ming Cheng
is not someone like that.

557
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,520
I have the evidences here.
You are not the one to decide...

558
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,959
what kind of person he is.

559
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,079
I can vouch for him. Brother Ming Cheng
is a righteous person.

560
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:32,600
He never even cheated before.
He will never do something like that.

561
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,120
People change.

562
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,000
He is a poor university student.
He might be tempted.

563
00:33:37,199 --> 00:33:38,840
No. He won't do that.

564
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:41,520
Don't meddle with this thing for now.

565
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,600
I already asked Wei An to investigate
on it. He'll be suspended for now.

566
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,039
If it's true that he did that,

567
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,279
then he'll not only face termination.

568
00:33:50,439 --> 00:33:51,760
What else will happen?

569
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,840
Trust is very important.

570
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,959
No matter what industry you are in,
are soon you people lose trust in you,

571
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,520
it'll be a stain on his career forever.

572
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,400
Especially in the financial sector
where trust is gold.

573
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,520
If he is tainted with this problem,
he won't be able to survive here.

574
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,079
If this turns out to be true,

575
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,519
he'll be blacklisted
from all major companies.

576
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,120
You can't do that.
You'll destroy him.

577
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:13,680
Now, he did something that harms
the interests of my company.

578
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,120
I can deal with him however I like.

579
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:18,840
I'm not the one who'll destroy him,
he's the one doing it.

580
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,400
But can't you give you another chance?

581
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,200
What if he's just confused for a while?

582
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,920
You just said that...

583
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,160
he won't do it for sure. Why are you
saying that he's confused now?

584
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,160
I...

585
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,600
Enough. Don't meddle
with this thing for now.

586
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:37,920
I already asked Wei An to investigate.
If it's really not him,

587
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,039
I'll prove his innocence
when things come to light.

588
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,999
If you are still so garrulous here,

589
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:47,600
I'll call the police to arrest him now.

590
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,680
Don't do that. I'll leave now.

591
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,960
I believe that you'll
prove his innocence.

592
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:08,960
Zhou Shi.

593
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,640
Li Ming Cheng.

594
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,999
What should I do?

595
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,120
Stop crying.

596
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:30,640
My heart rate is increasing
because of your cries.

597
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,479
What if this thing...

598
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:34,400
really stains Brother Ming Cheng's name?

599
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,920
He is so young.

600
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,880
He has a long road ahead of him.

601
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,840
He won't do something foolish, right?

602
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,759
What if he turns evil?

603
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,640
He won't kill Wei Qing, right?

604
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:47,079
Stop. You are letting
your imagination runs wild.

605
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,120
Why are you being so dramatic?

606
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,600
I'm just worried.

607
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,799
When will Fei Fei come back?

608
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:57,840
You don't know how to
comfort someone at all.

609
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,319
Drink some hot water.

610
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,519
Actually, I think
the key to this issue...

611
00:36:09,799 --> 00:36:12,519
is that problematic account.

612
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,360
Account?

613
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,319
You mean the account where he
asked for your help last time?

614
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:22,920
That account is connected to
a large deficit from within Yun Ma.

615
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,840
A large amount of money
has gone missing.

616
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,960
I think there are two possibilities
in this situation.

617
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,400
First, the one who made the fake account
has found out about Li Ming Cheng.

618
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,279
So, he purposely discredits Ming Cheng
before he can be exposed.

619
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:37,239
Second, Li Ming Cheng
really did resell...

620
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,079
that account to another party
and Yun Ma found out about it.

621
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:41,960
Of course Wei Qing will
punish him accordingly.

622
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,039
Because he is leaking trade secrets.

623
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,559
He won't do that.

624
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:47,079
It must be the first one.

625
00:36:47,279 --> 00:36:49,479
Somebody is trying to discredit
Brother Ming Cheng.

626
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,719
I'll ask Wei Qing about it tomorrow.

627
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,279
I think you better don't go.

628
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,559
When Li Ming Cheng
came to find me last time,

629
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,719
he even asked me to sign a
confidentiality agreement.

630
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,319
If you find him now,
he'll be sure that Li Ming Cheng...

631
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,840
has indeed leaked their trade secrets.

632
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,759
What should I do now?

633
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,079
I think the key to this issue...

634
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:08,600
is not about Li Ming Cheng.

635
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,360
It's about Wei Qing instead.

636
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,200
Wei Qing?

637
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,719
Think about it.

638
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,360
Li Ming Cheng is just
a newbie in the company.

639
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:19,120
How can he get his hands
on something so confidential?

640
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:21,279
Someone must have put him up to it.

641
00:37:21,479 --> 00:37:22,880
Are you saying that...

642
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,799
Wei Qing is the one
who put him up to it?

643
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,440
So, it means that they
are on the same side...

644
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,600
and Brother Ming Cheng will be fine?

645
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,559
It's not as easy as that.

646
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,880
Think about it. There are
so many people in Yun Ma.

647
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,519
Why did he have to ask Li Ming Cheng...

648
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,279
to investigate about it?

649
00:37:42,799 --> 00:37:44,799
No matter it's his
qualifications or capabilities,

650
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,440
Li Ming Cheng is not
the best candidate for it.

651
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,120
If it's about trust,

652
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,079
then the one he trusted the most...

653
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,999
should be Assistant An
who's always by his side.

654
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,680
Why did he do it then?

655
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,759
Because he is insignificant.

656
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,160
Because he is insignificant,

657
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,640
the one who made the fake account
won't find out about him.

658
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,719
Because he is insignificant,

659
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,120
he can easily be discarded
if something happens.

660
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,120
Looks like...

661
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,160
your Brother Ming Cheng
has been drawn into a storm.

662
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,479
Brother Ming Cheng.

663
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,640
The more spacious it is,

664
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,479
the more magnificent it looks.

665
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,920
Who is it?

666
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:08,319
Bi Qiu Jing.

667
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,239
I thought you've found
a hiding place to lie low.

668
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,039
This is my hiding spot.

669
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,719
Shi Shi has already told you about it?

670
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,279
She is very worried about you.

671
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,120
Success or failure will be
determined on today.

672
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,400
This is a deal that you had made
with Wei Qing, right?

673
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,519
How did you know?

674
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,840
Is it very hard to guess?

675
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,319
Have you found out...

676
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,400
where the funds went?

677
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:57,880
Yes.

678
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,880
Is it connected to Wei Qing?

679
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:04,999
No need to look at me.

680
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,719
Anyone with a thinking mind
will be able to guess that.

681
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:10,120
Are you very worried about...

682
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,239
what Wei Qing will do to you now?

683
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:17,360
Since you are so good in guessing,

684
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,719
guess about what he'll do to me then.

685
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,759
How would I know.

686
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,479
Now, I can choose
to announce the truth...

687
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,440
or I can choose to pretend
that I know nothing.

688
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:34,239
Of course. The latter
will be a safer choice.

689
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,999
Look at these stars.

690
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:44,960
They look like they are just
hanging there randomly.

691
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,039
But actually, every star...

692
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,759
has their own orbits.

693
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,999
They'll never stray from their path.

694
00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:57,200
Humans are the same.

695
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:00,279
We have our own orbits.

696
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,799
And we have our own paths.

697
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,960
Actually, deep down inside,
you've already...

698
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,079
made your decision, right?

699
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,479
Since you already made your decision,

700
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:14,319
then do it according to your way.

701
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:17,479
March forward bravely. Don't hesitate.

702
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,360
What if...

703
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,360
I banged into Mars?

704
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,079
You'll be beautiful too when
you turn into a shooting star.

705
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:43,880
Assistant An.

706
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,519
Can you help me to plead with him?

707
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,519
Brother Ming Cheng's phone is still off.

708
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,559
He has yet to be arrested, right?

709
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,160
Do you think that your
Brother Ming Cheng is a villain?

710
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,440
Of course not.

711
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,160
Then continue to believe in him.

712
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,479
The worries you have now
prove that you don't trust him.
