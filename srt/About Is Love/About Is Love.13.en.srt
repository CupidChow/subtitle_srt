29
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,079
Is there anyone here?

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,799
Can anyone help me?

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,239
Editor He.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,160
There was nobody in the fitting room.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,479
I heard you shout, so...

34
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,160
You won't blame me, right?

35
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,720
No, this is my problem.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,119
Wait a minute.

37
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:35,599
I'll do it.

38
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:51,679
Take it.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,879
I don't think that's good.

40
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,239
I think it suits you more than me.

41
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,879
Really?

42
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,759
Moreover, this brand...

43
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,119
suits you too.

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
Really?

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,759
I'm meeting the director
of this brand on the 6th.

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,840
Do you have time?

47
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:12,080
Me?

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,280
I want to introduce our model to them...

49
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,360
and see if there's a chance
to collaborate.

50
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,759
Do you have time?

51
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,039
Yes.

52
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
What about the location?

53
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,000
Give me your phone.

54
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,879
My phone.

55
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,160
I think this is more convenient.

56
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:42,800
I'll contact you later.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,519
Okay.

58
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:47,239
And, next time when we meet,

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,800
can you stop being so nervous?

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,039
I think,

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,280
you look the best
when you act naturally.

62
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:54,119
Okay.

63
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,759
He really knows how to flirt.

64
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,679
That brooch should be expensive, right?

65
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,119
Fei Fei was staring at it
since 30 minutes ago.

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,799
I think, it's not that
the brooch is expensive,

67
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,199
the person who gave her that brooch
is valuable

68
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,639
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,399
I heard everything.

70
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
She has a fever.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
Who has...

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,160
He said you have a fever,

73
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,480
but you seem like you have...

74
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,079
I'm fine.

75
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,119
You don't know,

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,000
but He Wei is really...

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
the same as rumours about him.

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
Although I know he was flirting,

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,679
he did it...

80
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,840
naturally.

81
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,119
Especially when he isn't talking...

82
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:56,160
and smiles at you,

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,320
his eyes...

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,040
are filled with stars.

85
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,760
My heart was thumping.
He's too handsome.

86
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,320
No, I met He Wei before.

87
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,880
He wasn't like what you said.

88
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:09,919
This is the first time seeing you...

89
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,679
infatuated with a man.

90
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,720
No, yesterday I saw...

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,679
Saw who?

92
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,280
This is a new flavour, it's delicious.

93
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:20,799
Let me tell you,

94
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,639
He Wei bought all of these.

95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,079
You should thank him.

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
You can do it...

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,040
the next time you see him.

98
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
I'll have to wait until the 6th...

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,000
to meet him.

100
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,799
How old are you?
It's all over your face.

101
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,639
Why did you ruin my makeup?

102
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,679
How dare you do that?

103
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,519
Why did I suddenly think of that person?

104
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
No,

105
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,199
since when did you become so close?

106
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,399
No.

107
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,359
I'm disciplining him.

108
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,160
He was spoiled by you.

109
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,040
Don't touch my chocolate stick.

110
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,000
Can you steal it from me?

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,079
You can play this way?

112
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,199
I'm afraid they'll make it real.

113
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:31,720
Don't just talk about me.

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
Well, what about...

115
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,760
you and Wei Qing?

116
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,959
There's nothing between us.

117
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,399
I think we are friends.

118
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,000
Friends?

119
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,079
Look, even Xiao Fei lost his appetite.

120
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,359
Do you know how wrong you are?

121
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,959
Did you think it through?

122
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,119
I thought you wanted to escape from him?

123
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,880
Actually, to think about it,

124
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,600
although Wei Qing lied to me,

125
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,399
he didn't harm me.

126
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,199
Moreover, he did...

127
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,760
repay my dad's gambling debt.

128
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,880
I should thank him.

129
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,079
I think you have...

130
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,600
Stockholm syndrome.

131
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,720
The more others torture you,

132
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
the more you like them.

133
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,919
No, he's quite pitiful.

134
00:08:17,119 --> 00:08:19,000
He doesn't have friends.

135
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,840
I don't know what happened
between him and his mum.

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,079
His mum seems to hate him.

137
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:28,000
So, I pitied him and...

138
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,919
Since you've thought it through,

139
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,720
we can't say anything.

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,800
But, you have to be cautious,

141
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,160
don't be fooled by him again.

142
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:37,800
Don't worry. I'm not a fool.

143
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,040
I won't be lied to again.

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,040
Shut up.

145
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:42,680
It's extremely easy...

146
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,600
for Wei Qing to win your heart.

147
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,559
If you can't control yourself,

148
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,439
then your Brother Ming Cheng...

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,920
If you didn't mention him,
then I would've forgotten.

150
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,079
I haven't thought about
what should I draw for him.

151
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,800
Quick, help me think about it.

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,959
-Quick...
-Wait...

153
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,360
Stop eating!

154
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,199
You can eat yourself slowly.

155
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,519
I'm going back to my room.

156
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,559
Miss Xue Zi, this time...

157
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,399
you won't be going back
to the States, right?

158
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,879
Yes.

159
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:56,319
The company assigned me...

160
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,240
to oversee the management
of the China market,

161
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,959
find a suitable collaborator...

162
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,399
and expand the market in China.

163
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,319
I just got here recently.

164
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,399
I'll appreciate it if you'll
help me in the future.

165
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,160
You're too courteous, Miss Xue Zi.

166
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,199
Yun Ma really wants to collaborate
with Snow Group.

167
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:11,800
What do you think...

168
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,439
about the collaboration proposal...

169
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,639
proposed by Yun Ma?

170
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,319
We are interested...

171
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
in Xun Ran's designs.

172
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,160
I believe you know,

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,959
even in the international market,

174
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,360
Xun Ran is a popular designer.

175
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,600
Many large companies are
willing to spend money...

176
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,040
to sign him on.

177
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
But, unexpectedly
he signed on to Yun Ma Artwork.

178
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
How did you...

179
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
persuade Xun Ran?

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
We are simply acquaintances.

181
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,280
I didn't expect that...

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,999
the biggest chip for Yun Ma
to collaborate with Snow...

183
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,079
is Xun Ran.

184
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,800
Xun Ran is one of the reasons.

185
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,639
It's also important to see...

186
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,280
who's our partner too.

187
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:58,600
Looks like we have to collaborate more.

188
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,360
I remember when we met last time,

189
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,399
you were wearing gloves too.

190
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,759
I have mysophobia.
Excuse me for that.

191
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,439
People who have a strange habit
are more interesting.

192
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,040
But now, there are only
the two of us here.

193
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,519
What are you worried about?

194
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,160
If I want to take Xue Zi down,

195
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,199
I'll have to cure my illness soon.

196
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,800
Thank you.

197
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:42,720
Go ahead.

198
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,725
[Yun Psychological Clinic]

199
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:12,120
I slept soundly.

200
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,240
This is a psychological clinic,

201
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,840
but you treated it like a hotel.

202
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,559
I paid the fee.

203
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,360
You took my money but
didn't do anything. Isn't that good?

204
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,559
That means,

205
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,559
I have to thank you?

206
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,160
How are you recently?

207
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,600
Do you still have nightmares frequently?

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,199
Two to three times per week.

209
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,680
But even if I didn't have nightmares,

210
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,199
I can only sleep an average of...

211
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,600
four to five hours per day.

212
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,120
Then, what is the content...

213
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,639
of your nightmares?

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,040
Can you remember them?

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,439
The usual.

216
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,439
Screams, blood and my mum.

217
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,120
Will you consider hypnotherapy?

218
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,840
No, I don't want you
to be in my head...

219
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:03,720
where you can see whatever you want.

220
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,639
Okay, then...

221
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:07,920
Then let's talk about Zhou Shi.

222
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,120
How is it going?

223
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,600
Is your relationship going well?

224
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,079
It has improved.

225
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,759
We are friends now.

226
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,079
Friends?

227
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:20,800
This isn't your usual style.

228
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,480
By now you should be...

229
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:26,840
She's different.

230
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:27,999
I have to go slowly.

231
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,280
Moreover, it's good to be friends first.

232
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,360
At least we can get to know each other.

233
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,559
Why are you laughing?

234
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,040
I've known you for 10 years.

235
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,879
This is the first time I've heard you...

236
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,480
talk about friends.

237
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,519
Moreover, this is
my first time seeing you...

238
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,559
talking about someone...

239
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,360
in a relaxing manner.

240
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:57,160
Do you remember
what did you look like...

241
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,160
the first time you came to me?

242
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,360
Of course I do.

243
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,639
Every time, after he...

244
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,879
had skin contact with others,

245
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,399
red rashes will appear...

246
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,840
on that part of his body.

247
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,120
Although the rashes...

248
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,680
will disappear after a few hours,

249
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,120
it will recur when
the same thing happens again.

250
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,199
This doesn't look like vasculitis.

251
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,439
I think it's just a normal...

252
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,759
skin allergy.

253
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,559
You can go to the hospital
for an allergy test.

254
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,040
Then, get some histamines.

255
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,399
You should recover by then.

256
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:30,840
The same thing again.

257
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,519
Look,

258
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,680
I said it isn't necessary to come.

259
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,999
Yet, you didn't believe me.

260
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,959
Mysophobia.

261
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,559
How long has he been like this?

262
00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:55,920
Around six months.

263
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
Although he had
slight mysophobia previously,

264
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,399
it wasn't that serious.

265
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,680
I don't know the cause exactly.

266
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,079
He never told me about that.

267
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,559
I saw many mysophobia patients.

268
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,959
But this is the first time I saw...

269
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,800
a patient with allergic reaction.

270
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,800
18 years old.

271
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,840
No family history for allergic reactions
or a history of psychological problems.

272
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,680
So, this is an acute allergic reaction.

273
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,999
Did he undergo an allergy test?

274
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Surely he's not only
allergic to people, right?

275
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,959
He thinks that the hospital is dirty.

276
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,559
He wouldn't go there for tests.

277
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,920
If your clinic wasn't just...

278
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,639
a psychological clinic,

279
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,199
he wouldn't come at all.

280
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,160
18 years old.

281
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,920
Then you have to contact his parents...

282
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,800
to arrange for a full
psychological check-up.

283
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,680
No need.

284
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,079
In my mum's eyes,

285
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,759
a stray cat is more important than me.

286
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,759
What about your dad?

287
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,800
Don't bother, okay?

288
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,600
Just check...

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,079
and prescribe medicines.

290
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,759
As long as you can cure me,

291
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,879
you will get your pay, okay?

292
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:16,360
Party? Of course I'm going.

293
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,800
Wait for me, I'll pick you up.

294
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,879
You're going to a party?

295
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,240
What's wrong?

296
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,480
What's wrong?

297
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,559
Do you know
a severe allergic reaction...

298
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:32,280
will trigger shock and disseminated
intravascular coagulation?

299
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,879
You're going to the party
with your condition?

300
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,480
Because I'm in this condition,

301
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,399
I have to go to the party.

302
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Maybe there will be...

303
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,920
a woman that won't...

304
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,120
trigger my allergic reaction.

305
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
Let me tell you.
Don't bother about my private life.

306
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,199
Just cure my illness, get it?

307
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,319
Okay?

308
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,199
You were like a...

309
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:57,480
small hedgehog.

310
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,519
Other people couldn't go near you.

311
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,360
So what?

312
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,199
It was just a front I put on.

313
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
But, you did a great job.

314
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,199
You went through it yourself.

315
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:12,199
Look, you even have a friend now.

316
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,760
Zhou Shi is your lucky star.

317
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,279
Whether or not we can be friends...

318
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,880
depends on...

319
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,520
me passing her test.

320
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
What do you mean?

321
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,600
I came over this time...

322
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,840
not to just sleep,

323
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,400
I also need your help.

324
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,600
Okay.

325
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,039
In a situation without spending money...

326
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,360
nor giving presents,

327
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,799
how can I treat a girl well?

328
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,959
This is her test?

329
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,919
She is interesting.

330
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,159
You're a female too.

331
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:53,799
Speak nicely.

332
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:59,840
As a female, help me out.

333
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,799
It's all written in the Internet, right?

334
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,120
Men shouldn't tell women
to drink more water...

335
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,240
whenever there's a problem.

336
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,199
Just do that.

337
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,760
Okay, I'll be serious.

338
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,640
Compared to men, women...

339
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,439
are more fickle.

340
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,679
For example,

341
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,039
they might like something a minute ago,

342
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,400
but the next minute,
they might already hate it.

343
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
Women want men to...

344
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,120
pay attention to them.

345
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,679
So, you can try...

346
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,240
paying attention to her.

347
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,799
For example,

348
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,360
you can try to understand
what she needs the most.

349
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,600
Even if the outcome is not desirable,

350
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,760
but your sincerity...

351
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,240
can touch her.

352
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,600
But, women won't..

353
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,079
make it clear...

354
00:18:43,199 --> 00:18:45,159
about what they want, right?

355
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,559
How can I guess that?

356
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,120
Women want...

357
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
men to guess what's on their mind.

358
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,439
But, this doesn't mean that...

359
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,279
they won't tell their friends...

360
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
about their feelings.

361
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,039
Can you take that pair down
for me to try?

362
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:11,679
-Okay.
-Thank you.

363
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,840
Miss, have you decided on
which pair to buy?

364
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll look around first.

365
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:29,840
Wrap them all up.

366
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,760
Li Ming Cheng's birthday?

367
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,199
Miss Zhou is planning to confess
her feelings during his birthday party.

368
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,240
Again?

369
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:47,520
Why won't she give up?

370
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:50,000
Find out what Li Ming Cheng likes.

371
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:51,400
Buy that for Zhou Shi.

372
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
Miss Zhou has already
prepared a present.

373
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,840
Then, book...

374
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,439
a romantic restaurant for hm.

375
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,439
I think compared to external factors,

376
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
Miss Zhou would care more about...

377
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,640
whether or not
her confession will succeed.

378
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,199
Then, find a few staff from
the publicity department...

379
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,240
and send them to their college.

380
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:09,880
Okay.

381
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,199
You're here?

382
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,159
What is this?

383
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,079
The second present in your list.

384
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
A model of the solar system.

385
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,079
Really?

386
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,600
But, this is a 2D version.

387
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,799
You don't get it?

388
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:56,400
You drew...

389
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
the solar system before, right?

390
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes, but what does that
have to do with this?

391
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,760
Focusing on the scaling aspect,

392
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:05,120
that diagram you drew
was completely wrong.

393
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,400
In fact, to draw the solar system...

394
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,120
on a piece of A4 paper
using the correct scale...

395
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:10,439
would be an impossible task.

396
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:11,880
Yes.

397
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,919
But, that was just a normal diagram.

398
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,919
In reality,

399
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,319
nobody can draw it using
the correct scale, right?

400
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,840
Is this the attitude...

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,120
of a scientific researcher?

402
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,000
You're a top physics student.

403
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,679
Can you see this?

404
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:31,640
This is a speck of toner.

405
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,840
Of course, you can't see it
with the naked eye...

406
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,319
as it has a diameter of 4µm,

407
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,880
This is the smallest printing unit...

408
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,640
on paper.

409
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,959
Imagine this speck of charcoal
is the moon.

410
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,720
How many papers
do we need approximately...

411
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
to print out the whole solar system?

412
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,679
Wait, let me calculate.

413
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,039
If one speck of toner
has a diameter of 10µm,

414
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,039
then the diameter of
the moon is 3500 km.

415
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:57,039
The ratio is 1:35x10x^11.

416
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,400
The distance between Neptune
and earth is 10 astronomical unit.

417
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,199
One astronomical unit is 1.5 billion km.

418
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,480
Then, according to
the scale I'll need...

419
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,679
-One...
-169 sq.m.

420
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,079
If we calculate the size of A4 paper,

421
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:11,039
we'll need more than
2700 pieces of paper.

422
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,360
Which is the number of papers
you have in your hands.

423
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,400
So?

424
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,640
You're giving me
more than 2700 pieces of paper...

425
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,520
to let me draw by myself?

426
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,439
Of course.

427
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,600
Didn't we agree that...

428
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
the time and method
would be decided by me?

429
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,919
My present is...

430
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,919
pointing out your logical errors.

431
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,240
You don't have to thank me.
We are both in science stream.

432
00:22:28,439 --> 00:22:30,120
It's should be an exciting thing...

433
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,039
for others to point out
your logical error.

434
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,039
I've never experienced
this happiness before.

435
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,720
I really envy you.

436
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,360
I'm defeated.

437
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,520
Isn't this normal?

438
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,000
Aren't you used to it yet?

439
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,959
Don't think that...

440
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,640
I'll keep losing to you.

441
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:46,120
So what if you lose?

442
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:48,679
I lose to Zhou Shi in cooking.

443
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,880
I lose to Ning Fei in drawing.

444
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,760
I also lose to Lin Fei Fei
in dressing up.

445
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,039
But, so what?

446
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,279
Will remembering
all of that make me happy?

447
00:22:56,439 --> 00:22:57,159
But,

448
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,679
what if I have to win once?

449
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,600
Up to you.

450
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,240
If the opponent is boring,

451
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,520
what's the point...

452
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,840
of winning 100 times?

453
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,559
You're a bore.

454
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,400
He doesn't suit Zhou Shi at all.

455
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,959
I don't get what he likes.

456
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,840
Hello, friend.

457
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,520
Can I interview you?

458
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,520
Sure.

459
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,159
Why did you ask me to come in a hurry?

460
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,480
I have something to show you.

461
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:42,360
My name is Li Ming Cheng.

462
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,919
I'm a fourth year student studying
physics in Guang Hua University.

463
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,720
Brother Ming Cheng?

464
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,600
Watch it carefully.

465
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,840
Do you have a girlfriend?

466
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,039
No.

467
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,640
Do you have someone that you like?

468
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,679
No, why are you asking this?

469
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,720
We just want to know...

470
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,799
about the relationship status
of university students.

471
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,480
Then what is your...

472
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,720
ideal type?

473
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,720
My ideal type?

474
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,319
Smart.

475
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,079
What about her appearance?

476
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,880
Normally, she wears glasses.

477
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,480
She has no makeup or light makeup on.

478
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,199
Her hair is short, until this length.

479
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,840
She has fringe.

480
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:32,600
Normally, she likes
to wear casual clothes.

481
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,720
She has a big heart and is direct.

482
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,240
Just like a guy.

483
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,360
So?

484
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,760
What do you mean?

485
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,840
Aren't you going to confess your feelings
to Ling Ming Cheng...

486
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,799
on his birthday?

487
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:51,679
How do you know that?

488
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,360
You don't need to know that.

489
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,880
Let me ask you,
do you want to succeed or not?

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,959
Of course I do.

491
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,159
Follow me.

492
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,520
What are you doing?
Are you done?

493
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,919
It feels strange.

494
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,360
Come out. Let me see.

495
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,319
Why are you laughing?
Don't I look good?

496
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,319
What is this?

497
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,679
Not bad.

498
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,559
I think this is simple.

499
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:44,360
This is too plain.

500
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,640
Why would Brother Ming Cheng like
someone like that?

501
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,120
That's hard to say.

502
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,959
Maybe Li Ming Cheng
likes girls who are natural.

503
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,559
I won't trust you.

504
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,039
I think this is better.

505
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:08,600
What do you think?

506
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,400
She looks youthful.

507
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
Really?

508
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,079
I think I look good in this.

509
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,240
Don't you know it yourself?

510
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Change it.

511
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,720
Okay, take a look now.

512
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:34,559
Wei Qing.

513
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,720
What are you doing? You're a bear!

514
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:43,360
Wei An!

515
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,880
Wei An!

516
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,319
How do I look?

517
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,159
Almost done.

518
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,640
Look at the mirror yourself.

519
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:06,559
Why does this look familiar?

520
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,039
Your image is done.

521
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,400
Do you know why did you fail last time?

522
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,679
Because you lost...

523
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:14,919
my ring and letter.

524
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,600
No, it was because
you weren't confident enough.

525
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,120
From tomorrow onwards,

526
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,120
I'll arrange a special
training session for you.

527
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,679
Quick, change back to your clothes.
I'll send you home.

528
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:24,959
Okay.

529
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,319
Are you really helping Miss Zhou
to pursue Li Ming Cheng?

530
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,799
Li Ming Cheng doesn't like Zhou Shi.

531
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,520
But, if I don't let her...

532
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,720
try it herself,

533
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,120
I'm scared she will regret it.

534
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,520
Sister Zhou Shi.

535
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,439
You're alone at home?

536
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,520
I'm hungry.

537
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:19,439
I'll cook for you later.

538
00:29:19,439 --> 00:29:20,199
Okay.

539
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,240
You're drawing? Let me take a look.

540
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,559
You draw really well.

541
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,959
I can't be compared to you.

542
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,000
I have always wanted to ask you.

543
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,480
Your drawing style
is similar to Xun Ran.

544
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,199
Are you imitating him?

545
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:39,240
Yes.

546
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,520
You're good at imitating him.

547
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,199
I imitated him too.

548
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,559
But, I can't imitate his essence.

549
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,799
But your drawing...

550
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,720
is similar to his.

551
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,520
You must have been
imitating him for a long time.

552
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,120
By the way, I heard that...

553
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,240
you learnt drawing from Wei Qing's dad.

554
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,720
Yes.

555
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,159
Can you tell me about him?

556
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,120
Uncle.

557
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,439
You can draw well.

558
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,039
Xiao Fei,

559
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,159
if your dad is still alive,

560
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,439
he'll be proud of you.

561
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,360
Wei Qing.

562
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,600
Look at Xiao Fei's drawing.

563
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,760
What do you think?

564
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,799
Although Xiao Fei's technique
is still amateur,

565
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,760
you can feel passion...

566
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,439
in each of his drawings.

567
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,400
Although he doesn't like to talk,

568
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:52,360
drawing became his only way to
communicate with the world.

569
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,720
I hope you can reach this level too.

570
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,319
Now, you can draw well,

571
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,000
but your drawing...

572
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,199
lacks passion.

573
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,760
Looks like Xiao Fei will be...

574
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:16,480
inheriting my talent.

575
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,079
Thank you, uncle.

576
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,720
You're doing a good job.

577
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:22,799
Here, if...

578
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:25,439
Senior.

579
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,559
What's wrong?

580
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,079
If your senior...

581
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,360
can use his anger...

582
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,079
to draw, that will be great.

583
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,679
Uncle thought highly of him.

584
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,159
So, he was strict...

585
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,120
to get the most out of him.

586
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,400
But, Wei Qing...

587
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:52,039
never understood his intentions.

588
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,799
Then what about him and his mum?

589
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,360
Why does his mum hate him?

590
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,720
Because uncle's death...

591
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,240
It's all your fault!

592
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,159
You caused your dad's death,

593
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,679
do you know? You're an unfilial son!

594
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,520
Chairman He...

595
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,480
You caused his death!

596
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,919
Why do I have a son like this?

597
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,159
Auntie thinks that...

598
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:31,640
uncle's death was related to him.

599
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,199
So, she hates him.

600
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,159
Then, how did...

601
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,760
Wei Qing's dad die?

602
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,600
Auntie didn't tell me about it.

603
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,600
I didn't expect that Wei Qing's family
will be this complicated.

604
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,360
Do you like him?

605
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,840
What are you talking about?
Impossible.

606
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,240
Actually, he isn't that bad.

607
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,520
He's only bad some times.

608
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,439
I know.

609
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,400
Okay, I'll go and cook for you.

610
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,199
I'm back.

611
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,039
You're back? I'm going to cook.

612
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:06,360
Come and help me.

613
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,400
Okay.

614
00:33:08,439 --> 00:33:12,000
Normally, she wears glasses.

615
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:15,279
She has no makeup or light makeup on.

616
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,159
Her hair is short, until this length.

617
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,760
She has fringe.

618
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,439
Why does this look familiar?

619
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:27,840
What are you thinking about?

620
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,199
Nothing.

621
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:32,319
Aren't you going to cook?

622
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,039
I'll go and change.

623
00:33:34,959 --> 00:33:35,799
Okay.

624
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,679
Brother Ming Cheng...

625
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,000
likes her?

626
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:52,079
Someone that I like?

627
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,799
Yes, do you have one?

628
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,600
Why is this question popular nowadays?

629
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,760
What?

630
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:00,240
Nothing. Why are you asking this?

631
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,319
I'm just asking.

632
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,959
Brother Ming Cheng,
you aren't young anymore.

633
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,199
You should consider...

634
00:34:06,199 --> 00:34:07,520
about your relationship.

635
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,719
You,

636
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,279
if you use your brain to study,

637
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,960
you'd have pass the CET-4 ages ago.

638
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,239
Do you have one?
Tell me.

639
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,479
-No.
-Really?

640
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,680
You've been in college for four years.

641
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,880
You didn't fall in love with anyone?

642
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,640
No.

643
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,160
Okay.

644
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,239
By the way, do you remember Bi Qiu Jing?

645
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,279
Bi Qiu Jing?

646
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:37,039
Yes, what's wrong with her?

647
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,400
What do you think of her?

648
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,239
Both of you are top students.

649
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,400
You should have many common topics.

650
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,479
Her?

651
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,200
Compared to her,

652
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,120
I'm not a top student.

653
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,920
She's much more smarter than me.

654
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,519
Moreover, she's more
open minded than me.

655
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,079
This is the first time I've seen you...

656
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,440
compliment someone like that.

657
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,400
Then, is she your ideal type?

658
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,999
What ideal type?

659
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,479
You're saying it like
we're on a dating show.

660
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,079
If I have to say it,

661
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,759
she's a rival...

662
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,640
that I want to catch up to.

663
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,920
Just a rival?

664
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:17,120
Of course.

665
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,880
Although she often laughs at me,

666
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,479
I want to win at least once.

667
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,079
You can do it, Brother Ming Cheng.

668
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:25,319
I believe that you can win one day.

669
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,799
You don't sound confident at all.

670
00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:30,559
You think she's better
than me too, right?

671
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,600
No. You're the best to me.

672
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,840
Let's go to class.

673
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,600
Okay.

674
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,600
Do you have class later?

675
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,039
Yes, one more class.

676
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,880
I don't have class later.
Can I come along?

677
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:47,400
It's a physics class.
Can you understand?

678
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,960
Yes...
I like physics.

679
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,319
When did you like physics? Good.

680
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,719
Where is the class?

681
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:04,039
Great.

682
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,400
From today onwards,

683
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,360
you'll be the queen
of Li Ming Cheng's heart.

684
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,039
Be confident.

685
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,079
Confident...

686
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:19,600
Then, what should I do next?

687
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:20,680
Confess your feelings.

688
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,600
To whom?

689
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,680
To me, of course.

690
00:36:28,279 --> 00:36:29,319
From now on,

691
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:31,079
I'm your Brother Ming Cheng.

692
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,200
-You can start now.
-Are you joking? This is embarrassing.

693
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,079
Do you want to succeed?

694
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,719
You can begin when you're ready.

695
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,239
Brother Ming Cheng.

696
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:58,600
Are you going to bite me?

697
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,400
Can you be more natural?

698
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,880
Brother Ming Cheng.

699
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,479
Are you awake?

700
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,079
Put more feelings into it, okay?

701
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,400
Brother Ming Cheng.

702
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,759
Are you going to a fight?

703
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:14,759
Can you be more gentle?

704
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,160
Gentle, get it?

705
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:18,719
I won't practise anymore!

706
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,759
I couldn't do it well.
You kept laughing at me.

707
00:37:24,759 --> 00:37:26,519
I'll stop laughing at you, okay?

708
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,920
Let's do this again. But,

709
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,200
you have to treat me like...

710
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,440
your Brother Ming Cheng.

711
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,039
Be more passionate, okay?

712
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,799
But, I can't do that.

713
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:40,680
I know...

714
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,279
why I can't.

715
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,400
It's because you don't look
like Brother Ming Cheng at all.

716
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,479
Then, what should we do?

717
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,960
Why don't you dress up like him?

718
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,759
Impossible.

719
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:56,999
Then, I won't practise anymore.

720
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:16,440
Why are you laughing?

721
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,200
Didn't I do this for you?

722
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,799
Okay, thank you.

723
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,160
But, actually you look good...

724
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,999
in this outfit.

725
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,279
Don't use that tactic.

726
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:32,999
I changed my outfit.

727
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,559
You don't have an excuse now, right?

728
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,759
Can we start now?

729
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:37,719
Go ahead.

730
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:49,600
Go ahead.

731
00:38:58,559 --> 00:38:59,719
Brother Ming Cheng.

732
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,239
I liked you...

733
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,999
since we were in primary school.

734
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,719
Do you know that?

735
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,680
Thanks to you,

736
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:13,719
I got my first full marks.

737
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,519
I was delighted.

738
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,640
I wanted to tell you about that.

739
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:21,759
But,

740
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:24,880
I fell into the river.

741
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,960
My test paper was soaked.

742
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,319
That was the first time
I failed in confessing my feelings.

743
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,079
Later on...

744
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,120
Later on, I never got
100 marks in exam anymore.

745
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,079
So, I never tried to
confess my feelings anymore.

746
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,239
I was afraid that
you'll think I'm foolish.

747
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I was afraid that I'll disappoint you.

748
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,440
So, I tried my best to catch up.

749
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,840
I hope that one day,
I could catch up to you.

750
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:58,440
But, I realised...

751
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,200
you drifted apart from me.

752
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
I was tired of chasing after you.

753
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,360
Maybe because I was too foolish.

754
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,519
But, I still like you.

755
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,960
I forced myself to catch up.

756
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,920
I hope that one day,
I can catch up to you,

757
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,360
pat your shoulders and say,

758
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:36,319
Brother Ming Cheng,
I finally caught up to you.

759
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,680
Am I good?

760
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:42,719
That way...

761
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,079
That way you'll like me.

762
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:50,960
But, I can't keep on running anymore.

763
00:40:53,479 --> 00:40:55,279
Can you stop,

764
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,279
wait for me and hug me?
