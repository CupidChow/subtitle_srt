relative's belonging.

That bowl was left to him
by his relative that died?

33
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:15,399
Yes.

34

The Ning family is close
to the Wei family.

35
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,559
Xiao Fei's father was a skilled potter
when he was alive.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,520
He made this bowl specially...

for Xiao Fei to keep him safe.

38

I was foolish enough to try
to find a replacement.

I don't know how long
will it take to repair them all.

167
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:58,000
It was broken,

until it looks this perfect?

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,039
The raw ingredients are...

171
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,000
gold powder, pottery dust and lacquer.

172
00:11:09,479 --> 00:11:11,079
Because the visual effects are good,

173
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,279
it is often used to repair pottery.

174
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,120
Use gold to repair pottery?

175
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,200
This is too expensive.

176
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,399
The philosophy of Kintsugi...

177
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,639
is to use perfection
to handle imperfection,

178
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,399
not to hide from imperfection...

179
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,639
but to use a more
expensive ingredient...

180
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,719
and endeavor to fix it.

181
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,839
Because of this acceptance...

182
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:33,839
of transforming imperfection to beauty,

183
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,200
the cracks become a form of art.

184
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,399
But,

185
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,920
there must be someone
who is willing to fix it.

186
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,560
Do you know...

187
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:47,000
everyone that can fix potteries?

188
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,920
Not all of them,

189
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,880
I only know a few elders.

190
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,039
Most of the young people gave up.

191
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,920
Why did you ask me that?

192
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,519
My friend...

193
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,279
accidentally...

194
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,959
broke someone else's pottery.

195
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,920
Then,

196
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,320
that person refused to get a new one.

197
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:02,920
He wants the exact one.

198
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
So, can you help me...

199
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,920
to find a reliable person to fix it?

200
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,039
Just count it as returning
my favour at the bar.

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,039
Can you help me?

202
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,399
No, that's another matter.

203
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
Do you think my promise...

204
00:12:17,599 --> 00:12:19,920
is that cheap and can change easily?

205
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,599
Then I'll owe you a favour, okay?

206
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,760
This is a life and death situation.

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,159
If you're willing to help me,

208
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,240
I'll help you if you need help later.

209
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:31,519
Okay.

210
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,800
I need your help right now.

211
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,560
Say it.

212
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:37,320
Be my girlfriend.

213
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,360
This favour is too big.

214
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,200
No, change it.

215
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,680
Then, kiss me once.

216
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
I'm begging your earnestly.

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,320
Don't joke around, okay?

218
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,920
I'm not joking too.

219
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,440
Didn't you say it's a matter
of life and death?

220
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,200
Can't you kiss me once?

221
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:02,440
I'll kiss your face then.

222
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,680
Okay.

223
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,320
Close your eyes.

224
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,719
If I only kiss his face, it shouldn't
count as my first kiss, right?

225
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,839
Hurry up.

226
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,440
I'm going all out to save a life.

227
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,800
Just a peck will do.

228
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,120
You'll have to kiss me
for more than five seconds.

229
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,279
You...

230
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,240
Okay.

231
00:13:24,719 --> 00:13:26,959
Brother Ming Cheng, I'm sorry.

232
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,200
One, two, three, four, five.

233
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
Okay, I'm done.

234
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,200
Give it to me.

235
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,680
Is your friend a female or male?

236
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,279
Female. My roommate and best friend.

237
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:55,959
Send the thing that you want to fix...

238
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,639
to this address.

239
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,639
I'll inform the repair centre.

240
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,880
After it's fixed, I'll inform you
as soon as possible.

241
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,039
Thank you.

242
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,360
You're welcome. You earned that
through your efforts.

243
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,279
There wasn't any allergy reaction.

244
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,479
Looks like my body...

245
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
isn't defensive against her.

246
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,039
Before going to the art gallery,
I have to go to the warehouse.

247
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,519
I have to get something.

248
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,120
What is it?

249
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,639
Because of someone,

250
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,479
I finally thought it through.

251
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,200
The most difficult thing
to fix in this world...

252
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,680
is a relationship.

253
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,399
But, if I take the initiative,

254
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,279
it'll be better than not doing anything.

255
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,159
It's good that you think that way.

256
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:04,200
I believe...

257
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
Madam will accept your intentions.

258
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,440
Please enter.

259
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,719
Madam He, the chairman is here.

260
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,680
Just do as you usually do.

261
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,039
Tell him I went out to meet an artist.

262
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,240
I said that.

263
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,240
But, he said he must meet you.

264
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:47,159
He's in the exhibition hall now.

265
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,719
Fine, I got it.

266
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,360
I'll go after I'm done working.

267
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,320
Okay.

268
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,800
Madam Wei.

269
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:13,360
Mum, you're here.

270
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,360
Are you used to living here?

271
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,639
Quite good.

272
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
How long are you planning to stay here?

273
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:22,880
If you're staying for a long time,

274
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
I'll ask them to clean up...

275
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,599
your room at home immediately.

276
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
I'll pick you up in a few days.

277
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,599
Mr. Chairman, you came today...

278
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,279
not to say that, right?

279
00:16:31,479 --> 00:16:32,440
If you're here to inspect...

280
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,039
the gallery's management,

281
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,719
you don't have to make small talk.

282
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:42,159
This is a record of the gallery's
expenditure for the past six months.

283
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,760
Mr. Chairman, please take a look.

284
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
I don't need to read this.

285
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,839
I've listened to many reports...

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,839
during the board of directors' meeting.

287
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,440
I know the art gallery is where...

288
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,639
you and my dad met.

289
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,519
I know how important it is to you.

290
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,760
But after all, the gallery
was where he started.

291
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'll help you to protect this place.

292
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,159
Don't worry.

293
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,239
Actually, I'm here...

294
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,800
as I have a gift for you.

295
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,320
No need for that.

296
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:13,279
As the chief culprit who's
dragging the group behind,

297
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,359
I wouldn't dare to receive your gift.

298
00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:17,480
I have an appointment.

299
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,359
I won't talk anymore.

300
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,320
Mr. Chairman, please help yourself.

301
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,239
You're going to meet...

302
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,080
someone from the auction house, right?

303
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,920
You're meeting that person...

304
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:30,840
to know more about...

305
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,560
a certain item, right?

306
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,759
You don't have to do that.

307
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,999
The other piece of porcelain bowl...

308
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,320
is with me.

309
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,159
Originally, I wanted to help you out...

310
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,440
since to me, this bowl...

311
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,920
is just a toy.

312
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,560
But, to Ning Fei,

313
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,159
it's his life saviour.

314
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,560
How did you find out?

315
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,119
I went to the hospital.

316
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,039
It wasn't my first time seeing him...

317
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,680
half alive.

318
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,999
It's easy to guess what happened.

319
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,639
But, this time...

320
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:09,119
I don't know who got unlucky.

321
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,600
Give me that.

322
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,039
I don't care what is
your motive this time.

323
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:14,720
But, it originally belongs to Ning Fei.

324
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,840
Give it back to him.

325
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:17,080
Originally?

326
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:20,359
I was originally your son too.

327
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,879
Now, you're shouting at me...

328
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,800
because of an outsider.

329
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:26,960
As long as you ask,

330
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,840
never mind a porcelain bowl,

331
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,359
I'll give you...

332
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,560
anything you want.

333
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,759
But I think I don't have to do that now.

334
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:37,519
I'm not you.

335
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,279
I don't care about the outsider.

336
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:42,119
Give me that.

337
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,119
Give me that! Give it back to Ning Fei!

338
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,239
Give me that!

339
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,519
Mum!

340
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,200
Scoundrel, leave!

341
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,800
Okay.

342
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,720
If you want this bowl,

343
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:02,039
ask him to come and beg for it.

344
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,279
Chairman Wei, I know you can drink well.

345
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,399
But, you can't drink that fast.

346
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,519
Why don't I find a few...

347
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,519
pretty girls to drink with you?

348
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,279
No need, I want to be alone.

349
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,159
I'm sorry.

350
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:43,759
The bar is booked for today.

351
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,239
We aren't accepting other guests.

352
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,399
I may have come the wrong place.

353
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,999
Chairman Wei.

354
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,600
I didn't expect to see you here today.

355
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,320
We're in the same circle.

356
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,279
It's normal to see each other, right?

357
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,039
But, I thought...

358
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,480
after having a new lover,

359
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,519
you won't have a chance to be alone.

360
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,399
When I saw you drinking alone here,

361
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,320
I thought I saw it wrongly.

362
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:23,720
Don't tell me...

363
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,239
you still don't have a lover?

364
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,359
No.

365
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,399
How is this possible?

366
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,440
Are you like me?

367
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,999
What do you mean by that?

368
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,920
After separating at the
Mountain Art Gallery Hotel,

369
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,239
a few months have passed.

370
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,359
But, I couldn't put it behind me.

371
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:48,320
Every night when I close my eyes,

372
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,720
I keep thinking about you.

373
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:53,840
Do you believe me?

374
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,800
I still can't accept that fact...

375
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,639
that we broke up.

376
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,039
I keep thinking that
you'll come back to me.

377
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,279
I know I'm being silly.

378
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm your ex,

379
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,639
but I want to continue our relationship.

380
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,239
Do you really think
that we've broken up?

381
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,039
That's enough.

382
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,359
Stop acting, okay?

383
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,119
Excuse me, give me a towel...

384
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,159
and a glass of water for this lady.

385
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,080
I'm sincere.

386
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm not drunk, why do
I have to drink water?

387
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,320
The water isn't for you to drink,

388
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,239
wipe your face with it.

389
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,560
I was drinking alone...

390
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
and feeling bored.

391
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,279
Listening to what you said...

392
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,960
entertained me.

393
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:51,920
But, you got more and more excited.

394
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,600
I'm afraid if you go on,

395
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,080
I'll have to act...

396
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,999
and reminisce our memories together.

397
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,239
I don't have time to act with you.

398
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:03,080
Stand right there.

399
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,920
What do you mean?

400
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:06,399
When did I act?

401
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,279
Do you want me to make it clear?

402
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,800
Okay, I'll help you to
recall your memories.

403
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,440
One week ago, at this exact spot...

404
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:14,720
right here,

405
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:16,999
with this same glass of tequila,

406
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:19,359
you watched me being beaten up
by the people you hired.

407
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,920
Do you have evidence that
I sent those people?

408
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,800
Do you want me to ask them in person?

409
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:34,159
Later on, at the hospital,

410
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,680
I got their phone number.

411
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Do you want me to call them now?

412
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,920
Fine.

413
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,239
I sent them to beat you up.

414
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,359
So what?

415
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,999
You can dump me,

416
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,800
but I can't release my anger?

417
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,600
I sent them to beat you up.

418
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,200
So what?

419
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:56,960
It's a small matter...

420
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,159
You...

421
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,480
I just need...

422
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,119
to post this on the Internet
and tag you.

423
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,600
You're a famous influencer.

424
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,080
You have a lot of viewership.

425
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,239
What do you want?

426
00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:15,840
I'll apologise to you,
isn't that enough?

427
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,159
Since I was once your ex,

428
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,119
even though it was by name only, just...

429
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,840
I don't need your apology.

430
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,279
You need to apologise to that girl...

431
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,359
who was dragged in and got hurt
because of you.

432
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,759
Apologise to her, and
I'll send you the recording.

433
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,960
I won't pursue this.

434
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,399
Don't come and
look for trouble next time.

435
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:39,080
I don't have time for you.

436
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:41,519
By the way,

437
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,399
I lied to you about something just now.

438
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,560
What is it?

439
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,039
I have a girlfriend.

440
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,639
Who is it?

441
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,279
I sent you her picture,
take a look at it yourself.

442
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
Although we aren't actually dating yet,

443
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,960
there's just one more step.

444
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:13,720
How can it be her?

445
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,039
He's awake.

446
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,039
Who?

447
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,720
Who else?

448
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,879
The boy from upstairs that
went on a hunger strike.

449
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:41,480
I realise that...

450
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,960
every time you mention him,
you'll give him a different nickname.

451
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,879
How is he now?
Did he eat anything?

452
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:49,680
No, although he was hungry,

453
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,119
he refused to eat anything.

454
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,639
The centre contacted you
that the repairing is done...

455
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,519
and asked you to
pick it up today, right?

456
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,840
You must get it today.

457
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,320
He's relying on an IV drip right now.

458
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,720
I'm afraid something bad will
happen to him if this goes on.

459
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:02,039
Don't worry.

460
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,239
No matter what, today...

461
00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:04,879
I'll get the repaired bowl for you.

462
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,119
Okay, that's all.

463
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,480
Goodbye.

464
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,359
Thank you...

465
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,920
It's done that fast. Thank you.

466
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,560
You don't have to thank me.

467
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:22,999
Although I...

468
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:24,800
hate to come in contact with others,

469
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:26,960
but since this is important to you,

470
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,039
I don't mind owing others a favour.

471
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,560
Well,

472
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,680
how much is the fee
for fixing this bowl?

473
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,759
I'll transfer it to you later.

474
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:39,119
I don't need money.

475
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:42,600
You can repay me with other things.

476
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,840
Why is this so hard to unwrap?

477
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,359
They wrapped it so tightly.

478
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,159
Thank you.

479
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,320
I have a bad habit.

480
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,840
When I see a parcel,
I want to unwrap it immediately.

481
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,440
You're in a rush.

482
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,639
The bowl inside must be valuable.

483
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,440
I don't know how valuable it is.

484
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,399
But, the owner of this bowl...

485
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,879
is still lying in the hospital.

486
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,680
He's waiting to be saved by this bowl.

487
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:40,080
The bowl looks perfect!

488
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:41,680
Great!

489
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:48,800
Does this bowl belongs to someone
with the surname Ning?

490
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,320
Yes, he's my neighbour.

491
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:53,920
He's also my junior.

492
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,039
Do you know him?

493
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:01,119
So, you asked me for help...

494
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,119
and pestered me to
find a master to repair it...

495
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,680
for him?

496
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:07,560
Not entirely.

497
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,800
I was the one who indirectly
caused it to happen.

498
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,039
The owner of this bowl
is still in the hospital.

499
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,840
I feel guilty.

500
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,920
So many years have passed,

501
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,960
but he's still that lucky.

502
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,920
Who?

503
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,680
Ning Fei.

504
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,320
Since young,

505
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,239
he just needed to be himself...

506
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,239
to get...

507
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,800
many things that others couldn't get.

508
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,639
Even if he made a mistake,

509
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,639
many people will rush to defend him.

510
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,119
I didn't expect you...

511
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:44,159
to be one of them.

512
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,879
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

513
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,359
Nothing.

514
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:51,999
Are you done checking?

515
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:54,440
Yes, it's perfect.

516
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,920
It's so amazing, I'm enthralled.

517
00:27:57,359 --> 00:27:59,680
There may be cracks
that you didn't notice.

518
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,480
I'll inspect it for you.

519
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,920
Oh no...

520
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,399
It's shattered into pieces.
It can't be fixed anymore.

521
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:26,080
Oh no..

522
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,119
How am I going to answer to her?

523
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,399
If Fei Fei finds out,
she'll scold me to death.

524
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,039
If Ning Fei dies because of this,

525
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,680
what should I do?

526
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:38,920
You care about him a lot.

527
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,960
That's a person's life!

528
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:43,359
It feels like I'm the one
who did this to him.

529
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,680
I'll handle it.

530
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,039
It's useless...

531
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,399
It's useless.

532
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,999
Ning Fei won't accept any replacements,

533
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,759
unless if I can find one
from the same set.

534
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,039
You mean...

535
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:10,320
Follow me.

536
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,519
This is huge.

537
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,519
No wonder you can hold an exhibition.

538
00:29:21,879 --> 00:29:23,399
Your collection is huge.

539
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:25,800
It's almost like you have
a private museum.

540
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,039
That's what it is.

541
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,840
Don't touch it.

542
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,720
You can't afford to pay me back
if you break it.

543
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
There's an exact one.

544
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,600
You can really give this to me?

545
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,119
Since I gave you my word,

546
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,560
I won't go back on my word.

547
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,239
Although I'm taking this
for nothing in return,

548
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,560
to save someone,

549
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,119
I'll have to be thick-skinned.

550
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,720
Before a collectible
leaves the warehouse,

551
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,999
you have to help me to complete
a certain ceremony.

552
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,159
What ceremony?

553
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,399
Take it.

554
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,680
Just like this.

555
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:14,999
Stand there. Don't move.

556
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,119
Close your eyes and raise your head.

557
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,680
It's best if you don't say anything.

558
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:21,639
What is the use of doing that?

559
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,279
It's like a prayer.

560
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:25,159
If we do that,

561
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,320
the collectible won't be broken easily
after leaving the warehouse.

562
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,519
Why?

563
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,080
It's just superstition.

564
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,279
I don't want the bowl to break again.

565
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,920
Then, what should I say?

566
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,320
Anything.

567
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,800
But, I heard that saying the name
of the previous owner...

568
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,999
is the most effective.

569
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,680
The previous owner?

570
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,759
Isn't that you?

571
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,720
Please don't break...

572
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:52,800
Wei Qing...

573
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,239
Useless. You kissed her before, right?

574
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,039
Why are you nervous now?

575
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,119
This is just an experiment,
don't be scared.

576
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:07,519

Come, take more pictures for me.

586

Keep a record of the crime scene.

587
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,600
Your warehouse is in this state.

588
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,720
Aren't you calling the police?

589
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,720
Call the police? What should I say?

590
00:33:06,999 --> 00:33:08,119
The culprit escaped?

591

and become the topic of discussion
of the netizens?

594
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,759
Don't you want to pursue this?

595
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,800
How is that possible?

596
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,800
Oh no...

597
00:33:39,999 --> 00:33:41,680
I broke so many things...

598
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
and took this item away from him.

599
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,359
I'll be locked up this time.

600
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,720
But, I'm still young.

601
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:53,600
I don't want to be locked up in jail.

602
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:57,080
Should I escape?

603
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,159
Where should I escape to?

604
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,320
Oh dear, what should I do?

605
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,040
No matter what,

606
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,799
I'll have to give this to him.

607
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,680
You don't look mad at all.

608
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Really?

609
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,920
I'm fuming.

610
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:28,960
It's rare for me to take the initiative,

611
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,920
but I was rejected.

612
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,639
At this age,

613
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,879
I've only lost to the same girl...

614
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,520
twice.

615
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,280
How can I not care?

616
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,520
Judging from her reaction,

617
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,839
she must've thought
I was a pervert that molested her.

618
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,920
Perhaps I was in a rush this time.

619
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,399
But,

620
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,960
the results of the experiment was great.

621
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,079
It has been 10 years.

622
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,960
Finally, I found someone
who I can have close contact with...

623
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,200
without my body reacting adversely.

624
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,000
When there is a will, there is a way.

625
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:06,000
She is valuable to me.

626
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,000
How can I let her go that easily?

627
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,319
Xiao Fei,

628
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,760
will you take a bite?

629
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,399
Make me happy.

630
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,599
Here,

631
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,720
just a little bite.

632
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,399
I can't eat...

633
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:32,599
If you don't eat, you'll die.

634
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:33,960
No.

635
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,040
I can't eat food given by others easily.

636
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,520
My brother said that.

637
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:44,040
Why are you so stubborn?

638
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,240
I found it...

639
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:02,240
I had diarrhea last night.

640
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:05,879
Someone gave you bread again
and you ate it, right?

641
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,680
Didn't I tell you?

642
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:10,000
You can't trust anyone here.

643
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,799
Don't eat food given to you
by others easily.

644
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:15,200
But, I was hungry.

645
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,920
Remember this.

646
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,839
In this world, besides your relatives,

647
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,520
nobody will treat you well
without expecting anything in return.

648
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,079
Mum and dad are dead.

649
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,799
You can only trust me.

650
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,879
From now on,
I'll put food that you can eat...

651
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,559
in your bowl.

652
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,680
Just eat whatever that's in the bowl.

653
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,440
Even if you're hungry, don't eat food
given to you by others, okay?

654
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,920
Xiao Fei.

655
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,240
Xiao Fei.

656
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,720
Thank you so much, Miss Lin.

657
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,200
You saved Xiao Fei.

658
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,799
Thank you.

659
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,639
It's fine, we're neighbours.

660
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,680
I should do that.

661
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,799
Before this, I misunderstood you.

662
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,440
I thought you went after Xiao Fei...

663
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,280
as you want fame and money.

664
00:37:57,399 --> 00:38:00,440
But, you care for him a lot.

665
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:01,920
To help him,

666
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,240
you found a bowl that
looks exactly the same.

667
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,680
I was astounded.

668
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,240
Madam He.

669
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:10,399
I think you may have
misunderstood something.

670
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,879
We are just neighbours.

671
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,319
We only met a few times before this.

672
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,760
You don't know him?

673
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,920
Forget it, this is better.

674
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,079
This is...

675
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,599
This is a token of my regards.

676
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,879
Since young, Xiao Fei
doesn't have many friends.

677
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,520
I'm glad that...

678
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,240
he met a good neighbour like you.

679
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:41,799
He doesn't know
how to take care of himself.

680
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,079
I hope that when I'm not there,

681
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,440
you and your roommate...

682
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,839
can take care of him, okay?

683
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,359
Of course.

684
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:51,639
But, you should keep this.

685
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,599
No...

686
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,240
Don't misunderstand.

687
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,319
It's just a token of my regards.

688
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,280
I insist.

689
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,720
By the way,

690
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,159
that fake starlight glazed
porcelain bowl,

691
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,720
where did you get it from?

692
00:39:10,399 --> 00:39:11,559
From what I know,

693
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,960
at the moment there aren't
that many who can....

694
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,200
imitate it that well.

695
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,480
You can pass it off as a genuine one.

696
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,319
I asked my friend's help.

697
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,639
I don't know about that.

698
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,319
One, ten, hundred, thousand,

699
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,399
ten thousand, one hundred thousand.

700
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:38,119
Even if you sell me,
I'm not worth that much!

701
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,280
The blue and white porcelain vase from
the Qing dynasty, 6.58 million yuan.

702
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,799
White porcelain vase with fine cracks,
8.43 million yuan.

703
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,680
Stop ringing.

704
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,879
What should I do?

705
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,760
You should return the money you owe me.

706
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,280
Don't think you can escape
because your husband ran away.

707
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:09,559
If you don't pay us back today,

708
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,799
we'll smash up your house.

709
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,079
Mum.

710
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,319
Mum.

711
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,200
It happened a long time ago.

712
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,879
Why did I suddenly think of that?

713
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,359
Announcement to collect
Yun Ma Scholarship?

714
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,480
Scholarship?

715
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,480
What is this?

716
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,559
A charity ball organised
by a celebrity magazine.

717
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,879
Previously, you'll attend
with a partner.

718
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,680
So, Editor He also...

719
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,599
sent an invitation this year.

720
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,119
This is tradition.

721
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,799
Anything special this year?

722
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:21,559
Amongst the guest list,

723
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,960
there seems to be a member
of the Snow family.

724
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,839
SG Group?

725
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,119
What post is that person holding?

726
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,599
Chief representative in China,
Zoey Snow.

727
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,240
Her Chinese name is Xue Zi.

728
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,720
It's rumoured that she's young...

729
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,440
and one of the candidate to be...

730
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,440
the heir of Snow Group.

731
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,040
But, she rarely
reveals herself to the media.

732
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,720
So, there is little information of her.

733
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,680
He Wei really does have some weight.

734
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:49,599
He even invited...

735
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,680
someone from the top management
of an international luxury brand.

736
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,760
Previously, I only went to show my face.

737
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,599
This year, I have to stay longer.

738
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,559
But, taking a partner along?
