[Episode 17]

29
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,479
Snow Group?

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,799
Snow Group is all about luxury goods.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Do you think she will buy
the gallery down just for art?

32
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,640
She promised me that
she'll keep it the same.

33
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,959
And she will give Yun Ma's artists...

34
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:16,640
as much space as they want.

35
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,200
She won't ask them
to do something awful.

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,720
You rather believe an outsider
instead of me?

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,519
Outsider?

38
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,920
You used Xun Ran as a front...

39
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
to do some cross-industry design that
dragged his own exhibition behind.

40
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,239
Do you think I won't know that
just because I'm overseas?

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,360
I did the designs willingly.

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,679
I don't uncle's gallery to get sold.

43
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,039
Xiao Fei.

44
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm not selling the gallery.

45
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm just giving it to someone...

46
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,679
who knows art so that
they can take care of it.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
You are cultivated by two masters.

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,599
Your hands are a pair
of painter's hands.

49
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,800
Aren't his drawings meant
to be sold for money?

50
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,479
His drawings are meant to be sold too.

51
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,959
Moreover, it's just a joint design.

52
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,039
You are making it sounds like
I had made him suffer.

53
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
A painting is an artwork.

54
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,679
People who are willing to buy it...

55
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,640
know its value.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560
And the luxury goods you like...

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,599
can be bought as long as you have money.

58
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,759
Those who buy them
just follow the trend.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,160
How many of them really
know their values?

60
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,239
No need to worry about the gallery.

61
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,759
Even if Snow Group took over
Yun Ma Artwork,

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,399
We won't let Xue Zi take charge
of it completely.

63
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,039
After all, my sister
has the most shares in it.

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,319
We?

65
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:39,119
Don't you know?

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,879
I'm the manager of Yun Ma Artwork now.

67
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,879
My sister is only responsible
for the galleries.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,200
-What?
-Besides, Xue Zi...

69
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,920
is not as difficult as I think she is.

70
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,319
As soon as I say that the brokerage
contract belongs to my sister only,

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,319
I managed to lead her by the nose.

72
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:56,000
She is really Xun Ran's loyal fan.

73
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
She has really spent a lot
to buy his paintings.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,959
Enough, Xiao Wei.

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,519
I'm tired.

76
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,119
If you have nothing else to say,

77
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,119
please go back.

Director He.

80
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,919
I'm here to solve the problem.

81
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,480
We can't solve it if we
keep hiding from it.

82
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,239
The issue between us...

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
can't be solved.

84
00:04:33,799 --> 00:04:35,040
We can only hide from it.

85
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,199
Please go back.

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,760
Wei Qing.

87
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:52,040
Everything is now in their due course.

88
00:04:52,239 --> 00:04:53,679
Don't trouble yourself over it.

89
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,760
Unless you can change Xue Zi's mind...

90
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,560
to give up her shares,

91
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,239
or else, I don't think you are
that much of an influence to her.

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,919
You can't be sure yet.

93
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:05,280
I can handle a woman
much better than you can.

94
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,600
Is that so?

95
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,760
Then why did all of your ex-girlfriends
turn out to be mine in the end?

96
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,040
Even Lin Fei Fei who you had
just broken up with...

97
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,560
is now under my spell.

98
00:05:17,239 --> 00:05:19,720
-Lin Fei Fei?
-Yes.

99
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,399
You even give her your
limited edition Patek Philippe.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,919
But you still can't keep her.

101
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:43,720
I'll lend this to you.
You can use it for the moment.

102
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,519
When we meet next time,
remember to return it to me.

103
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,840
Let me warn you.

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,919
She is not someone you should touch.

105
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,959
That is not up to you to decide.

106
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,919
I am more and more interested in her.

107
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,519
I told you. Stay away from her.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,760
Thanks to your ex-girlfriends,

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,199
now I know that why...

110
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,919
you have to wear gloves.

111
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,840
I'll warn you again.
Don't play with fire.

112
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,119
Do it...

113
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,040
if you are not afraid that
my sister will get angry.

114
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,760
Xue Zi will organise a mini salon party
in two days' time.

115
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,160
I'll prepare a huge present
for you on that day.

116
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,919
Wait for it.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,119
Are you a cat? You don't
make a sound when you walk.

118
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,119
Don't touch Lin Fei Fei.

119
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,639
You are all grown up now.
You know how to protect what's yours.

120
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,519
I can stay away from her
but you need to beg me.

121
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,480
Xiao Fei, can you come for a moment?

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,799
My sister is calling for you.

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,840
Be a good boy. Go.

124
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
Don't touch her!

125
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,519
All of you don't want me to touch her.

126
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,799
But I'm still going to let her
come to me.

127
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,079
If you want to blame someone,

128
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,760
blame me.

129
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,959
I don't want the Yun Ma
that we had built together...

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,399
to be destroyed in his hands.

131
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,040
Even if it has to end, I hope that...

132
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,679
it'll end in my own hands.

133
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,440
Yun Ma Artwork that was
established by me and my wife...

134
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,840
will be took over by my son,
Wei Qing, after my passing.

135
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,639
He'll have full authority.

136
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,760
What?

137
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,000
Impossible.

138
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,560
Yun Ma belongs to us.

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
How could you give it to him?

140
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,199
Lawyer,

141
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,880
have you gotten it wrongly?

142
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:06,480
Mr. Wei had sealed his will
right in front of me.

143
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,079
And you are the one who opened it.

144
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,679
There's no problem with it.

145
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,079
How is that possible?

146
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:14,840
He knew what Yun Ma means to me.

147
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,639
He should give it to me.

148
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,119
I don't want Yun Ma.

149
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,239
I don't even know how to manage it.

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,560
I'll only destroy it
if it's given to me.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,040
It's better to give it to my mother.

152
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,720
He doesn't want it.
So, I can have Yun Ma instead, right?

153
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:34,720
Theoretically, it's feasible.

154
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,040
But, Mr. Wei had given me
a letter when he was still alive.

155
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,439
He enjoined me to...

156
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,319
give this letter to Wei Qing...

157
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,280
if he wouldn't take over Yun Ma.

158
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,680
Alright.

159
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,160
I'll take over it.

160
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,959
Why?

161
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,160
I thought you don't want that.

162
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,079
This is father's will.

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,840
Son,

164
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,879
your father is old and muddled.

165
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,280
Yun Ma contains all of
his and my memories.

166
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,360
Now that your father is gone,

167
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,360
if Yun Ma is gone as well,

168
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,480
then I will be left with nothing.

169
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,439
We can manage Yun Ma together.

170
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,399
But you don't like the gallery
and you don't like to draw.

171
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,280
Why do you want to take Yun Ma?

172
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
If you want money,

173
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,199
I can give it to you.

174
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,399
I can give you anything.
I just want Yun Ma.

175
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,160
You can do the things that you like.

176
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,959
Give me the letter.

177
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,879
This is given by my father.

178
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,600
Alright.

179
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,240
I know.

180
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,439
I know you hate me.

181
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,639
You hate me for being
so strict to you in the past.

182
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,319
So, are you going to threaten me
with Yun Ma now?

183
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,959
-No, mother.
-Let's go!

184
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,759
Mother!

185
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,199
Mother.

186
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,160
Mother!

187
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,319
Why won't you manage
Yun Ma together with me?

188
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Because of you,

189
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,999
I came to America with your father.

190
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,360
Or else, he wouldn't have died.

191
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,559
It's your fault that he is dead.

192
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,040
I really don't know how to face you now.

193
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,319
We should calm ourselves down.

194
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:20,360
Mother.

195
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,999
Mother!

196
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Mother!

197
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,879
Mother.

198
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:39,639
Mother!

199
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,040
Mother!

200
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,519
Why did you abandon me?

201
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
Because of you,

202
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,519
I came to America with your father.

203
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,879
Or else, he wouldn't have died.

204
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,160
It's your fault that he is dead.

205
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,680
Father. Don't worry.

206
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,559
I will prove that your choice is right.

207
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
Finally, I found out where the deficit
of this project has gone.

208
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,319
Yes. I never thought that...

209
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
they will use this kind of way...

210
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:14,079
to insert the advance payment
under the profit item...

211
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,639
to balance out the account.

212
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,840
But the actual profit is not even
half of what's stated in the account.

213
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:20,439
By doing so,

214
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,240
they can cover it with the
capital outflow of other projects.

215
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,120
No wonder the account in
main office's is always in deficit.

216
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:33,800
But Yun Ma's financial statement
can always be justified.

217
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,439
The one who plotted this...

218
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,199
is too cunning.

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,959
But next, as long as we can find out...

220
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
who's the legal person
in charge of the capital flow,

221
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
our job will be done.

222
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
You've worked hard.

223
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,079
Leave the rest to me.

224
00:15:50,999 --> 00:15:52,079
Shi Shi.

225
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,759
Shi Shi.

226
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,199
Brother Ming Cheng.

227
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,999
Why don't you sleep in your room?

228
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,920
I'm waiting for you. Are you done yet?

229
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,639
Yes. We are done.

230
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,879
It's still early.

231
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,120
How about you take a rest
on the sofa first?

232
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,559
No need, Shi Shi. I'll go back now.

233
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,079
Go back to your room to sleep.

234
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,040
-I'll see you out.
-Alright.

235
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,999
Goodbye, Shi Shi. Go to sleep.

236
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,360
Bye. Brother Ming Cheng.

237
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,199
Wait for me.

238
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,680
Thank you.

239
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,360
Good day, Chairman.

240
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,640
You didn't sleep well last night?

241
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,600
I had insomnia.
I didn't sleep for the whole night.

242
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:10,760
You didn't sleep well too?

243
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,919
I had a nightmare.

244
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,600
Come to my office later.

245
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,199
I have coffee.

246
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,679
I'm so sleepy.

247
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,760
The first batch of the
necklaces is done. Take a look.

248
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:48,679
Xun Ran is indeed impressive.

249
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,840
He can corporate
such artistic element...

250
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,600
into something so commercialised.

251
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,079
-Send this to Xue Zi.
-Alright.

252
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,480
Zhou Shi.

253
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:08,520
Zhou Shi.

254
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,199
Don't compliment me like this.

255
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,840
I feel embarrassed.

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,319
How can you like me so much?

257
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,600
I don't know how to respond to you.

258
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,640
This is so perplexing.

259
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,760
Let me ask you then.

260
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,039
What do you like about me?

261
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:27,079
Why do you keep pestering me?

262
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,919
What is it? You had a nightmare?

263
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,840
What is wrong with you?

264
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
It's nothing.

265
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:20,079
Careful, it's hot!

266
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,559
This is so hot!

267
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,079
I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose.

268
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,720
Let me clean it up for you.

269
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,039
Don't ever tell anybody about you...

270
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
spraying coffee all over me.

271
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,279
I understand. I'm sorry, chairman.

272
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
-Go out.
-Alright.

273
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,240
When did you come?

274
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm here for quite some time.

275
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,919
Why didn't I see you when I come?

276
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,079
I've been staying in the office.

277
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,919
You've been staying in the office?

278
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,959
For so long?

279
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,520
What did you do in the office?

280
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,199
Nothing.

281
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:25,959
Wei Qing's perfume.

282
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,959
Her hair is messy and
there's sweat on her clothes.

283
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,679
Her breathing is choppy
and her face is red.

284
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,760
Don't go in now! He's unavailable now.

285
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,079
Unavailable?

286
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,159
What did you do inside?

287
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,760
Don't ask me. He wouldn't let me say it.

288
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,959
You...

289
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,439
Both of you.

290
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,079
I hate you.

291
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,079
I just didn't tell her that
I sprayed coffee all over his face.

292
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,840
Does she need to be so angry?

293
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,439
Oh my goodness. Why would I kiss him?

294
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,279
And I'm the one who took the initiative.

295
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
This can't do.

296
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,240
I can't let him know that
I've remembered about it.

297
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,799
I have to keep this a secret.

298
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,400
I'm sorry for making you wait,
Assistant An.

299
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,520
It's fine.

300
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,279
I'm the one who came here rashly
without telling you first.

301
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,679
May I know why you are here?

302
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,360
This is the necklace from Xun Ran's
Starry Sky series. It was just done.

303
00:22:36,959 --> 00:22:39,480
The chairman asked me to send it to you.

304
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,720
Please tell Chairman Wei that
I really like the necklace.

305
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,000
Thank him for taking the trouble.

306
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,520
Alright.

307
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,279
The chairman also said that...

308
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,520
this is our first collaboration
with Xun Ran.

309
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,159
If you are interested in it,

310
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,400
Snow Group is welcome to join too.

311
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
I'll organise a mini salon party
in my villa tomorrow.

312
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,840
I hope that Chairman Wei
will be able to attend that.

313
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:10,799
I'll pass on this message.

314
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,919
Director He, I'll start working now.

315
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,679
Is it good? Let me take a look.

316
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,880
Let me take a look.

317
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,279
This is not bad.

318
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,799
If you want to post it,
remember to edit for me.

319
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,120
-Can I post it?
-Of course. It's all up to you.

320
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,600
WeChat moments.

321
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:19,600
First day at work. All the best.

322
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,279
Thank you Mr. Perfect
for making an appearance.

323
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,319
Hide it from father, mother.

324
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,775
[Ning Fei]

325
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,000
Didn't you say that I can't find
a boyfriend? I'll show you then.

326
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,840
Share.

327
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
[He is so handsome!]
[Is he your boyfriend?]

328
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,863
[Why did you cover his face?]
[I want to see him]

329
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,400
He is mine.
I won't allow you to look at him.

330
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,593
[He's not yours to look at.]

331
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,360
He is my Mr. Perfect.

332
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,351
[Bring your Mr. Perfect
to the gathering tomorrow.]

333
00:25:04,959 --> 00:25:07,640
Gathering? It's tomorrow?

334
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:10,489
[Bring him along. I want to see.]

335
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,289
[I want to see him too.]

336
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:13,813
[So petty. Remember to bring him
to the gathering tomorrow.]

337
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:16,120
What should I do?

338
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,319
I totally forgot about this.

339
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:20,319
What should I do?

340
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:22,400
Who should I bring tomorrow?

341
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,640
Who should I bring?

342
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:32,506
[Why did you cover up my face?]

343
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,408
[Director He, can you lend me
a help tomorrow?]

344
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,520
Senior. I'll be getting off work now.
Goodbye.

345
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,039
Zhou Shi.

346
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,840
Come in.

347
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,279
Chairman.

348
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,079
Take a look.

349
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,520
It's so beautiful.

350
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Chairman, can you let me
wear it for a moment?

351
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,840
Just a moment.

352
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,640
As expected from Xun Ran's design.

353
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,679
Others like to use jade, agate,
gold and diamond.

354
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,360
I never thought that Xun Ran
will use moldavite.

355
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,480
Usually, a material like this
won't be used on accessories.

356
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,919
But Xun Ran used it as the
main material for the accessories.

357
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,760
This will definitely be a bomb.

358
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:25,480
Yes. When the first draft of
the accessories came out,

359
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,919
they were already sold out.

360
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:28,600
Of course.

361
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:32,279
Unfortunately, a poor student
like me can't afford it.

362
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,640
If I can buy it,

363
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:35,480
I'll display it in my house...

364
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,439
so that I can look my fill.

365
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:40,319
How about I give...

366
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,559
No need!

367
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,959
This is so expensive. I can't accept it.

368
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,720
I mean a postcard. I didn't say anything
about buying a necklace for you.

369
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,760
If I want to give a necklace, I should
give it to our VIP client like Xue Zi.

370
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,079
You are already lucky that
you got to wear it.

371
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:57,120
I'm giving this back to you.
Who wants it anyway.

372
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,000
If it wasn't design by Xun Ran,
I wouldn't have worn it.

373
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,199
Why can't I take it off?

374
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,559
Help me to take it off.

375
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,039
Why is it so hard?

376
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,000
I forgot to tell you.

377
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:14,720
This necklace has an initial passcode.

378
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,000
Why didn't you tell me about it earlier?
What's the passcode?

379
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,559
I forgot.

380
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,039
Do you have any other way?

381
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,679
Yes. You can separate
the necklace from it.

382
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,600
But even this clasp is worth
months of your salary.

383
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,880
And after you separate the necklace
from it, you can't reattach it back.

384
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,199
Are you willing to do that?

385
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,039
You are just bullying me.

386
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,480
If you had told me earlier,
I wouldn't have worn it.

387
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,120
It's going to break.

388
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,840
Looks like I'll have to add
another item to your debt.

389
00:28:42,439 --> 00:28:43,760
Can I give you my head?

390
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,000
Just chop my head off
and retrieve this necklace.

391
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,679
I'm not interested in your head.

392
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,559
You can go back and
chop your own head off.

393
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,159
I have a party tomorrow.
Attend it with me.

394
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,480
So, you can keep your head
for one more day.

395
00:28:55,959 --> 00:28:57,079
You...

396
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,039
Wei Qing, you are a scoundrel.

397
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,319
Why am I such a troublemaker?

398
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,039
Now, I have another debt.

399
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,079
And I can't take this off.

400
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,720
Why are my hands so...

401
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,600
Xiao Fei. Help me take a look at this.

402
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,559
This necklace. Why will you...

403
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,120
Come and help me.

404
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,240
I can't unclasp this.

405
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,439
Is it because it's tangled with my hair?

406
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,559
Yes. Wait. Don't move.

407
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,840
We are out of electricity?

408
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,039
How is it? Am I beautiful?

409
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,319
Why are you hugging each other?

410
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:56,039
You actually used my planetarium
star projector as background.

411
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,919
Such a waste for good product.

412
00:29:58,439 --> 00:29:59,919
You are so beautiful.

413
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,959
Isn't this the gown you worn
for the shooting last time?

414
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,559
Where are you wearing this to?

415
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm going to a gathering tomorrow.

416
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,799
It's just a gathering.
Do you have to wear like this?

417
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,840
You won't be able to understand.
Gathering is like a show.

418
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,919
A place to show off your work,
your love, your house.

419
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,000
Maybe they'll even show off
their kids after a few years.

420
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:21,640
-What are you going to show them then?
-Me? Of course I'll show off myself.

421
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,439
Are you going alone by wearing that?

422
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,000
Of course not.
I'll bring a male companion for sure.

423
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:29,919
Or else, they'll mock me
no matter how well I'm dressed.

424
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,559
You can bring along Xiao Fei then.

425
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,840
After all, Xiao Fei is the
handsome boy in our house.

426
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
He won't embarrass you.

427
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,600
That's right. Xiao Fei, are you willing
to accompany Sister Fei Fei?

428
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,840
Who's going to bring you along?
I already have a male companion.

429
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:47,159
-Who is it?
-Of course it's He Wei, my Mr. Perfect.

430
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:49,240
At first, I just asked him for fun.

431
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,000
I never thought that he'll agree to it.

432
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,919
I think in this life,

433
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,039
I won't find another guy who is...

434
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,760
as handsome and
considerate as him, right?

435
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,480
Xiao Fei, where are you going?

436
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,439
Throwing the garbage.

437
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,840
What's wrong with him?

438
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,279
Xiao Fei.

439
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:37,559
Are you alright?

440
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,120
You are shaking and then
nodding your head.

441
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,319
Are you alright or not?

442
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,840
He Wei is an evil man.

443
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,679
I heard that from Fei Fei before.

444
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,480
Looks like you know him well, right?

445
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,959
He always bullied my senior
when I was young.

446
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,959
And he even asked me to join him.

447
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,880
Have you told Fei Fei about that?

448
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,079
She wouldn't listen.

449
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:11,520
So, you are angry because of that?

450
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,760
Enough. Don't be mad anymore.

451
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,520
I'll advise her when I have the time.

452
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,400
It's so cold outside. Let's go in.

453
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,159
Your necklace...

454
00:32:25,439 --> 00:32:27,640
That's right. Can you unclasp it for me?

455
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,679
I'll try.

456
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,600
You are amazing!

457
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,559
I tried so hard but I still can't
unclasp it. But you did it in a flash.

458
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,120
This is not a combination lock.

459
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,959
It has a small hook at the side.

460
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,600
You can unclasp it that way.

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,439
How did you know?

462
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,439
I saw it just now.

463
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,559
You are too awesome.

464
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,240
Let's go home.

465
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:11,079
This combination lock is just for show.

466
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,880
The real lock is this hook beside it.

467
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,640
Others will usually get side-tracked
by the combination lock...

468
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,959
and put all their attention
into decoding it.

469
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,799
About this...

470
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,439
You found that out by yourself?

471
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,120
Of course.

472
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,400
So, you are not as dumb as
I think you are.

473
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:34,400
What are you doing?

474
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:40,439
I told you, right?

475
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,799
Attend a party with me in the afternoon.

476
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm acting as your vase again?

477
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,199
You will be my bodyguard this time,
not a vase.

478
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,559
What do you mean?

479
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:50,679
I have some rules. Firstly,

480
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:53,520
you have to be within one metre from me.
Don't leave my side.

481
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,159
Secondly, no matter it's man or woman,

482
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:57,760
make sure that they stay
half a metre away from me.

483
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,360
And thirdly, which is
the most important rule,

484
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,319
don't let anybody touch me.

485
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,480
Why?

486
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,240
No need to know why. Just do it.

487
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,799
When I went to the party with you
last time, you didn't have these rules.

488
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:11,400
That was a large-scale party.

489
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,840
I have enough space to keep
my distance from others.

490
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:15,759
This is a private party.

491
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,279
Someone might act out of line.

492
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,079
Enough questions. Your foremost duty...

493
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,239
is to be my shield. Shield me from them.

494
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,559
Shield?

495
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,239
Chairman.

496
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,719
I have to go out. If there's
anything about the company,

497
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,440
you can just inform Wei An.

498
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,559
Alright.

499
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,200
Director He.

500
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,160
Xiao Fei. I'll be leaving now.
Guard the house well.

501
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:11,400
I've ordered food delivery for you.
It'll be here soon.

502
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,319
Brat, why are you mad again?

503
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,680
Eat or don't, it's up to you.

504
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,920
Let's go in.

505
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,960
Let's go.

506
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,400
Chairman Wei.

507
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,279
Hello, Miss Xue.

508
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,120
It's you? We meet again.

509
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,840
I came here with the chairman.

510
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:52,999
-I thought you work for the gallery.
-I changed my job.

511
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:56,960
Hello, Miss Xue.

512
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,680
Miss Xue, your hand is so pretty!

513
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,239
So is your ring.

514
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,999
I have something to say to her.
You can leave first.

515
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,999
-But...
-It's alright.

516
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,319
Alright.

517
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:20,759
Miss Xue, can I talk with you?

518
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:26,279
My job is done?

519
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:44,519
He Wei? Why is he here?

520
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,120
-Understand?
-Yes.

521
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:50,039
Anyway, don't make it easy
for him today.

522
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,319
Why didn't he pick up my call?

523
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,160
Lin Fei Fei!

524
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,279
Liu Yuan'er? Oh my goodness!
Long time no see.

525
00:38:13,279 --> 00:38:14,880
Long time no see.

526
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,559
Oh my goodness.

527
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,600
Don't call me Liu Yuan'er.

528
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,239
Call me Bobbi from now on.

529
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,680
Bobbi?

530
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,120
My husband gave that name to me.
Isn't that fashionable?

531
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,440
Oh my goodness. You are married?

532
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,200
I got married last month.
It's an overseas wedding.

533
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,719
I didn't inform all of you because
I knew that you were busy.

534
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,279
You won't blame me, right?

535
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:39,680
Of course not.
I should congratulate you instead.

536
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,960
Why are you alone?
Where is your Mr. Perfect?

537
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,880
He is busy now. He'll be here soon.

538
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,799
Don't stand us up.
We will be waiting for you.

539
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,239
Don't worry. We won't.

540
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,999
Come on. Let's go in.
Why are you standing here?

541
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:56,120
-Alright.
-Let's go.

542
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,960
You asked for me...

543
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,920
because of Yun Ma Artwork, right?

544
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,680
I think I had already told you
very clearly before this.

545
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,640
Are you so certain to
have a winning hand...

546
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,559
in acquiring Yun Ma Artwork?

547
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,239
If you say it like that,

548
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,239
do you mean that things will change?

549
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,600
If I let it out that Snow Group
is going to have...

550
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,680
collaboration with
Yun Ma Artwork soon...

551
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,079
to increase the stock price,

552
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,759
you won't be able to buy it off
with a low price.

553
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,680
And perhaps,

554
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,759
if I call in other M&A competitors,

555
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:33,759
then you'll have to increase
your acquisition cost.

556
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:35,880
No matter what I do,

557
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,479
you won't have a smooth sailing...

558
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,400
in acquiring Yun Ma Artwork.

559
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,239
So why did you do that, Chairman Wei?

560
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,999
Because of you, Miss Xue.

561
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,120
I admire you, Miss Xue.

562
00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:51,039
I hope that we can collaborate
in a more pleasing way.

563
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,200
What do you think?

564
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,239
I already told you.

565
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,239
Compared to profits,

566
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,120
people matter to me more.

567
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,920
If I'm satisfied with someone,

568
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,840
everything can be negotiable.

569
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,880
Before this,

570
00:40:11,999 --> 00:40:13,840
I acquired Yun Ma Artwork...

571
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:16,200
because of Yun Ran.

572
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,279
If there's a better choice,

573
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,239
I can stop if you want.

574
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,479
Since you...

575
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:28,799
already make yourself clear,

576
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:31,239
I'll keep you company until the end.

577
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,559
Alright. Then we...

578
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:35,559
Chairman!

579
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,680
Chairman.

580
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:41,880
I didn't invite you, right?

581
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,840
Someone invited me.

582
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Didn't you see that I'm
talking with Miss Xue?

583
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,120
Wei Qing!

584
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,799
Qi Qi?

585
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,440
-Wei Qing.
-Wei Qing.

586
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,479
Wei Qing, enjoy...

587
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:11,360
this huge present from me.

588
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,799
Why are you here?

589
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,400
I should be asking you that.

590
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,039
Shouldn't you be in
a gathering with Fei Fei?

591
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:23,440
Gathering?

592
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,920
I've forgotten about it.

593
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,400
Forgotten about it?

594
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:29,640
Do you know that Fei Fei
is waiting for you?

595
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,120
It's just a gathering.

596
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,200
There's an even more
interesting show here.

597
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
You...

598
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,440
No, I have to tell Fei Fei now.

599
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,319
Wei Qing!

600
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:51,799
