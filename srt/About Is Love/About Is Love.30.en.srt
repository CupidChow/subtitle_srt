[Episode 30]

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,759
My dearest son,

30
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,120
If you are reading this letter,

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,880
it means I have passed away.

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,719
If you can't be an outstanding artist,

33
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:19,559
please be a successful businessman.

34
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:22,639
Hold on to Yun Ma for me.

35
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:27,240
Of course, I am aware it's not fair
to make this request,

36
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,999
but even if you turn me down,

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,320
your decision will be respected.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,999
But if you agree to take over,

39
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,439
please look after the company
and your mother for me.

40
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,520
You have my gratitude.

41
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:45,160
Lastly,

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
do not feel sad for my death.

43
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,880
From: The father that loved you
but couldn't tell you.

44
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,600
Wei Heng.

45
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,600
I am on my way to the airport.

46
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,479
I have got the arrangement done in America.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,719
Don't worry.

48
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:06,559
Take care of yourself
while you are there.

49
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,680
Someone would take care of you here,

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,919
But you'll be on your own in America.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,839
Relax, stop worrying about me.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,600
You are the one that worries me.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,559
Relax, I have Fei Fei and
Qiu Jing with me.

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,400
My life will be better than yours here.

55
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,880
This is my last warning for you.

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,600
After I am back from America,

57
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,559
you need to give me an answer.

58
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
Fine, I get it.

59
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,320
That's all. Take care.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Goodbye.

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Zhou Shi.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,839
You are here.

63
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,680
Is Ning Fei all right now?

64
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,319
Much better now.
He can discharge from hospital soon.

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,960
That day,

66
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Let bygones be bygone.

67
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,840
He said you have apologized.

68
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,400
So let's not mention it ever.

69
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,440
Very well, but there is another thing
I must apologize to you.

70
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,120
What is it?

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,159
What is this?

72
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,159
I have been applying for
a college in America.

73
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,359
When I sent them my work,

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
I sent yours along with mine
without your permission.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,280
They are interested in your work.

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,479
If you pass the language test,
you will get the admission offer.

77
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,159
Studying abroad?

78
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,520
I have never thought about that.

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,359
Don't worry about the fees.

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,479
They are willing to provide scholarship.

81
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,199
You can have part-time job there.
Money won't be an issue.

82
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,680
They are willing to provide me
with the scholarship?

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,599
Of course, they are interested
in your drawing.

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,280
Zhou Shi.

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,479
I really think this is a
great opportunity for you.

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,440
Please reconsider the offer.

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
I will think about it.

88
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:29,720
Thank you.

89
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,079
Come on, stand closer.

90
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,440
A little closer.

91
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:37,159
-Stand closer.
-Place the reflecting panel there.

92
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,000
Good, stay in this pose.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,800
Okay, look at the camera.

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,599
Three, two, one, smile.

95
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:50,479
This is nice.

96
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,800
Great.

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,280
-Kiss her, kiss her!
-Kiss her!

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,079
Kiss her, kiss her!

99
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,039
Father, I am back.

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,240
Bi Qiu Jing, Li Ming Cheng,

101
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:23,479
The matrimony regulations conform to
the marriage law of the PRC.

102
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,440
They are hereby given this certificate.

103
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,919
Bi Qiu Jing, Li Ming Cheng,

104
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,879
-The matrimony regulations conform to...
-Stop!

105
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,440
Give it back.

106
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,599
You read it a dozen of times today.

107
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,359
If you want to get married so badly,
you can marry Xiao Fei now.

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,039
Who says I am going to marry him?

109
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,759
This is nothing but a fling.

110
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,280
I will ditch him soon enough.

111
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,039
I was just joking, don't be mad.

112
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,919
Xiao Fei is just a kid.

113
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,280
Stop scaring the kid, my old lady.

114
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,960
Right after I come back from America,

115
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,759
Xiao Fei will be old enough
to get married.

116
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,840
Are you really going for the offer?

117
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,240
Of course, this is the chance
of a lifetime.

118
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
I even get the scholarship.

119
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,280
Why shouldn't I go?

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you really going to leave us?

121
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,079
It's not I am never coming back.

122
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,400
Speaking of which, I can
shop for you online in America.

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,960
Leave, go there now!

124
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,599
I think our precious friendship is
on the brink of breaking.

125
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,440
You know I am just kidding.

126
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,519
We will miss you after you are gone.

127
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,279
What about Wei Qing?
Would he let you leave?

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,039
I didn't tell him.

129
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,080
He has other important
matter to see to right now.

130
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,359
I don't want to distract him.

131
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,800
I feel like your relationship
with Wei Qing...

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
is so close yet so far apart.

133
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,519
I do have feelings for him,
but I am not sure that is love.

134
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I am not going to make
a scene out of myself again.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,399
Let me tell you what it
truly means to like someone.

136
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,159
When you like someone,

137
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,159
you heart would be like
a piece of cotton candy,

138
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,719
the thought of him makes you melt.

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,399
You could feel the sweetness
right on your face,

140
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,760
and you would be smiling at him.

141
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:19,839
Come on, try it out.

142
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,359
How?

143
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:24,120
Think about him and
see if you get soft for him.

144
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,279
Nothing.

145
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,640
The feeling you describe
is too abstract.

146
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,279
When you like someone,

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
just get to the point.

148
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,240
That is too straight forward,
I could never do that.

149
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,080
What about you, Brother Ming Cheng?

150
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,519
When you like someone,

151
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,159
reading the post she made is like
searching the true meaning of a book,

152
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,760
replying to her messages is
like writing poetry.

153
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,039
What do you mean?

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,039
I need to think it through
for every word I write to her.

155
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,760
This is way above my standard.

156
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:05,919
Don't you have something
more common?

157
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,479
You would wag your tail if you have one.

158
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:15,159
I said it out loud?

159
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,560
So that is what you think of me?

160
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,159
Show us how you wag your tail.

161
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,719
It was a figure of speech.

162
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,008
I don't care! Wag your tail for me!

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,880
-Wag your tail.
-Wag your tail.

164
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,519
Hurry up.

165
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,240
How can you be so adorable?

166
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:42,200
I always thought Xiao Fei is
more of a cat person,

167
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:45,519
but he is actually a dog person.

168
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,880
No, he is a cat person.

169
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,800
Only a cat would bully a dog.

170
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
You are torturing a single dog!

171
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,200
That is so mean.

172
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,359
15 seconds is the perfect timing with
the current temperature in the pot.

173
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,839
No, you forgot the
oxidization rate of omasun,

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,279
I think the perfect
timing is 10 seconds.

175
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,959
-It's 15 seconds.
-It's 10 seconds.

176
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,080
It's definitely 15 seconds.

177
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,599
-It's 15 seconds.
-It's 10 seconds.

178
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,719
It's 15 seconds.

179
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Time's up.

180
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,039
Let's try it.

181
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,839
It's 15 seconds.

182
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
It's 10 seconds.

183
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,039
Here, try it out.

184
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,476
[What are you doing right now?]

185
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:09,680
This is the case file.
The incident happened at 3.00 a.m..

186
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,919
What are you doing?

187
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,320
Stop right there!

188
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:36,120
Stop! Give those back!

189
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,640
Give it back!

190
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,399
What do you want with my stuff?

191
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,599
Keep it going.

192
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,159
No! Don't go up there!

193
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,000
No!

194
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Don't go up there!

195
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:06,800
Son, my son!

196
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,279
Father?

197
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,839
father?

198
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,519
Move, move, move!

199
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,599
You run fast.

200
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,880
Father?

201
00:13:51,719 --> 00:13:52,599
Father?

202
00:13:55,599 --> 00:13:56,440
Father?

203
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:43,640
This looks like quite the feast.

204
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,680
I did a great job here.

205
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,959
Good luck.

206
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,519
Now, I shall wait for that
silly kid to come back.

207
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,479
Where could he be right now?

208
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,719
Tonight,

209
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,519
I need to have a drink with him.

210
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Father.

211
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:34,839
Don't you know?

212
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,800
That was my birthday.

213
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,479
I went out to have a drink
with my friends.

214
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,159
Father.

215
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,359
I am sorry.

216
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:57,839
I am sorry.

217
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,560
Father.

218
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I am planning to stay
in America for a while.

219
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,359
I leave the company
in your capable hands.

220
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,479
Sure.

221
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,880
Miss Zhou asked about you recently.

222
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:34,959
What should I tell her?

223
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,719
Tell her I will be busy.

224
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,880
The mean of contacting you?

225
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,640
Don't tell her for now.

226
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,560
Just tell her I will be busy.

227
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,719
I won't be available.

228
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:45,640
Sure.

229
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,279
What? He is not coming back
for some time?

230
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:14,600
He plans to stay in America
for a while.

231
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,399
For how long?

232
00:17:16,639 --> 00:17:19,399
I don't know for sure.

233
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,759
Is there any progress
on his father's case?

234
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,952
It's just as you guessed.

235
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,080
I am glad to hear that.

236
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,440
Has he settled down over there?

237
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:37,440
Is there a way to contact him?

238
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,680
We don't have anything for now.

239
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,600
I will give you his contact
as soon as he is available.

240
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,600
I was just asking.

241
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:50,360
Right.

242
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,279
The Chairman wants you to know
everything is fine over there.

243
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,919
He wants you to stop worrying.

244
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,360
Pass a message to him as well.

245
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
I am doing well here.
Don't worry about me.

246
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:02,239
Sure.

247
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,840
"ize" is a suffix for word.

248
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,919
It means "make" or "become".

249
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,080
Boys and girls, feel free to ask
if you have any questions.

250
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,279
When you like someone,

251
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:03,159
you heart would be like
a piece of cotton candy,

252
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,239
the thought of him makes you melt.

253
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,999
You could feel the sweetness
right on your face,

254
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,279
and you would be smiling at him.

255
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:15,360
Come on, try it out.

256
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,840
How?

257
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,800
Think about him and
see if you get soft for him.

258
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,159
Oh no.

259
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:00,239
Okay, time's up.

260
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,639
Stop your pens and we will
collect your answer sheets.

261
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:16,360
Assistant. An.

262
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,119
What brings you here?

263
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,039
This is from the Chairman.

264
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,759
What is this?

265
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,039
A flight ticket to America.

266
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,680
Where are you headed?

267
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,119
America. I am going to Wei Qing.

268
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,440
Wei Qing?

269
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,239
I want him to explain why he didn't
answer my messages for months.

270
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,519
Teach him a good lesson for me.

271
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,720
High five.

272
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:02,999
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

273
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,159
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

274
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,919
Go on, move.

275
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,480
Stay safe.

276
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:09,639
Good luck, goodbye!

277
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,720
-We'll wait!
-Goodbye.

278
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,480

Where are you staying for the night?

298
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
A hotel near Wei Qing's house.

299
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:52,680
He didn't find out you were
following him?

300
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,919
Of course.

301
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
I am quite the expert
at tailing people.

302
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:59,600
I saw her following me as soon
as I stepped out the house.

303
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,600
I was trying very hard not to laugh.

304
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,639
You finally got a
chance to be in America,

305
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,639
are you not going to meet him at all?

306
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,600
No, not unless he comes to me first.

307
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,600
Be patient.

308
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,239
She is playing hide and seek.

309
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
I'll play along.

310
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,999
-Let's see who can't stand it first.
-Let's see who can't stand it first.

311
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,200
Today at Ninghai, the Snow Group...

312
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,039
official acquires Yun Ma Artwork.

313
00:23:24,239 --> 00:23:26,080
Xue Zi, the heir of Snow Group...

314
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,159
and the person in charge of
Yun Ma Artwork, He Wei...

315
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,759
attended the signing ceremony.

316
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,039
It was the error on my end.

317
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:35,480
I never expect He Wei would sell
all the share to Xue Zi.

318
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,119
Book a ticket for me.

319
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,399
I am headed back tomorrow.

320
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,519
Yes.

321
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,879
Zhou Shi, come on Zhou Shi.

322
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,840
Didn't you come here just to see him?

323
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,720
Why are you hiding in your room?

324
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:55,320
YOu just puff yourself up at your own cost.

325
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:58,239
Forget it, I will see him tomorrow.

326
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,919
I lost to him again.

327
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,480
The Chairman is going back tomorrow.

328
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,360
He booked you the ticket
of the same flight with him.

329
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,279
Please pack your belongings
as soon as possible.

330
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:16,639
He is going back tomorrow?

331
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,039
Go on without me.

332
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:55,480
I miss you so much.

333
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,840
I miss you too.

334
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,560
Why didn't you call me if you
miss me so much?

335
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,200
I was trying to give you
more time to consider.

336
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:12,200
I even booked the ticket to
America for you.

337
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,480
You didn't call me even after I arrived!

338
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,600
You kept following me and
wouldn't talk to me,

339
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,279
I thought you didn't want to see me.

340
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,759
Who says...

341
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:23,039
How do you know I was following you?

342
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,879
I found it out the first day
you started doing that.

343
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,879
Do you really think you are
an expert in tailing people?

344
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,080
You...

345
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,159
Did you see me on the flight just now?

346
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,519
Hello, brother.

347
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,840
How adorable of you.

348
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,320
Goodbye, big brother.

349
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,239
You are cured?

350
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,360
Yes, I am.

351
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:10,840
What is it now?

352
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:13,879
You clearly knew I missed you,
why didn't you call me?

353
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,039
You knew I missed you,
why didn't you meet me?

354
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,239
I...

355
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:18,999
From the day I met you,

356
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:21,519
you have always tried
to be the one in control.

357
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,519
You controlled each and
every action I make.

358
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,560
Even in our relationship,

359
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,519
you are still doing the same thing.

360
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,480
If you want me to be with you,

361
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,119
I hope you see me as your equal.

362
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,999
At least let me feel like
you care about me.

363
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:43,639
Of course I care about you.

364
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:46,800
But I can't feel it.

365
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
What's wrong with her?

366
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,680
Maybe I crossed the line.

367
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,200
You should go after her.

368
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,320
She is now mad at me.
I will talk to her later.

369
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,519
♪ Let's fly into that starry sky... ♪

370
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:32,200
♪ to light up our dreams. ♪

371
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,999
I thought you are in America.

372
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,919
What brings you back now?

373
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,200
Your acquiring the Yun Ma Artwork
is a big deal.

374
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,680
Of course I need to come
back and congratulate you.

375
00:27:48,879 --> 00:27:50,720
It's now the Snow Artwork.

376
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,840
Miss Xue, let's get to the point.

377
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,119
I came back to buy the
Yun Ma Artwork back.

378
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,800
When you transferred
your share to He Wei,

379
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:01,960
you should have seen this coming.

380
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:04,879
Bringing up this issue to me now...

381
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,720
is simply too late.

382
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,840
How much did you pay for the share?

383
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,519
I will pay you double for it.

384
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,039
And you have my word,

385
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,999
the partnership between
Yun Ma Jewellery and Snow...

386
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,639
will bring you lucrative profit.

387
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:22,639
Chairman Wei, did you get away
for so long...

388
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,680
that forget how to be a businessman?

389
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,879
What's done is done,

390
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:30,600
my plan for Yun Ma is not something
you can easily change.

391
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,200
Other than the Xun Art Gallery,

392
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,440
the other galleries will
all be shut down.

393
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,200
They will be turned into luxuries shops.

394
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:40,119
The price of these real estate alone...

395
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,680
is more than the money
you offered just now.

396
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,960
Please, name a price for me.
I will play along.

397
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,320
The issue with Yun Ma Artwork is
not just about money.

398
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,800
Rather than wasting our time here,

399
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:55,399
you might as well plan
our next partnership.

400
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:59,200
Snow is still interested in cooperating
with Yun Ma Jewellery.

401
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,279
By then, the jewelry we produce together,

402
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,519
will be sold in the new shops of Snow.

403
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,480
It seems your resolve
is unwavering.

404
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
You don't plan to sell it back.

405
00:29:16,639 --> 00:29:18,480
There's no point in continuing
this conversation.

406
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,560
But Miss Xue, He laughs best who laughs last.

407
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,800
I won't give up so easily.

408
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,200
So long.

409
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,360
A study tour?

410
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,999
They received offers
from a lot of schools.

411
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,560
But they didn't decide
on which place to go.

412
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,680
So, they made up their minds
and went to all the schools,

413
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,440
making it their honeymoon trip.

414
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,200
The two of them are like real life bugs.

415
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,239
I worked so hard
and only got one offer.

416
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,600
They did nothing and got
all the other offers.

417
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,159
Perhaps this is how knowledge could
change your destiny.

418
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:08,800
Enough about them.
Let's talk about you.

419
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:11,360
Is your relationship with
Wei Qing closer after the trip?

420
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:12,639
I...

421
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,200
Not bad.

422
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,119
What do you mean by that?

423
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,200
You were following him for days
and didn't even talk to him?

424
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,320
I did talk to him, but...

425
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,080
He still got his hands full
with the matter at Yun Ma artwork.

426
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,960
He doesn't have the time
for Zhou Shi yet.

427
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,840
What happened to Yun Ma Artwork?

428
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,360
It's He Wei, he sold
all his share to Xue Zi.

429
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
No wonder he went to meet her.

430
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,200
How do you know about that?

431
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,840
Xue Zi called me and told
me the galleries are sold.

432
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,159
I am not working for them.

433
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,519
They want me to be Snow
Jewelry's designer.

434
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,200
-You turned her down?
-Of course.

435
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,560
The gallery is Uncle's life work.
I can't let her ruin it.

436
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,320
But you have a contract
with the gallery.

437
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:58,279
What if they sue you?

438
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,759
The contract expired.

439
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,360
-What?
-It expired over a month ago.

440
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:05,239
They were busy with the acquisition
and had no time for me.

441
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,759
I wouldn't sign it again anyway.

442
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,200
No, you need to take on the contract.

443
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:10,960
But the gallery...

444
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,680
Signing a contract with them is
the only way to save the gallery.

445
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,800
Xue Zi's villa is luxurious.

446
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,919
It's has even more grandeur than
Wei Qing's house.

447
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,639
Xiao Fei.

448
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,039
Are these photos from your childhood?

449
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:45,560
Brother?

450
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,560
Where did she get these?

451
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,800
I am sorry for the long wait.

452
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,440
Where did you get these photos?

453
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,840
Where is this person now?

454
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,680
Silly kid, I got your back.

455
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:01,440
If someone bullies you,
let them know I am your brother.

456
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,759
-Brother?
-Brother?

457
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,720
Stay away from him! Back off!

458
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,239
Get lost!

459
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,800
Silly kid,
they are always picking on you.

460
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:24,119
What is your name?

461
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,279
Ning Fei.

462
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,879
Ning Fei?

463
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,680
That is a strange name.

464
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,239
Silly kid, if they bully you again,

465
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,080
tell them I am your brother.

466
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:36,840
From now on, I am Ning Ran.

467
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,119
So, it wasn't your real family name?

468
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,399
I was sent to the orphanage
as an infant.

469
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,080
There was only the word "Ran"
on my clothing.

470
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:48,519
I took on the name Liao Ran.

471
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,960
I have no name until
I was eight years old.

472
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,680
Until I met him.

473
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,759
I've been searching for you.

474
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,399
But I never thought...

475
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
That I am a girl...

476
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,239
and I inherit the Snow Group?

477
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,279
I was surprised as well.

478
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,840
I never thought my little brother...

479
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,560
the little crybaby is a genius artist.

480
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,519
Since you knew it was me,

481
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,200
why didn't come to me?

482
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,800
Why didn't you tell me
when we met that day?

483
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,480
Since you know who I am now,
it makes thing easier for us.

484
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,119
I will sign another
contract with you,

485
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,239
you will have your
own professional team.

486
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:30,639
You'll work for me.

487
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:33,159
I will let you show the world
your greatest potential.

488
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,800
No, I came here today...

489
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,840
because I want you to
return the Yun Ma Artwork.

490
00:33:42,642 --> 00:33:44,360
Wei Qing sent you here?

491
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,960
I have my success today
all thanks to Uncle.

492
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,960
I wish to preserve his life work.

493
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:56,840
I hope that for our old time's sake...

494
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,119
Yes, you are my brother.

495
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,639
I went through painstaking effort
to acquire Yun Ma Artwork...

496
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,159
all because of you.

497
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:08,239
But our relationship and business
are two different matters.

498
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:12,679
I will not hand over my business
simply because you are my brother.

499
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:16,080
Fine, let's talk business then.

500
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
If you refuse to return Yun Ma Artwork,

501
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,479
we will not let Xun Ran design
any work for Snow Group.

502
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,719
That is not up to you.

503
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,439
I have a contract with Xun Art Gallery.

504
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,880
The contract expired.

505
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,479
You can ask the lawyers.

506
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,439
What do you mean?

507
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,080
I think you bought this company...

508
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:39,439
not just because of the real estate
from those galleries.

509
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,600
It's because Xun Ran's fame
in the industry...

510
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,239
and the business value he holds.

511
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,600
With the two aspects of
business and artwork,

512
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Ning Fei is undoubtedly
a great treasure,

513
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:57,800
he would be much more valuable
than those real estates.

514
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:01,519
Your target wasn't Yun Ma Artwork,

515
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:04,600
it was the designer Xun Ran
that worked for it.

516
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,400
And it's not just because
he is your little brother.

517
00:35:11,999 --> 00:35:13,679
As for me,

518
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,039
I am the only legal owner
of Xun Ran's work.

519
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,239
the distribution of his artwork
must go through my permission.

520
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:25,400
This is a certificate with legal effect.

521
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,880
You refuse to reunite with Xiao Fei...

522
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,239
because you don't want to
expose your background.

523
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,239
If people know you were adopted,

524
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:40,519
your power as the heir
might be in jeopardy.

525
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,439
Very well,

526
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,920
let's talk about the
business deal now.

527
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,039
Chairman, Miss Xue wishes to see you.

528
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,279
Miss Xue, you are demanding a lot.

529
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,920
You said so yourself.
For the sake of Yun Ma Artwork,

530
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,479
I can name whatever price I want.

531
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,880
May I know what changed
your mind so soon?

532
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,519
Your girlfriend has the answer.

533
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:41,840
Zhou Shi?

534
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,239
-Who is it?
-Zhou Shi?

535
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,479
Where is Zhou Shi?

536
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,439
She is not here.

537
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,679

Are you all right?

555
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:15,800
I am fine, I was just hit.

556
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,479
What are you doing here?

557
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,320
Fei Fei told me you are here.

558
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,279
Let's after we got out of the water.

559
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,199
This place is too remote,
most people don't know about it.

560
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,600
What brings you here?

561
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:39,160
I live nearby ten years ago
before I went to America.

562
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,679
I came by for a swim
when I had free time.

563
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,719
It's been ten years
and nothing changed.

564
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,320
What about you?
Why would you swim here?

565
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,439
This is the anniversary
of me almost drowning.

566
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,759
I came here every for a swim
on this day.

567
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,199
Speaking of which, you remind me.

568
00:38:59,479 --> 00:39:01,600
Before I left for America,

569
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,999
I did save a girl here once.

570
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,679
Right in this pool.

571
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,120
Hey, wake up!

572
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,400
Wake up!

573
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,279
Wake up!

574
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:35,840
It's you?

575
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,160
-What?
-The man that saved me 10 years ago...

576
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,999
was actually you?

577
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,160
What do you mean?

578
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,080
I have the answer for your question.

579
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,840
I know that.

580
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,759
But I am going abroad soon.

581
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,920
I am also...

582
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,039
What?

583
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,120
Why didn't you tell me?

584
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,679
Why should I tell you?

585
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,360
This is my own business.

586
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,840
This is not just about you,
it's about the two of us.

587
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,679
What do you mean our business?

588
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,439
I am not your girlfriend.

589
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,239
How are you not my girlfriend?

590
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,600
You are my girlfriend.

591
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:35,880
No way, you don't like me anyway.

592
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,400
Of course I like you.

593
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,759
I don't buy it.

594
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,719
Everyone, be my witness.

595
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:45,039
I, Wei Qing,

596
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:46,439
like Zhou Shi a lot!

597
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,199
From now on, she is my girlfriend!

598
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,320
What are you doing?

599
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,120
Do you believe me now?

600
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,719
Fine, I believe you.

601
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:00,400
Childish.

602
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,600
Are you willing to wait for me?

603
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:06,039
Sure.

604
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:09,279
I will wait as long as it takes.

605
00:41:35,279 --> 00:41:39,160
I've been thinking
my drowning that afternoon...

606
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:42,600
meant that my love-life would be ups and downs .

607
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,840
But I forgot one thing.

608
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,080
I learned to swim that very same day.

609
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,199
All the sadness, joy and anger,

610
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:54,640
they are nothing but a challenge
from fate itself.

611
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,360
But fortunately,

612
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,959
the destined guardian
was always by my side.

613
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,840
Even if I lose my way again,

614
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:06,320
he would still be there
when I turn around.

615
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:11,640
They say all encounter
was a reunion in disguise.

616
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,239
If something is guiding us
towards each other,

617
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,920
perhaps that is love.
