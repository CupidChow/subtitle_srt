Yes, she's taking a shower now.

it might make things worse.

I'll send her back safely.

What a tiring day.

00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,079
I didn't expect things
to turn out this way.

50
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:53,600
It's all Li Ming Cheng's fault.

51
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,320
He did nothing wrong
by liking you.

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,040
I think Xiao Fei is right.

53
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,800
Li Ming Cheng did nothing wrong.

54
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:02,040
Why? You won't let him like you?

55
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,800
Moreover, he didn't know
Zhou Shi likes him.

56
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,520
Well, someone finally likes you.

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Shouldn't you be happy?

58
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:10,359
Love is...

59
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,279
so troublesome, it doesn't suit me.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,160
I think both of you suit each other.

61
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,680
You're the only one that can
understand words on his T-shirt.

62
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,599
You can understand each other well.

63
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,079
You should be a couple.

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,680
Shouldn't we talk about...

65
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,840
how to console Zhou Shi?

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,639
Why are you talking about me?

67
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,599
Zhou Shi has been liked Brother
Ming Cheng for decades.

68
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,400
But, you stole him away just like that.

69
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,199
You should think carefully
how to console her.

70
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,159
I'll find Li Ming Cheng and
get him to like Zhou Shi.

71
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,840
Sit down.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
Is that something you can change?

73
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,479
Then what should we do?

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,400
Anyway, Sister Zhou Shi won't blame you.

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,680
She won't blame me,

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,359
but I have to do something.

77
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,479
Think about it yourself.
I'm going to bed.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,359
By the way, text Brother Ming Cheng...

79
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,960
to let him know Zhou Shi is fine.

80
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,280
No.

81
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,680
Just send him a text.

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,879
I don't have his WeChat ID.

83
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,319
Besides, he's probably been
worried for the whole night.

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,120
I won't do it. Send it yourself.

85
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,280
Will you send it or not?
If you won't send it, I won't sleep.

86
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,400
I...

87
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,840
I'll send it.

88
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,319
Done.

89
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,319
Goodnight.

90
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm going to wash up.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,199
So annoying.

92
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,159
Have you slept?

93
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,560
No.

94
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,759
Can you talk with me?

95
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,639
About what?

96
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,120
Anything.

97
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,159
Okay, let's talk about...

98
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,000
why you like Li Ming Cheng.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
If you don't want to
talk about it, forget it then.

100
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,039
Because there was a power outage
in the elevator.

101
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,479
Power outage?

102
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,560
Wait a minute.

103
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,479
You just moved in, right?

104
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,079
I didn't see you before.

105
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,319
Yes.

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,599
I'm Li Ming Cheng.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,599
We'll be neighbors from now on.

108
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,240
I'm Zhou Shi.

109
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't be scared, I have a torchlight.

110
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,680
Aren't you scared?

111
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,000
It's fine, this elevator always
break down...

112
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,120
as it's old.

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Don't worry, someone
will come and fix it soon.

114
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,079
Come on, sit down.

115
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:42,680
Here.

116
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,039
It's dark yet you're
doing your homework?

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,680
This homework is too easy.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,199
I can finish it in a while.

119
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,319
I think doing homework is difficult.

120
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,000
I have an exam tomorrow.

121
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,560
I don't know what to do.

122
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,840
Really?

123
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,560
Show me.

124
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,319
It is so simple.

125
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,479
Look, these questions are simple.

126
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,440
Look at this one.

127
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
When they were fixing...

128
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,159
the elevator,

129
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,159
not only he taught me
how to do my homework,

130
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:30,800
but also helped me with revision.

131
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,479
After studying so many years

132
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,440
That was the first time
that I learned so effectively...

133
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,000
Then?

134
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,880
Then, I took the exam the next day.

135
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,200
I got 100 marks.

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,000
That was the first full mark
I got in my life.

137
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,599
I was so excited.

138
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
My teacher also praised me.

139
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,680
After school, I ran home...

140
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,519
because I wanted to show him.

141
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,599
But, I accidentally fell...

142
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,640
into the pool with the exam paper.

143
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,039
Although I was saved,

144
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,279
the exam paper was ruined.

145
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,200
So, I didn't show it to him.

146
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,039
But, from that day on,

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
I fell for him.

148
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,399
So,

149
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,159
because he helped you...

150
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,719
to get 100 marks,

151
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,719
you liked him for over a decade?

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,200
You know nothing.

153
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,200
Brother Ming Cheng is my idol.

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,640
In that elevator, we didn't know if
we could get out alive,

155
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,680
but he could focus on his homework...

156
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,519
and even helped me to revise.

157
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,080
Do you know how moved...

158
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,479
a little girl would be?

159
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,359
Is this love?

160
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I think so.

161
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,640
You think so?

162
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,240
Of course this is love.

163
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,359
Don't interrupt me, okay?

164
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,880
Okay, go on...

165
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Since then,
I wanted to catch up with him.

166
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,399
For him,

167
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:58,479
I entered Guang Hua Vision University.

168
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,680
I hope that one day,

169
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,000
I'd be able to catch up with him...

170
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,599
and tell him personally that...

171
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
the girl in the elevator...

172
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,800
has grown up.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,440
She fell for him...

174
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,599
and wanted to be with him.

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,680
But, I failed to confess
my feelings for three times.

176
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,880
Maybe because I am too stupid.

177
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,919
I don't suit Brother Ming Cheng at all.

178
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,519
So, if you connect the three words together,

179
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,800
it will be "I Love You".

180
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:43,959
How cliche.

181
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,240
Li Ming Cheng, who are you
confessing your feelings to?

182
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:51,000
As expected, you're the only one
that can understand my heart.

183
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,359
Bi Qiu Jing, I like you.

184
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,240
He did nothing wrong
by liking you.

185
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,560
I think both of you suit each other.

186
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,760
You're the only one that can
understand words on his T-shirt.

187
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,039
You can understand each other well.

188
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,959
You should be a couple.

Calm down, Bi Qiu Jing...

00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,919
Thank you for drying my clothes.

00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,680
Didn't we agree to go back home?

240
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,320
We have to do something.

241
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,719
What is it?

242
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,200
Why is it with you?

243
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:12,680
Previously, the cleaner threw it away
when she cleaned the room.

244
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,039
When you told me about it,

245
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,399
I asked them to get it back.

246
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
That means you already have it ages ago?

247
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,399
Why did you give it back to me now?

248
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:20,760
I forgot it.

249
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,039
You forgot it?

250
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,159
Do you know how important is this to me?

251
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:29,560
Are you going to continue...

252
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,839
criticizing me...

253
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,680
or will you do something serious...

254
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,279
like confessing your feelings
to Li Ming Cheng?

255
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
Confess my feelings? I already knew...

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,719
he likes the top student.

257
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,479
Why should I confess my feelings?

258
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,680
Since getting 100 marks in that exam,

259
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,320
you've been thinking of...

260
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,959
confessing your feelings
officially one day.

261
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,640
You've worked hard for so many years...

262
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
to catch up with him...

263
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,080
and become someone that can suit him.

264
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,599
You've been waiting for this chance
for more than a decade.

265
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,519
Now, you have the chance.

266
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
Are you really going to give up...

267
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,159
without confessing your feelings?

268
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:02,440
Don't you want to know who you are...

269
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,000
in Li Ming Cheng's heart?

270
00:16:04,719 --> 00:16:06,039
I do.

271
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,719
You're still wearing this outfit

272
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:12,560
The show isn't over yet.

273
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,560
Go and confess your feelings.

274
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,959
No matter what, think it as...

275
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:17,880
an answer to the younger you.

276
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,000
Good luck.

277
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,440
Good luck.

278
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,760
Did you read it?

279
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,919
No.

280
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,719
Your expression looks suspicious.

281
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
I'll deal with you when I get back.

282
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:26,879
Brother Ming Cheng.

283
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,840
Shi Shi.

284
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,759
Are you okay?

285
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,200
What is this?

286
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,480
Brother Ming Cheng. This time,
I got 100 marks for the exam.

287
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,360
Thank you for helping me
revise in the elevator.

288
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,399
Thank you.

289
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,360
You're welcome.

290
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,600
There's also something else.

291
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,879
What is it?

292
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:47,879
I like you a lot.

293
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,840
I've liked you for 15 years.

294
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,039
Can I be your girlfriend?

295
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,999
But, I've always thought you
as a little sister.

296
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,720
I don't want to be your little sister.

297
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,639
I want to be your girlfriend,
will you say yes?

298
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,200
Shi Shi, remember that...

299
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:11,159
I'll always treat you as...

300
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,800
my little sister.

301
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,639
no matter in the past or future,

302
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,840
I'll protect you...

303
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,080
like an elder brother.

304
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:22,919
But,

305
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,960
I know Bi Qiu Jing now.

306
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,720
I like her a lot.

307
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,720
So...

308
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,800
I understand.

309
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,840
Can I hug you?

310
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:48,919
Thank you.

311
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,360
Thank you for giving me hope
for 15 years.

312
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,560
I'll appreciate it.

313
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,840
Shi Shi.

314
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,960
Can you return the exam paper to me now?

315
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,080
Okay.

316
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,800
I hope that...

317
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,639
you can succeed in pursuing
Sister Qiu Jing.

318
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,159
But, as her best friend,

319
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,919
I don't think you have much hope.

320
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
Why?

321
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,399
Because you're not her type.

322
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,680

She's here, are you ready?

348
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,159
Are you done?

349
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,919
Why is it so dark? Nobody home?

350
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Don't switch on the light.

351
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,680
Quick, come over here.

352
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,480
What are you doing?

353
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,639
Here...

354
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,119
Okay.

355
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,600
Fei Fei, who did this?

356
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,639
The top student, of course.

357
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,279
Zhou Shi, I'm sorry for
what happened yesterday.

358
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,919
Top student,

359
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,119
let bygones be bygone.

360
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,039
We are still good friends.

361
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,080
You're hugging each other without me?
I want to join in too.

362
00:23:32,239 --> 00:23:33,279
Come on.

363
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,519
Come.

364
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,279
-Can I join in too?
-This is so pretty.

365
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,680
Of course.

366
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,879
How did you make the snow?

367
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:29,239
This is a simple chemistry reaction.

368
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,600
Just add water to...

369
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,800
polyacrylic acid.

370
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,399
This is so magical.

371
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,480
If you like it, next time, I'll make...

372
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,080
elephant toothpaste, golden rain,

373
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,759
and the coolest reaction,

374
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,320
the Pharaoh's serpent.

375
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,800
But, that one is poisonous.

376
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,999
I won't make that for you.

377
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,519
If you let her go on,

378
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,960
she won't
finish it in three days.

379
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,200
Top student,

380
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,039
why don't you do
something useful today?

381
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,840
Shouldn't you pay for our dinner?

382
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:57,480
No problem. Let's eat
Haidilao Hotpot tonight.

383
00:24:57,639 --> 00:24:58,720
If we're not full,
we won't come back.

384
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,200
I'll pay for dinner tonight.

385
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,080
Why?

386
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,279
My art exhibition is on from tomorrow.

387
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:16,320
You're finally holding
an art exhibition!

388
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,800
I want to go...

389
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,159
Okay, I got it...

390
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,399
You're Xun Ran?

391
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,119
You didn't expect that, right?

392
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,360
Our little disloyal cat...

393
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,999
is the genius artist, Xun Ran.

394
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,960
I'm sorry for hiding it from you.

395
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:35,919
Okay.

396
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:38,879
Since you're paying for dinner tonight,

397
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,279
we'll forgive you.

398
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,639
Top student, what are you
taking pictures of?

399
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,639
The future Xun Ran's old home.

400
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,360
I'll auction it off.

401
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,399
Well, let's go and eat?

402
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,200
I'll go and get changed.

403
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,119
I'll go and fix my makeup.

404
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,080
I need to get changed too.

405
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,360
Okay, I'll get changed too.

406
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,720
Now, you know how to ring the doorbell...

407
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,279
instead of climbing in
through the window?

408
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,519
I don't want to see...

409
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:21,919
something inappropriate.

410
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:27,399
Did you succeed in
confessing your feelings?

411
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,879
You knew the answer
but still asked me about it.

412
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,600
But, I have to thank you.

413
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:35,519
Thank you for encouraging me.

414
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,239
Or else, I'd still worry...

415
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:38,639
about the next confession.

416
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,039
It is good.

417
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,759
I don't have to think about it anymore.

418
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,239
It's good that you got over it.

419
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,480
Actually, I already knew that...

420
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,680
Brother Ming Cheng likes
Sister Qiu Jing.

421
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,840
I was lying to myself...

422
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,759
that they only appreciate each other.

423
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,800
Maybe, like what you've said,

424
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,200
I probably don't love
Brother Ming Cheng.

425
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,600
Enough, let's stop talking about this.

426
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:06,239
I came here to give you something.

427
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,519
Here it is.

428
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:09,999
What is this?

429
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:12,279
I received my salary.
I'm paying you back.

430
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,239
I don't remember you owed me money.

431
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,440
Previously,

432
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,399
you repaid my dad's gambling debts.

433
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,200
Although we're friends now,

434
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,879
you shouldn't bear the loan.

435
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,600
So, I'll return the money to you slowly.

436
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,239
Okay.

437
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,840
That's all.

438
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,639
I'm going back to sleep.

439
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:33,360
You've worked hard
for the past few days.

440
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,800
Get some sleep.

441
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,360
I hope I can.

442
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,879
By the way, will you go to
Xun Ran's art exhibition tomorrow?

443
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,800
No, I won't.

444
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,320
Wei An will go to the ribbon-cutting ceremony for me.

445
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,600
Okay.

446
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:56,039
I'll help to say good words for you
in front of Chairman He.

447
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,600
Goodnight.

448
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:08,519
She can repay the money,

449
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,560
but what about my feelings?

450
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,919
Xiao Fei, have you not slept yet?

451
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:30,919
Birthday present.

452
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,480
I have a present, thank you...

453
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,039
Quick, open it.

454
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,399
From now on, I, Xun Ran...

455
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,440
is willing to give all
of my paintings...

456
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,680
to Zhou Shi forever.

457
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,080
She can choose to
keep them or sell them.

458
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:54,239
No one else can
interfere her decision.

459
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,639
This is...

460
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,279
You like my paintings,

461
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,639
so I'll give them all to you.

462
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,200
No, this is too expensive,
I can't take it.

463
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Xiao Fei.

464
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,919
If you don't want it,
I won't paint anymore.

465
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,680
You have full privilege
of my paintings from now on.

466
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,480
Thank you.

467
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,320
Don't cry.

468
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,159
Don't cry.

469
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,440
that means,

470
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,919
with this,

471
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,239
I can stay at home and earn money?

472
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I think so.

473
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,759
Then, I'll have to keep this well.
I can't lose it.

474
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,239
It's fine. If you lose it,
I'll write another one.

475
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,720
I must be the luckiest fan...

476
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,399
in the world.

477
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:37,999
Thank you, my idol.

478
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:14,119
Oh dear, there are so many people.

479
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,800
Turns out our disloyal cat
is pretty famous.

480
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,600
Of course, there will be
more people in the future.

481
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,399
I don't get why are the paintings good.

482
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,440
I'll keep being a vulgar person.

483
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,639
Where is the top student?

484
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:30,919
She's Xiao Fei's top fan now.

485
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,480
She's in his office...

486
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,759
watching him being interviewed.

487
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:36,360
I think our house can be...

488
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,360
Xun Ran's fan base.

489
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,919
We're all his fans.

490
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:42,239
Miss Zhou.

491
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,399
Miss Xue, you're here.

492
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,600
I was wondering...

493
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,999
why didn't you come.

494
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,720
I don't like crowds.

495
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,999
So, I came after...

496
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:52,200
everyone left.

497
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,399
Then you'll have to wait
for a while. Xiao Fei...

498
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,600
Xun Ran is having an interview inside.

499
00:30:57,759 --> 00:30:59,080
Xun Ran is here?

500
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,279
Xiao Fei, here!

501
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,480
How do you feel about
your first interview?

502
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,840
Nervous.

503
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,080
You'll get used to it later on.

504
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,960
You'll have a lot of interviews.

505
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,720
Auntie said...

506
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:32,999
I can only accept interviews
from the Celebrities.

507
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,200
Looks like Director He
holds an important position.

508
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,600
That means your interviews...

509
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,119
will be exclusive to us.

510
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,159
Let me introduce you.
This is Miss Xue Zi.

511
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,399
She's your fan too.

512
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Hello.

513
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Hello.

514
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,879
Did we meet before?

515
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,919
Impossible.

516
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,960
I've just returned to this country.

517
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,279
But, I've always admired your works.

518
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,720
I even carried along the necklace
you designed.

519
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,800
Miss Xue told me about...

520
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:10,600
the word "Ran" in your painting.

521
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,080
How did you know it?

522
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,360
I saw many of your paintings
and discovered it coincidentally.

523
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:19,279
Then, do you know Ning Ran?

524
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,399
No, I don't.

525
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,519
Don't just stand here.
Let's sit down and talk.

526
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,800
You go first and have a talk.

527
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,320
I have to go to the washroom.

528
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,919
♪ It's just me ♪

529
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:46,519

531
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:54,279
What are you looking at?

532
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,200
Do you like mature women like her?

533
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,720
I think I knew her from somewhere.

534
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,519
Ran wasn't selected this time?

535
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:20,200
Yes, because she's a girl,

536
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,840
it's hard for her to be selected.

537
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,119
This is the fifth time.
How pitiful.

538
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,039

544
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,239
Keep buying Yun Ma Artwork's shares.

545
00:34:24,759 --> 00:34:26,640
Can you change to a more natural pose?

546
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,160
You're too stiff now.

547
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,679
This pose is tiring, okay?

548
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,120
How can I relax?

549
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,439
Change to a natural pose and relax.

550
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:37,039
Relax.

551
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:44,320
This is relaxing.

552
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,600
This is too relaxing.

553
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:48,239
Are you sure you want
to use this pose...

554
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,600
to join the competition?

555
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,640
Competition?

556
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,080
Then I have to find a suitable pose.

557
00:34:57,759 --> 00:34:58,999
This pose then.

558
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,999
This pose is the most natural.

559
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,600
Don't move.

560
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,679
Well, what competition did you join?

561
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,560
Yun Ma's design competition.

562
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,400
Yun Ma?

563
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:17,800
Why? Is it not good?

564
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,320
You hate Wei Qing, right?

565
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:22,160
Why did you join Yun Ma's competition?

566
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,719
Yun Ma?

567
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,080
I won't go.

568
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:27,759
I know that you hate Wei Qing.

569
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,279
But, the winner for this competition
will be signed by Yun Ma directly.

570
00:35:31,759 --> 00:35:33,640
You know Yun Ma's status
in this industry.

571
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,640
Many people wants to join them.

572
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,080
It's their business.

573
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,039
I wouldn't want to work for Wei Qing.

574
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,239
You're too sentimental.

575
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:44,279
Do you know why Wei Qing
hold this competition?

576
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:47,160
Yun Ma Artwork
has been suffering losses.

577
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,039
He wants to change the situation.

578
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,840
So, every artist that signed on...

579
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,519
will be personally trained by him.

580
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,439
What does that have to do with me?

581
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,880
Don't you want Zhou Shi...

582
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,560
to see his true colours?

583
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,600
If you're signed on to Yun Ma,

584
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,880
you'll have more chances to
get close to him.

585
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,479
Then, you can get something from him.

586
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,479
Besides, Zhou Shi is working in Yun Ma.

587
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,519
Even if she doesn't like Wei Qing now,

588
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,600
she may be attracted by him...

589
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:16,279
after some time.
are you Ok with that?

590
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,479
Are you still drawing?

591
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:27,479
I'm tired. Can I take a break?

592
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,519
Yes.

593
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,239
I've finished the basic sketch.

594
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:38,120
For this design competition,

595
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,600
if you succeed,

596
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,519
it will be a great chance for you.

597
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,279
You think so too?

598
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:45,880
Yes.

599
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:48,800
He is very accomplished
in his profession.

600
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,479
Most importantly,

601
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,160
he not only values
the importance of art,

602
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,959
he also places importance
on commercial value too.

603
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,840
He can stretch you
to your full potential.

604
00:36:57,279 --> 00:36:59,679
For a newcomer,

605
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,400
it's fortunate.

606
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,479
If that's the case,

607
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,920
why didn't you join the competition?

608
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,400
Me? Forget it.

609
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,920
With talented artists like you,

610
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,560
I won't embarrass myself.

611
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,880
Aren't you close to Wei Qing?

612
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:15,080
He'll help you, right?

613
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,719
How is that possible?

614
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,080
He has a high professional integrity.

615
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,039
He won't cheat.

616
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,600
Looks like you've changed
your mind about him.

617
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,600
Previously, you hated him, right?

618
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,920
Yes, a little.

619
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,479
But, after getting to know him,

620
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,320
I think he's a good person.

621
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,759
Okay, good luck.

622
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:39,400
We may be colleagues if you win.

623
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,959
I'll be looking forward to that.

624
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,400
Are you done resting?

625
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:46,800
-Let's continue.
-Okay.

626
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,160
Zhou Shi.

627
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,880
Zhou Shi.

628
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,920
You...

629
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:56,959
Disgusting.

630
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,719
How can you say that to me?

631
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,279
Don't think I don't know...

632
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,640
what you did to Zhou Shi.

633
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,439
I've always been upfront with
whatever I did.

634
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:06,840
I'm not like you who did
that while she was sleeping.

635
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,920
Who is it?

636
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,080
Don't worry, it's me.

637
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,679
You can continue sleeping.

638
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:20,199
Let me tell you.

639
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,039
You'd better find a new model.

640
00:39:22,479 --> 00:39:24,959
I don't want this to happen again.

641
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,519
I'm not a generous person.

642
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,959
Wei Qing.

643
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,479
What is it?

644
00:39:53,439 --> 00:39:55,080
Why am I in your car?

645
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,999
I was in the art studio, right?

646
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,120
You fell asleep there,

647
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,759
so I brought you back to the car.

648
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:02,560
Why didn't I wake up?

649
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:05,439
-I didn't feel anything at all.
-Because you're a female bear.

650
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,120
You're the bear.

651
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,360
Since your problem is solved,

652
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,920
we should solve my problem now, right?

653
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,239
What is it?

654
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:21,800
Treating your illness...

655
00:40:21,999 --> 00:40:23,160
Yes...

656
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:24,999
Let's go.

657
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,439
Let's go.

658
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,239
-I'll bring you to Dr. Chen.
-Okay.

659
00:40:45,959 --> 00:40:46,959
Do psychologists...

660
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,679
like to observe others?

661
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,199
I'm sorry.

662
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:54,920
Yes and no.

663
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,039
But, I want to...

664
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,400
look closely...

665
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,080
at the girl who...

666
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,600
conquered Wei Qing.

667
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,120
Conquered?

668
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,880
Surely that's an exaggeration.

669
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,199
I wasn't exaggerating.

670
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,360
I knew him for 10 years.

671
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,439
Besides Wei An, you're the only...

672
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:10,920
girlfriend he brought to me.

673
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,080
Girlfriend? Please don't misunderstand.

674
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,080
You're not his girlfriend?

675
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,719
Yes.

676
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,400
We're friends.

677
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:29,759
Then, why did you agree
to the treatment?

678
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,759
During the treatment,

679
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,800
there will be...

680
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,600
physical contact that can't be avoided.

681
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,120
If it's not too over,

682
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,560
I can accept it.

683
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:45,880
Okay, no matter you're his friend...

684
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,479
or girlfriend,

685
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,519
I'll have to thank you
on behalf of Wei Qing.

686
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,640
Do you know? For many years,

687
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,600
I've been trying to find...

688
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,039
someone that Wei Qing can trust...

689
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:59,239
to resolve the curse on him.

690
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,600
Well, I'll try my best...

691
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,560
since I don't know anything.

692
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,800
By the way, I heard Wei Qing said...

693
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:11,999
you think his illness is
due to a psychological condition?
