Since there's no candidate,

00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:38,760
please stop thinking about the change
we need to make in the team.

Even if you want more,

170
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,839
I wouldn't be willing to.

171
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,159
What?

172
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,120
Brother Ming Cheng.

173
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,519
Why do you have his resume?

174
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
Every year, Yun Ma Group has
a talent scheme.

175
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,080
We recruit students from
well-known universities...

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,919
and train them as potential talents.

177
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,760
Looks like your Brother Ming Cheng...

178
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,440
sent his resume to us.

179
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,039
But, why would he send
his resume to Yun Ma?

180
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,640
What do you mean?

181
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,880
Is Yun Ma not worthy of Li Ming Cheng?

182
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,279
No, what I meant is,

183
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,359
he studied physics.

184
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:23,560
It makes more sense...

185
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,919
for him to apply for research positions.

186
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,919
Why would he...

187
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,839
His resume...

188
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,680
isn't bad compared to other students.

189
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,919
But, as a potential candidate,

190
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,159
he lacks experience...

191
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,159
compared to other candidates.

192
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,479
He can't compete against them.

193
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:40,599
Look.

194
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,159
Why did you swipe over?

195
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,399
Are you not going to use him?

196
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,159
I said he lacks experience.

197
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,200
He can't compete against others.

198
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,479
Many people want to join Yun Ma.

199
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:55,839
They tried hard but couldn't get in.

200
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,080
But, Brother Ming Cheng is capable.

201
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,839
You can't reject him because
his major is different.

202
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,880
You mean...

203
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,399
I mean,

204
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,399
you should see him first.

205
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,120
Even if you're rejecting him,

206
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,839
you should give him a chance first.

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
Since I took over Yun Ma,

208
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,399
I never interviewed anyone before,

209
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,279
not even important executives.

210
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,159
Why should I interview him?

211
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,279
Especially one
who probably won't succeed.

212
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,000
But, Brother Ming Cheng is different?

213
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,399
How different is he?

214
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
He's just different to you.

215
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,599
I treat everyone fairly.

216
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,440
If I give him a chance
to be interviewed alone,

217
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,839
it will be unfair...

218
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,320
to other candidates.

219
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,440
This is indeed unfair.

220
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:37,919
But...

221
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,320
But, I did see it.

222
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,399
If I ignored him,

223
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,080
I'll feel guilty towards him.

224
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,640
I can interview him.

225
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,479
-Really?
-But,

226
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,359
whether or not he succeeds...

227
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,000
will depend on his own abilities.

228
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,320
Of course.

229
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,560
If Brother Ming Cheng finds out...

230
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,919
that he got accepted
because of connections,

231
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,519
he'll blame me.

232
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,440
Eat up.

233
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,320
I'll send you to college
after you finished eating.

234
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
-Are you ready?
-Of course.

235
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,240
Okay.

236
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:27,640
One, two, three!

237
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,560
This model...

238
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,399
can project up to 120,000 stars.

239
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
You can choose any day...

240
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,279
and project the stars on that day.

241
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,839
Not only that,

242
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,680
there's also the meteor shower effect.

243
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,240
With the constellation plate,

244
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,680
it can reproduce the meteor showers
that happened a few times every year.

245
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:50,760
Stop talking, I'll buy it.

246
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,919
Even if I have to eat dirt
or chop my hand, I'll buy it.

247
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,479
This is awesome.

248
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,359
I just need to look up
to see the milky way.

249
00:13:56,479 --> 00:13:58,320
In my eyes, there's an ocean of stars.

250
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:01,279
This baby is a dream maker.

251
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,279
I'll bring you home for sure.

252
00:14:04,599 --> 00:14:07,279
Actually, you don't have to buy it back.

253
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,760
You can just come and use it
at the astronomy club.

254
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,120
That's different.

255
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,240
If you like it that much,

256
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,159
I can lend it to you for a few days.

257
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:18,919
Really?

258
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Of course.

259
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:22,640
My impression of you...

260
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,120
have suddenly improved.

261
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,320
I'll try to mock you less in the future.

262
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,240
Only that?

263
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,519
Since you like astronomy that much,

264
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,440
why did you choose to study chemistry?

265
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:51,039
My parents wouldn't let me steer a ship.

266
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,039
My dream is to be a seafarer.

267
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,959
But, there is only professional training
in marine studies.

268
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
My parents thought that...

269
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,640
I should at least have a degree.

270
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,560
But, Guang Hua doesn't have this course.

271
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:06,399
As I was a recommended student,
I couldn't...

272
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,719
choose another university.

273
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,599
So, I reluctantly...

274
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,000
chose chemistry.

275
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,399
No.

276
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:16,560
If you're a recommended student,

277
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:18,599
why did you take the college exam?

278
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,039
The college exam is a huge matter
in our country.

279
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,279
We will only encounter it
once in our lifetime.

280
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,560
If I missed it, wouldn't it be a pity?

281
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,200
No matter what,
I should gain this experience.

282
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,839
Then why did you not take
the language exam?

283
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,399
The night before, I had food poisoning
after eating seafood.

284
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:39,359
The next day, I was sent to the hospital
and got my stomach pumped.

285
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,000
You didn't really care
about the exam, right?

286
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,919
Do you think exam is a game?

287
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,800
Otherwise?

288
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
You've taken so many exams,

289
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,279
but you still don't understand...

290
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,839
the fun of it?

291
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:55,200
Okay...

292
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:00,719
Fine, I give up.

293
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,479
You were right.

294
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,560
Winning or losing isn't important.

295
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,919
Having fun is the most important part.

296
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,039
This child is teachable.

297
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,894
[Mr. Li Ming Cheng, please attend...]

298
00:16:24,975 --> 00:16:26,078
[an interview at Yun Ma Group,
3 p.m. today.]

299
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,399
-That fast?
-What's wrong?

300
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:29,680
I have an interview.

301
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,240
They asked me to go there
this afternoon.

302
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,640
What company?

303
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,959
Yun Ma.

304
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,320
Yun Ma?

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,919
We're here.

306
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,959
Thank you,
I'll buy you a meal next time.

307
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,640
Do you want to work in Yun Ma?

308
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Me?

309
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,880
But, I'm working at the art gallery.

310
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,240
You're just a decor there.

311
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,719
Do you want to be a doorman forever?

312
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,000
The workload at
the art gallery is light.

313
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,279
But, someone kindly
recommended me to work there.

314
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,919
If I leave...

315
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,800
Ning Fei recommended
you to work there, right?

316
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,480
How are you related to him?

317
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,840
Why did he recommend that job for you?

318
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:14,999
He's my room...

319
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,360
He's my friend.

320
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,119
When he lived upstairs,

321
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,800
we talked a few times.

322
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,440
I'll give you one day...

323
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,680
to think about it carefully.

324
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,879
I'm not always this generous.

325
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,680
I'll think about it.

326
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:31,639
By the way, if I say yes,

327
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,720
will I be part of the talent scheme?

328
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:36,159
You? Talent?

329
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,800
How funny.

330
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,039
Just be content to be working
at the front desk.

331
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,039
You...

332
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,720
I'll leave now.

333
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,519
So many missed calls?

334
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,919
Oh no. They will kill me.

335
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,480
Zhang Shuai.

336
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,320
You're here.

337
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,360
I have good news.

338
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:18,639
Good news?

339
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:21,800
Yes. The art studio is
preparing to hold...

340
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,399
an art exhibition
at the lobby of the building.

341
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,960
Your calligraphy is good.

342
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,560
Do you have any recent works...

343
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,239
to be exhibited?

344
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,239
Calligraphy?

345
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,683
[Destined for a lonely life]

346
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,639
Your blessing is so unique.

347
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,039
What's wrong?

348
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,840
Nothing.

349
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,279
I don't have any now.

350
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,039
I'll write you one when I get back home.

351
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:48,999
I haven't finish using the papers yet.

352
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,759
It's fine. Take your time.

353
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,879
After you're done,
send it to Lan Ning Club.

354
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,879
They're planning to promote newcomers.

355
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,360
If you send your work there,
they would be delighted.

356
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,519
Zhou Shi.

357
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,480
Zhou Shi, why are you hiding from me?

358
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:04,680
You can hide from me once,

359
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,360
but you can't hide from me forever.
Come out.

360
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:10,919
Teacher Xiao,
I haven't seen you in a while.

361
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,480
Yes, we didn't meet for a while.

362
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:13,879
You kept hiding for me,

363
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,519
how can we meet?

364
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,200
I haven't received my salary yet.

365
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,239
Once I received my salary,
I'll transfer it to you immediately...

366
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,440
I received the payment already.

367
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:24,239
Yun Ma recently increased...

368
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:26,639
the amount of scholarship
for this semester.

369
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,919
Coincidentally, it's enough...

370
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:31,080
to pay your fees.

371
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,759
There are also some money left.

372
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,960
Let me tell you, with the money,

373
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,320
don't live miserably, get it?

374
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,720
Your first and foremost mission...

375
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,480
is to study hard.

376
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
Don't always think about working.

377
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,119
Thank you, teacher.

378
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,480
Goodbye, teacher.

379
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,519
I'll leave now.

380
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
Goodbye, teacher.

381
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,720
That much money?

382
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,960
Congratulations, you finally don't have
to hide from him anymore.

383
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:04,080
Zhang Shuai.

384
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,279
Quick, pinch me.
I'm not dreaming, right?

385
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:07,399
No need.

386
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,200
It's fine, I have a thick layer of fat.

387
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,999
Pinch me anywhere, quick.

388
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:15,800
Wait a minute.

389
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,480
Finally you picked up your phone.

390
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,960
Your cat is so annoying.

391
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,919
It kept pestering me to look for you.
Where are you?

392
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,840
Now, you even dare to
stay overnight elsewhere?

393
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,720
I was wrong.

394
00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:32,119
I'll buy you barbequed meat
for dinner tonight.

395
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,759
Did Wei Qing do anything to you?

396
00:20:36,759 --> 00:20:38,080
I'm fine.

397
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm in college now.

398
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,999
We'll talk tonight, goodbye.

399
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:41,800
I...

400
00:20:42,999 --> 00:20:44,080
Sister Zhou Shi?

401
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,680
Go away.

402
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,919
Your roommate was loud.

403
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes.

404
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,440
I went to have fun
with my friends last night.

405
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,360
I didn't go home.

406
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,080
She was worried about me.

407
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:58,720
Wei Qing? Stayed overnight elsewhere?

408
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,759
Didn't they break up?

409
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,360
Well, I received my scholarship, right?

410
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
I'll buy them a meal tonight.

411
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:08,360
Do you want to come along?

412
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,440
I won't go. You should
have fun with them.

413
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,119
Then, I'll go home now.

414
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:18,239
I'll show it to you after I'm done.

415
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,039
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

416
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,333
[Zhou Shi]

417
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:38,198
[Zhou Shi]

418
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,480
I received my scholarship.
Thank you.

419
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,919
You deserved it.

420
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,360
Yes,

421
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:49,999
but it came at the right time.
Thank you.

422
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,840
Okay, I'll accept your gratitude.

423
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,159
Anything else?

424
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,639
No, I won't disturb you from working.

425
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,560
Goodbye.

426
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
Goodbye.

427
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,399
Chairman.

428
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,440
Something bad happened.
Yun Ma Artwork's stock price...

429
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,919
Why did this happen?

430
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,399
Last night, someone
released news on the Internet...

431
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,840
that Yun Ma Group
will sell Yun Ma Artwork...

432
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,519
as a negative asset.

433
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:30,639
Although the news didn't spread out,

434
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,999
it affected some stockholders.

435
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,239
Today, once the stock market opened,

436
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,119
a few large stockholders sold
their stock. The others followed suit.

437
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,279
Who are the stockholders
who sold their stock?

438
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,960
It was her?

439
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,320
Do you need to ask Chairman He?

440
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,399
No need.

441
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,840
She will avoid me.

442
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,680
Contact Xue Zi directly.

443
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,999
Okay.

444
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,320
Chairman, Li Ming Cheng is here.

445
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,239
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

446
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,759
Are you nervous?

447
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,919
Yes, I didn't expect...

448
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:48,999
you will interview me directly.

449
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,960
I didn't expect that too.

450
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,840
This is my resume.

451
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,560
I've read your resume.

452
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:57,960
Your grades at Guang Hua...

453
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,879
are very good.

454
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,720
You'll even be in the top
if you're ranked nationally.

455
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,519
Why didn't you choose
to continue studying...

456
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:06,800
but instead chose to intern...

457
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:07,960
in a foreign field?

458
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,879
Actually, I'm not
that good at studying...

459
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,279
even though I have good grades.

460
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:14,999
What do you mean?

461
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,119
I'm good at taking exams only.

462
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,560
I'm not that I'm talented...

463
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,759
at studying.

464
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,840
To do research...

465
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,879
is to pursue academic
with greater intensity

466
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:25,680
It's a field where one has to rely
on actual strength.

467
00:24:25,879 --> 00:24:27,560
People who cut corners like me...

468
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,960
won't make it there.

469
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,440
You're honest.

470
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,039
Cut corners.

471
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,720
You suit the finance world.

472
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,480
In this industry,

473
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,759
you'll have to be bold, meticulous
and smart.

474
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:41,159
Moreover, you have
a mathematics background.

475
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,639
You also...

476
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:46,919
took the CPA and CFA.

477
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,440
Looks like you're well prepared.

478
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,879
Yes, I started preparing...

479
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,200
since a few months ago.

480
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:53,759
You may think that what
I'm going to say next...

481
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,840
is mere flattery,

482
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,600
but I really want to join Yun Ma.

483
00:24:58,999 --> 00:24:59,840
Why?

484
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,080
Because you're my role model.

485
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:04,879
I'm your role model?

486
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:06,639
The art world said that...

487
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,399
I'm the black sheep.

488
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:11,200
I don't know much about arts.

489
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,680
But, from the aspect of management,

490
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,519
you only used 10 years...

491
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,279
to turn a negative asset into...

492
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,999
a group focusing on investment,
luxury goods...

493
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,879
and venture capital.

494
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,519
This is an undisputed success...

495
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,879
for your business.

496
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:28,399
Your strategies and means...

497
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,600
can't be accomplished just by...

498
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,440
posting critical posts online.

499
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,119
Enough.

500
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,279
Enough of the flattery.

501
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:36,639
Give me one reason
for you to join Yun Ma.

502
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,239
I researched on...

503
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,200
all the available data on Yun Ma.

504
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,480
I realised that Yun Ma Group...

505
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:44,560
has been performing well in other areas,

506
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,399
but the only exception
is Yun Ma Artwork,

507
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:48,320
which has been plagued
with negative publicity.

508
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,800
The most successful event was...

509
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,080
signing on the talented artist, Xun Ran.

510
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:54,039
Other than that,

511
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:55,680
it's all news about artists
cancelling their contracts..

512
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,759
or the business going into recession.

513
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,759
Moreover, for these few years,
Yun Ma Artwork...

514
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,919
has been investing in other areas,

515
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,239
but there weren't any results.

516
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,720
This is a proposal of...

517
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,879
setting the investment direction
of Yun Ma Artwork.

518
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,039
Please take a look at it.

519
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:26,080
You came well prepared.

520
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,239
You're interested in
the investment department?

521
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,560
Yes.

522
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,239
You can work starting tomorrow.

523
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
You're hiring me?

524
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,039
Even an outsider like you...

525
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,999
can see it clearly.

526
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:43,119
Those in the company...

527
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,039
are still ignorant.

528
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,279
Now, I want you to wake them up.

529
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,159
Thank you, Chairman.

530
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,600
Why are you looking at me like this?

531
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,159
Xiao Fei, aren't you hungry?

532
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,639
Look, even Xiao Fei is ignoring you.

533
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,200
We have a cat at home,

534
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,480
why did you go outside
to attract other cats?

535
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,039
You even stayed outside overnight.
Explain to me now.

536
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:17,999
What really happened?

537
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,440
I didn't lie to you.

538
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,919
I got drunk last night, right?

539
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,519
So, I slept at Wei Qing's house.

540
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,519
We just drank alcohol,

541
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,080
we didn't do anything else.

542
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,680
Will Wei Qing give up...

543
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,919
on this opportunity?

544
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,279
I don't believe you.

545
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:33,800
Xiao Fei, you know Wei Qing well.

546
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,360
You believe me, right?

547
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:39,440
I know that Xiao Fei knows me the best.

548
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,919
Boss, three more servings of pork belly.

549
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:43,999
Boss, give me the best ones.

550
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,440
-You're here?
-You've reached?

551
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,239
-Brother Ming Cheng, have a seat.
-Thank you.

552
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,159
Brother Ming Cheng, have more meat.

553
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,399
Thank you.

554
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,159
Eat this.

555
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,919
Don't make a wrap for me.
I want Zhou Shi to make a wrap for me.

556
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,560
You kept asking Shi Shi to make a wrap.

557
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,080
Don't she get to eat?

558
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,519
Then, you can do it.

559
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:13,960
Okay.

560
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:19,360
Since when did
the both of you get close?

561
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,399
If he makes a wrap for me,
I'll eat it.

562
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,600
This has nothing to do with being close.

563
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,239
Xiao Fei, eat more.

564
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,440
By the way, Shi Shi,

565
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,440
I'll pay for this meal.

566
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,039
Why? I just received my scholarship.

567
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,680
I said I'll pay, right?

568
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,639
I just found a job today.

569
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,639
So, I'll pay for this meal.

570
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:45,200
Just think of it as a celebration.

571
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,480
Are you joining Yun Ma?
They are hiring you for real?

572
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:50,119
How do you know that?

573
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,600
Wei Qing told me about it.

574
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,800
That was why Chairman Wei
interviewed me today.

575
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,519
Did you ask him to do that?

576
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:03,960
Impossible.

577
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,680
I'm not as powerful as that.

578
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,960
Brother Ming Cheng,
you're too talented, so...

579
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,800
Actually, I thought
you would continue studying.

580
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,680
I didn't expect you to go to Yun Ma.

581
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,399
I was actually struggling
with this decision.

582
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,399
I was afraid that I couldn't get used
to it after joining the company.

583
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,519
But, someone kept telling me...

584
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,239
no matter what you do,

585
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,080
don't care too much about
winning or losing.

586
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,159
We must enjoy what we are doing.

587
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,119
So, I summoned up all my courage...

588
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,519
and took this step.

589
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:37,720
Okay, I believe Brother Ming Cheng...

590
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,119
will shine wherever he is.

591
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,519
Let's drink to...

592
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,239
his future at Yun Ma!

593
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,800
Cheers!

594
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,480
Who is going to work at Yun Ma?

595
00:29:46,879 --> 00:29:47,879
I am.

596
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,560
What a coincidence,
I'm going to work at Yun Ma too.

597
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,919
You too?

598
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
This must be fate.

599
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,960
What department are you in?

600
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,759
The investment department.

601
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,119
I'm at the administration department.

602
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,399
I can't believe we're going
to be colleagues.

603
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,080
Can't you see we're eating here?

604
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,200
Can't you find another time to chat?

605
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,440
Some people just never goes away.

606
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,119
I won't disturb your dinner.

607
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,480
Since we're going to be colleagues,
we'll have more chance to meet.

608
00:30:14,639 --> 00:30:17,080
Let's keep in touch.
I'll leave now.

609
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,960
Okay, goodbye.

610
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
That's right, go.

611
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,600
Show her your true colours, strong girl.

612
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,200
Why does Shi Shi look unhappy?

613
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Are we going to add more meat?

614
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,919
I'm going to work at Yun Ma too.

615
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,879
What?

616
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,159
Brother Ming Cheng,

617
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,480
we'll be colleagues starting tomorrow.

618
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,159
Why didn't you say that earlier?

619
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,080
I was going to surprise you.

620
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,600
You're going there too?

621
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,440
Which department will you be in?

622
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,279
The front desk.

623
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,960
Here, go ahead and eat.

624
00:31:15,879 --> 00:31:17,239
You must be starving.

625
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,639
You really have a big appetite.

626
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,759
You ate so much meat,

627
00:31:25,879 --> 00:31:27,239
but you got hungry quickly.

628
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:30,759
Most importantly,
you didn't gain weight.

629
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,560
I'm still growing.

630
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,480
Yes, our Xiao Fei...

631
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,919
is still a child.

632
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:41,399
Well, I have something
to discuss with you.

633
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:42,360
What?

634
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,279
I want to resign from the gallery.

635
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:46,200
Are you going to work for Wei Qing?

636
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,840
You know about it?

637
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,159
I thought you were focused on eating.

638
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,239
But,

639
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,440
will you be happy there?

640
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,279
I don't know too.

641
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,360
But, Brother Ming Cheng went.

642
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,080
Senior Ran Yu also went.

643
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:00,759
I want to be closer to him.

644
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,720
Then, go ahead

645
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:04,399
You've agreed?

646
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,519
Make your own decisions.

647
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,759
I've finally ended this.

648
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:17,919
Now, I can go to work...

649
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,480
at Yun Ma at ease.

650
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,239
I'll miss this place.

651
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,560
If it wasn't for Brother Ming Cheng,

652
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,320
I wouldn't want to leave.

653
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:37,119
Miss,

654
00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:39,560
you can't touch the paintings here.

655
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,600
Miss Xue?

656
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,639
You are...

657
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:44,720
Previously when you
returned to this country,

658
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,119
we met in the dinner party.

659
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:47,200
I'm Wei Qing's...

660
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
Wei Qing?

661
00:32:49,999 --> 00:32:52,960
No, I was the staff there.

662
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,399
I even shook your hands,
do you remember me?

663
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,039
I'm sorry.

664
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,279
It happened a long time ago, so...

665
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,519
It's fine...

666
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,519
I didn't expect to meet you here.

667
00:33:08,239 --> 00:33:09,200
No,

668
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,279
I also remember seeing you...

669
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,840
at the entrance.

670
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,519
You must've remembered wrongly.

671
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,159
It's my first time here today.

672
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:19,200
Really?

673
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,360
You like Xun Ran's paintings too?

674
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,279
Yes, his paintings...

675
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,399
are graceful and surreal.

676
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,639
People would be attracted involuntarily.

677
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,519
It's like facing...

678
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,519
a portal to another world.

679
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,200
But, to be honest,

680
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,159
this kind of viewing experience
isn't great.

681
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,480
Why?

682
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,800
Because if you look at it
for a long time,

683
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,960
you'll be captivated and
won't be able to pull yourself away.

684
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,159
It's like looking at
a bottomless abyss...

685
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,639
which suffocates you.

686
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,039
But,

687
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,039
did you realise,

688
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,279
no matter how hazy the night sky is,

689
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,800
his stars painting won't lack something.

690
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,480
This is the theme...

691
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,399
present in every painting of his.

692
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,920
Lost and found.

693
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,759
Although it sounds depressing,

694
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,759
he never give up on hope.

695
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,679
Did I talk too much?

696
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,199
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

697
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,519
No, you were right.

698
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,640
I didn't expect to meet someone
with the same taste as me.

699
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:27,320
Looks like you've studied
Xun Ran's paintings.

700
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:28,880
Not really.

701
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,759
I was his fan for many years.

702
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,560
But, I didn't get to meet him in person.

703
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,360
Director He said...

704
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:36,479
I'll get to meet him eventually...

705
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,279
if I work here.

706
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,400
I never thought I'll leave that soon.

707
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Leaving now is a good choice.

708
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,600
Not long after,

709
00:34:47,479 --> 00:34:48,999
this art gallery will have a new owner.

710
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,560
New owner?

711
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:53,080
As a person with the same taste,

712
00:34:53,279 --> 00:34:55,560
let me share with you
a habit Xun Ran has when he paints.

713
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,959
Do you see anything?

714
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,400
No.

715
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,679
This is actually "Ran".

716
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,479
This is Xun Ran's little secret.

717
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,800
He'll incorporate the word "Ran"...

718
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:16,959
in every painting of his.

719
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,640
People that don't know him...

720
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,959
will easily miss it.

721
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,719
This is the word "Ran".

722
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,439
How did you discover it?

723
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,479
I studied many of his paintings,
but I didn't discover that.

724
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,199
I discovered it accidentally.

725
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,679
So, this is looking for "Ran".

726
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,160
Letter of resignation?

727
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,679
I forgot about it. I'm sorry.

728
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,840
I have to go now.

729
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,279
-Go ahead.
-Goodbye.

730
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,479
Stop!

731
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,439
You're buying this much,
can you finish them all?

732
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,880
Just put them in the refrigerator.

733
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:04,239
Our refrigerator won't be able
to fit in that much stuff.

734
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,840
Then, buy another one.

735
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:08,999
You made it seem easy.
Do you have money?

736
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,360
You're just a child.

737
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,080
Do you know how much
a refrigerator costs?

738
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,800
Fine, you can buy anything
since you have money.

739
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:23,479
As long as we can take it back.

740
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,519
We don't have a car.

741
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,160
Buy a car then. I have enough money.

742
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,120
If you're that great,

743
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,959
why don't you buy the whole supermarket?

744
00:37:33,479 --> 00:37:34,320
No way.

745
00:37:34,479 --> 00:37:36,679
Don't buy the supermarket.
Don't even think about that.

746
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,759
I'm mad.

747
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:48,519
Fei Fei.

748
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:49,999
Director He.

749
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,479
I didn't expect...

750
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,120
to meet you here.

751
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,840
Why? You think I don't
come to supermarkets?

752
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,920
No, I think people like you...

753
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:05,800
should go to high class restaurants.

754
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,160
It's just like caviar won't be...

755
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,160
sold on the racks here.

756
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:11,719
Are you flattering me...

757
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,519
this time when you see me...

758
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,519
because you stood me up...

759
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:17,160
last time?

760
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,759
I'm sorry.

761
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,959
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,600
Are you okay?

763
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:27,479
I'm okay.

764
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,600
This aisle is a little narrow
for two carts.

765
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,679
Why don't we share a cart?

766
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,800
This will be inconvenient...

767
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,039
when we pay later.

768
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,199
It's fine. We can get closer this way.

769
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,999
He flirts so well.

770
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:47,239
Why did you buy so much meat?

771
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,479
I'm buying these for my cat.

772
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,679
Cat?

773
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:54,840
Let's go.

774
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,920
So, Miss Xue, you don't agree
with my proposal?

775
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,840
Personally,

776
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,959
I'm interested in your proposal.

777
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,880
But, acquiring Yun Ma Artwork...

778
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:09,679
is the decision of Snow's headquarters.

779
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,719
I'm just the executor.

780
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,400
You thought too highly...

781
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,199
of my influence on
the making of the decision.

782
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,640
Acquisition of Yun Ma Artwork?

783
00:39:17,999 --> 00:39:20,519
No wonder she said the art gallery
will have a new owner.

784
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,439
You don't have to be humble, Miss Xue.

785
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,640
Even though Snow's chairman...

786
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:26,880
hasn't announce to the public...

787
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
who his successor will be,

788
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:31,320
but if he doesn't trust you fully,

789
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,039
he won't let you manage...

790
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,479
this important region.

791
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,199
I believe the acquisition...

792
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,880
of Yun Ma Artwork...

793
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,120
doesn't need to be reported
to the headquarters.

794
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:43,840
I believe it's up to you...

795
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:47,120
to end or cancel it.

796
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,719
Since you've already made up your mind,

797
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,439
there's no use explaining.

798
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,080
But, I'm curious.

799
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,560
If you really want to
stop this acquisition,

800
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,880
why didn't you advise your mother...

801
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,239
to stop selling her stocks...

802
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,840
in large quantities?

803
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,400
Wouldn't that be faster?

804
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,759
I also heard about something else.

805
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:12,279
Not only you're going to...

806
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,479
separate Yun Ma's art gallery out,

807
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
you're also preparing to terminate
all the artist's contracts.

808
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,560
Chairman Wei was desperate...

809
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,439
so she made an unwise decision.

810
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,519
Seems like...

811
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,360
you were the one who started this.

812
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,479
That's untrue.

813
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,080
The art gallery was the start of Yun Ma.

814
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,080
My father devoted his whole life to it.

815
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:36,120
The artists are the Wei family's
most valuable wealth.

816
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,519
I don't know where my mother...

817
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:40,120
heard the rumours from,

818
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,479
but I won't allow...

819
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,999
that to happen.

820
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,199
Really?

821
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,080
But, it was rumoured that...

822
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,279
the most popular artist of
Yun Ma Artwork, Xun Ran...

823
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,439
isn't close to you.

824
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,959
You even said you'll sell...

825
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,800
this art gallery
that was opened for him.

826
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,519
Sell it off?

827
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,439
Why are you here?

828
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,880
I just walked past.
I didn't hear anything.

829
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:20,560
Chairman Wei.

830
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,679
Let's stop for now.

831
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,320
Okay.

832
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,560
Let's talk next time.

833
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,719
Compared to Yun Ma Artwork,

834
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,840
I'd rather work closely with you,
Chairman Wei.

835
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,519
Miss Xue Zi was so passionate.

836
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,800
You're lucky.

837
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:03,320
Why is your ear red?

838
00:42:04,479 --> 00:42:06,239
