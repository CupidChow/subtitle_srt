Maybe you saw a wedding dress

or maybe you saw someone's wedding.

They might trigger you
to dream about it.

71
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,639
The problem is not about the wedding,

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,040

What's the problem with the groom?

74
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,680
Actually, I had the same dream before.

75
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,000
But the groom...

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
was a brother who I liked a lot.

77
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,720
But last night,

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
the one in my dream was another person.

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,039

80
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,280

I once thought was impossible.

From the psychological aspect,

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,720

as a reflection of our subconscious.

87
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,159
But I think that dream is often...

88
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,800
a reaction from the feelings
we have in our hearts.

89

Do you know that when you are awake,

90
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:06,960
we will often ignore some
real feelings we have in our hearts.

91
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,400
But when we are asleep,

92

When all the noises
in your head fade away,

Are you saying that...

97
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,639
I subconsciously want
to marry this person?

98
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,039
That might not be the case.

99
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,680
But I think that in your subconscious,

100
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,479
your feelings towards this person
is not as simple...

101
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,240
as what you think.

102
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,639

Think it as a reminder.

104

Alright now. Don't blame yourself.

169
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,839
It's alright.

170
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,959
This will get better. He'll get better.

171
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,479
Tell me.

172
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,560
Are you the one who killed his cat?

173
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,519
-No.
-How dare you lie.

174
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,240
Xiao Fei already said it.

175
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,320
He saw you did it with his own eyes.

176
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,719
-He's lying.
-Xiao Fei never lies.

177
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,399
But you have always disliked his cat.

178
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:27,399
I even saw you hit it.

179
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,200
Because it bit me first.

180
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,279
I'm going to ask you one last time.

181
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:35,279
I hope that you'll tell the truth.
Did you do it?

182
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,599
If you think that it's me,
then go ahead.

183
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,159
After all, it's just a stray cat.

184
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,880
It's a stray just like him.

185
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,320
So what if I drown it to death?

186
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,240
What nonsense is that?

187
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,159
Since you like the one you
picked up so much,

188
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,880
why did you give birth to me back then?

189
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,080
You...

190
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:01,959
Come back.

191
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,039
Apologise to your father!

192
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:43,599
Dr. Chen.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,039
It's alright. He's just
having a nightmare.

194
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,760
I didn't do it.

195
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,359
Father.

196
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,000
Father!

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,039
Did you kill me?

198
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,560
-Wei Qing.
-Are you alright?

199
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,839
-Wei Qing, are you alright?
-I didn't do it.

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,880
-I didn't do it.
-Wei Qing.

201
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,159
-I didn't do it.
-Wei Qing.

202
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,279
-Are you alright?
-I didn't do it.

203
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:56,000
-Wei Qing. How are you?
-I didn't do it.

204
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,519
-I didn't do it.
-Wei Qing.

205
00:13:58,719 --> 00:14:00,039
-Wei Qing!
-I didn't do it.

206
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,839
I didn't do it.

207
00:14:06,359 --> 00:14:07,560
-I didn't do it.
-Wei Qing, it's alright.

208
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,000
The doctor is here. Don't worry.

209
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,159
Alright, here. Keep quiet.

210
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,080
Keep quiet.

What should we do next?

215
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,719
We can only start over again.

221
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,839
Assistant An, what did the doctor say?

222
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:26,359
He's very emotionally unstable.

223
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,320
I'm afraid that he has to stay here
for a few more days.

224
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,640
Let me do it.

225
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,519
It's late already.
Go back and have a rest first.

226
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,000
No. It happens because of me.

227
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,479
I have to stay here.

228
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,599
Besides, you need to settle a lot of
things in the company, right?

229
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,159
Don't worry and leave him to me.

230
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,800
Alright. I'll have to trouble you then.

231
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:51,359
Let me change the water for you.

232
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:01,479
♪ Heartache is just a crater
where meteorites fall ♪

233
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,680
I'll definitely cure you.

234
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,000
Wei Qing is in the hospital?

235
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,599
When did that happen?

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,320
Do you know why?

237
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,479
Alright. Keep an eye on him.

238
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,560
It'll be best if you can a photo of him.

239
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,039
Wei Qing is in the hospital?

240
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,080
He was sent into the hospital
this morning. I heard that it's serious.

241
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,320
What happened?

242
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:29,719
Sister, when did you start
to care about him?

243
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,159
I'm not worried about him.

244
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,279
I'm worried about his shares.

245
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't worry. He won't die yet.

246
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,359
When are you going to transfer
the shares back to me?

247
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,800
Sister, I can't do that.

248
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,000
Why?

249
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,640
Wei Qing is an expert
in laying down a trap.

250
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,959
If we are lead around
by our noses by him,

251
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,000
we will definitely fall into his trap.

252
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,880
I've fought with him for many years.

253
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,479
I know his tactics.

254
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,039
If you want to defeat Wei Qing,

255
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,399
you need to throw him into confusion.

256
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,039
So, sister,

257
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,279
we need to bide our time now.

258
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,999
Bide our time?

259
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,399
What if Xue Zi makes a move?

260
00:17:08,639 --> 00:17:12,119
Don't worry. If she wanted to attack
Yun Ma Artwork, she would have done it.

261
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,919
Why did she have to wait until now?

262
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,600
She is all bluff and bluster.
She wants to throw us into confusion.

263
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,840
Now, the three of us are
competing with discernment.

264
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,759
The one who can keep cool can
succeed in undertaking the initiative.

265
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,239
So, don't be impatient, sister.

266
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,840
Anyway,

267
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:30,600
you'd better settle this thing
as soon as possible.

268
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,639
Or else, I can't have a peace of mind.

269
00:17:33,879 --> 00:17:35,119
Alright, I get it.

270
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,720
Sister, go and rest first.

271
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,919
If anything happens to Wei Qing,

272
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:45,399
remember to tell me about it.

273
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,759
Alright.

274
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,639
Go now.

275
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,239
And you said that you
don't care about him.

276
00:17:56,879 --> 00:17:59,720
Wei Qing. Let's see how long
can you hold out against me.

277
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,440
No need to come over.

278
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,759
He refuses to meet anybody now...

279
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
except me, Assistant An and Dr. Chen.

280
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,480
Alright then. Tell us anytime
if you need anything.

281
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,119
Alright.

282
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,119
Bye.

283
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,519
Please come in.

284
00:18:49,639 --> 00:18:50,680
It's alright.

285
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,600
This is the body examination result.

286
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,720
It's not too serious. He just needs to
go home and rest for a few days.

287
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:00,720
-What is the cause for this?
-It's because of his heart rate.

288
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:22,360
Assistant An,
why is it so noisy outside?

289
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,119
The public has found out about
the chairman being hospitalised.

290
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,480
There are many reporters outside. We
need to get him out as soon as possible.

291
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,759
I have an idea.

292
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,840
-Chairman Wei, how's your condition?
-Have you recovered?

293
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,480
-Chairman Wei.
-Chairman Wei.

294
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,119
Don't be afraid. We are going home.

295
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,919
-He is not Chairman Wei.
-Where is the real Chairman Wei?

296
00:20:20,239 --> 00:20:21,480
I can't tell you that.

297
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,639
Are you alright?

298
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,399
Are you alright?

299
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:18,919

Why are you here?

306
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,960
I'm worried about you.
How long have you been in there?

307
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:08,200
One week?

308
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:10,200
More or less so.

309
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:12,080
How is he?

310
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,600
He's still like that.

311
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,200
He's scared about people.

312
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,039
-Let's talk in the house.
-No.

313
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,480
I don't want to scare him.

314
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,519
Didn't you say that he had
got better before?

315
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:24,519
Why did he become more serious
all of a sudden?

316
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,800
Something went wrong
while I was treating him.

317
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:30,600
What went wrong?

318
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:34,759
His biggest fear is cat.

319
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,600
So, I put him in the
same room with cats.

320
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,759
You acted too rashly!

321
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,800
You acted too rashly.

322
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:45,279
No wonder he became like this.

323
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,759
You've always been very careful.

324
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,720
Why would you act so rashly this time?

325
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,080
Because I'm afraid.

326
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,759
What are you afraid of?

327
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:58,440
After you reminded me that day,

328
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,919
I realised that our relationship
is getting more and more confusing.

329
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,999
I want to break it.

330
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,600
So, I put him together with the cats.

331
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,800
I thought that if
I can solve this issue,

332
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,360
then my treatment can be
considered as successful.

333
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,639
And then, I can part with him.

334
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:19,080
Why do you need to part with him?

335
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,279
He doesn't like you?

336
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,879
Have you asked him?

337
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:29,360
I'm sorry. Don't be upset.

338
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:31,519
What do you want to do now?

339
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,440
Are you going to stay by his side still?

340
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,360
I'm the one who caused him
to be like this.

341
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,239
I have to take care of him.

342
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,440
If you want to help him,
you have to help him stand up again.

343
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,480
Do you know how many people are
paying close attention to him now?

344
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,960
What do you mean?

345
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,039
You didn't read the news?

346
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,440
That is too much.

347
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,119
They are just making it up.

348
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,360
Do you think these onlookers
care about the truth?

349
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,119
The chairman of Yun Ma Group...

350
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,480
has mental illness.

351
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,879
They are just here to watch the drama.
Nobody cares about the truth.

352
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,919
Where did they get the photos?

353
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,519
Somebody sent them to the Celebrities.

354
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,560
I already advised He Wei not to send them.

355
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,159
But with his relationship with Wei Qing,

356
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,080
I can only advise him
to blur out your face.

357
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,680
Others are beyond my power.

358
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:38,080
Thank you.

359
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,960
You are the only one
who can help him now.

360
00:24:42,879 --> 00:24:45,960
If you want to shut their mouth,
you have to help him stand up again.

361
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,480
-Where are you?
-I'm right outside the door.

362
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,720
Come back now.

363
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,320
Alright. I will.

364
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:02,800
Take care of yourself then.

365
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:07,999
Go in then.

366
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,200
Play games with me.

367
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,879
Let's go out and take a walk.

368
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,639
No.

369
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
How long are you going to stay inside?

370
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:30,800
Don't forget that you are
the chairman of Yun Ma.

371
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,480
Everyone is waiting for you
to take charge of the situation.

372
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,879
But you are playing games here.

373
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,720
From the first time I met you until now,

374
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:50,320
you always assume an air of superiority.

375
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,879
It's like everything is
under your control.

376
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,879
And you had indeed
controlled my life once.

377
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,320
Every step I took...

378
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,480
was just a part of your plan.

379
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:07,639
You knew how I hated you back then.

380
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:10,800
But when I think about it,

381
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,320
it shows how powerful you are.

382
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,560
No matter who your opponent is,
no matter how powerful they are,

383
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,800
you can always spot their
weaknesses easily and defeat them.

384
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,720
Now, the enemy is you yourself.

385
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,119
why you are afraid?

386
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,560
You can control my life so easily.

387
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,879
Don't you think you can
control your own life?

388
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:44,239
News about you are
all over the internet.

389
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,519
Some said that you've gone crazy
and some said that Yun Ma has collapsed.

390
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,639
You don't need me to tell you
who's the one did it.

391
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,159
Are you going to admit defeat so easily?

392
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,720
Stop saying that! I don't want to hear it!

393
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,200
Wei Qing.

394
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,239
Stop! I don't want to hear it!

395
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:00,840
Wei Qing!

396
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:09,200
Don't open the door!

397
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,200
-Sister Zhou Shi.
-You are looking for me, Xiao Fei?

398
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,560
No. I'm looking for my senior.

399
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,399
Come in.

400
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,279
Senior.

401
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,399
Senior.

402
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,320
Senior.

403
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,960
Your mother has been dismissed.

404
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,840
Senior.

405
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,399
She is sick. She said that you are
the only one who can help her.

406
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:09,119
I heard that...

407
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,399
you were sent to the hospital
because of cats.

408
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,080
-Is it because...
-It has nothing to do with that!

409
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,759
He Wei was the one who did it.

410
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,239
I'm sorry.

411
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Senior.

412
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:35,600
Help your mother.

413
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,159
Please help your mother.

414
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:41,200
Please help your mother.

415
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,399
Open the door! This is my gallery!

416
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:47,840
I won't let you take it away!
Open the door!

417
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,919
Aunty.

418
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
-Aunty.
-Xiao Fei!

419
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,800
They took away our gallery!
Ask them to open the door!

420
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,399
Let's go home first.

421
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:57,960
No. I can't let them
take away my gallery.

422
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,879
Open the door!

423
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,960
You are the only one who can help her.

424
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:09,560
Can you please help her?

425
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:11,919
Senior.

426
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,800
Senior.

427
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,440
Maybe you should leave.

428
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,600
Go back and tell my mother that...

429
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,119
I won't let anything happen
to Yun Ma Artwork.

I don't want to play anymore.
That's it for today.

461
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:48,600
Wait. I still have
another thing for you.

462
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,960
-What?
-You'll know it later.

463
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,440
Don't take a peek.

464
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,480
-Are you done yet?
-I'm almost done.

465
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
You can look now.

466
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,519
What are you doing?

467
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
You are afraid of cats, right?

468
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,919
Today, you are going to defeat it
with your own hands.

469
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,440
Come on.

470
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,519

I'm sorry.

-Thank you.

475
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,600
You look well.

476
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
It doesn't look like you've just
recovered from a serious illness.

477
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I just had a minor flu.

478
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,279
I never thought that
it'll create such havoc.

479
00:34:21,479 --> 00:34:23,120
But from the photos,

480
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,279
it doesn't look like
a simple flu.

481
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,719
Don't tell me you believe
words  in the gossip magazines...

482
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,640
about me having mental illness?

483
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,560
But I never thought that...

484
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,759
you transferred your shares to He Wei.

485
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:39,120
Now, I'm not the biggest shareholder.

486
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,600
You knew from the start that...

487
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,519
I would transfer my shares, right?

488
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,959
You must be joking.

489
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Yes.

490
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,400
But I thought that you would force
He Wei to give you his shares.

491
00:34:49,759 --> 00:34:52,160
I never thought that
you would do the opposite.

492
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,959
Are you saying that...

493
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,479
you are so bent on buying off
the shares from others...

494
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,600
so that I can become
the biggest shareholder?

495
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,560
Of course. I told you many times before.

496
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,479
Compared with profits,

497
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,320
people are more important to me.

498
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,120
I knew, you're in an awkward position
when it comes to Yun Ma Artwork.

499
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,320
You have no place to stretch your wings.

500
00:35:15,759 --> 00:35:18,439
I saw it so clearly during
Xun Ran's art exhibition.

501
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:20,519
That's why I did all of these.

502
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,800
I thought that you'll succeed
in taking it over.

503
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:25,840
And then, we can further expand
Yun Ma Artwork together.

504
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:29,920
I never thought that you'll act
impetuously. You've disappointed me.

505
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,600
Now, Yun Ma Artwork
has totally fallen into their hands.

506
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:37,160
Do you think they can
really manage it well?

507
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,199
Because of your clemency,

508
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,679
you've buried Yun Ma Artwork
with your own hands.

509
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:47,560
Of course, there's a way for you to...

510
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,239
turn the tables on them.

511
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,120
By transferring the shares to you?

512
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,039
Or, I can transfer the shares to you.

513
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,439
What do you want?

514
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:07,160
I just want to collaborate
with you well.

515
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,800
I wonder if...

516
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:18,439
Director He is supposed
to be thankful to you now?

517
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
Zhang Shuai.

518
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,120
Zhou Shi. Why are you here?

519
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,759
You are done with your painting?
Let me see.

520
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,959
This is a great painting.

521
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,560
When are you going to hand it in?

522
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,479
I'll do some polish work and hand it in
within these two days.

523
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,479
Why are you looking for me?

524
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,479
When are we going for the fieldwork?

525
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,239
-The day after tomorrow.
-The day after tomorrow?

526
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:43,999
Is it too late to sign up now?

527
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,519
You are free now?

528
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:46,959
Yes.

529
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,360
Why do you want to go
to a fieldwork suddenly?

530
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,320
I had been so busy with the exam
and treating Wei Qing these two months.

531
00:38:58,479 --> 00:38:59,719
I didn't have time to rest.

532
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,759
I want to go out and relax.

533
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:04,199
If you are gone,
who will treat Wei Qing then?

534
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,880
He has almost fully recovered.

535
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,479
Even if I'm not here,
Assistant An will be enough for him.

536
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,080
Have you told him about this?

537
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:13,239
I didn't tell him about this.
I just told him that I'm moving back.

538
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,519
What if he comes here to look for you?

539
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,679
It's alright. I'll be leaving tomorrow.

540
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,719
You can tell him honestly
if he comes here.

541
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,999
So, the relationship between
you and Wei Qing...

542
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,600
is just a doctor-patient relationship?

543
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,560
What else will it be?

544
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,519
He doesn't like me anyway.

545
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
And I can't say that I like him.

546
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,679
I already thought about it.
We were too close.

547
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,400
And with both of you hinting me
about it, I panicked.

548
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,999
Actually, if I think about it carefully,

549
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:45,320
it's not that easy to fall in love
with someone.

550
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,120
You've loved Li Ming Cheng...

551
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,360
for more than 10 years because
he helped you with your studies.

552
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:52,360
Don't rat me out, Goddess of study.

553
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:54,279
I'm sorry. Occupational hazard.

554
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,560
I can't help but to say it out
when it's wrong.

555
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,479
Anyway, let bygones be bygone.

556
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,800
For now, I just want to relax myself.

557
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,959
I've stayed put for two months.
I'm bored.

558
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,999
It's time to get some sunshine.

559
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:09,679
Tonight, how about having our...

560
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,400
best-friend mask night?

561
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,640
-Sure.
-Let's go.

562
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,479
Stop packing first. Let's go.

563
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,320
Xiao Fei. Where are you going?

564
00:40:29,479 --> 00:40:30,759
Fieldwork.

565
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,800
