Of course not.

That's not what I meant.

165
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,960
All the income from this auction will go to Beixin Orphanage.

166
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:37,870
Hopefully, it will be able to provide lovable and happy facilities for the children.

167
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,570
Very good. Let’s look at the first item.

168
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,030
Now, it's time for our third item.

169
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,210
Is this... a doll?

170
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,040
Isn't this a doll?

171
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,970
This is a hand-made doll

172
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,140
made by the children at the Beixin Orphanage.

173
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,820
Although the item is not worth much money, a kind heart is priceless.

174
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,020
Starting price is one dollar. Everyone, please help generously!

175
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,200
- Five silver dollars.
- Five!

176
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,750
- Ten silver dollars.
- Ten!

177
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:35,260
- Twenty.
- Twenty!

178
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,060
Fifty! Third Master Xiao bids 50!

179
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,470
Is anyone willing to make a higher bid? Third Master has bid 50!

180
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,360
- 100.
- Great, 100!

181
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,030
This gentleman bids 100 dollars!

182
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,450
150 going once!

183
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,630
150 going twice!

184
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,060
150 going three times! Sold!

185
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,430
Third Master, please come on stage to claim this item!

186
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,960
Great! Let's also welcome the donor of this item,

187
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,900
Sir Mu Zizheng to say a few words for us!

188
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,760
First of all, I'd like to say thank you to Third Master Xiao for helping me turn this into love for the children.

189
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,280
This doll was made by me

190
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,630
and Teacher Lin at the orphanage, together.

191
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,310
Maybe in your eyes, it's just simple handicraft work.

192
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:07,600
But in my eyes, it is the most precious hope that the children of the orphanage are eager to survive.

193
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,160
Even a child has to struggle to live.

194
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,120
Doesn't that make us sad and heartbroken?

195
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,590
I want to tell everyone that there are more children who lost their parents like this.

196
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,120
They need our love and care.

197
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,730
Thank you again, Third Master Xiao, for helping generously.

198
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,560
Thank you to Third Master Xiao and Sir Mu for your kind heart.

199
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,980
Now it's time for

200
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,540
the last item for today's auction.

201
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,920
The last item to be auctioned

202
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,600
was donated by Third Master Xiao.

203
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,500
This medal is part of a personal collection.

204
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,190
Why is it here for an auction?

205
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,970
Third Master Xiao, please speak a few words.

206
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:29,930
Dear friends, dear guests.

207
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,850
This medal is indeed meaningful to me.

208
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,710
I received it at the age of 19, the first time I was on a battlefield.

209
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,940
I was honored and got this medal.

210
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,620
Before that, I thought I should be

211
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,060
fearless about my life.

212
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,320
Until I met a child on the battleground.

213
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,880
He was a thirteen-year-old child.

214
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,180
His name was Luo Dou, and we called him Xiao Douzi.

215
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,010
Why did a kid at such a young age need to join the army?

216
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,080
Later, he told me on the battlefield.

217
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,250
It was the only way that he didn't have to suffer from hunger and cold.

218
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,720
Even then,

219
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,110
he smiled at me and said

220
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,470
he wanted to open his own tailor shop when the war ended,

221
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,320
and to make a wedding dress personally for his older sister.

222
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,000
Later, Xiao Douzi died.

223
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,330
He hugged me,

224
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,710
and said that he was very happy to have us as brothers

225
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:42,780
in his life.

226
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,880
Since then, I've been asking myself,

227
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,710
"A child like this,

228
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:54,450
a 13-year-old child, why can't he just live a normal life?

229
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,870
Why is it impossible

230
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,350
for him to achieve such a simple dream?"

231
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:09,110
Before that, I thought I had the most tragic life.

232
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,430
When I was seven, my mother, just like Xiao Douzi,

233
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,820
passed away in my arms.

234
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,800
I resented how the heavens treated me unfairly.

235
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,330
In the following years, I'd been living in the shadow of my mother's death.

236
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,390
But I only got to realize later

237
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,620
that in a time of war like this, many children

238
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,580
have no chance to meet their parents for a lifetime.

239
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:49,990
Today, I'm here to auction this medal.

240
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,920
This represents my wish for peace in the world.

241
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,830
I hope our country can be stable soon.

242
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:01,760
Our fellow citizens, especially young children,

243
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,340
just like Xiao Douzi,

244
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,510
no longer have to suffer from hunger and cold,

245
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:13,180
or the pain of losing their families. That's it. Thank you.

246
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,760
Adjutant Zhou, we have finished interrogating Yakov.

247
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,460
Come with me. The governor is inside.

248
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,940
Okay.

249
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,520
- Reporting!
- Come in.

250
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,610
Governor, please have a look.

251
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,590
This is the interrogation record from the beginning to now.

252
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,400
This Yakov is very cunning indeed. He's been beating around the bush.

253
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,500
He never said anything about where the allowance ended up.

254
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,070
Now different parties have been looking for Yakov, publicly or in secret.

255
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,120
Including people from the South, and people of the president.

256
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,400
The cabinet ministers have reached out their hands, too.

257
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,910
We should send him to the premier as soon as we can,

258
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,580
to avoid future problems.

259
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,080
Tell Old Huang that we're sending him away within 5 days.

260
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,200
But, Governor, the Fish Light Festival is approaching.

261
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm afraid we can't wait that long.

262
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,870
Then get it done before the Fish Light Festival.

263
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,680
After the premier fell out of power, he's been planning his comeback.

264
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,660
If we can capture Yakov, it will definitely help with his comeback.

265
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,150
But we have to be careful about this. We can't make any mistakes.

266
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,670
- Understood.
- Yes, Sir.

267
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,280
Who is it?

268
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,290
Governor, there's nobody there.

269
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:40,250
Today, I'm here to auction this medal.

270
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,380
This represents my wish for peace in the world.

271
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,280
I hope our country can be stable soon.

272
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,010
Our fellow citizens no longer have to suffer from hunger and cold,

273
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,720
or the pain of losing their families.

274
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,300
Hurry it up! Full speed!

275
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,460
Third Brother, he's here.

276
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,800
3:00 p.m. at the Huaxing Hotel.

277
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,400
Let's go.

278
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,000
Envoy Zhao, what is your purpose...

279
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,800
for coming here in person?

280
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,400
It's an important matter, and I won't beat around the bush.

281
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,600
I’m sure Deputy Commander Xiao is clear that

282
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,900
that Minister He took instruction from the president.

283
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,000
Jin Cheng wanted to transfer your Regiment Tiger away, and hold you back with the three army joint exercise.

284
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,200
The president is already aware of that.

285
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,300
You're a smart person. These years, Jin Cheng has been publicly and covertly

286
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,800
helping the premier get back to power. The president

287
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,400
has long since been dissatisfied with him.

288
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,400
Then, what's your purpose exactly for coming here today, Envoy Zhao?

289
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,500
To replace him.

290
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,800
The president wants to imprison Jin Cheng while he's in Beixin.

291
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,600
Deprive him of his military power. The Beiyang Government will assist your Xiao family

292
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,800
replace Jin Cheng, and take control of the 17 cities in the North.

293
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,800
Envoy Zhao, is this the intention of the president

294
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,000
or Minister He's personal interest?

295
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,800
It is a kind of advice from Minister He.

296
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,200
Of course, you know that the president thinks highly of Minister He.

297
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,400
His advice is actually what the president is thinking about.

298
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,100
It's just that it's not appropriate for him to give the order directly, because of who he is.

299
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,200
Minister He is concerned about the same things as the president.

300
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,000
That's why he sent me here to negotiate with you.

301
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,700
I appreciate Minister He's concerns.

302
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,800
Jin Cheng wants you to be under his control.

303
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,000
While you're reluctant to hand over your military powers to him.

304
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
The conflict between you and him will erupt one day.

305
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Instead of that, Third Master Xiao,

306
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,200
under the support of the president,

307
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
take the opportunity?

308
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,700
Here.

309
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,200
Third Master Xiao,

310
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,400
you can achieve a lot more with your talent. Don't be satisfied just being someone's subordinate.

311
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,200
[Huaxing Hotel]

312
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Goodbye, Sir.

313
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,200
Governor.

314
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,000
Governor, we found this in his luggage.

315
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,200
He's the special envoy from the Military Ministry that Minister He sent here.

316
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,800
The purpose of his trip is to persuade Xiao Beichen.

317
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Zhao Tianlong.

318
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
Envoy Zhao.

319
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:19,400
Did you meet with Xiao Beichen already?

320
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,400
What did he promise you?

321
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,220
Still not sober enough.

322
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,600
Are you telling the truth?

323
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,200
I'll say it! I'll say it!

324
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,700
Xiao Beichen... he agreed to imprison you.

325
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,500
and force you to give up your military power.

326
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,000
When is he taking action?

327
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,600
Tonight, at 10:00 p.m.

328
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,400
Great show!

329
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,140
Third Brother, say something.

330
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,200
What did you say to the envoy?

338
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,450
Third Master, is it because you didn't give an answer?

339
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:41,100
So they decided to take action in advance?

340
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,160
Hello?

341
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,640
Governor, Xiao Beichen is on his way.

00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,100
Third Brother, why is it so quiet here? Are we late?

345
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,400
Freeze!

346
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
What's happening?

347
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,600
It's so late already, Beichen.

348
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,200
What are you doing here with all these troops?

00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,600
- Seventh Madam.
- Uncle Gui.

350
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,000
Why is Third Master fighting with the governor's people at the Hot Spring Villa?

351
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Oh, and what did they say at the East Main Camp?

352
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Seventh Madam, they didn't give many details over the phone.

353
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,200
But they said you should not worry.

354
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,800
Division Commander Zheng is already on the way to the Hot Spring Villa to support him.

355
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,200
How can I not be worried?

356
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,600
Commander Xiao is not at home. If anything happens to Third Master,

357
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,800
how can I explain it to him?

358
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
Governor...

359
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,000
What do you mean?

360
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
I'm asking you!

361
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,000
You brought so many people with loaded weapons,

362
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,200
and besieged the villa where I'm sleeping.

363
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
What do you want to do?

364
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,600
I got the news

365
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,800
that someone was going to kidnap you tonight. I'm here to protect you.

Bring Envoy Zhao!

373
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,400
Envoy Zhao from the Ministry of Military has confessed already.

374
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,000
At Minister He's request, he came to Beixin to persuade you

375
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,200
to stand on the president's side. You promised him that at the right time,

376
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,500
you would use military power to force me to quit my role and take my place!

Put down your guns!

Adjutant Zhou, if anyone makes a move, kill them with no exception!

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,100
Yes, Sir!

380

What kind of behavior is this?

381
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,600
It's treason. What a vicious thought!

382
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,800
Every word I said was true.

383
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,000
I brought my troops here only to protect you. I have no intention to rebel.

Only you know what you're up to.

385

If I were not prepared tonight,

386
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,340
the gun would be pointing at my head instead, is that right?

387
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,040
Governor, allow me to prove it to you.

388
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,230
For what reason do you think I should believe in you?

389
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:01,360
For he is a fake envoy!

390
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,160
Xiao Beichen, you're lying!

391
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,050
I don't mean to betray you.

392

I just want to survive.

393
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,390
You're saying he's a fake envoy.

394
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:19,120
All right, prove it to me.

395
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,710
Governor, if you don't believe me,

396
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:27,220
I can interrogate him with a few simple questions in front of your eyes.

397
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,480
We'll know whether he's real or fake by then.

398
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,400
Okay.

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,850
- Let me check.
- Okay.

You stay here. I'll go by myself.

404
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,100
Third Young Madam! It's dark! Be careful!

405
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,300
You said you were an envoy from the Military Ministry.

406
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,240
Who's the highest officer in the Military Ministry?

407
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,140
He Yunlai. Minister He.

408
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,090
Minister He.

409
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:33,030
When did he join the Military Ministry?

410
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,040
Two years ago. The former Minister was Liang Wensheng.

411
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,160
Minister He was his favorite student specializing in managing sources of troops.

412
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,560
Later at Minister Liang's recommendation,

413
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,950
he succeeded as the Minister of Military.

414
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,530
Minister He studied abroad in France, right?

415
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,030
How well does he speak French?

416
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,900
Minister He studied abroad in the United States.

417
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,810
I never heard him speak French.

418
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,490
Is there anything else you'd like to ask?

419
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:05,460
Okay. You're well prepared. Then let me ask you.

420
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,090
What is the car plate number of the Special Envoy's car at the Military Ministry?

421
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,810
I... don't usually pay attention to that.

422
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:24,080
As the Special Envoy of the Military Ministry, you don't pay attention

423
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,460
to the cars coming in and out of the ministry?

424
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,030
Okay. What are the first three digits of the internal line number of the Military Ministry?

425
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,490
As the Special Envoy of the Military Ministry,

426
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,950
you have to use the phone every day!

427
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,040
What? Envoy Zhao can't even remember this?

428
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
Who sent you here?

429
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,610
Adjutant Zhou.

430
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,200
Speak!

431
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,470
You're a fake envoy. Where's the real one?

432
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,790
What a bastard! Bastard!

433

My eldest nephew!

435
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,510
If you were not so smart, we would have misunderstood each other today!

436
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,580
Families would be fighting amongst each other!

437
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:45,780
Governor, the situation is turbulent now.

438
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,760
It's natural that people want to provoke dissension between us.

439
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,940
But the Xiao family is forever loyal to you.

440
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,880
In public, you're the supreme commander of the Ying Army.

441
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,590
And from a personal perspective, you're my father's older brother.

442
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,740
- And my uncle.
- That's true.

443
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,960
The bond between us will never change.

444
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,410
Yes, yes. The loyalty of the Xiao family

445

has always been clear to me.

446

You're not inferior than your father.

447
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,570
I'm relieved.

- Yes, Sir.

- I'm fine.

But I'm back, safe and sound.

461
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,060
Brother, what happened between you and the governor?

462
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:19,920
It's fine. It was a misunderstanding.

463
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,670
Where's Hangjing?

464
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,270
She's probably not aware of this yet. She's resting in her room.

465
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,290
She doesn't care about what happens at home. She only pays attention to someone else's business.

466
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,650
Well then, go back to your rooms and get some rest.

467
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,020
Okay.

468
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,490
Let's go back to our rooms. You should rest early, too.

469
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:41,260
Let's go.

470
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:30,940
Lady, where did you go?

471
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,850
My Lady, what happened to your feet?

472
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,380
Don't tell anyone.

473
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,500
Be careful.

474
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,140
The thing that happened today, what do you think of it?

475
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,030
I didn't expect that Envoy Zhao was a fake one.

476
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,640
But his certificate and traffic permit were real.

477
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:04,460
And Minister He did send an envoy to Beixin.

478
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,290
Where's the real one?

479
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,310
Zizheng, what do you think?

480
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,380
Since someone is trying to make him pass off as the real one,

481
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,560
naturally, they'll make the real one disappear.

482
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,510
If that's the case,

483
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,010
who would be so bold

484
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,430
to go against the Beiyang Government?

485
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:28,150
There are many changes happening in the Beiyang Government, and the situation now is turbulent.

486
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:32,070
They appear friendly to each other, but in fact, they're rivals. He's only just an envoy of the Military Ministry.

487
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:34,440
I'm afraid even if Minister He comes to visit in person,

488
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,620
it will be hard for him to escape this.

489
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,170
Anyone who wants to undermine your alliance with Xiao Beichen may be the suspect.

490
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,160
I'm afraid many people are bold enough to do this.

491
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,930
That backstage manipulator put on such a show.

492
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:51,330
That person is definitely trying to get rid of Xiao Beichen using your power.

493
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,280
Or impair the governor's forces using Xiao Beichen.

494
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,780
Foster-Father, this happened in Beixin after all.

495
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,580
I'm familiar with this place. Please let me investigate it.

496
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,460
There's no need for now.

497
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,450
Their conspiracy has already failed.

498
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,270
I don't think they'll make another move in the short term.

499
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:13,660
We'll just be careful.

500
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,970
There's one more thing about Xiao Beichen.

501
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,240
Now the joint military exercise is under way.

502
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,020
Without my permission, nobody shall do anything to him.

503
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,610
We need to look at the whole picture. Do you understand?

504
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:27,220
- Yes, I understand.
- Yes, Foster-Father.

505
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:47,330
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

506
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,590
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

507
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,710
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

508
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:04,240
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

509
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,950
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

510
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,980
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

511
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,360
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

512
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:27,220
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

513
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,360
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

514
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:39,910
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

515
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:45,610
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

516
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:51,170
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

517
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:56,850
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

518
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:02,380
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

519
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:08,060
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

520
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:13,740
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

521
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:19,380
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

522
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,890
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

523
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:34,940
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

524
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:45,610
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
