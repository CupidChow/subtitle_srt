By the way, the weather's getting cool these days.

Shuyi, I'm not worth you treating me this well.

And my current situation

49
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,630
doesn't allow me to think about personal relationships.

Eldest Brother Shen, I don't care who you are...

or what you have done.

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,770
I only know that my affection for you has never changed.

53
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,200
And there's never been anyone who could occupy my heart as you do.

You don't know how sad I was when I learned that you were married.

But... I didn't want to bother you or ruin your family.

But now everything's reset.

I still want to say the same thing. I can wait.

Until the day you fall in love with me.

59
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,200
If in the end you still have no feelings for me, that's okay.

60

But please don't reject my love.

Aren't you a bit too anxious?

66
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,420
Deputy Commander Xiao, I’m doing this for your benefit.

67
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,880
What if you don't capture the Communist Party members,

68
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,690
there's still time to make up for it. Right?

69
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,280
That's not something you should worry about.

00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,780
- Bring it here.
- Yes, Sir.

71
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,960
Deputy Commander Xiao, I hope you're not telling me that this is Shen Yanqing.

72
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,750
Commander Kang, you're right. This is Shen Yanqing.

73
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,910
I believe you are aware of the operation

74
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,780

If Commander Kang doesn't believe in this, you can go there and see for yourself.

Or you can ask residents living nearby. They can all be our witnesses.

82

161
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,880
a world of our own.

162
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,120
Mr. Shen.

163
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,460
Eldest Brother Shen.

164
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,710
It's about time. We should get on the train.

165
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,180
Okay.

166
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,300
Take care, Brother Shen.

167
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,130
I'm leaving. You should take care, too.

168
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,320
Hello, Adjutant Jiang. I'm Sheng...

169
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,650
I'm Lin Hangjing. Can you let me know

170
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,300
if Deputy Commander is in a meeting now?

171
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,020
What?

172
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,790
Old Huang, how much longer is it going to take?

173
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,360
I can't tell.

174
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,300
Rickshaw!

175
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,740
Newspapers! Newspapers!

176
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,070
You! Raise your head!

177
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,190
You! Turn your head towards me!

178
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,060
Let me try.

179
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,420
- Raise your head! Turn around!
- Good girl, don't cry.

180
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,080
- Good girl, eat this.
- You!

181
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,980
Sir, let me take care of her.

182
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,010
Don't cry. Be good.

183
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,380
Now it's 2:35 p.m.

184
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,860
Can I assume that you've given up on seeking the truth

185
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,140
and have chosen the latter option I gave you?

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,780
Then I'm sorry.

187
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,280
Take him!

188
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,490
Who dares to touch Third Brother? Will have to step over my dead body first!

189
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,790
Wait!

190
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,140
- Why are you here?
- Young Third Madam, why are you here?

191
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,950
Aren't you looking for the Communist Party?

192
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,530
I know where they are.

193
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,300
Lin Hangjing, do you have any idea what you're doing?

194
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,290
Young Third Madam, you know where the Communist Party is?

195
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,420
Why are you still standing there?

196
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,870
- Take Hangjing down now!
- Third Sister-in-law.

197
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:49,380
Hey, Brigade Commander Xu. Army Chief Mo.

198
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,700
Why are you doing this?

199
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,890
Since Young Third Madam has important information to provide,

200
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,020
we have to at least let her finish.

201
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:02,850
The garrison headquarters is responsible for overseeing the military discipline.

202
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:08,700
If you interfere with my job, how can I explain it to the higher authority?

203
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,890
Xiao Beichen!

204
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:43,270
I was ambushed as soon as I arrived at the train station.

205
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:46,320
Deputy Commander Xiao, you're indeed more tactical than me.

206
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,820
Shen Yanqing.

207
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,920
That's right. I'm Shen Yanqing, the one you're looking for.

208
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,120
A proud Communist Party member.

209
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:04,390
How daring of you to come here.

210
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,980
Dying to save my country is like returning home.

211
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,920
Why wouldn't I dare to come here?

212
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,820
If I die, my comrades will bury my body.

213
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:20,980
They'll wipe off the blood and keep fighting. The will of revolution

214
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,500
will not be eliminated by simply killing one or two Communist Party members.

215
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,330
Shen Yanqing, I'm giving you a chance.

216
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,580
Were you ambushed by Deputy Commander Xiao,

217
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,430
or are you surrendering yourself?

218
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,000
You can make a choice.

219
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,250
If you make the right one, I can spare your life.

220
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,160
I'm giving you a chance to choose, too.

221
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,180
The evil ambition of the Japanese is known to everyone.

222
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,910
If you want to disassociate yourself from them,

223
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,670
it's not too late. But if you insist on colluding with them,

224
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,150
you will definitely become a sinner in history!

225
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:10,360
In this piece of land where wars and disasters strike,

226
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,290
nobody can only live for himself.

227
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,630
The Japanese invasion is like the Sword of Damocles hanging above our heads.

228
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,780
For each day it doesn't fall down, there's one more day without peace.

229
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,530
When it eventually falls down, you'll realize

230
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,100
that you've lost your ability to fight back.

231
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,050
So, the earlier we start to fight back,

232
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:35,690
the sooner we can rescue our compatriots from oppression!

233
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,620
Every Chinese citizen should fight for our country and our homeland,

234
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
and for future generations to come.

235
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,870
We should set our blood on fire,

236
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,860
unite as one and never allow the enemy to take one inch of our land!

237
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,480
It’s such an easy choice. There’s no need to hesitate.

238
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,140
Every Chinese with the right conscience knows what to do.

239
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,860
Wherever the sun and moon shine, wherever the mountains and rivers are, these are all a part of our homeland.

240
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,130
If anyone dares to invade, we will eliminate them, no matter how strong they are!

241
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,280
Commander Kang, don’t you agree?

242
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,410
Young Third Madam Xiao, this is the first time we meet each other.

243
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,730
But you really do look like my wife.

244
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,240
Unfortunately, she has left China already.

245
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:35,920
Although you look like her, you’re not her.

246
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,650
What I want to tell you is that sometimes illusions are just temporary.

247
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,750
When the time has come,

248
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,200
it should remove the camouflage of your heart.

249
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,850
Deputy Commander Xiao, I’m only a few years older than you. I’m not qualified to be your big brother.

250
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,730
There are a few words that I wish to tell you. I hope every decision you make

251
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,120
comes from your heart.

252
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,220
Don’t do anything that makes you regret again.

253
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,870
Shen Yanqing!

254
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,190

255

- Doctor!

- Put down your gun!
- Eldest Brother Shen...

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,270
Please take good care of Hangjing.

264
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,070
Eldest Brother Shen!

265
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,170
Eldest Brother Shen!

266
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,380
Didn't you go to the train station already?

267
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,570
Why didn't you go? Why?

268
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,300
Shuyi.

269
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,820
I still have so many things to tell you, Eldest Brother Shen!

270
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:53,080
You can't leave me!

271
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,290
I'll see you again in our next life.

272
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,210
No. No! Eldest Brother Shen!

273
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,040
No.

274
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,080
Eldest Brother Shen!

Eldest Brother Shen!

276
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,000
Eldest Brother Shen, I'm sorry.

277
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,030
I can't even put up a headstone for you.

278
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,050
You're like the running water in the river that never dries up.

279
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,750
All of us will remember you forever.

280
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,100
Eldest Brother Shen, rest in peace.

281
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,670
I know you're leading your soldiers to the battlefield.

282
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,820
You know how to win. You know how to push their limits in order to win a battle.

283
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,880
We can only overthrow the old system to create a new world.

284
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,800
After that, we'll go through in-depth reform after the downfall.

285
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,170
We need to evolve from the old.

286
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:49,140
Otherwise, it'll be a halfhearted overthrow. It won't last for long.

287
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,230
Beichen, instead of eliminating military warlords entirely,

288
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,870
we want someone like you to join our party.

289
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,600
You will strengthen our power.

290
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Every Chinese, for our country territory and motherland,

291
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,930
for our descendants, fire up your passion,

292
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:15,560
to be united and not give away any territory.

293
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,840
Third Brother,

294
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,820
Commander has sent us a telegram.

295
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,300
Beichen, my son, I'm aware of Yanqing's situation.

296
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,630
It's devastating.

297
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,500
Kang Jingxiong is conspiring with the Japanese.

298
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,980
Yanqing sacrificed his life to destroy the conspirators.

299
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:54,190
He was our nation's hero.

300
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,420
He'll be your lifetime example.

301
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,470
From now on, anything that can benefit our nation,

302
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,610
you should go ahead and do it. I'll support you as your father.

303
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,020
The Japanese have a cunning mind, and they've been planning this for a long time.

304
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,850
We'll be facing a tough enemy, we can't be afraid,

305
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,420
and we cannot act against our own interest.

306
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,710
We cannot lose dignity as a military personnel.

307
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:24,680
We'd rather die in glory than live in disgrace.

There is news from Nanjing that

the Central Government wants to appoint Xiao Haishan to take over the position of commander-in-chief of the Zhibei province.

Now that Jin Cheng is dead, when the Xiao family were associated with the Communist Party,

we could have helped Jin Cheng to become the commander-in-chief position.

if beyond love between a man and a woman.

344

For Shuyi, Eldest Brother Shen is her mental support.

It's even more a belief.

If I love someone, I want them to be happy.

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,370
Of course, he's okay. Seventh Madam was also very worried.

479
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,730
She went to East Main Camp that day to verify.

480
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,270
Third Young Master showed Seventh Madam the telegram sent by Old Master from Beiping.

481
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,620
She then believed that Old Master and Young Masters were safe.

482
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,470
These two days she's been preparing for their birthday.

483
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,840
Got it. Continue your work.

484
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,340
Okay.

485
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,060
The clouds against the wind, snow against the wind.

486
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,820
Evening sunshine against clear skies.

487
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,490
Lai Hong against Qu Yan.

488
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:45,920
Resident bird vs songworm.

489
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,540
Three foot sword.

490
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,950
- Third Master is back.
- Continue to read it.

491
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:55,000
I just came back to take a look.

492
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,600
I see that you are almost done preparing the house

493
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,730
for my father's birthday.

494
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,960
Isn't that so? Seventh Madam has customized a flower stand.

495
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,010
She says she wants to use fresh flowers and green leaves to decorate, so that it'll look bright.

496
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,830
You want to read some more?

497
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,910
Why did you come back at this time in the afternoon?

498
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,020
I just came back to see if there was anything I could help with in the house.

499
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,500
I still need to go back to East Main Camp later.

500
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,640
You don't need to worry about matters of the house. You get busy with your work.

501
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,150
By the way!

502
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,400
- Third Master,
- Ke'er.

503
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,520
did Commander say when he'd bring Fifth and Sixth back?

504
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:41,530
Seventh Aunt, don't be anxious. Father sent a telegram.

505
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,550
He said he'd bring Fifth and Sixth back in ten days.

506
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:45,960
Really?

507
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,910
That's great. These two days I have been anxious.

508
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:53,300
It might be because of the mess the damn newspaper caused.

509
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,220
Maybe you're thinking what Father is thinking.

510
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,470
Look at what you're saying. Go back quickly.

511
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,520
Are you tired these two days? Your eyes are red.

512
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:08,130
Maybe a little. I'll leave first.

513
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,390
Go ahead.

514
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,520
Let's read again, okay?

515
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,060
The clouds against the wind, snow against the wind.

516
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,790
Evening sunshine against clear skies.

517
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,950
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

518
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:47,070
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers?  ♫

519
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,290
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

520
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:58,790
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment?  ♫

521
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:04,560
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat?  ♫

522
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,590
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

523
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,930
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this?  ♫

524
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:21,950
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

525
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:28,950
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

526
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:34,530
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again  ♫

527
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:40,160
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

528
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,810
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life  ♫

529
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:51,460
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

530
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:56,960
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

531
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,690
♫ If you still remember, when the next time
a shooting star passes ♫

532
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:08,340
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

533
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:13,990
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

534
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,460
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

535
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:28,350
♫ If you still remember, when the next time
a shooting star passes ♫

536
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:40,230
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
