21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,960
Eldest Brother Shen, it was my mistake.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,830
I didn't expect he would still remember the article I wrote in the past.

23
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,330
He even associated my former pen name with Qinyong.

24
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,270
This isn't your fault.

25
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,530
Beichen has been suspicious since the beginning, he would have looked into it sooner or later.

26
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,550
Eldest Brother Shen, don't worry. I won't interfere in the big plan because of this.

27
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,770
From now on, I'll still be Madam Shen. I'll still be Sheng Hanjun.

28
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:28,220
As I said, I believe you'll handle your personal emotions and do your work.

29
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,590
Now that you've come clean, perhaps this is a good thing.

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,460
Beichen can come to you and talk, this means he doesn't consider us as enemies.

31
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,920
Our organization intended to recruit him.

32
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,790
I can use this opportunity to speak to him sincerely.

34
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,900
Shen Yanqing. Eldest Brother Shen.

35
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,470
I address you as Eldest Brother Shen and yet you lied to me for so many years.

36
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,190
Beichen, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,730
Do you think an apology would solve everything?

38
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,040
Six years ago, because of the Changsha Fushimi ship accident,

39
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,200
my organization sent me back to Beixin.

40
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,220
I was back to contact the students for the boycott against Japanese corporations.

41
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,990
You never endorsed any political party,

42
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,790
why have you decided to join the Communist Party?

43
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,590
Do you remember you were against the war when you were young?

44
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,660
Aren't you a deputy commander in the Ying Army now?

45
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,710
I didn't have a choice.

46
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:08,980
Who could force you to do anything you don't want to do?

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,810
How about Hangjing?

48
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,360
Why are you bringing her into this turmoil?

49
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,500
Do you know how dangerous it is for her to be involved in this turmoil?

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,220
Actually, I met Hangjing by accident.

51
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,320
I remember she had just lost her baby back then, and she was totally devastated.

52
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,570
Hangjing was determined to leave Beixin.

53
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,070
Therefore, I took her and we left for the Soviet Union.

54
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,990
Once we contacted our organization,

55
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,550
she joined us as a volunteer.

56
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,540
In order to carry on the investigation mission,

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
she became another person.

58
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:08,510
My granddaughter, Hanjun, went missing many years ago.

59
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,510
I still don't believe it's true.

60
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,850
That's why I never announced her death.

61
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,330
Sir Sheng, thank you so much for your corporation.

62
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,130
You should call me Grandpa.

63
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:32,100
From now on, you'll become Sheng Hanjun.

64
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,070
Her mission was to become

65
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,770
a Red Capitalist,
(T/N: Patriotic Entrepreneur)

66
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,200
Sir Sheng's granddaughter, Sheng Hanjun.

67
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,550
She moved down to the south

68
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,130
and founded Eastern Newspaper as a cover, later becoming a patriotic personage.

69
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,840
In order to completely transform herself into Hanjun,

70
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,060
Hangjing dedicated an enormous amount of effort.

71
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,070
For her, this was not just a mission.

72
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,580
It was a rebirth.

73
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,340
Hanjun might not be our official comrade,

74
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,640
but she grew up in the south,

75
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,640
she is also very familiar with the environment.

76
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,460
Also, you two work well together with lots of chemistry.

77
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,180
You are the best candidate for this mission.

78
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,940
Also, you two need to pretend to be a married couple.

79
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,410
It'll be easier to cover up your identities.

80
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,620
This is Xiao Ke.

81
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,730
His parents were also our comrades.

82
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,950
Both of them died in a mission.

83
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,070
From now on, he'll be your child.

84
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,580
It turns out she went through so much all these years.

85
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,310
You cannot imagine

86
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,110
how tough Hangjing had it in the past few years.

87
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,470
And how much effort she made in order to transform herself into the person she is now.

88
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,500
The good thing is that she has become a new person.

89
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,290
It's like a rebirth. She has her own goal.

90
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,270
She has her own belief.

91
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:12,000
She is working hard to dedicate her hard work to the country's future.

92
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,850
Have you thought of

93
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,040
current Beixin, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Guangzhou?

94
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,730
They are all arresting Communist Party members.

95
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,470
The Central Government insists on suppressing internal political parties.

96
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,050
Everywhere bleeds like a river.

97
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,250
Why are you going against the current? What's the point?

98
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:37,220
That's right. Even if it's bleeding like a river, we must do that.

99
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,830
I also think about if

100
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,430
I hadn't joined the Communist Party, what would I be doing?

101
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,800
Perhaps I would be working in a medium size publishing house,

102
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,120
being paid a decent salary and married to a Chinese wife with two kids,

103
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,420
living like a peaceful middle-class man.

104
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,520
Isn't it great?

105
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,390
It's pretty good.

106
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,960
Do you know how many fellow countrymen are living and struggling with a miserable life?

107
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,380
This so call peaceful life is just lying to yourself!

108
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,540
I admire your selflessness and persistence. I also know that,

109
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,150
perhaps, you undermine military personnel like me.

110
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,720
But you have to understand,

111
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,630
I only want the people in Beixin to have a peaceful land in this chaotic period of time.

112
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,420
For how long?

113
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,700
What?

114
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,640
Do you think this is what you call "peaceful land"?

115
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,900
Based only on your own effort, how long can you sustain?

116
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,970
If the war within our country doesn't stop,

117
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,160
the civil wars will continue like an endless farce.

118
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,140
The Japanese have been increasing their troops along the railways every year.

119
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,760
This proves that they had plans to invalidate China a long time ago.

120
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,140
I won't talk about the long term, I'll just talk about Zhibei.

121
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,550
Kang Jingxiong is trying to stir the pot in court.

122
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,240
This it's a strategy designed by the Japanese.

123
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,380
Why are they doing that? You should know better than me.

124
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,900
Beixin, based on this current situation, how much longer can you sustain?

125
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,080
Different big parties have been ruling China for so many years.

126
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,520
Other than all the wrongdoings, and fights for power and money,

127
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,010
have they ever mentioned uniting and

128
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,320
strengthening the country?

129
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,850
Not once!

130
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,890
We can only overthrow the old system in order to create a new world.

131
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,800
After that, we'll go through in-depth reform after the downfall.

132
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,170
We need to evolve from the old.

133
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,760
Otherwise, it will just be a halfhearted overthrow,

134
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,950
and it won't last for long.

135
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,400
Beichen,

136
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,820
instead of eliminating military warlords completely,

137
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,350
we would rather have someone like you join our party.

138
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,860
You will strengthen our power.

139
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,330
Believe me.

140
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,220
I know. You need some time to digest our conversation.

141
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,610
I'll wait for you.

142
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,180
Eldest Brother Shen,

143
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,400
everyone has their own choice.

144
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,620
I know and I completely understand that

145
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,740
you persist in your beliefs,

146
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,520
and you're ready to sacrifice your life.

147
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,030
About the acts of your comrades previously,

148
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,840
I won't go pursue them for that.

149
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,680
But as for Hangjing,

150
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,510
she is my wife, my partner,

151
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,930
I will not allow you to bring her into danger while I stand by and watch.

152
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,070
You're on your own.

153
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,780
Come in.

154
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,980
Sir Shen?

155
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,530
You are Migrant Bird?

156
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,040
Correct. The port bidding process has finished.

157
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,110
It's time for us to talk face to face.

158
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,480
I never imagined this!

159
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,410
Come!

160
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,860
Come, please sit.

161

The Japanese have complicated powers here in Beixin,

Third—!

324
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,590
Third Brother!

325
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,460
Let her in.

326
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,460
Shuyi...

327
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,060
Shuyi, what are you doing here?

328
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,270
What happened here?

329
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:06,370
Where's Ms. Sheng? Where did she go?

330
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,430
I think... we were too late.

331
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,420
Ms. Sheng, eat something. Your health is important.

332
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,690
Ms. Shuyi, thank you.

333
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,400
Thank you for saving Yanqing.

334
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,980
It's nothing. It's what I should do.

335
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,760
Ms. Shen, the soldiers of Garrison Command did this, too?

336
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,220
Kang Jianxiong, that old fox, is so insidious.

337
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,910
Ms. Sheng, I promised Brother Shen that I'd take you to our home.

338
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,270
Hurry and pack your things, you'll be safe at our home.

339
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:48,480
No, I cannot go. I'll implicate you all.

340
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,100
I still have to notify everyone else to be careful.

341
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,920
I cannot hide like that.

342
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,350
Do you have another option?

343
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:04,440
Right now, you can't do anything as Sheng Hanjun.

344
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,020
Only in Xiao Manor can you openly walk around.

345
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,540
That's right, Third Sister-in-law. Listen to Third Brother.

346
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,110
Third...? You really are Third Sister-in-law?

347
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,720
Madam! Young Master has a fever, what do we do?

348
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,020
Let's go home.

349
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,220
[Huadinzhou]

350
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,050
Have they and Shen Ke settled down?

351
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:53,640
Yes. He's in a private clinic in the northern part of the city. There's people watching him.

352
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,970
Third Brother, this criminal on death row

353
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,970
is similar in body height and shape to Brother Shen.

354
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,950
He was put in prison for murder one year ago.

355
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,960
He's also scheduled for execution in two days.

356
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,810
It is great. We can have a bomb raid.

357
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,360
Once he's exploded to pieces, if we say he's Brother Shen, then he's Brother Shen!

358
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,020
Report to Deputy Commander. The soldiers of the Garrison Command are coming toward us.

359
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,100
They came pretty quickly!

360
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,350
What are you doing? This is Deputy Commander Xiao's private room!

361
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,030
You can't come in like that!

362
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,590
- You—!
- Don't move!

363
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,380
- Who's there?
- Turn on the light!

364
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,990
Deputy Commander Xiao, am I bothering you?

365
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,600
You brought soldiers here in the middle of the night.

366
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,880
What are you trying to do?

367
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,090
We received a tip

368
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,740
that one hour ago,

369
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:36,190
Communist Shen Yanqing's wife, Shen Hanjun came here.

370
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,550
We came to catch her under Commander Kang's orders.

371
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,110
If you can't find her here today,

372
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,110
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave here.

373
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,870
Beichen, don't make things hard on him.

374
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,850
He's just acting under orders.

375
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,120
Deputy Commander Zhang, since it's under Uncle Kang's orders,

376
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
then go ahead and take a look.

377
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,880
Sheng Hanjun!

378
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,070
Arrest her!

379
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,270
Who dares?

380
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:17,280
Assistant Commander Zhang, I remember we crossed paths a few times before.

381
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,370
It's only been a few years, don't you recognize me anymore?

382
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:23,150
I recognize you.

383
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,890
You are Shen Yanqing's wife, Sheng Corporation's Sheng Hanjun.

384
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,300
The Xiao and Shen families are longtime friends.

385
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,100
I am the Third Young Madam of the Xiao family. How did I become Shen Yanqing's wife?

386
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:42,620
If you really can't recognize me, you can ask Uncle Kang to come here.

387
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,190
When Beichen and I got married, he came to congratulate us.

388
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,240
He definitely wouldn't mistake me for someone else.

389
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,300
Lin Hangjing died in a fire five years ago.

390
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,470
Deputy Commander Xiao was discouraged

391
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,190
and almost hindered military operations.

392
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,760
The entire Zhibei knows about that!

393
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,480
What a joke.

394
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,930
My wife died in a fire?

395
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,600
Did you see us hold a funeral?

396
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,890
Did you see us tell the world?

397
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:29,300
Or did you personally come to pay your respects?

398
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,790
But... Deputy Commander Xiao,

399
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:37,410
I heard... you repeatedly

400
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,280
mistook Sheng Hanjun as Lin Hangjing.

401
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,310
And once in public,

402
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,430
you hit Shen Yanqing.

403
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,850
How do you explain that?

404
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:58,300
Previously, I was indeed improper towards his wife.

405
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,510
Even my wife hasn't held that against me,

406
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,090
who are you to hold it against me?

407
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,240
Isn't your department stretching its hand too far?

408
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,580
If you can't prove that my wife is Sheng Hanjun,

409
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,940
don't even think of taking a step out of Xiao Manor.

410
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,330
Deputy Commander Xiao...

411
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,180
Put down your guns! Put them all down!

412
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,740
Deputy Commander Xiao... it's a misunderstanding.

413
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,750
Definitely a misunderstanding!

414
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,640
Thank you. I've made things hard on you.

415
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,320
You don't need to thank me.

416
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,980
I told you this before, I'm willing to do it for you.

417
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:15,540
On the other side, I should thank Aunt Zhang.

418
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,580
In that moment,

419
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,860
I felt like I'd gone back in time.

420
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,720
Anyway, we're already in a position where we can't take back what we said.

421
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,430
No matter if you're willing or not, you can only return to being Third Young Madam.

422
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,440
I know. They won't give up easily.

423
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:59,120
I wonder how Yanqing is doing.

424
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:04,120
I've already left the orphanage to Zijun.

425
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,550
It'll be safe for now.

426
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,550
It's getting late. Get some rest.

427
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,150
Thank you!

428
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,860
No matter what, we owe you.

429
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,730
Once things have passed, I will find a way to leave.

430
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,090
"We"?

431
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,660
Are you talking about Sheng Corporation's Sheng Hanjun,

432
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,750
or my wife, Lin Hangjing?

433
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,550
I told you once before,

434
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,870
I will do anything for Hangjing.

435
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:45,820
I won't let her suffer at all.

436
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:53,040
But if it's Sheng Hanjun, if I want to capture them,

437
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,000
I can do it at any time. Why would I wait until now?

438
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,310
It's getting late.

439
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,980
Get some rest.

440
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:12,060
Sheng Hanjun is Lin Hangjing.

441
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,240
What a small world.

442
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,010
One plays the bad cop, the other plays the good cop.

443
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,440
Look at how in sync they are, Miss Fengqi.

444
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,920
Your road to revenge is sown with thorns.

445
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,650
Mr. Sato.

446
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:37,510
Are we going to just watch Sheng Hanjun

447
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:39,370
continue hiding at Xiao Manor?

448
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,200
Don't worry, Commander Kang.

449
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,130
Our chance has come.

450
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,570
What chance?

451
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:52,590
Whether it's Shen Yanqing or Sheng Hanjun,

452
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,560
the Communist Party is insignificant to us.

453
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,010
Our goal is to unseat the Xiao family.

454
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:07,680
If that's the case, why make such a fuss?

455
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,480
Xiao Beichen is covering up for the Communist Party in broad daylight.

456
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,920
He's made it clear that he has no respect for me.

457
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,980
Although the Communist Party is insignificant to us,

458
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,470
they're a red line for the Southern Government.

459
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:32,210
Any attempt to hide or protect the enemy is worth the death penalty.

460
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:35,650
The closer Xiao Beichen gets to the Communist Party,

461
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:38,410
the bigger our chance will be.

462
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,520
Sheng Hanjun has now become Lin Hangjing.

463
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,450
She has proven our previous prediction.

464
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,720
Xiao Beichen definitely will not capture Shen Yanqing.

465
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,850
Commander Kang, I think you're only one step away

466
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,680
from becoming the King of the Northern Territories.

467
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,570
Please.

468
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,290
- Young Master.
- Young Madam.

469
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,940
Third Sister-in-law.

470
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,500
Seventh Aunt!

471
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,960
You've finally returned!

472
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,400
It's been five years, I thought I'd never see you again.

473
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,550
I thought our family would never be united again.

474
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,870
We wronged you, we let you suffer.

475
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:45,050
Seventh Aunt, don't say that.

476
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,400
You and Commander treat me like your own daughter.

477
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,700
I was just not lucky enough to enjoy the time with you.

478
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,250
Now, I've returned to bring you two trouble.

479
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:56,690
Silly child, what are you saying? This is your home!

480
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,100
If you don't come here, where else would you go?

481
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,650
I heard Father went to the States for his illness. How is he doing?

482
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:08,930
I just sent him a telegram to make him happy!

483
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm sure Fifth and Sixth Young Master will be happy, too!

484
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,480
His body has improved a lot now.

485
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,190
Hangjing, you won't leave again this time, right?

486
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:29,310
Third Sister-in-law, I'm the one who should apologize.

487
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:31,860
I used to always create trouble for you.

488
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,360
If I didn't trust Zheng Fengqi,

489
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,720
you and Third Brother wouldn't have separated and you wouldn't have suffered so much.

490
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:48,250
It's all in the past. Don't bring it up again.

491
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:53,600
No, you can punish me however you want. That will make me feel better.

492
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,220
Then I'll make one request.

493
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,720
Forget the past, don't live with regrets anymore.

494
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,630
Shuyi, listen to Hangjing.

495
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:08,250
This is the day of our family reunion! We should be happy!

496
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,890
Let's go eat dinner!

497
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,460
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

498
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,720
Mr. Mu.

499
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,360
You said Sheng Hanjun is Lin Hangjing?

500
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,430
Impossible! How could that be?

501
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,370
Mr. Mu, stop lying to yourself.

502
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,520
If she isn't Lin Hangjing,

503
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,930
how could Xiao Beichen risk his entire family to hide her?

504
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,720
Hangjing...

505
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,000
is a member of the Communist Party?

506
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,710
Think about it. Shen Yanqing's wife.

507
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,100
Even if she isn't,

508
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,730
she can't possibly be entirely unrelated to the Communist Party.

509
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,460
Then, what do you want?

510
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,190
What Mr. Sato wants

511
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:31,180
is for you to step forward

512
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,970
and prove Lin Hangjing's identity.

513
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:37,230
She trusts you without any doubt.

514
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,000
And you're a member of the Youth Union.

515
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,560
Nothing can go wrong.

516
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,940
This way, if you uncover Lin Hangjing's identity,

517
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,400
Xiao Beichen will certainly be finished.

518
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,290
- Don't even think about it. I definitely will not harm—
- Mr. Mu.

519
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:07,740
As far as I know, your mother's body has improved every day.

520
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,700
You don't want anything to happen at this point, right?

521
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,220
So... answer after you've thought it through.

522
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:37,990
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

523
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:43,160
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

524
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,490
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

525
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:54,900
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

526
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,610
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

527
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,730
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

528
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:10,930
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

529
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:18,030
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

530
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:25,000
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

531
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,580
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

532
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:36,250
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

533
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,870
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

534
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:47,480
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

535
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,120
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

536
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:58,760
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

537
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:04,400
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

538
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,030
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

539
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:15,580
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

540
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:24,720
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

541
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:36,490
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
