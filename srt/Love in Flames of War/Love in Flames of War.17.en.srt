00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm very honored to meet the lead actress in person.

323
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,200
Thank you.

324
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,400
You can call me Zheng Fengqi. That's my original name.

325
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,200
Okay. Please have a seat.

326
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
Thank you.

327
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,600
Fengqi, this Sir Qiao would like to sponsor the girl's school.

328
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,200
You talked about the idea of putting up a charity show last time.

329
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,900
So we've invited you here to have a discussion.

330
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,300
We'll also hear Sir Qiao's thoughts.

331
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,700
Sir Qiao, the two ladies here don't hope

332
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,800
that all of the expenses are covered by charity funds.

333
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,200
I came up with a good idea. We can put up a show regularly

334
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,000
and that can be a source of income.

335
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,600
But we're not professional actresses. Would people buy a ticket to watch the show?

336
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,100
I'm here. I can help train the students of the girl's school.

337
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,800
You don't need to worry.

338
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,600
I think this is a great idea.

339
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
This way we can cover the basic operations cost of the school

340
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,900
and help the girls become more independent.

341
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,600
So they're not just receiving money from the charity.

342
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,200
Sir Qiao, what do you think?

343
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,200
After hearing your ideas,

344
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,000
I think you're really taking practical approaches to educating girls.

345
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,600
I am overwhelmed by my respect for you.

346
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,800
I'll support you by raising both my hands up!

347
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,400
I think this is a great idea.

348
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,000
Doctor, the drug is here.

349
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,640
Miss Rouke, please hold him for me.

350
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,000
Okay.

351
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,100
Hangjing. Hangjing.

352
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,200
Hangjing.

353
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,800
Hangjing.

354
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,400
Doctor, how is he now?

355
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,200
He's got a slim chance of survival.

356
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,000
Now it's the crucial moment of life and death.

357
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,700
He can only be saved if he recovers from the high fever and wakes up.

358
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,900
Normally... can he be saved?

359
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,800
Slough, muscular injury, inflammation, and high fever.

360
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Normally people will have already died.

361
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,600
Although he's unconscious, he’s trying to hold onto it.

362
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,400
Did you hear him saying someone's name?

363
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,800
Yes. Although he's in a coma,

364
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,000
he's been saying the name, "Hangjing."

365
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,800
She's probably the love of his life.

366
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,800
Governor, we'll make sure to complete the task.

367
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,500
Governor, please follow me.

368
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,300
- Doctor, please don't let my father know about it.
- Okay.

369
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,000
Okay.

370
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Cheers.

371
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,000
Thank you for all your hard work these days.

372
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,600
Teaching lessons and rehearsing the show at the same time.

373
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,400
So I'm inviting everyone here for dinner to help you relax.

374
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,000
Sir Qiao, you're such a gentleman.

375
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,600
But we only have two male teachers at our school.

376
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,380
Their performance skill sucks! Just like two tree stumps.

377
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,800
We still need someone to play Romeo.

378
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,900
If you need, I can help with that.

379
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,400
That's great! One big problem solved.

380
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,200
You have to endorse us!

381
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,800
Then, thank you, Sir Qiao.

382
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,200
You're more than welcome. It's my pleasure.

383
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,400
Cheers for a successful show!

384
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,000
Cheers!

385
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,000
Sir Qiao, you have some unique collections in your house.

386
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,600
I bought this furniture when I was traveling in Europe.

387
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,300
These are antiques that I love.

388
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,000
It's probably a mix of styles to put them together.

389
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,800
Please don't laugh at me.

390
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,600
A mix of Chinese and Western styles. These are interesting antiques.

391
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,500
It's making me reluctant to leave!

392
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,400
Thanks for your compliment.

393
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,040
Teacher Lin, do you like kites, too?

394
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:07,060
These are my collections.

395
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,900
This one is a kite from Beiping. It's called "Experience."

396
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,210
This one is a kite from Weifang.

397
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,060
He likes to put new year paintings and traditional Chinese paintings onto the kites.

398
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,510
This one is the representative kite of Tianjin.

399
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,130
It's called Wei Yuantai. It's the most prestigious one.

400
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,230
It won the gold prize at Panama International Expo.

401
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:35,080
Sir Qiao, you have a lot of knowledge on kites.

402
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,490
If you like it, you can choose anyone you like.

403
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,390
It must be difficult for you to collect all these kites,

404
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,730
I don’t think I could take any one away from you.

405
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,320
Sir Qiao, if you’re giving away gifts, how about us?

406
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Of course you can.

407
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,820
If both of you like these,

408
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,400
the efforts I put into these kites

409
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,090
has not been wasted.

410
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,490
Here you go.

411
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:04,860
It's so exquisite. Thank you.

412
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,630
You're welcome.

413
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:11,910
- Will it work?
- I’m sure.
- Team Captain.

414
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:18,470
Chengjing Girls School debut first play.

415
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:20,350
Do you think Third Sister-in-law will be in it?

416
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,780
Do you not see those three big words, Lin Hangjing? Are you blind?

417
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,930
Lin Hangjing, right?

418
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,060
We must go and support Third Sister-in-law.

419
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,220
Third Brother, do you want to go to support her?

420
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,550
- I don't have time.
- Third Brother.

421
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,440
No matter how busy you are, you need to find time to go.

422
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,930
You sleep alone in the office, don’t you feel empty, lonely, and cold?

423
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:54,450
Also, this is the best time for you two to get back together.

424
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,530
Exactly. It's an opportunity to reconcile with her.

425
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,270
They work so hard rehearsing, don’t you think you should send them some fruits and flowers

426
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,210
to show your care?

427
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,210
How could she still get mad at you?

428
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,680
Let’s settle that.

429
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,330
[Romeo and Juliet]

430
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:21,820
That's "Herald of Daybreak of the Lark." It's not "Nightingale".

431
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,750
Look. A pair of lovers.

432
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,180
The dawn that is unfavorable already inlaid the eastern clouds
[Juliet and Romeo]

433
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,420
with a golden thread.

434
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,150
The starlight of the night has already burned.

435
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,820
That's not the light of dawn.

436
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,050
It's the shooting star from the sun.

437
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:49,410
Hence, don't be anxious. You can still delay for a while.

438
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,740
Let them capture me. Let them kill me.

439
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:00,820
As long as you are willing, I won't have any grudges.

440
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,360
Come.

441
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,150
Death, I welcome you.

442
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,130
Is this Juliet's intention?

443
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
What's wrong?

444
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,050
My soul wants to talk to me.

445
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,130
The sky is not bright yet.

446
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,460
The sky is already bright. It's already bright.

447
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:48,630
No.

448
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,130
The day is getting brighter

449
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,390
but our sorrowful hearts

450
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,720
are getting darker.

451
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,040
Teacher Lin and Teacher Qiao perform very well.

452
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:09,180
Both of them are so good-looking. They are perfect for these roles.

453
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,950
That's right. This is known as pleasing to the eyes and warming the hearts.

454
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,420
What window?

455
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:21,060
Let daytime in, let life out.

456
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,140
Goodbye. Farewell.

457
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,290
Give me a kiss.

458
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,830
And I will leave.

459
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,150
Sir Qiao.

460
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,320
Why did you hit him?

461
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,830
Xiao Beichen, what are you doing?

462
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,610
I should be asking you that. What was he doing?

463
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,340
- We were just rehearsing.
- Third Master, don't misunderstand.

464
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,750
Sir Qiao provides grants for our school. They were only rehearsing.

465
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,970
It was just a misunderstanding.

466
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,600
Stop beating him up.

467
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,540
Can a grant provider do anything at random?

468
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,750
- Third Master Xiao.
- Keep quiet!

469
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,770
- Xiao Beichen, Chengyu is my friend.
- Are you okay?

470
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,450
Do you still have any respect for me?

471
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:24,430
You want respect. You want freedom.

472
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,690
Which is being lovey-dovey with this man?

473
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,370
You don't even understand what acting is.

474
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,490
Okay.

475
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,920
Fine. I didn't understand.

476
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,540
My memory is bad.

477
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:46,970
I'm warning you. When I see you again, I will look for my gun.

478
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,150
No matter where you are, I will kill you.

479
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,340
Sir Qiao.

480
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,440
Are you okay?

481
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,290
- Army Chief, what happened?
- Start driving!

482
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,540
[Beixin Chengjing Girls School]

483
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,160
- Report.
- Come in.

484
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,410
Commander,

485
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,990
the Governor's eighth brigade in Suiling

486
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,010
may want to cause troubles.

487
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,830
Is this the information from our spy?

488
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,520
That's right.

489
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,350
Since Cheng Army was defeated, they have changed their expansion strategy.

490
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,740
They have moved their war from the battlefield to the underground.

491
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,570
They started to use the money to infiltrate,

492
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,330
aiming to decay the opponent from the inside and create turmoil in the Zhibei region.

493
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:02,160
They're expecting to reap the gains from this plan.

494
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,340
However, the eight brigades of Suiling isn't under Jin Cheng's direct command.

495
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,410
They are permanently posted in Eagle Rocks. It's a very rough area.

496
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,630
They don't have a good relationship.

497
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,230
I fear when the opportunity rises,

498
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,170
there will be a rebellion.

499
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:22,140
Suiling is the fortress of the Zhibei region.

500
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,910
Eagle Rocks is a place surrounded by tough mountains.

501
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:29,490
If there's really a battle,

502
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,190
it will be a tough battle.

503
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,480
Commander, you must think of a solution.

504
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,950
Since the Xiao's father and son are investigating the mole,

505
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:53,520
Mo Xibai won't be able to hide for long either.

506
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,840
Why don't we use this opportunity...

507
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,500
You mean you want Mo Xibai to start a riot

508
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,040
and directly fight Xiao Haishan?

509
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,340
The closer you stand, the knife will stab deeper.

510
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,320
Military posture is the face of a soldier.

511
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,970
There are still ten minutes left!

512
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,580
Third Brother, I knew you would be here.

513
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,540
Stop shooting. I want to have a few words with you.

514
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:29,320
Don't be so angry.

515
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,990
Qiao Jiang and Hangjing just met each other.

516
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:35,840
The two of them were rehearsing so they could raise money for the school.

517
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,260
Don't overthink it.

518
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,110
I can totally sense the jealousy.

519
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:46,460
Enough. Stop it.

520
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,610
Army Chief, how’s my shot?

521
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,340
It’s good, I thought you would be rusty.

522
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,420
You are better than a man.

523
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,830
Look how manly I am.

524
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,790
You need to be more open-minded.

525
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:13,280
I’m not worried about Hangjing’s motive.

526
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,540
It’s the way that guy looked at Hangjing.

527
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:20,710
Come on, Qiao Jiang came from a rich family.

528
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:25,680
His life is pretty simple. He likes to collect antiques

529
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,500
then he likes to make kites.

530
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,120
That’s about it.

531
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,040
What did you say?

532
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,050
- He makes kites?
- Yes.

533
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,360
He likes to collect kites from different places.

534
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,060
And also different kinds of kites.

535
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,190
What? Is there something wrong with that?

536
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:12,650
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

537
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:17,840
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

538
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:23,000
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

539
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,530
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

540
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,320
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

541
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,300
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

542
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,690
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

543
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:52,530
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

544
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,730
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

545
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,300
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

546
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:10,950
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

547
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:16,500
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

548
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,180
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

549
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:27,660
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

550
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,420
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

551
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:39,080
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

552
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,720
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

553
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:50,240
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

554
00:44:50,240 --> 00:45:00,270
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

555
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:10,860
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
