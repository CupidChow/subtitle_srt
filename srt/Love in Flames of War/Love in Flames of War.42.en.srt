[Episode 42]

21
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,660
Mr. Mu, what are you doing?

22
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,640
My mother took your opium and died.

23
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:16,940
When the Japanese took me in, they gave me those pills.

24
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,670
They claimed it was to treat my lung disease.

25
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,760
After I took those pills, my condition improved.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,850
My body and my bones weren't aching that much anymore.

27
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,650
But... But later on...

28
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,390
I realized that I was addicted to it.

29
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,860
Later on, I learned that it was opium.

30
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,430
If I don't take it any other day,

31
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,400
I... I... I will feel very anxious.

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,450
I... I feel like I want to die.

33
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,350
They told me if I told you the truth, they would kill you.

34
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,530
Sato!

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,070
I'm sorry, Zizheng.

36
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,990
It's your mother, it's me who became your burden.

37
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,400
Mother.

38
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,220
Mother!

39
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,430
Spit it out! Mother!

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,120
Zizheng, your mother is going to die.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,480
You shouldn't work with the Japanese from now on.

42
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,010
I... I'm sorry.

43
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,070
Mother.

44
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,980
Mother! Mother!

45
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,100
Mother!

46
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,470
It turns out you're the one who set this up?

47
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:20,550
You pretended to be the bait and lured Xiao Beichen?

48
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,230
That's right.

49
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,220
Have you thought of this? If I die,

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,630
and you'll be in the hand of Xiao Beichen, what's the consequence?

51
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,910
I'll be dead, isn't that so? I should have been dead a long time ago.

52
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,970
But you deserve to die more than me.

53
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,120
I look like a mess right now all because of you.

54
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,890
You blame me?

55
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,970
Mr. Mu, don't forget that we're simply working with each other.

56
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,390
Aren't you using the Japanese Empire to take your personal revenge?

57
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,430
This is the opportunity now.

58
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,910
The Japanese troops stationed in North China are garrisoned right next to Beixin.

59
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,700
The end of Xiao Beichen will come very soon.

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,320
Are you done with your nonsense?

61
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,500
You can tell the King of Hell Yama the rest of it.

62
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,080
Third Bother, they're over there.

63
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,700
Follow them!

64
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,110
Let's go.

65
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,460
Why did you do this?

66
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,550
It was you.

67
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,590
You were the one who cut the fuse wire of the bomb...

68
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,980
in advance.

69
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:26,150
I knew this would be my ending a long time ago.

70
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,540
I'd gone too far down the wrong path,

71
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,760
and I couldn't go back to the right one.

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,480
Xiao Beichen, in the future,

73
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,080
please take good care of Hangjing.

74
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,870
Zizheng, what happened exactly?

75
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,740
In fact,

76
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,520
I started working with the Japanese a long time ago.

77
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,530
Shen Yanqing and Brother Ding...

78
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,120
both died because of me.

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,140
Even my mother... She died because of me, too.

80
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,210
Why?

81
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:46,390
You once said that everyone is born equal.

82
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,870
You said you wanted to build a new world of freedom and equality.

83
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,910
You said that only when our country was independent and strong,

84
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,120
could the Chinese people live happy lives.

85
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,750
That's the world you've always longed for.

86
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,610
Why did you do all this?

87
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,330
I'm sorry.

88
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,990
Don't cry.

They're gathering toward Feng City in secret and causing a lot of trouble.

Third Brother, Feng City is a portal in the south of the Northern Territories.

95
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,450
Sato is doing this merely to find a proper excuse to offend us.

96
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:27,260
If they take over Feng City, the Northern Territories will be in big trouble.

97
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,470
Is the Nanjing Government reacting in the same way as before?

98
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,230
Yes. Two words, "still negotiating."

99
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,760
Third Brother, what do we do?

100
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,880
Order the defense troops in Feng City to set off today, toward where the Japanese troops are gathered.

101
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,640
Establish a camp 500 meters away from the Japanese troops and build up a defense line.

102
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:57,740
If the Japanese troops dare to cross that line, my Ying Army will defend with their lives and leave them no chance to invade!

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,000
On the same day?

104
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,600
Third Brother, have you prepared ahead of time?

105
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,400

107
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,400
I hold a deep grudge against the Japanese.

In terms of work, as a military officer who works for the country,

According to Seventh Aunt's instructions,

111
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,200
I've sent away almost all of our servants.

The mission you came here for is finished.

I won't stop you.

You want me to leave? Away from the Xiao family?

119
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,400
Perhaps we should have ended things long ago.

120
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,020
You once said...

121
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,200
our meeting was wrong to start with.

122
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,400
We've dragged out this wrong for several years.

Now, I am alone and have nothing left to hold onto.

Hangjing,

125
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
there's no need for us to continue dragging things out.

126

You really think that way?

Starting from today,

you are no longer the Third Young Madam of the Xiao family.

In the future, you don't need to hold the Xiao surname.

After the 4th regimen of the China Garrison Army

132
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,200
was stationed at the border of Beixin, they were malicious and caused trouble repeatedly.

133
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,000
They kept having conflicts with the Ying Army.

134
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
September 18, 1939.

135
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,200
Under the orders of the Japanese military,

136
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,400
their garrison troop bombed out the South Manchurian Railway near Willow Lake in Shenyang,

137
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,200
and framed the Chinese military for it.

138
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,000
The Japanese army used this as an excuse to bombard Shenyang North's camp.

139

It's the Mukden Incident on September 18th.

Following the increased pace of the invasion of China,

the Japanese China Garrison Army's strength kept getting stronger.

142
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,400
The situation at the border of the Northern Territories was like a hanging sword.

Brothers.

176
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,400
This time it is the Japanese Kwantung Army

177
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,200
joining the Sato regiment to intimidate my Beixin.

178
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,000
It is as you all saw.

179
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
They are insane!

180
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,800
They directly attacked the center of Beixin City!

181
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Many civilians died or were injured.

182
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,800
If they attack,

183
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,600
the entire Beixin City will turn into hell.

184
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,700
The Sato regiment is now still stationed at Linhe town confronting our side.

185
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,600
But they keep increasing the number of people in the Kwantung Army and it's still increasing.

You two lead the independent brigade to station at the inner city,

and cooperate with the Second Division in the outskirts to defend the camp till the end.

Yes!

195
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Everyone else, listen up!

196
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Lead your garrison army to defend the camp till the end!

197
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,400
If we go to war, you can only move forward!

Only one of us is allowed to exist!

- Yes!
- Yes!

201
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Colonel, currently the Ying Army sent a large number of troops

202
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,200
and their own troops to defend Beixin till the end, forming a fortress.

203
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,800
The enemy and we are in deadlock. For the moment,

204
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,200
we are unable to make a breach.

205
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Xiao Beichen has sent out his elite soldiers.

206
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,800
Miss Fengqi, it is time.

207
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,400
The sword you placed within the army.

208
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
It's time to see some blood.

209
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,700
I've waited eagerly for this day.

210
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,740
Eldest Lady, she's inside.

211
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,540
- It hurts!
- I almost cannot hold on!

212
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,740
No, he's too heavily injured. He has to go to the hospital.

213
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,470
I'll go with you.

214
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,080
What's going on?

215
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,740
Get inside!

216
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,600
Long time no see. Have you been well?

217
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,450
Zheng Fengqi, how did you get into Beixin City?

218
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,640
They switched sides?

219
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,870
You're wrong. They're very loyal.

220
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,340
I should say, they're only loyal to my father.

221
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,110
They are loyal to Regiment Leader Zheng.

222
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,520
But it's too late now.

223
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,500
Very soon... you'll die in my hands.

224
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,980
Zheng Fengqi! Your hands are stained with so much blood.

225
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,150
Now, you are working with the Japanese.

226
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,570
You're helping the tyrant with their evil deeds. Are you afraid that karma will get back on you?

227
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,290
Karma?

228
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,530
Are you talking about your child?

229
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,490
Let me tell you. He deserved to die!

230
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,880
Because that child was yours and Xiao Beichen's!

231
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,570
Zheng Fengqi! Do you understand what love is?

232
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,840
Love isn't forcing someone.

233
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,860
Love isn't about being hysterical.

234
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,770
It is two hearts as one, helping each other.

235
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,600
You don't understand what love is!

236
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,370
Shut up! You have no right to teach me!

237
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,310
Because of you, my father died!

238
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,660
My mother died, too!

239
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,710
You destroyed my family! You made my life a living hell!

240
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,730
It's all because of you!

241
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,810
I couldn't get the person I love!

242
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,600
Have you ever experienced that before?

243
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,760
You never will!

244
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,330
Kneel down!

245
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,590
As long as you beg on your knees to be spared

246
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,740
and express your regret to me, I'll consider sparing you.

247
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,500
You're insane!

248
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,840
I will not kneel to someone like you.

249
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,040
Hangjing! Hangjing!

250
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,510
I'm fine.

251
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,380
Notify Comrade Du Heng now.

252
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,600
Have him tell Commander... Xiao...

253
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,600
that there are traitors among the city's soldiers!

254
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,730
Hangjing! Hangjing!

255
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,870
- Drive.
- Where are we going?

256
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,370
Drive!

257
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:33,240
Xiao Beichen is too crafty. He escaped!

258
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,560
Search for him all across the city! Dead or alive!

259
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,780
Yes! Let's go!

260
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,540
Report!

261
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,720
We've already searched two streets, but we haven't found Xiao Beichen.

262
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,050
Wait.

263
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,200
Perhaps we missed a place.

264
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,290
Get up!

265
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,250
My Lords. My Lords. I am so sorry.

266
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,480
We are practicing right now. If you want to watch a performance,

267
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,750
please come back tonight.

268
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:44,020
Troupe Leader Zhao, have you been well?

269
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,890
Aren't you... Director Sato?

270
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,640
- You are...?
- Has Third Master Xiao been here?

271
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,410
Third Master?

272
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,110
He hasn't come here for a long time!

273
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,020
Stop lying!

274
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,350
Troupe Leader Zhao, a wise man suits his actions to the time.

275
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,710
You'd better tell the truth.

276
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,890
Yes, yes, yes. I'll be honest.

277
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,930
I speak only the truth!

278
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,290
If you don't believe me, this place

279
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,190
is only so big.

280
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:22,150
Would you like to search for him yourself?

281
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,520
- Search!
- Yes!

282
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Mr. Sato, please.

283
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,010
- Please continue.
- Yes.

284
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,470
Continue, continue, continue.

285
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,520
Report! Nothing!

286
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,420
Report! Nothing!

287
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,950
Troupe Leader Zhao.

288
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,830
You'd best have not lied,

289
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:48,590
or else everyone here will die.

290
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,180
How could I dare to lie?

291
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,310
If you still don't believe me, you can take another look around.

292
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,800
At this point in time, you're still indulged in your elegant leisure.

293
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,630
Beixin City is on the verge of being occupied.

294
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:07,450
The Xiao family has come to their end,

295
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:09,970
and their troops will be discharged too.

296
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,040
You are still in the mood to practice here?

297
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,420
Troupe Leader Zhao, you should think about what the next step is for you.

298
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:20,400
Mr. Sato, you really know how to joke.

299
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,630
We still have to make a living.

300
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,320
No matter how chaotic things are,

301
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,270
they all have to eat.

302
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,740
Xiao Liu, Xiao Liu!

303
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:54,190
Use the opera troupe's car to send Third Master out of the city!

304
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,670
Yes!

305
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,250
Third Master, there's a hidden compartment under the car.

306
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,800
The Japanese won't find you.

307
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,070
Thank you, Uncle Zhao.

308
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,540
Third Master, please take care!

309
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,710
Third Master, take care!

310
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,470
You all take care too!

311
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:16,740
Don't worry. As long as the Japanese don't find you,

312
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,390
there's nothing they can do against us.

313
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,230
- All right, hurry and go!
- Okay!

314
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,500
- Third Master!
- Third Master!
- I'm going now!

315
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,750
Third Master, this way!

316
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,320
What should we do?

317
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,720
[Yushi Tianhu]

318
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,110
That's not right.

319
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,020
One of those performers...

320
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,000
This is bad!

321
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,210
Director Sato, why have you returned?

322
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,640
Troupe Leader Zhao, can you tell me

323
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,470
why there's one less person?

I think you're mistaken.

Is that so?

327

But I remember there were eight people just now.

328
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:46,640
They should be Du Liniang, Liu Mengmei,

329

Chun Xiang, and four flower goddesses.

330
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,660
And of course... the devil of dreams.

331

Then please tell me, Troupe Leader Zhao, where is the devil of dreams?

Speak! Don't make things difficult for yourself!

333
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,890
I never imagined Director Sato

334
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,310
would know Chinese plays so well.

335
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,320
I only know a little.

336
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,070
I have another play here.

337
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,550
The hateful Japanese invaders are invading our territory.

338
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:33,090
People in the Min and Zhe regions are plunged into an abyss of misery.

339
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,120
We are the offspring of the Qi Family of the Ming Dynasty.

340
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:42,830
To protect our country, we must wipe out the Japanese invaders!

341
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,750
I've never heard of this play before.

342
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,160
But from the description, I know

343
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,540
it is about the Ming Dynasty's General Qi Jiguang

344
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,970
leading the Qi troops and people in the Zhe and Min region

345
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,980
to fight with the warriors of the Great Japanese Empire.

346
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:02,240
You also know about the Qi family troops fighting against the enemy?

347
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,170
Then I will be direct.

348
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,330
My Ming Yu Yue has prepared a new play.

349
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,620
It's called Song of Fighting the Japanese Invaders.

350
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,680
Today, it seems that performing it for you all

351
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,930
is the most appropriate thing to do.

352
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,340
How ridiculous!

354
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,140
Fighting the Japanese Invaders. Have you remembered the lyrics well?

355
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,870
Yes!

356
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,690
General Qi, you are absolutely right.

357
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,140
As the poem goes, "Since nobody lives forever, why not leave my loyalty to the history?"

358
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,480
The Japanese invaders have destroyed the lives of the people of the Ming Dynasty.

359
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,250
How can we stand by and do nothing?

360
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,490
We'd rather die in the frontier

361
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,740
and kill them all.

362
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,420
All because the Japanese invaders are savaging our country

363
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,280
without any constraints. We're all people of the Ming Dynasty,

364
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,860
and we've suffered so much from what they do. Along the way,

365
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,110
we see these Japanese invaders

366
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,480
rape and plunder, and our hatred toward them is rooted in our bones!

367

It looks like your position is clear.

368
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,280
You'd rather die than speak.

369
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,540

Where is Xiao Beichen?

371
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,490
Sato, a play without emotions won't touch the audience.

372
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,340
A play without reasons won't convince the audience.

373

Director Sato's soldiers weren't moving

in order to mislead us to think they aren't planning on sending out soldiers.
