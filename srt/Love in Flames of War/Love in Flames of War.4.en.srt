324
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,430
Don't you know?

325
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,610
Watch the door. I'll let Third Brother know.

326
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,200
- What?
- Keep a close watch!

327
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,710
Just me?

328
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,370
Lin Hangjing, you humiliated me in front of everyone at school.

329
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,970
To protect you, my brother cared nothing about my feelings.

330
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,200
It's time that you suffer today.

331
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,630
Who asked you to do this?

332
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,580
No need to hurry, Third Brother. You can thank us after it's done.

333
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,520
- Sister! Come here!
- Who's this?

334
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,010
Look at her skin! She has such nice skin!

335
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,690
Yeah.

336
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,470
Is she really being sold here to wash clothes?

337
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,930
Yes! That's what they said!

338
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,690
The girls have helped her change her clothes. Look!

339
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,930
What a pity.

340
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,000
Look at her face. And her tiny waist.

341
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And her skin.

342
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,490
Her skin is as soft as an egg without a shell.

343
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,270
She was born to be a beauty!

344
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,840
Sir, is there anyone who's been serving you? Let us know!

345
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,910
Why did you tie her with a rope?

346
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,310
Sir, you definitely have a tender heart towards girls.

347
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,670
She's new here.

348
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,930
She hasn't been educated yet. We don't want her to ruin your day.

349
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,980
Take her down now!

350
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,850
I'll take her.

351
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,900
Great. Great! Sir, you can go upstairs first.

352
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,100
Where's Hangjing?

353
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,910
Xiao Shuyi, speak up!

354
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,810
Don't ask me. I don't know anything.

355
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,800
My ancestor! Tell Third Brother the truth now!

356
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,730
Look how worried Third Brother is!

357
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,970
Xiao Shuyi, stop pretending. Where is she?

358
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,890
I'm telling you! If anything happens to Hangjing, even with our father present,

359
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,040
I will never forgive you!

360
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,460
How can anything happen to her?

361
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,270
Senior Brother Renliang said, we're just letting her do some hard work. She can come back after she suffers.

362
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:35,060
It's him!

363
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,530
Which Senior Brother Liang?

364
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,140
The heavy smoker?

365
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,750
He quit smoking a long time ago, okay?

366
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,550
My ancestor! Why did you get him involved?

367
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,100
He lives in the street nearby.

368
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,700
When I need someone to help, he's the one to ask.

369
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,030
Where did he send her?

370
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,580
He said he sent her to a high-end place.

371
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,640
Something called... Shu Yu.

372
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,470
Third Brother!

373
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,310
Do you have any idea what kind of place that is?

374
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,040
Third Brother!

375
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,040
Go inside.

376
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,060
Have a seat.

377
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,590
Nothing is more overwhelming than snow-white skin.

378
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,330
In the middle of the night, her beautiful shadow falls under the moonlight.

379
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,950
What a surprise.

380
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,350
I was just looking for fun, and I met such a beauty like you.

381
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,380
I know you're new here. It's okay.

382
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,970
I love new girls.

383
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,150
Wait a moment.

384
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,870
To tell you the truth, I'm the miss of the Xiao family.

385
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,680
If you know what you're doing, send me back home.

386
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,060
Otherwise, you can't afford the consequences.

387
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,520
Why is the lady of the Xiao household here to serve guests?

388
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:27,140
If you're really the lady of the Xiao family, I'll be the first master of the Xiao family.

389
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,340
Wait. That painting is the Court Ladies Adorned by Floral Ornament by Zhou Fang of the Tang Dynasty.

390
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,810
You know paintings?

391
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,300
Women of the Tang Dynasty loved the color red.

392
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:42,880
Empress Wu Zetian opened the chest to see her red dress. Yang Yuhuan was compared to the sweet dew on a rosy red flower.

393
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,800
So the six ladies in that painting

394
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,550
were adorned by floral patterns of red and black,

395
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,030
which is quite impressive.

396
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,920
Of course, in a place like this, there's no way this is the original.

397
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,010
This painting is just a fake one to make the place look artistic.

398
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,580
Who are you?

399
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,150
You bought a new girl today.

400
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,030
Where is she?

401
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,920
Wow. Which family are you from, Young Master?

402
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,640
You look unfamiliar. No wonder you don't know my rules here.

403
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,400
If you want a girl here, there's no need to fight for it.

404
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,740
I'll just take a few pieces of silver.

405
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,310
Security!

406
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,880
What are you up to? Looking for trouble?

407
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,250
If you send me back to the Xiao family, you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

408
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:43,570
And the Xiao family will thank you with a huge reward.

409
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,380
My car is parked downstairs.

410
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,060
Okay.

411
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,680
Wait.

412
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,240
You sure know how to play the game.

413
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,960
Pretending to be a lady from a prestigious family.

414
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,200
I've heard of Xiao Beichen from the Xiao family. He's got a lot of power in Beixin City.

415
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,470
If you're really someone from the Xiao family, how could you be trapped in a brothel without anyone looking for you?

416
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,930
Are you kidding me?

417
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,570
I...

418
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,040
Let go of me!

419
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,090
Third Master Xiao! He's really Third Master Xiao!

420
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,640
Help! Help!

421
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,460
Who are you? Get out!

422
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,500
Help!

423
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,770
Third Brother! Calm Down! Third Brother!

424
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,870
Third Brother! No!

425
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,590
Third Brother!

426
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,200
Third Brother, calm down.

427
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,240
Hangjing.

428
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,360
I'm beating you to death!

429
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,220
Bastard! You're such a bastard!

430
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,070
How come I've raised such a bastard like you!

431
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,800
I'm hitting you to death!

432
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,400
Commander!

433
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,650
Commander! Stop hitting him!

434
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,110
Don't be angry! It will ruin your health! What should we do then?

435
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,830
Commander! Stop hitting him!

436
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,230
You're so stubborn!

437
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,500
Why are you still standing there? Ask your dad to spare Third Brother!

438
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,180
Come on, now.

439
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,070
You bastard!

440
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,790
Come on.

441
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,840
Dad.

442
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,590
Don't hit him. It's all my fault.

443
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:04,210
Please punish me instead. Stop hitting Third Brother.

444
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,610
- Get lost!
- Dad! Dad!

445
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,340
- Stop hitting Third Brother!
- I'm hitting you to death today!

446
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,950
Such a bastard!

447
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:14,430
Seventh Aunt.

448
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,450
Let me try.

449
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,780
I'm hitting you to death!

450
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,790
Who is it?

451
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:34,730
Uncle Xiao, can I come in and speak a few words?

452
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,920
Third Brother!

453
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,300
Stop watching. Go back.

454
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,580
Uncle Xiao, please stop hitting him.

455
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,240
It's all my fault.

456
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,140
I wasn't supposed to be here. I'm sorry for making you so angry

457
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,200
and making trouble for the family.

458
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,290
Girl, don't say that.

459
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,760
It's Uncle Xiao's fault. I failed to educate my son.

460
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,660
I've raised such a bastard thing who knows no limits!

461
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,390
Uncle Xiao.

462
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:35,550
My father and I agreed that I'd stay with the Xiao family temporarily for three months.

463
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,570
Now the time is up.

464
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:42,720
Please let me return. I want to go back home.

465
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,430
No.

466
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,860
- How dare you speak?
- Stop it.

467
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:51,330
My living ancestor! Keep your mouth shut!

468
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,120
It's fine. Don't be angry.

469
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,180
Hangjing, it's not that I don't want you to return home.

470
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,220
It's because it's delayed by something on your father's side.

471
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,090
I think he can only come here to pick you up

472
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,930
after quite some time.

473
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,670
Uncle Xiao, what happened to my father?

474
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,850
Please don't hide the truth from me anymore.

475
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,100
Don't make random assumptions, okay?

476
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:24,890
Uncle Xiao, I know my father.

477
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,820
If there's really something delaying him, he'd definitely send me a message.

478
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,750
Just tell me. What happened?

479
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,960
My father is my only family in this world. Please.

480
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,220
Child, the thing is...

481
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,480
The truth is...

482
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,380
Warlord Cheng wants to prepare more money

483
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,480
to purchase equipment from the United States.

484
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,080
So he printed a lot of banknotes in private.

485
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,980
The commodity prices went up a lot.

486
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,760
For the benefit of the local people,

487
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,650
your father destroyed the molds and documents related to the banknotes without hesitation.

488
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:17,900
Back then, Warlord Cheng was entangled in a war with Chief Commander Zhang.

489
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,230
Warlord Cheng was so angry,

490
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,790
that he imprisoned your father.

491
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,700
Hangjing.

492
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,140
When he sent me here,

493
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,100
did this happen to him already?

494
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,180
Yes. But don't you worry.

495
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,440
I've used my network.

496
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,830
Although your father is in prison, he'll be taken good care of.

497
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,840
No.

498
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,390
I need to go back home.

499
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,420
Wait.

500
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,000
Hangjing, if you go now,

501
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,250
you won't be able to help your father, you'll make him worried instead.

502
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,440
This is a letter from your father. Read it first.

503
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,520
Dear daughter. I'm very pleased to know

504
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,310
that you've settled in the Xiao family. You work hard in your studies

505
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,070
and you're kind-hearted. I love you more than anyone.

506
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:45,170
Your father is free for now.

507
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:47,500
I'm lucky enough to have the commander taking care of me.

508
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,120
There's no risk of losing my life, so you needn't worry.

509
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,740
But I'm worried that someone will hurt you because of what I did.

510
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,460
So please don't come home yet. Please don't miss me too much.

511
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,670
Uncle Xiao, my father can't even see me.

512
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,680
Is he really okay?

513
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,270
How many years will he stay in prison?

514
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,550
According to the authorities, five years at least.

515
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,970
Five years?

516
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,080
That long...

517
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,700
Uncle Xiao, my father always had some health issues.

518
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,940
He always coughs and he needs to take medicine in time.

519
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,770
And because he's been sitting in front of his desk most of the time, his legs will suffer when seasons change.

520
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,580
He's in prison without anyone looking after him.

521
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,030
Is there any other way to help him get out of prison?

522
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,810
Girl, get up first.

523
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,930
Get up.

524
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,490
I know you're worried and upset now.

525
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,350
But you have to understand one thing.

526
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,810
Not only did your father block Warlord Cheng's road to fortune,

527
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,630
he also hindered the interests of many people.

528
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,760
So, your father being in prison

529
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,860
is actually saving his life by avoiding misfortunes.

530
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,480
Your father and I are sworn brothers.

531
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,740
Don't worry. I'll get everything sorted.

532
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,780
- I'll make sure your father is safe.
- But...

533
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,730
What your father worries about the most is you.

534
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,340
If you go, how can I keep my promise to him in the future?

535
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:37,900
He's right, Hangjing. Both Commander and I treat you like our own daughter.

536
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,460
This is your home. Stop saying you're going back.

537
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:46,100
Also, regarding this bastard,

538
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,000
you don't have to respond to him again.

539
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,720
I'm telling you! If you find more trouble,

540
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,740
I'm going to send Hangjing somewhere else!

541
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,480
Commander, please don't be angry.

542
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,990
What a thing that doesn't let me relax.

543
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,080
How's it going with sending Third Master to military school?

544
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,330
Hearing that Third Master is going to attend military school,

545
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,220
many schools are fighting for him.

546
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:36,270
We're rooted in the infantry. Have him go to a military academy.

547
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,860
Got it.

548
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,380
It's one problem after another these days.

549
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,900
The conflict between the premier and the president has not been resolved yet,

550
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,680
Xun Bianzi is taking his chance to cause an uproar in the capital.

551
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,570
The governor has ordered us

552
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,080
to reinforce our defense

553
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,110
in case any conflicts from above will affect the local regions as well.

554
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,070
I'll be quite busy within the army these days.

555
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,100
I will trouble you to watch over

556
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,930
the security of the family.

557
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:17,970
It's not trouble at all. It's my responsibility. Trust me, Commander.

558
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,120
- Can you see it clearly?
- Yes!

559
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:59,040
The eldest son of Xiao Haishan, Xiao Beichen.

560
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,600
Your family members all died by Xiao Haishan's gun.

561
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,610
Now it's time to get revenge.

562
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:16,120
Everyone, I hope you're willing to die for this task.

563
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:20,160
My master will help you as much as he can.

564
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,970
Yes.

565
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:43,230
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

566
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,370
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

567
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:53,550
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

568
00:43:53,550 --> 00:44:00,050
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

569
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:05,810
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

570
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:10,830
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

571
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:16,140
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this? ♫

572
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,970
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

573
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,210

♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

582
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,670
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

584
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:41,370
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
