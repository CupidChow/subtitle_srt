00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
What Eldest Brother says is correct.

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Whether they can win the bid or not,

167
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
It depends on the patience of the Japanese.

168
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,900
Third Brother, we can't convince the commander.

169
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,400
Do we really need to open up the bid and allow the Japanese to join?

170
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
It's only been half a year since the Jinan Massacre happened.

171
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,200
Has the country forgotten to see the Japanese as enemies?

172
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,500
Establishing a seaport is a Japanese regular business format.

173
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,100
It's different from the Japanese military's actions.

174
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,600
Deputy Commander made his objection once before, and Jin Cheng compromised.

175
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,000
If we object again, it would appear that we treat everyone as our enemy.

176
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,900
But Beixin is a critical location.

177
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,400
It's also the entry to Huabei.

178
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
If the railroad is built,

179
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,800
Huabei, Huanan, and Xibei, will be all connected.

180
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,200
To develop a port in such an important location,

181
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,600
the Japanese's goal is not as simple as improving their reputation.

182
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,400
Third Brother, what do you think?

183
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,700
The port must be developed, but we must keep our guard up against the Japanese.

184
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,200
Now the bidding has been handed over to us,

185
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,000
then let's find a proper reason to reasonably kick them out.

186
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,900
Let's use their own tricks against them.

187
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,200
Weiyi, you will be in charge of coordinating the bidding.

188
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
Zijun, regarding logistics and security,

189
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,700
- you will be in charge.
- Okay.

190
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,800
Shengchang.

191
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,600
You'll be investigating the backgrounds of all bidders, especially the Japanese.

192
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

193
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,600
Breaking news! Breaking news!

194
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Deputy Commander Xiao will be hosting the international bidding

195
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,000
for the Beixin Harbor soon!

196
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,500
- I'll take one copy.
- I'll take one copy, too.

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I will have to trouble you.

198
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,300
Third Master, you released the fabrics of the Chamber of Commerce that have been held.

199
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,000
Thank you.

200
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,800
Your goods were held because the officer at the port breached his duty.

201
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,000
I just did my job. It's not a big deal.

202
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Indeed. The port before

203
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,800
was chaotic in delivery and inspections.

204
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,600
Once the Beixin port is built,

205
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,800
everything will become much smoother.

206
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Talking about harbors, I heard there will be a domestic bidding process.

207
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,200
But why has it become an international bidding process, according to the newspaper?

208
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,400
The goal of building a harbor is to benefit the livelihood of people.

209
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,000
Other countries now have more advanced technology than we do.

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If we only accept bids from within the country,

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,400
I'm afraid it'll hold back the port's future development.

212
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
So that's what it is.

213
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Commander Xiao, you are looking ahead.

214
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,900
Director Sato, based on what you mentioned,

215
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,000
are you also interested in bidding?

216
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
In Beixin, the Yamato Chamber of Commerce

217
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
is only involved in business activities.

218
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,200
But we have developed an affection for this land.

219
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
We sincerely hope

220
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,000
we can be of help to Beixin's development.

221
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,200
In recent years, the Yamato Chamber of Commerce

222
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,200
has been very successful in its business.

223
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,200
The East Main Camp will of course welcome strong businesses

224
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,300
to put in their bid.

225
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,500
Thank you for thinking so highly of us.

226
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,800
We are just trying our luck.

227
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,400
I think this time, there will be many experts.

228

Director.

229
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,200
I didn't know you had a visitor, Director Sato.

230
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
It seems like I came at a bad time.

Long time no see! Have you been well?

233
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,200
So you two are old friends?

234
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,000
Then there's no need to introduce you.

235
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,300
Commander Xiao, you didn't know.

236
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,200
Miss Fengqi has been living in Tokyo all this time.

237

She has become a well-known film star.

238
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,200
But... she still misses her home.

Third Brother, please take good care of me.

Here, Third Brother. Please come and give your support.

242
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,900
Director Sato, I've got other things to do. I have to go.

Xiao Beichen. Eventually, one day,

244

I will give you a taste of losing your entire family

245
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
and having nothing.

246
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,700
Director, judging from the relationship between Miss Zheng and Xiao Beichen,

247
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,000
can we really use her?

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You don't understand women.

249

The more she loves, the more she hates.

250

Our most important mission now

is to obtain the rights to developing Beixin port.

254
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Cabinet Minister Hara Takashi called me many times,

255
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,200
and he pays a lot of attention to it.

256
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,000
The future Beixin port

257
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,300
is one of the doors for us to get to Huabei.

258
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
As long as we get the port,

259
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,200
Director, you will become the No.1 contributor to Cabinet Minister Hara Takashi.

260
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,200
Whether we succeed or not,

261
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:03,200
depends heavily on Xiao Beichen's attitude.

Shen Yanqing? Eldest Brother Shen is coming back?

What's so interesting about that? Hasn't he always worked for the newspapers?

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,360
- Come!
- Old Commander Xiao and I are old friends!

326
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,650
That's right. Let me introduce you.

327
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,350
This is my good friend, Boss Yang.

328
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,090
Boss Yang graduated from the department of architecture of Heidelberg University.

329
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,330
A few years ago, when the Haiyuan Earthquake happened,

330
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,420
everything was shattered to pieces.

331
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,620
But all the houses his company built survived!

332
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,180
Later on, he even gave money to help the people recover!

333
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,290
Boss Yang is such a kind person.

334
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,030
Boss Yu, you exaggerate.

335
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,410
Assistant Commander Xiao, I have long heard about you. I am Yang Wendao.

336
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,670
Thank you for joining us.

337
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,960
Shuyi, Shuyi.

338
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,890
My husband has joined the bidding this time, too.

339
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,440
Can you put in a word with your brother?

340
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,240
I'm sorry, I never participate in my brother's matters.

341
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,600
Shuyi, we were classmates!

342
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,740
Can't you help me?

343
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,940
Director Sato is here!

344
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,600
- Director.

345

346
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,730
- Deputy Commander Xiao.
- Director Sato.

347
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:28,960
It's quite lively today.

348
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,510
Yes. Please help yourself.

349
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,930
Dear friends from the press and partners,

350
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,330
welcome to Beixin, and welcome to the bidding conference for the Beixin Harbor development.

351
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,870
For this event, we have hired experts to be our scoring panel.

352
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,380
In a secret ballot, they scored the proposals that were submitted.

353
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,320
Now, I will announce the candidates that passed the first round.

Edward Architecture from the U.K.

359
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:37,890
Our standard this time will be fair and equal.

360
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,570
All rounds will strictly follow the rules.

361
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,300
For this, we have invited influential press from all over China

362
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:51,640
to oversee the process. Thank you all for taking the time to come here today.

363
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,200
Let's welcome Chief Editor Yu from Da Gong Bao.

Chief Editor Zhou from Hui Bao.

And Chief Editor Shen from Eastern Times.

366
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,080
Chief Editor Shen from Eastern Times.

367
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,750
He's here!

368
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,820
I'm sorry, we're late.

369
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,430
Let's welcome Chief Editor Shen from Eastern Times, and his wife.

370
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:34,500
Head Editor Shen, hello.

371
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,550
Boss Yu has been waiting for you upstairs.

372
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,950
- I'll be right back.
-Thank you for coming tonight.

373
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:43,310
Caroline?

374
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,110
My goodness, it really is you! Do you remember me?

375
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,630
We met at Guchi's dinner banquet in Paris.

376
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,180
David!

377
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,800
Yeah!

378
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:38,730
It looks like Xiao Beichen is even more interested in this Madam Shen.

379
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,160
Hangjing! You've come back!

380
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:54,510
Sir, have you mistaken me for someone else?

381
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,640
Deputy Commander Xiao, is there a misunderstanding?

382
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,840
This is Head Editor Shen's wife.

383
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,580
She is Shen Corporation's Sheng Hanjun.

384
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,370
Hello, Deputy Commander Xiao.

385
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,520
This is our first meeting. I am Sheng Hanjun.

386
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,150
Third Brother, the banquet hasn't even started yet, and you're drunk?

387
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,750
I'm sorry, everyone. Deputy Commander was so happy, he drank a little too much!

388
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,270
Don't mind him. Keep enjoying yourselves!

389
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,700
- Continue enjoying yourselves!
- Let's go sit over there.
- Okay.

390
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,120
Third Brother. Third Brother! Everyone is watching!

391
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,310
Whatever it is, you can save it for later.

[Huaxing Hotel]

393
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,590
Sir Xiao.

394
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,690
Hangjing, you've come back?

395
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,320
Sir Xiao, you've mistaken me for someone else.

396
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,410
I'll introduce myself again.

397
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,580
My Chinese name is Sheng Hanjun.

398
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,520
Since you've come back,

399
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,670
why won't you admit that you're Hangjing?

400
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,180
Sir Xiao, I can forgive you for mistaking me for someone else.

401
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,680
But that doesn't mean you can repeatedly offend me.

402
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,740
Did you know?

403
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:39,480
During that fire,

404
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,950
when I found your earrings,

405
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,600
my heart died then.

406
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:54,720
But even so, I held onto one shred of hope that you were still alive.

407
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:58,710
That's how I stayed alive until today.

408
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,880
Hangjing,

409
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,590
I shouldn't have suspected you and hurt you.

410
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,380
Since you've returned,

411
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,000
don't leave again. Okay?

412
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,970
Please watch your behavior!

413
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,190
You are offending your good friend's wife!

414
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,850
Hangjing!

415
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,750
I was wrong.

416
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,790
I was wrong.

417
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,590
Please let go!

418
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,220
Let go!

419
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,330
Beichen! Calm down!

420
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,720
What are you doing?

421
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,610
Hanjun, are you all right?

422
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,420
I'm fine.

423
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,180
Shen Yanqing, I've treated you as my own brother since childhood!

424
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,230
What have you done in these past years?

425
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,700
I'll ask you one more time! Who is she?!

426
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,990
She is my wife!

427
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,020
Your sister-in-law!

428
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,840
Yanqing! Are you okay?

429
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,540
I'm fine.

430
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,690
Sir Xiao! Stop acting insane!

431
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:19,510
You've already threatened our safety!

432
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:23,000
I will apply for security from the British Embassy.

433
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,490
If you continue bothering us,

434
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:29,150
I will definitely sue you!

435
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:35,110
Hanjun, let's go.

436
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,160
Third Brother.

437
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,120
Yanqing's wife looks the same as Hangjing?

438
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,870
Are you being foolish again, Big Fool Xu?

439
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,530
I saw it with my own eyes, Seventh Aunt.

440
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,770
No matter how silly I am, I can see that much clearly.

441
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,490
They were all there. You can ask them!

442
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,340
Seventh Aunt, he's right.

443
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:00,200
They really look very similar. But their personalities and behavior are entirely different.

444
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,260
Then... how is Third Master doing?

445
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,930
He's locked himself up in his room. No one can get him to open the door.

446
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,470
Not good. I must go and take a look.

447
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,200
At this time, let him calm down.

448
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,380
Are you all right?

449
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,160
You've already threatened our safety!

450
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,640
I will request security from the British Embassy!

451
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,040
If you continue to bother us,

452
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,620
I will definitely sue you!

453
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,570
Just who are you?

454
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,170
- Deputy Commander Xiao.
- Come in.

455
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,260
This is the background information on all the bidders.

456
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:44,940
I also had someone investigate Sheng Corporation and Sheng Hanjun.

457
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:48,590
Sheng Hanjun is the only granddaughter of the President of Sheng Cooperation, Sheng Tian.

458
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,920
Sheng Tian has always raised her as his successor.

459
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,660
She was taught international business since childhood and knows English and German.

460
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,660
When she was ten, she became a student at St. Paul's Girls' School.

461
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,050
Her grades were excellent. Before meeting Shen Yanqing, she lived in Europe.

462
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:05,830
Four years ago, she married Shen Yanqing.

463
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,300
There were many newspaper reports on their marriage.

464
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,960
There's a photo of them with Sheng Tian, too.

465
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,630
Not long after they got married, Shen Yanqing was transferred to Shanghai as Eastern News' Head Editor.

466
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,550
Sheng Hanjun came with him.

467
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,620
She invested in a few enterprises for pleasure, including shipping and antiques.

468
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,400
She is definitely a rich person with nothing to do.

469
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,050
I also have news on her investments.

470
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,190
Also, the investigation in Europe is ongoing.

471
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,130
But since it's overseas, I'm afraid it'll take some more time.

Come, take this.

475
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,690
Do you really think Madam Shen looks that much like Hangjing?

476
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,610
Even Third Master can't tell them apart.

477
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:02,830
In this world, there are many people who look alike.

478
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:07,200
Perhaps he just misses Hangjing too much.

479
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,990
I feel like there's something strange about this.

480
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,580
I must take a look for myself.

481
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,640
Now that Shen Yanqing has returned, shouldn't we

482
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,250
invite him over for dinner?

483
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,250
This Madam Shen, Sheng Hanjun, I also want to see her.

484
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,420
I'll arrange for it.

487
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,370
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

488
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:07,600
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night? ♫

489
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:14,050
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

490
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:19,770
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

491
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,900
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

492
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:30,130
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this? ♫

493
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:37,100
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

494
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:44,150
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

495
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,780
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

496
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,390
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

497
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:01,060
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

498
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,670
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

499
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,300
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

500
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,010
♫ If you still remember, when the next time
a shooting star passes, ♫

501
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:23,600
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

502
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,260
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

503
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:34,820
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

504
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:44,730
♫ If you still remember, when the next time
a shooting star passes, ♫

505
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:55,820
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
