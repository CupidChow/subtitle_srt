Are you saying you don't agree?

23
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,580
Shuyi, we are really unsuitable.

What's bad about me?

25
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,760
This is not a question of whether you are good or not.

Are you just like those friends who look down on me?

I don't look down on you.

28

It's just that I have always regarded you as my younger sister.

29

When a man rejects a woman, he always says that he only regards her as a younger sister.

Why are you using this same old excuse?

Enough, Shuyi. Stop throwing a tantrum.

Shen Yanqing, you don't have any feelings for me?

Third Brother, many students are protesting at the cluster of Japanese companies these days.

56
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,460
And they've gathered in many places in Beixin.

57
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,650
Obviously, the protest is organized and intentional.

58
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,370
They definitely won't stop in just one or two days.

59
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,350
The Japanese navy shot citizens in Changsha.

60
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,670
The students are doing this to show their support for Changsha.

61
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,220
Their call has received responses from across the country.

62
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,500
They also secretly called for the Education Council and Chamber of Commerce

63
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,330
and people working for companies in Japan to go on strike and boycott Japanese products.

64
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,220
Now businesses with the Japanese have almost stopped.

65
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,520
But Governor Jin once ordered that the Northern Territories have to provide preferential policies for foreign businesses.

66
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,620
I'm worried that these Japanese businessmen will report it to the governor.

67
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,500
Third Brother, shall we give an order to disperse these students?

68
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,160
The Japanese committed violence in public and killed our people.

69
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
Do we have any reasons to stop them from pleading for the people?

In fact, I do respect the leaders of the protest this time.

They're safeguarding our territories and fighting for our sovereignty.

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,930
I'll find that person.

161
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,080
Rest assured, Third Brother. I'll reveal the whole truth.

162
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,460
You can take good care of Third Sister-in-law, and yourself too.

163
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,960
You don't need to worry about anything else.

164
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Here, Hangjing. Take the medicine.

165
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,810
Hangjing, the hearts of a mother and her child are connected. Seventh Aunt knows how painful it is for you.

166
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,340
You need to take care and get better.

167
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,080
And you'll have a baby again very soon.

168
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,980
No.

169
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,630
My baby is gone.

170
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,780
As the old saying goes, a child that has a destined bone with its parents

171
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,760
will come back to find its mother again.

172
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,150
So no matter what happens, you need to survive this.

173
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,230
Really?

174
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,990
The child will come back again?

175
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,690
Yes. If the baby knows you love it so much,

176
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,850
it will definitely come back to you soon

177
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,210
and have you as its mother again.

178
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,890
Let Seventh Aunt accompany you tonight, okay?

179
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,560
Uncles. Please sit down.

180
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:49,250
Beichen, if it's not because Wei Zhenliang has some sort of unusual move,

181
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,400
we wouldn't call you

182
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,680
back to the East Main Camp.

183
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,040
Right, Third Master. Have you settled everything at home?

184
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,570
Don't worry about it. How's the situation going?

185
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,050
Deputy Commander, please take a look.

186
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,160
Wei Zhenliang's troops used to station in the northwest.

187
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,700
Recently, they've been looking to the Japanese as their support and expanding their forces.

188
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,480
And their ambition has become even bigger.

189
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,720
Especially Beixin's ice-free harbor,

190
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,950
they're very eager to take over.

191
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,810
They not only re-arranged their military manpower,

192
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,900
they even delivered 50 units of cannons.

193
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,470
They use military exercises as an excuse, we should be prepared.

194
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,690
Their current location is facing our troops at Jin Yang and

195
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,830
Qin Guan; two defense lines. We need to be prepared.

196
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,480
We have got to make sure we're in battle mode.

197
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,680
That's right.

198
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:04,540
You skipped lunch again? You eat less than mosquitos these days. Have you found any clues?

199
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,340
I verified with Jin Xiang and Doctor Sun. All of the IV fluid they brought were sealed.

200
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Also, it was opened right in front of them.

201
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,620
I wonder how those abortion medicines went into the fluid?

202
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,790
That's right.

203
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,050
All the bottles are made out of glass, and they're all sealed, how did it go inside?

204
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,270
It's a glass bottle.

205
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,300
What's the matter?

206
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,690
Look!

207
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,000
Did you see the little needle mark?

208
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,340
Here.

209
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,090
As you all know, Third Madam lost her child.

210
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,860
After careful investigation, someone in this house rigged the IV fluid.

211
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,060
Someone rigged the IV bottle? It can't be.

212
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,420
How is it possible?

213
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,390
That's why I want to know between 3:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. that day,

214
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,620
other than Jin Xiang, what were you guys doing?

215
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,340
I didn't do anything. I was in the kitchen.

216
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,400
Think carefully! Tell me one by one.

217
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I went out to get a procedure done early in the morning.

218
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,100
I didn't come back until evening. Gatekeeper can prove that.

219
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,030
Fourth Lady has not been in a good mood these days. She locked herself in the room.

220
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,560
I was with her in the room.

221
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,360
How about you? What're you thinking?

222
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,920
That day, when I got a break,

223
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,730
I went out to gamble.

224
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,770
Hu Sanwan from Dong Mianhua alley can prove that.

225
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,670
How dare you sneak out to gamble?

226
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,750
Seventh Madam. Young Master Mo. Young Master Xu.

227
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:03,040
I took a nap in the room,

228
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,370
I've no alibi.

229
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,420
But I can use my entire family's lives to be collateral, it's not me.

230
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,550
Third Young Madam treated me so well,

231
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,810
I should give her my gratitude, why would I harm her baby?

232
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,290
Lift her up.

233
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,180
Come.

234
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,310
Next one.

235
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,680
That day, I was making Osmanthus Jelly in the kitchen for Third Young Madam.

236
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,930
Nanny Liu and Nanny Jiang can be my alibi.

237
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,850
That's right. I can confirm that.

238
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,860
Three of us were in the kitchen that day.

239
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,180
She delivered the Osmanthus Jelly right after 3:30 p.m.

240
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,140
After she left, we stayed in the kitchen and didn't go anywhere.

241
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,180
Next one.

242
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,760
After eating time, I was cleaning the dishes in the kitchen.

243
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,370
They can be my alibi.

244
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,460
That's right. I can confirm that.

245
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,130
My mother was sick, I wasn't in the house that day. I was taking care of my mother.

246
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,040
Miss Fengqi, will Young Master Mo find out I did that?

247
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,450
Your statement was flawless.

248
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,230
How will they find out?

249
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,430
But they've already found out the syringe hole.

250
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:13,470
If they found out, what should I do?

251
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,990
Even if they found out,

252
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,240
you should know what to do.

253
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,550
Don't forget, you're not done with your performance.

254
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,580
[Sales Contract]

255
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:33,950
Isn't this my sister's sales contract?

256
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,570
You need to ask your gambling-addicted father.

257
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:44,850
I helped your father pay for his debt.

258
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,470
Your father gave me your sister as a guarantee.

259
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,710
Get up.

260
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,440
If you follow all my directions,

261
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,460
I'll return this sale contract to you.

262
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,180
If you don't want to work with me,

263
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,110
I'll sell your sister to the brothel.

264
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,070
By then, don't blame me for that.

265
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,200
Lady, just eat a little bit.

266
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
If you carry on like that, it's bad for your body.

267
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,300
I said I don't want to eat.

268
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,700
Lady, I heard Seventh Aunt said

269
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,100
Young Master Shen is leaving Beixin in a few days.

270
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,800
Will... Will you really not send him off?

271
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
Why would I do that?

272
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,000
But you've been waiting for him.

273
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,600
His doesn't love me.

274
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
It will be shameful if I go.

275
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
You go get busy.

276
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
What's the matter? What's the purpose of your visit?

277
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm leaving. I just wanted to say goodbye.

278
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,190
So soon?

279
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm done with what I need to do.

280
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Also, I heard about what had happened in your family.

281
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Lately, you've been busy at work.

282
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,300
Seventh Aunt told me that you haven't been home in so many days.

283
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,200
No matter what happened,

284
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,000
you need to take care of yourself; don't exhaust yourself.

285
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,430
I don't even know what tiredness is.

286
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Every night, no matter how exhausted,

287
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,800
whenever I think of that child, I feel like I owe him everything.

288
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,620
Losing a child is the biggest pain for parents.

289
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,800
You and Sister-in-law need time to recuperate.

290
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,300
That's why you shouldn't increase your mental burden.

291
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,000
You'll definitely have another child in the future.

292
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
You will love and take care of them by then.

293
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,300
The string in your heart,

294
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,800
don't stretch it too far.

295
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,400
Thank you, Eldest Brother Shen.

296
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,900
Report!

297
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,500
Instructor Du.

298
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,200
Perfect timing. Let me introduce you.

299
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,700
This is Shen Yanqing, Brother Shen. We grew up together.

300
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,800
This is Ying Army Independence Regiment Team Captain,

301
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,200
he was also my mentor at school, Du Heng, Captain Du.

302
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,400
Sir Shen.

303
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,200
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

304
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,600
You're both Beichen's teacher and his friend.

305
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,400
Beichen is very lucky to have a regiment commander like you.

306
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,900
Thank you for your compliment, Sir Shen.

307
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,000
Beichen, I'll be on my way.

308
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,300
Okay. This way.

309
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,000
Eldest Brother Shen, take care.

310
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,700
Take care.

311
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,800
- Old Li, see him off for me.
- Yes, Sir.

312
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,200
Please.

313
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,520
This is the plan for sending soldiers to Jinyang Pass devised by the three-army joint garrison.

314
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,800
Lady, why are you here alone?

315
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,000
It's cold outside. Let me help you get inside.

316
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,300
Jin Xiang.

317
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,800
Look at the moon. It's a full moon.

318
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,600
Yes, My lady.

319
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,000
Lady, I'll check in the kitchen to see if your medicine is ready.

320
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,200
Please sit here and wait for me.

321
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,260
My baby...

322
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,700
You're in Heaven now.

323
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,000
Will you blame Mother for not protecting you well?

324
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,200
Poor little master. I'll burn more paper money for you.

325
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,600
Please find a good family for yourself on the other side of the world.

326
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,400
I shouldn't have kept this a secret from Young Third Madam.

327
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,700
Don't blame me! Don't blame me!

328
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
Young Third Madam!

329
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,600
Xiu'er, what are you doing?

330
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,700
I... nothing.

331
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,400
I heard everything you said.

332
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,400
Young Third Madam, it's not that I don't want to tell you. I just don't have the courage.

333
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,800
What do you know? Tell me everything!

334
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,800
It's... It's Third Master.

335
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
What did Third Master do?

336
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,800
Tell me!

337
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,200
It was Third Master who asked Doctor Sun to infuse aborticide to you.

338
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,000
I heard it.

339
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I really didn't have the courage to say it. So I can only burn some paper money for the poor child.

340
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,100
Young Third Madam!

341
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,200
Young Third Madam...

342
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,700
The child is gone.

343
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,800
There's nothing you can do to change Third Master's mind.

344
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,000
I think you should just... turn a blind eye to it.

345
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

346
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,700
Nor will I hurt the child. I accept the child.

347
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,900
Lady, I heard from Xiao Rongzi

348
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,200
that the war is about to erupt at the borders.

349
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,900
Third Master has been staying at the East Main Camp all these days.

350
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,600
Lady, but Third Master said

351
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,800
that he will come and visit you whenever he gets a chance.

352
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,900
Lady, you have to take good care of your body

353
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,100
for the sake of Third Master caring about you so much.

354
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,900
Jin Xiang.

355
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,100
No matter where I end up being,

356
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
you have to be happy.

357
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Lady, why are you saying this all of a sudden?

358
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,360
No matter where you go, I'll follow you there.

359
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,170
I know.

360
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
It's fine. You can go back to your work.

361
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,300
Let me stay on my own for a while.

362
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,500
Okay. Have a good rest.

363
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,400
In the future, there will be no boundary between us.

364
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,200
And no marriage agreement. We'll take care of each other

365
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
and stay together for the rest of our life.

[Seventh Aunt,]

[I'm sorry for leaving the Xiao Residence without a farewell.]

368
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,600
Take a look at these two copies of the budget for equipment and supplies.

369
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,200
Okay.

370
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
Reporting!

371
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Come in.

372
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,500
Deputy Commander, Young Third Madam is missing!

373
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,800
- Third Brother.
- What did you say?

374
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,400
Don't panic yet. What happened exactly?

375
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,800
We can't find her anywhere in the residence. Her personal maid Jin Xiang doesn't know where she went, either.

376
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,300
Seventh Madam already sent people to look for her.

377
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,000
We found out that a driver from Xinxing Car Dealer picked up a lady outside the back door of the Xiao Residence.

378
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,200
It's very likely to be Young Third Madam.

379
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,600
It is said that she got off the car at Jiangcang Hostel on Lindong Road, near the pier.

380
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,600
Miss Fengqi, we've arranged everything according to your request.

381
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,700
- Well done. Off you go.
- Yes.

That side! Hurry up!

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Pay attention to the direction of the wind!

387
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,200
- Quickly!
- Follow along!

388
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,400
Reporting to Commander. The fire already started when we arrived.

389
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,000
We're trying our best to fight the fire. But we didn't find Young Madam.

390
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,460
There's not enough water! Get some more!

391
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,020
Hangjing. Hangjing.

- Third Brother.
- Hangjing!

00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,250
- Hangjing!
- Third Brother, you can't go! Third Brother!

394
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,510
- Hangjing!
- Third Brother! It's too dangerous!

- Third Brother!

No. Hangjing!

403

Wake up, Third Master. Don't scare me. Wake up!

404
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,940
Wake up, Third Brother! Don't scare me!

Open your eyes and look at me, okay?

406
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:11,140
Last night, at midnight, Wei Zhenliang's forces launched a general attack.

407
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,210
They've already broken the first line of defense in Jinyang.

408
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,630
We're holding on to the second line of defense.

409
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:21,230
Weiyi, do we need to let the Deputy Commander know of this situation?

410
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,560
Uncles, you know what's going on with Third Brother recently.

411
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,350
Let's not bother him if it's something we can resolve by ourselves.

412
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:29,820
His baby and his wife are both gone.

413
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,530
How can anyone possibly get through it?

414
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,960
So let's give Third Brother more time to rest.

415
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,830
Okay. We'll do as you said, Weiyi.

416
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,340
Now Regiment Commander Sun and Xu

417
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,400
have sent two infantry troops to counterattack them.

418
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,340
You two can just stay with Third Master

419
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,550
to get through this difficult time.

420
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,480
Then we'll have to bother you, Uncles,

421
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,400
- to handle the military matters.
- Okay.

422
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,820
Third Master, you're finally awake.

423
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,980
You've been in a coma for quite a few days. We're all worried about you.

424
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,250
Seventh Aunt, where's Hangjing?

425
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,390
Third Brother, why are you doing this?

426
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,720
Yes, you are completely smitten with Lin Hangjing.

427
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,230
But she's never been devoted to you.

428
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,100
You can even accept her child, even though you don't know who the father is.

429
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,920
But what about her? Has she ever been nice to you?

430
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,360
Shuyi!

431
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,820
Shuyi, don't say it.

432
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,260
I have to say it!

433
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,470
This ungrateful woman doesn't deserve your sad feelings for her!

434
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,420
- She's disloyal and unpure. She doesn't deserve you!
- Shut up!

435
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,650
Fourth Lady, how can you make such a baseless accusation?

436
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,320
My Lady has never been disloyal to Third Master. Her baby

437
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
- is Third Master's!
- You're still arguing over it!

438
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,330
- She got that baby because of her affair with...
- No!

439
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,430
The night before Lady left,

440
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,430
she was with Third Master.

441
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,770
How can you say that the baby is not Third Master's?

442
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,330
What did you say?

443
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,090
After Old Master passed away,

444
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,270
My Lady had been mourning for her father by fulfilling filial duties.

445
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,180
It's true that she stayed in Tingxiang Garden.

446
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,590
But that night, you got drunk.

447
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,480
And My Lady was worried.

448
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,890
So she came here.

449
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,320
The next morning, I asked Nanny Liu to prepare breakfast for the two of you.

450
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,860
Yes, Third Master. Everything Jin Xiang said was true.

451
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,520
She did ask me to do that.

452
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,510
- Third Brother, do you know that this baby...
- There's no need to say anything.

453
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:01,900
Third Master, if you still don't believe in me,

454
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,230
I have more proof here.

455
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,970
This is a list of names that my lady came up with for the unborn little master.

456

00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,970
However, Hangjing suffered the pain of losing my beloved father.

476
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,460
There is no longer any hope in my life, and I have shed all of my tears.

477
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,390
Please forgive me for leaving without saying goodbye.

478
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,730
As for Third Brother,

479
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,910
I wish we had never met each other.

480
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,190
I hope we can be forever be separated from now on,

481
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,720
and never see each other again.

482
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,390
♫  How am I supposed to blossom when I'm wounded and hurt  ♫

483
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:34,270
♫  The transient memory wipes out my hopes  ♫

484
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:41,430
♫  And buries my heart in the abyss  ♫

485
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:58,860
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

486
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:04,100
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫

487
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,290
♫ Who is watching the galaxy in the summer night ♫

488
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:15,670
♫ Who remembers a shooting star going by in a moment? ♫

489
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:21,530
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

490
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:26,560
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

491
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,790
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

492
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:39,030
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

493
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:45,950
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

494
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:51,420
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

495
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,170
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

496
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,740
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

497
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:08,460
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

498
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:13,960
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

499
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,660
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

500
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:25,360
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky

501
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:30,870
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

502
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:36,420
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

503
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:46,410
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

504
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:56,940
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
