- Get off me!

323
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,890
What's going on?

324
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,220
Seventh Aunt, those people are outrageous.

325
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,010
No, I'm getting off to see what's going on.

326
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,430
Shuyi, don't get yourself into trouble.

327
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,350
Hangjing, what are you doing?

328
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,720
I want to go and see what's going on too.

329
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,050
- Get off me!
- Be careful!

330
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,040
Get out of the way.

331
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,540
Go back!

332
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,950
Let me go!

333
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:34,850
- Move back.
- The two of you, get back in the car.

334
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,030
Madam, my father is selling me to the brothel.

335
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,730
It's a horrible place. I don't want to go back.

336
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,370
Get up first.

337
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:47,480
How dare you force this girl in such broad daylight?

338
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,110
This Madam, we are not forcing her at all.

339
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,510
We made a deal. She was sold to us.

340
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,370
It's all written on the paper.

341
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:59,950
This is her father's fingerprint.

342
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,290
Stop there!

343
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,890
This is Seventh Madam from the Xiao family.

344
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,030
Don't get close.

345
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,910
Move away.

346
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,350
What's the matter?

347
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,690
Madam, please forgive us. We didn't recognize you.

348
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,940
The car Fengqi got you is at the back of the alley. You need to hurry.

349
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,340
Shuyi, thank you.

350
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,630
Don't thank me. I'm not helping you. I'm helping my brother.

351
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,420
Don't ever come back after you leave.

352
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,220
Hurry.

353
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,930
Zizheng.

354
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,220
Fine. I will pay you the money.

355
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,680
Do not bully her again.

356
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,830
We won't.

357
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,600
Give them the money.

358
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,280
I— This—

359
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,550
You haven't scrammed yet?

360
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,900
Thank you, Seventh Madam.

361
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,280
Here. This is for you.

362
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,590
Take care of yourself. Go now.

363
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,950
Thank you, Seventh Madam.

364
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,450
Disperse, disperse.

365
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,540
- Disperse.
- Disperse.

366
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,110
What a morning.

367
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,870
Where is Hangjing?

368
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,510
I don't know. She was here just now.

369
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:59,120
♫ The life is full of hardship ♫

370
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:05,240
Third Master, Zhao's troupe of Ming Yu Yue is very prestigious in Beixin. Their performance is beautiful.

371
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,160
I have taken the opportunity to present my opera group to you.

372
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,890
It's very exotic.

373
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:21,490
Third Master, I'm flattered. Farewell, My Concubine is a well-known story of a long history.

374
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:25,710
It's a story taken from Qian Jin Ji of Kunqu Opera.

375
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:28,420
It is a show done by many famous artists.

376
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,210
I may have embarrassed myself by presenting it to you.

377
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,980
It seems you know quite a lot about opera.

378
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,280
Your performers are nearly as good as our opera artists.

379
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,540
I'm flattered.

380
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,050
Actually, the reason I've invited you here is to make an apology to you.

381
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,980
Last time at the White Cloud Crossing Pier,

382
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,260
my man, Yoshida had some misunderstandings with you.

383
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,500
I beg your forgiveness.

384
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,440
Second, I also want to thank you.

385
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,600
Japanese Chamber of Commerce now has settled in Beixin.

386
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,670
Our business has been going well

387
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,810
thanks to your help.

388
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,900
You don't need to thank me. It's an order from the governor.

389
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,940
The governor made an order to

390
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,570
open the entire Zhibei region for trade.

391
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,390
Then both you and Governor Jin have my gratitude.

392
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,330
You're welcome.

393
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:43,150
Deputy Commander, there has been an incident at the residence.

394
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,380
Zizheng, I didn't expect Fengqi would ask you.

395
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,260
I will take responsibility for my own decision. You can go.

396
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:10,490
No one can help you now. You finally got yourself out.

397
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,540
Do you want to be caught and brought back?

398
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,500
But I don't want you to take risks again.

399
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,290
My job is to take you to the south safely.

400
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:27,570
When we get there, I will leave you, even if you don't ask me to.

401
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,700
Show me your pass.

402
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,840
It seems Xiao Beichen has sealed off all the exits.

403
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,810
We can only go somewhere else for now.

404
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,080
We will leave Beixin when things quiet down.

405
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,940
Beichen.

406
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:18,470
How did it go? Did you find her?

407
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,630
Where have you hidden Hangjing?

408
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,180
Third Brother, what are you talking about?

409
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,930
I was with Seventh Aunt when we found out she had gone.

410
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,340
Tell me the truth now!

411
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,740
I don't know anything!

412
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,300
Bring him!

413
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,560
Miss!

414
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,570
You said you would take all the responsibility. You have to save me!

415
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:50,710
You are the man who...

416
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,440
Shuyi, you set it up?!

417
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,340
What do you say about that?

418
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,980
That's right. I let her leave.

419
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,150
But even if I didn't help her, her heart left long ago.

420
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,190
Third Brother, I have had enough of you losing your mind over this woman.

421
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:14,920
She doesn't care about you at all. She wanted to leave herself.

422
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,070
I'm warning you again. Mind your own business.

423
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,630
Where is she?

424
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,060
I don't know.

425
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:29,400
I won't tell you even if I know! Even if you hit me, I won't tell you a word!

426
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,320
Beichen!

427
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,960
Shuyi is your sister!

428
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,400
Xiao Shuyi, what's wrong with you?

429
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,370
Why are you doing this to your brother?

430
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,430
Tell us! Where is Hangjing?

431
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,440
I really don't know.

432
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,080
I just got her a car to help her leave here.

433
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,070
With whom?

434
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:52,390
Mu Zizheng.

435
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,550
- Beichen.
- Third Brother.

436
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,510
Get up. Move it.

437
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,890
Faster!

438
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,700
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

439
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,910
♫ Who is staring at the moving flowers? ♫
