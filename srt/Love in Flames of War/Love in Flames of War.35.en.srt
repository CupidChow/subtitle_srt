Deputy Commander, please look through the documents that were organized today.

22
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,420
You are knocking off from work now?

23
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,560
It's really punctual.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,890
Deputy Commander, you work overtime every day, you're too diligent.

25
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:57,200
But I've said before that I never work overtime.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,310
If I don't leave now, I will miss David's birthday banquet.

Caroline, are you having fun here tonight?

30
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,290
- Yes, of course, David. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

31
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,600
You are the queen of parties. Why are you so quiet?

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,160
You still say that? Last time, you insisted that I dance all night.

33
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,570
So all parties that you hold in the future, I’ll only see and not dance.

34
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,330
I've long heard about Madam Shen's outstanding dancing.

35
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,120
I really want to catch a glimpse of her style.

36
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,730
David, you really have high honor.

37
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:28,240
You even invited Deputy Commander Xiao.

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,310
Deputy Commander Xiao, I'm very honored that you could come.

39
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,650
David came all the way to Beixin to participate in the bidding.

40
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,960
Then, I naturally have to do my best as the landlord.

Madam Shen, don't tell me you're not entertaining the birthday boy?

42
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,690
Yes, Madam Shen, don't decline.

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,720
Caroline, please.

44
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,070
Okay, David. I'm doing it for

45
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,860

Sheng Hanjun learned ballroom dancing since young and speaks English and German.

49
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,450
When she turned ten years old, she entered an elite girl school called Saint Paul Girls School in Britain to study.

50
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,510
Her grades were excellent.

51
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,350
Bravo.

52
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,970

Great! Great!

56
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Deputy Commander, why are you here?

57
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,660
I came out to get some fresh air.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,890
I didn't expect that your dancing would be really quite good.

59
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,740
You all see it as quite good,

60
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,890
but you all don't know how much suffering I've gone through behind it.

61
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,480
You see. This

62
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,520
is when I was learning ballet

63
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,780
and you don't know how much blood I had on my big toe.

64
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,950
And here, this thick layer is all calluses.

65
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,600
And this is even worse.

66
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,810
Last time, when I was performing at school,

67
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,520
I didn't expect the floor had shards of glass that weren't cleaned properly.

68
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,600
At that time, I just stepped on it.

69
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,840
You wanted to avoid me,

70
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,780
so you keep getting yourself injured.

71
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,020
Deputy Commander Xiao, there you are again.

72
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,980
Deputy Commander Xiao, you are...

73
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,450
Dance.

74
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,830
Okay.

75
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,040
Deputy Commander Xiao, you really are drunk.

76
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,150
You should go back and rest.

77
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,510
I'll wait for you.

78
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,530
I'll wait for the day you decide to voluntarily come and find me.

79
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,090
Come in.

80
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,460
Ms. Fengqi, over this period we kept sending people to engage the maids at the Shen residence.

81
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,160
According to what they said, Sheng Hanjun and Shen Yanqing are a married couple.

82
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,810
And they even have a child.

83
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,190
Could it be that this is really a coincidence?

84
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,390
Then, what should we do for the next step?

85
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,090
My sixth sense is correct for sure.

86
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,710
That woman is definitely Lin Hangjing.

87
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,980
Continue to follow her.

88
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,410
I don't believe...

89
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,240
that acting as another person

90
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,930
can have no loopholes at all.

91
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,230
Old Mo, let's drink at Ming Yu Yue tonight.

92
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,100
This second round is about to start. If we still don't go,

93
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,780
we won't be able to go in ten to fifteen days.

94
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,850
Don't forget.

95
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,200
Tonight, we're eating with Boss Bai.

96
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,960
- I guarantee that you'll drink enough.
- Boss Bai hasn't given up?

97
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,580
You say, earlier if not for the fight to help Commander get his salary,

98
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,980
he kept reaching out to us overtly and covertly.

99
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,100
How? Now interested in our Beixin port's project.

100
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,670
So this time he moved out Seventh Uncle.

101
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,780

103

- Let's go.
- Let's go. We cannot be late today.

104
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,360
This round of drinks could be difficult.

105
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,060
Third Brother, I'm counting on you tonight.

106
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,930
A blood battle again.

107
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,750
What are you afraid of? Third Brother's alcohol tolerance is good.

108
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,930
Ms. Sheng, you are still here?

109
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,940
I will place the flask on the side of the table.

110
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,860
Stop the car.

111
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,440
Third Brother, why are you stopping here?

112
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,050
Where is this place?

113
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,990
I was thinking. Why don't you both join tonight's gathering on my behalf?

114
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:06,380
You are not going? Boss Bai invited Seventh Uncle this time.

115
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,900
I fear that if you don't go, he won't buy it.

116
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,660
That's right.

117
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,490
With your alcohol tolerance, I don't have to worry.

118
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,140
No, Third Brother. How can you do this to us?

119
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,660
Just go.

120

it's late. You are still here?

133
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,430
Deputy Commander, why did you come back at this time?

134
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,090
Well...

135
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,070
Someone invited me to dinner.

136
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,590
A bunch of people who want to watch me walk into a dangerous situation. Not interesting.

137
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,180
As for you, Ms. Sheng.

138
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,050
It would be great if everyone was as dedicated as you.

139
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,010
English is my native language,

140
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,740
but this is also my first time at translation.

141
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,370
Of course, I should be dedicated.

142
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,880
Is that so?

143
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,820
I don't think it's necessary.

144
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,630
I read your written work.

145
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:14,390
It's not inferior to Chinese girls who have learned Chinese poetry since they were young.

146
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,820
You are flattering me.

147
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,150
I must complete my translations today,

148
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:23,680
so that I won't hold up the audit review tomorrow.

149

Wait here. I'm going to check.

150
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,140
Be careful.

151
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,070
- Put it down.
- Sorry, Deputy Commander.

152

What's going on?

153
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,420
Due to a short circuit, it resulted in the power switch being burned.

154
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,870
The electrician is repairing it.

You can use this for now.

158
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,150
- You can leave now.
- Yes, Sir.

159
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,140
Take this.

160
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,220
At least there will be some light.

You're not as open-minded as Western girls.

If someone takes a picture of what we’re doing right now,

the love affair between Deputy Commander Xiao and his female secretary

344
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,510
The other designs have basically given up this section of the water.

345
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,680
The Yamato Chamber of Commerce's idea is to use the tiny space

346
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:56,010
in between two mountains as the outfall,

347
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:59,430
to shorten the route to North Korea.

348
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,030
This location is also more concealed and windproof.

349
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,900
Let's take another look at the east and west side.

350
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,090
The benefit of this design is that

351
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,440
the rocks on both sides act as natural wave breakers.

352
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,270
This can greatly reduce the construction cost.

353
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,650
That's true.

354
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:31,620
I have a different opinion from everyone.

355
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:36,130
I'm not sure if you've considered the issue of the situation in the waterway.

356

It's true that nobody mentioned this before.

357

Right. It is a problem worth considering.

[Birdseye View of Beixin Harbor | Yamato Chamber of Commerce]

359
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:56,730
In Yamato Chamber of Commerce's proposal, they chose this section...

360
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,350
to be the port area. I don't think that's a good idea.

361
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,890
It has mountains and rocks on both sides,

362
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,170
which can easily get loose due to weathering.

363
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:10,740
If there is a landslide, it will cause safety problems.

364
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,710
Even if it's not dangerous,

365
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,990
the sand and stones will fall into the port.

366
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,000
In the long term, they're definitely going to silt up.

367
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,620
The waterway can be dredged if it's silted up.

368
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,060
We can also reinforce the rocks and mountains to prevent them from loosening. Right?

369
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,810
You're right.

370
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,640
Even if the rocks and mountains get loose, we can just block them from falling with a net.
