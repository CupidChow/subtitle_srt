00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,430
You're used to living as a young master.

166
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,220
I doubt you can survive the hardship at the military school.

167
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,500
I'm telling you. Now that I've decided to go,

168
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,720
I will make sure I do well there.

169
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,950
Let me tell you. Though you are my son,

170
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,460
you will not enjoy any special treatment at the military school.

171
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,520
I have made a deal with the officers.

172
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,130
You will be treated exactly the same as the others.

173
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,340
I don't expect any special treatment.

174
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:08,110
I won't use your name at all.

175
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,210
Good. Suit yourself.

176
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,270
Right, you like betting, right? Shall we have a bet?

177
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,360
I bet that, after a month,

178
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,280
you will sneak back home.

179
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,910
Okay. I will make this bet with you.

180
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,100
I will vouch for him. I'm sure this time

181
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,150
he will become a good officer to bring glory to the family.

182
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,580
When he comes back,

183
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,440
we may have two celebrations in the residence.

184
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,210
What celebrations?

185
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:43,600
Are you marrying me to Young Master Shen?

186
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,750
The old lady wants to get married.

187
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,480
- Xiao Beiyi, no one takes you as a mute if you shut up.
- That's you.

188
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,390
Hangjing, your Third Brother is leaving soon. Do you have anything to say to him?

189
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,640
Today is New Year's Eve. I will drink this cup of tea in place of wine,

190
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,320
to wish you a bright future

191
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,400
and a early graduation, so you can reunite with your family soon.

192
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,280
Okay, tea it is for today.

193
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,260
I thank you in advance.

194
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,120
Older Brother, look! That's so beautiful!

195
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,540
I prefer that one.

196
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,560
Older Brother, look at that one. How pretty!

197
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,590
Older Brother, look at the fireworks, they're as pretty as me.

198
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,300
- Beautiful.
- Miss, now that Third Master is leaving,

199
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,910
you can live in peace now.

200
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,930
That's beautiful.

201
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,990
I guess you're very happy right now.

202
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,500
What do you mean?

203
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,010
Now I'm leaving, you can live in peace.

204
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,260
Though when I'm not here, if you are bullied again,

205
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,820
no one will stand up for you.

206
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,800
Thank you for your consideration.

207
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,740
But I think it's your academics you should worry more about.

208
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,570
Wow. It looks great!

209
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,000
Father, I love it.

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,730
When I'm gone, look after Seventh Aunt for me.

211
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,450
And Shuyi and those two little brats.

212
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,790
I will.

213
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,880
Don't forget about Maose and Hanyang.

214
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,100
Why?

215
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,930
Well, there's nothing I can do.

216
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,640
They only listen to you. Please.

217
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,390
Fine, I will.

218
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,100
Third Brother, come here. Let's set off the firework.

219
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,850
Okay.

220
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:03,030
Oh, right.

221
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,290
- Careful.
- Third Brother, hurry up.

222
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,080
Wait until I come back.

223
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,210
Me at the time

224
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,700
didn't understand his reluctance to go.

225
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,630
And him at the time,

226
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,000
didn't understand the confusion in my eyes.

227
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,500
The young man dressed in great attire riding a furious horse

228
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,580
sees all the petals of Chang'an City in one night.

229
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,140
When we see each other again, three years would have passed.

230
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,370
[Xinping Military School]

231
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,890
The training here is unbearably tough.

232
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,920
How come you two have come?

233
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,720
Soon after your father sent you to the military school,

234
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,670
our fathers followed suit.

235
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,980
We can stay together again!

236
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,400
Yes. We are inseparable, just like a scale and weights.

237
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,790
Am I right?

238
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,620
Say, military school isn't that bad.

239
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,560
The only downside is that you are not allowed out.

240
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,440
Well, when we have graduated,

241
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,870
will Xiao Shuyi marry someone else?

242
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,240
- Fool.
- Come on.

243
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,190
No one but you will miss her.

244
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,210
Speaking of which, Third Brother,

245
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,040
did you have a proper goodbye with Miss Lin?

246
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,410
Did you ask her not to change her mind about you?

247
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,960
That's unnecessary. Isn't that obvious?

248
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,660
She is a person that

249
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,700
once she falls in love with someone, she will love him forever.

250
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,760
Let's go!

251
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,300
What circumstances?

252
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,620
Such a place.

253
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,970
New classmate, I guess.

254
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,920
Come here.

255
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,090
Let me introduce you.

256
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,060
This is Mo Weiyi,

257
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,650
the son of the commander of 2nd Infantry, 3rd Regiment Division of the Defense Force in the three regions of the North. Know that?

258
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,280
As for me, I'm Xu Zijun.

259
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,730
My father is the commander of the 3rd Infantry, 2nd Regiment Division of the Defense Force in the three regions in the North.

260
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

261
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,670
I must grandly introduce him.

262
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,010
Defense Commander of 3rd Infantry,

263
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,120
Xiao Haishan Commander's eldest son, Xiao Beichen.

264
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,380
What story are you telling?

265
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,000
I will introduce myself, too.

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,920
I'm Ye Shengchang, a teacher at Xiangmin Hospital.

267
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,690
A doctor?

268
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,870
You abandoned medicine for the army?

269
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,720
Can you treat illnesses?

270
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,790
I'm slightly better than ordinary doctors.

271
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,250
- You can treat whoever's injured in the future then.
- That's right.

272
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,440
I hope there are no illnesses in this world that can't be treated.

273
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,050
Hello, schoolmates. I'm Kong Zuqing.

274
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,010
Before I joined the academy, I was a platoon leader in the army.

275
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,050
A senior.

276
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,120
I dare not call myself a senior. There are so many platoon leaders in the army.

277
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,280
We have no idea how many soldiers or guns we actually have.

278
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,810
More officials than soldiers, fewer soldiers than guns.

279
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:52,520
As for me, I went back to my hometown to sit for the military examination.

280
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,790
I wanted to learn to fight in a real battle.

281
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,400
Looks like this class is really

282
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,140
crouching tigers and hidden dragons.

283
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,400
May I ask if this is the dormitory of Class Three, Fifth Semester?

284
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,950
Who are you looking for?

285
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,110
I'm Luo Dou. I'm thirteen years old.

286
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,530
I'm here to attend the academy.

287
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,490
- Thirteen years old?
- And attending the academy?

288
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,150
Why is a thirteenth-year-old kid studying here?

289
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,200
My older sister is the personal maid of the third wife of Master Sun Bai of the Bai family.

290
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,280
My older sister begged the third wife. That's how I got the opportunity to come here.

291
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,860
This is Class Three of the Fifth Semester.

292
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,560
We will be roommates in the future.

293
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,410
You are the youngest.

294
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,640
- We will call you Xiao Douzi.
- Okay.

295
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,940
Fine. We will call you Xiao Douzi in the future.

296
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,660
Say that you know the five of us.

297
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,330
You are Number Six in the academy. No one will dare to bully you.

298
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,480
Attention. The principal is here.

299
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,770
- These are schoolmates of Class Five, Fifth Semester.
- Hello.

300
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,520
In our new generation of students, the composition

301
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,090
of this class is the most complicated.

302
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,490
Of course, you will also have the most potential to fight in a battle.

303
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,560
Hence, from today,

304
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,160
you must get along, help each other, and progress together.

305
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,530
- Can you do it?
- Yes.

306
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,640
Fine. Let me do the introductions.

307
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,830
This is Du Heng, Sergeant Du.

308
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,690
Starting from today, he will be your instructor.

309
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,100
That's to say, from now on,

310
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,750
you must obey his commands at all times.

311
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,550
- Understood?
- Yes.

312
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,930
Okay, Instructor Du. Thank you for your hard work.

313
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm going to check the other classes.

314
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,940
Communicate with each other.

315
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,840
Starting from today, I'm your instructor for Class Three, Fifth Semester.

316
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,620
I'm Du Heng. Open your suitcases for inspection now.

317
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,850
Yes.

318
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,710
Inspection?

319
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,200
What are you laughing at?

320
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
"What are you laughing at?" The tennis racket is gone now.

321
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What is this?

322
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,300
Ginseng.

323
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,800
Are you here to be a soldier or a young master?

324
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,700
Confiscate all personal belongings.

325
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,000
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Hold on.

326
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,620
Based on what can you confiscate them?

327
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,200
It's okay for me not to confiscate them.

328
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,300
Take your stuff and get lost.

329
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
If you don't want to go home, stand up straight.

330
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,400
Fine. The ginseng is gone.

331
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,000
The cologne is gone, too.

332
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,800
The tennis racquet is gone, too.

333
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,800
Have you cut it?

334
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Cut slowly.

335
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
Why so ugly?

336
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,600
You even talk about me?

337
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,300
You are just as bad.

338
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,600
Crew cut.

339
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,200
I think our hairstyles are the same.

340
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,000
I will kill the hairdresser.

341
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,200
Watch out.

342
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,100
[Beixin Orphanage]

343
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,550
Thank you.

344
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,100
Come. This is for you.

345
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Older Sister Hangjing is here.

346
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,900
Hangjing.

347
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
Who bought these?

348
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,600
You won't be able to guess.

349
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
We tried to crack our heads and couldn't guess who bought them.

350
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,300
You are keeping me in suspense. Who was it?

351
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,500
You will be shocked if I tell you who the person is.

352
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,600
It's Boss Jiu.

353
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,200
Boss Jiu?

354
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,600
That Boss Jiu who sang the "Drunken Concubine"?

355
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
There's something even more shocking.

356
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,400
I also just heard that, when they were building this orphanage, it lacked a lot of funds. Right?

357
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,400
The funds were donated by Boss Jiu.

358
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Did you see Boss Jiu?

359
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,900
No. It was their troupe leader who showed up.

360
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,200
He doesn't act in front of others or calls attention to his deeds.

361
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,800
I didn't realize Boss Jiu

362
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,600
was such a benevolent person.

363
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Faster! Move faster!

364
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,590
Faster!

365
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
What is it? Can't you run anymore?

366
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Even if you shot me dead right now, I wouldn't run.

367
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Should I release him and let him help you?

368
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,100
No! No need!

369
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,900
I'm so tired. I can't even lift my arms.

370
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,600
Third Brother and I just can't stand Du Heng.

371
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,200
What can you do?

372
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,800
You hate him? That guy Du is talented in literature and martial arts.

373
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,000
They say he doesn't fawn on others.

374
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,500
He doesn't visit brothels or gamble. He's just famous for being strict.

375
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,000
Others call him Crazy Du instead of Du Heng.

376
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Crazy Du?

377
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,800
That's a good name. I'll call him Crazy Du from now on.

378
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,600
We need to make sure we teach him a lesson.

379
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,400
You said you were tired? You look full of energy.

380
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,800
Help me scrub my back. I can't reach.

381
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,200
Scrub your back? Come here.

382
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Let me give you a massage.

383
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,200
Good enough?

384
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Damn you!

385
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,600
You splashed me?

386
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,200
- Why did you take my cup?
- You dare splash me?

387
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, I'll splash you.

388
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I'm splashing you.

389
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,870
Xu Zijun, I'll splash you with two cups.

390
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,700
I'll splash you to death.

391
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,190
Xiao Douzi,

392
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,600
in the future, don't do this.

393
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
They can wash their own clothes.

394
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
Moreover, the days will be long in the future.

395
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
It's okay. I have to wash my clothes, too.

396
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,200
I don't have anything else to do anyway.

397
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,600
If you have that much time, just go rest.

398
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,700
Brother Beichen, I'm not tired.

399
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,400
For me, these small chores let me rest.

400
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Instructor!

401
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,400
Class 3 of Semester 5, assemble!

402
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
Prepare for night training.

403
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,400
Kong Zuqing, mission complete!

404
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,200
Xiao Beichen, mission complete!

405
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
Ye Shengchang, mission complete!

406
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Mo Weiyi, mission complete!

407
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,500
Luo Dou, mission complete!

408
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,420
Xu Zijun, mission complete!

409
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Do you know who came in last place?

410
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,800
It was me, Xu Zijun!

411
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,800
- You'll stay in the muddy water tonight.
- Yes, Sir!

412
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Whoever comes in last tomorrow also doesn't need to return to the dorm.

413
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,000
Reporting!

414
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,200
- Who allowed you to step up?
- Xu Zijun—

415
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Who let you speak?!

416
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,600
What right do you have to speak without my permission?

417
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,480
Listen up. If anyone moves,

418
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,300
the whole squad will be put in detention.

419
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,000
Your punishment now is to stand here.

420
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,600
Until you hear my whistle, you cannot take even half a step.

421
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,700
Turn on the water.

422
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,500
Crazy Du is actually crazy. He's sending us to our graves.

423
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,000
Third Brother, should we just drop out of school?

424
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If we do that, we lose. Endure it!

425
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:04,900
Today, we will be digging out a machine gun defensive position.

426
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,600
Ten meters long, three meters wide, two meters deep. Not a sliver smaller.

427
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,900
If you do a poor job, you all won't be eating.

428
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,800
Fall out. Grab your shovels.

429
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,200
Yes, Sir!

430
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,800
Are you deaf?!

431
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,500
What's going on? Why aren't they moving?

432
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,470
Xiao Beichen, I take it from your attitude that

433
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,180
you're disobeying me, aren't you?

434
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,980
You're defying my orders.

435
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,780
Instructor Du,

436
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,570
do you know who set up Xinping Military School?

437
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,560
Do you know who Beixin, Xinping,

438
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,100
and Huyang belong to?

439
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,380
And do you know who you're speaking to right now?

440
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,160
Of course, I know. You're Xiao Beichen.

441
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,700
Commander Xiao Haishan's son.

442
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,340
So you do know. Then you should act appropriately.

443
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,730
From the day you walked into this school,

444
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,620
you should have known the rules here.

445
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,850
I don't care who you are or whose children.

446
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,730
Here, you're all soldiers without any special privileges.

447
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:43,550
For you to be comfortably educated here,

448
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,750
do you know how many families have been torn apart

449
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:48,280
and how many people were left destitute?

450
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,320
Xiao Beichen, as someone with a vested interest in this,

451
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,710
you should know to cherish this even more.

452
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:57,430
That's why, Instructor Du,

453
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,780
you should speak carefully and act cautiously.

454
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,360
Especially towards someone with a vested interest like me.

455
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,980
Third Master Xiao,

456
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,060
you've been living too recklessly in Beixin.

457
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,540
There are many things you don't understand.

458
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,090
Or perhaps you don't wish to understand them.

459
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,890
Okay. You have the military prestige,

460
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:26,200
but do you have the capability to back it up?

461
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,750
You won't obey me?

462
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,690
How can I, if I don't know your skills?

463
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,200
What do you want to do then?

464
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,950
Wrestling.

465
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,390
- Okay.
- If you win,

466
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,520
I'll accept my punishment.

467
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,580
If you lose, you resign from the school

468
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,620
and leave forever!

469
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,580
Deal!

470
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,990
- Isn't he playing with his life?
- Should we stop them?

471
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,850
Not bad.

472
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,140
Is he a fool?

473
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,820
- Third Brother!
- Third Brother!

474
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,430
Will you listen to me?

475
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,530
I won't!

476
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,100
That's it! That's it!

477
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,700
He's completely not Instructor Du's opponent.

478
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,860
If you surrender, we'll call it a day.

479
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,500
Don't get up.

480
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,050
He's completely not Instructor Du's opponent.

481
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:51,160
Third Brother, this is not the time to show your attitude.

482
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,880
Third Brother, just let go!

483
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,830
I won't surrender!

484
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,260
Third Brother!

485
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,490
Brother Beichen.

486
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,650
Good man, you're tough.

487
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,190
But you've lost today.

488
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,280
I punish you to dig the military ditch on your own.
