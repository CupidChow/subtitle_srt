[Beixin Court]

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,800
According to the trial, there is no evidence to show

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,600
that the defendant Lin Hangjing was directly involved in the assassination of Kang Jingxiong.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,000
But as the painter disappeared suddenly

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,400
and the bloodstain on Lin Hangjing's clothes,

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,600
it can be concluded that Lin Hangjing was covering up for the criminal.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,700
According to the law, the verdict is as follows.

28
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,440
Defendant, please stand up.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,800
- The defendant, Lin Hangjing is convicted of...
- Wait!

Third Master Xiao.

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,300
What does he want to do?

32
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,600
Third Master Xiao, why are you...?

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Your Honor,

34
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,100
I’m here today to vouch for Miss Lin Hangjing.

35
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,000
What? Vouch for her?

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
Third Master wants to vouch for her.

37
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,600
But how?

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm wondering, based on what, Third Master Xiao,

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,400
you think you can vouch for Lin Hangjing.

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Based on the fact that she's my fiancee.

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Fiancee?

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
What is he talking about?

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
- Do you know this?
- No!

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Third Master.

45
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,060
Quiet!

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,560
Well?

47
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,800
Why have I never

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,200
heard about it from Commander and Third Master?

49
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,660
My father and Miss Lin's father

50
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,600
have been close friends for years.

51
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,400
So they'd set up a childhood betrothal for us when we were kids.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
Betrothal?

53
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,080
Childhood betrothal?

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,000
And we're planning to get married within a month.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,600
In a month?

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,400
- Are you crazy? You...
- Sit down!

57
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
That's too soon.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Quiet! Defendant Lin Hangjing,

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
that statement about you and Third Master Xiao's relationship, is it true?

60
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,300
Defendant Lin Hangjing, please answer the judge's question.

61
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,600
Quickly speak.

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,800
Yes.

63
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,400
Your Honor, I, Xiao Beichen, am willing to stake my own dignity

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,200
and my role as the leader of the Ying Army,

65
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,900
to vouch for my fiancee.

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,200
That's a way out.

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,400
Plaintiff, do you have any objections?

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,800
As for the dignity of Third Master Xiao,

69
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,400
I naturally trust it.

70
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,600
As Third Master Xiao's fiancee, I also believe

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,300
Miss Lin would never do anything

72
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,200
like an assassination.

73
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,800
Therefore, I have no objections.

74
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,200
That settles the matter.

75
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,800
I guess it's solved then.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
My Lady will be safe now.

77
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,400
That's great.

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
It's thanks to Third Master.

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
I don't think they can win the case now.

80
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
They lost the case.

81
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Quiet.

82
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Fine. Since the plaintiff and the defendant have reached an agreement,

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,400
it is approved by the court that Xiao Beichen can vouch

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,600
to bail Lin Hangjing, with immediate effect.

85
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,340
During the bail, the person who vouches

86
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,600
will take joint and several liabilities.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Third Master Xiao, the reason you came to visit me today,

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,400
is it possible that it is for Miss Lin as well?

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,300
Uncle Kang, you are right.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm here exactly for Lin Hangjing.

91
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,100
And I'm planning to cooperate with you

92
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,400
after I finish this glass of wine.

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
What do you mean?

94
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,340
I...

95
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,100
need to save Hangjing.

96
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,000
And I have to save her.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,800
And I'm planning to vouch for her.

98
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,700
Wow. That makes me curious.

99
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,600
Who are you to vouch for her?

100
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,260
The fact is that she's my fiancee.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,800
To be honest,

102
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,200
it's just a childhood betrothal that our parents set up for us.

103
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,200
Not a lot of people know about it.

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,400
But I...

105
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
I know

106
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,200
exactly why you're visiting Beixin this time.

107
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
In that case, we'll just talk openly.

108
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
What your father didn't agree with,

109
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,680
do you dare to say yes?

110
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,830
To be honest,

111
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,800
if I can't even protect my fiancee,

112
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
then I'll become a joke.

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,200
That way, how can I lead the Ying Army in the future?

114
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,000
Good.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,100
As long as you can help me

116
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,400
get my goods through the port,

117
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,620
then Miss Lin will definitely return to you

118
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,000
safe and sound.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay.

120
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,800
But...

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,500
I don't know if you'd be willing to

122
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:53,800
clarify your relationship with her, in front of everyone in court.

123
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,430
Uncle Kang, you don't trust me.

124
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,190
Why? Do you notdare?

125
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,200
Commander.

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,400
That show we put up in court was so tiring.

127
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:22,000
I didn't expect that Xiao Beichen would cooperate so well.

128
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,600
You asked Xiao Beichen to admit in public that Lin Hangjing was his fiancee.

129
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,800
Can we believe what he said?

130
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,500
It doesn't matter.

131
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,400
That Zheng Laocu has always wanted to marry his daughter to Xiao Beichen.

132
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
It's a perfect chance

133
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,000
to make him give up on that idea.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,400
I'd love to see...

135
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,600
if he'll stay loyal to the Xiao Family.

136
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,200
Commander, I feel that something's not right.

137
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Say, we didn't say yes to Kang Jingxiong's request.

138
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Why did he release Miss Hangjing so easily?

139
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,900
Commander!

140
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,200
Commander!

141
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Old Zheng, what happened?

142
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Commander, Third Master said in court

143
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,400
that Lin Hangjing is his fiancee.

144
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,800
And they have an engagement.

145
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
When did this happen? Why do I not know about this?

146
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,800
I have no idea why he said that

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,400
in court.

148
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
Commander, you know it better than anyone.

149
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,200
I treat Third Master as half a son, right?

150
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
In Fengqi's heart, there's only Third Master.

151
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,400
- Then you say...
- Calm down first.

152
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
I figure...

153
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,000
it's probably just an expedient solution that Third Master came up with

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,200
to protect Hangjing, that girl at that time.

155
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,400
I hope so.

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,800
But... my heart...

157
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,900
When Third Master comes back, I'll make sure to ask him clearly in person.

158
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,000
Commander Xiao, I am sorry for my recklessness.

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,500
Please don't take it to heart.

160
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,100
It's okay. Don't I know you?

161
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,200
Fengqi is your beloved daughter.

162
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
I am also a father.

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,600
It's understandable, understandable.

164
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,300
Commander.

165
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Commander, something happened.

166
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,300

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Third Master released a batch of opium from the Japanese.

- But...
- But what?

171
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,700
But I don't know why, it was two hours late when I got the news.

172
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,000
That batch of goods has already been delivered out of our jurisdiction.

173
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,100
We don't have the authority to stop it.

174
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,200
How can Third Master do something like that?

175
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,400
What a bastard!

176

Speak up!

181
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
I have nothing to say.

187

I, Xiao Haishan, have spent half my life in the military.

188

I pride myself on not having crossed any lines.

But now,

190
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,800
my son has gone beyond the lines for me.

191
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,200
How do you think people will think of the Xiao Family after you have done this?

192
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,100
They'll think the Xiao Family has no moral standards!

193
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,010
It's your son's mistake.

194
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
Please punish me according to the military rules.

195

You're finally back. Are you okay?

199
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,910
I'm fine. Don't be worried, Seventh Aunt.

200
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,530
Sister Hangjing, were you arrested by bad guys?

201
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,660
I'm fine now.

202
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,970
You're so silly. Third Brother is here.

203
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,470
No bad guys dare to arrest Sister Hangjing.

204
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,740
Seventh Aunt, where is Third Brother?

205
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,420
You still have the dignity to ask about Third Brother?

206
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,820
East Main Camp reported that, in order to save you, Third Brother agreed he would approve Commander Kang's

207

request to allow the Japanese opium to pass through the port.

What?

If it weren't for you covering the assassin out there,

Third Brother would have never done such a thing.

Everyone knows my father forbids any kind of opium deals.

Who knows how Father will punish him.

213

Seventh Aunt, I'm sorry.

214
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,310
I'm so sorry for causing so much trouble for Third Brother, Uncle Xiao, and the entire family.

215
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,670
I'm glad you know what you did. Who is that assassin to you? Why did you protect him at all cost?

216
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,460
I really underestimated you before. Is he your lover?

217
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,570
Shuyi! Continue the nonsense and I will tell your father if you don't stop.

218
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,570
Seventh Aunt, you just tolerate her like this!

219
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,690
Hangjing, don't worry.

220
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,540
I'm sure Third Master is someone with an idea of what to do.

221
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,020
As for the consequences, we will leave it to Commander.

So it's true that Third Master did it?

I heard Commander was furious. It's a written rule.

233

For what? You said thank you earlier.

And I wouldn't be released from jail.

Naturally, you are one of the family.

You're here to tell me you're leaving soon, right?

329
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,690
Third Brother, that's not what I meant.

330
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,240
I don't care anymore.

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause such trouble to your family while my father is still in prison.

Hangjing.

334
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,190
So now you're not planning to tell me

335
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,520
what exactly happened?

336
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,280
Hangjing, I'm sorry.

337
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,670
I really didn't want to get you and the Xiao Family involved in this. Especially you.

338
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,680
I thought we were close friends that could talk about anything.

339
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,420
I didn't expect that we would keep secrets from each other.

340
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,330
I don't want to hear your apology. I just have one question.

341
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,580
Why did you try to assassinate Commander Kang?

342
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:06,690
Kang Jingxiong colludes with the Japanese to sell opium.

343
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,170
He secretly transports the opium into the country, and makes money at the sacrifice of the country and the people.

344
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,920
And he brought a lot of laborers to do hard work at his mine.

345
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,800
He allows his soldiers to tread on them and exploit them.

346
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,860
Shouldn't we just kill someone as vicious as that?

347
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,210
Then, how did you know about it?

Who are you working for?

I'm sorry, Hangjing. I really can't tell you this.

But I guarantee,

351

everything I do is for justice.

352
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,050

Third Brother.

359
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,630
We found Mu Zizheng.

360
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,650
Where is he?

361
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,450
Our people followed him to a dark alley and then he entered a residence.

362
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,480
After investigation, we found that the residence

363
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,730
is the meeting place for the Youth Society.

364

Youth Society?

That guy is exactly a member of the Youth Society.

366
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,280
No wonder he was trying to assassinate Kang Jingxiong.

Shall we arrest him?

368

No. It has already passed. Let's stay put for now.

Third Brother, the force of the Youth Society is becoming more powerful day by day.

The commander knows that they're very active in the North.

But why do we still keep an eye shut for them?

372
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
The Youth Society is a patriotic organization.

373
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,220
The members of it are a group of hot-blooded young people.

Although they tried to assassinate the warlord several times,

375
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,980
but in recent years, they haven't done anything

Mother, I met Mr. Ding at school.

384

He's a very nice scholar. This house

is an empty house owned by his relatives.

386

The rent is very low.

387

The main thing is... I don't want to be bullied by that landlord anymore.

I heard that they've already decided his term of imprisonment. He was almost going to be released.

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,770
Who'd expect that they found new evidence of him faking the account books?

401

Now the court is going to initiate a public prosecution.

Right. If he is found to be guilty this time,

410
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,260
that Governor Cheng is unwilling to release him

As far as I know about Lin Tangsheng,

00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,720
he isn't a man who would create fake account books

transparency is key for ruling an army.

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,460
If we break the law,

443
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,290
it will undermine the foundation of the army.

If Lin Tangsheng has indeed been corrupted,

445
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,120

And besides, Commander Xiao will help us, too.

Okay. What do you want?

484
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,920

486
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,790
Right.

487
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,350
What are we supposed to do now?

488
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:46,160
Governor Cheng only gave five days.

489
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,290
Sell all the land

490
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,580
under my name.

491
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,430
You lead a group in person to Xiping to buy provisions in secret.

492
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,020
But I don't think this plan will buy us much time.

493
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,170
We have to make it in time!

494
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,300
- Use all means!
- Yes, Sir.

495
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:18,560
Instructor Du reported that Kang Jingxiong visited Cheng's residence in secret.

496
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,000
A few days later, Cheng Ling announced that

497
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,260
Uncle Lin's case will be reviewed because of new evidence.

498
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,030
- It's him again.
- Seems like it's because we burned his opium.

499
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,560
He has been trying to take his revenge.

500
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,120
Third Brother, now Governor Cheng sent a telegram.

501
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,070
Right now, Commander has no provisions at all. What can we do now?

502
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,020
There are things my father can't do, but I can.

503
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,150
Third Brother, it's a tricky matter. You have to be careful.

504
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,840
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

505
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,540
Third Brother, have you thought it through?

506
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,450
Are you sure you can handle it on your own?

507
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:41,000
You two, wait for me here.

508
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,550
Governor.

509
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,780
Third Master Xiao.

510
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,320
What's all this about?

511
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,430
We agreed on 100,000 catties of provisions, but I've only received 30,000 catties.

512
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,020
I figured that you may not really mean to save Lin Tangsheng.

513
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,970
May I say something?

514
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,030
What do you have to say?

515
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,430
Governor, please don't get angry.

516
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,520
I know about the shortage. We're very sorry about it.

517
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,890
But both of us know 100,000 catties of provisions...

518
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:57,900
is a huge number, let alone we were only given five days.

519
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,200
Your father made the request to save him.

520
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:04,970
He gave me his words.

521
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,300
Why has he broken his promise?

522
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,010
I know.

523
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:13,480
You don't mean to kill Lin Tangsheng.

524
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,760
Third Master Xiao,

525
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,970
you've come a long way to visit me.

526
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:24,240
I'm sure you're not here to tell me jokes.

527
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,430
Governor.

528
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:33,640
Whether Lin Tangsheng has forged account books or not,

529
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,900
I'm sure both you and I know the truth.

530
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,650
I believe you're a fair man.

531
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,920
You've always been a proud man. If it weren't for you being in a difficult time,

532
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,240
you wouldn't do such a thing.

533
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,720
Hello, Mr. Zhang, this is Hangjing.

534
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,380
Can you help me with my father's case?

535
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,090
Hangjing, I know about your father's case.

536
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,200
I have used my connections with the police.

537
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,950
But they refuse to release him.

538
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:16,890
Oh. I'm sorry to have bothered you.

539
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:29,380
Uncle Zheng, this is Lin Hangjing.

540
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,020
You've known my father for many years. Can you...

541
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,930
I'm sorry, Hangjing. I'm quite busy at the moment.

542
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:38,140
But, Uncle Zheng!

543
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,680
Hello, this is Lin Hangjing. I'm Lin Tangsheng's daughter.

544
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,920
As for the military provisions, my father and Uncle Lin are very close.

545
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,930
He will give you what you need at all costs.

546
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,330
But Governor Jin made an unexpected order

547
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:03,680
which forbids my father from getting involved in any matters in the South.

548
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,730
It's very suspicious.

549
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,260
My father has been doing it in secret.

550
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,080
Why is there an unexpected order from Governor Jin?

551
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,160
There must be someone who reported the matter to him.

552
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:21,960
On one hand, this man doesn't want you to have the provisions.

553
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,300
On the other hand, he wants to break the bonds between us.

554
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:28,680
It's to kill two birds with one stone.

555
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:37,150
Governor Cheng, the reason I visited you today

556
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,750
is to warn you about being friends with such cunning people.

557
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,050
Third Master Xiao,

558
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,080
your intelligence is more than what I expected.

559
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,090
Since you know the whole matter,

560
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,350
why do you pretend

561
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:58,550
you are here to negotiate with me?

562
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,630
I want to make friends with you. That's the purpose of my visit.

563
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,320
How about this? For the crops that have been delivered to you,

564
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,320
it's a gift from me to

565
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,040
help you with the urgent shortage.

566
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,350
For the rest, I will deliver it to you in batches. What do you say about that?

567
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,830
Third Master Xiao,

568
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:23,040
I really don't quite understand you.

569
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:41,250
♫ Who is looking forward to the spring breeze? ♫

570
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:46,380

574
