00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,260
who else can keep the baby?

165
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,890
Choose what you love,

166
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,420
and love what you choose.

167
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,460
[Du Heng comrade]

168
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,070
Du Heng comrade, see the words as we see each other in person.

169
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:23,730
First, I wanted to announce a decision made by the organization.

170
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,060
After reviewing your case, we formally accepted your party application.

171
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,980
You will become a probationary member of the Communist Party of China.

172
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,790
I personally admire your view on current affairs.

173
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,620
I hope we can meet each other shortly.

174
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,100
Your primary duty right now is to spread the power of our party in the Ying Army.

175
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,210
In order to establish a solid foundation for us.

176
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,770
Also, you mentioned Xiao Beichen might be a good candidate to join us.

177
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,660
The organization has taken careful consideration. We realized that he comes from a military background,

178
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,420
since he used to managed his own troop,

179
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,260
we cannot rush to change his existing mentality and system.

180
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,800
We'll come up with a reasonable plan in the future.

181
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,760
Finally, we welcome you to becoming one of us, and congratulations.

182
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,660
Wishing you the best. Written by "Migrant Bird."

183
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,520
Angelica sinensis and wine preserved Chinese peony, 3 qian each.
(T/N: 1 qian = 5 g)

184
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
Ligusticum sinense, 1.5 qian.

185
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,710
Adhesive Rehmannia Root Tuber, 2 qian. Licorice Root 1 qian.

186
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,980
Chinese Dodder Seed, Fritillaria cirrhosa, Magnolia Bark, 1.5 qian each.

187
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,580
Have you got it? Don't make any mistakes.

188
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,480
Fine.

189
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,520
That's right! Three cups of liquid simmered down into one.

190
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,970
Don't burn it, okay?

191
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,630
Got it.

192
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,960
Do you know this little piece costs as much as a villa?

193
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,840
That expensive? Third Young Master is very generous.

194
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,690
Put it in.

195
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,500
Third Young Madam.

196
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,680
Xiu'er, what's this?

197
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,530
It was sent from the kitchen.

198
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,660
They said it's the medicine for Third Young Madam's pregnancy.

199
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,640
They're all expensive ingredients. Please drink it while it's hot.

200
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,260
Didn't they send the medicine over earlier?

201
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,480
Do you know who ordered them?

202
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,350
They didn't say.

203
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,000
Xiu'er, tell me the truth.

204
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,660
Who ask you to send it over?

205
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,880
It's Xiao Rong.

206
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,890
Xiao Rong?

207
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,220
Bring it over.

208
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,090
I can pretend nothing had happened.

209
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,850
But I cannot see you give birth to this baby in front of my eyes.

210
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,000
Young Madam, don't waste it!

211
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,720
- It's too bad!
- How dare you send the medicine over?

212
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,700
Jin Xiang!

213
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,750
Young Madam, you really misunderstood.

214
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,260
This medicine... This medicine is really for your pregnancy.

215
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,710
For the baby? How dare you talk about the nonsense?

216
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,430
I'm not talking about nonsense! It is all true!

217
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,200
Young Madam's body is so weak right now.

218
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,710
Doctor Sun said regular medicine wouldn't work.

219
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,650
Only a hundred-year-old preserved mandarin peel can treat physical weakness.

220
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,710
Young Master went through hoops to get this little can.

221
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,760
It was delivered from down south to here.

222
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,020
I won't drink it.

223
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,900
Young Madam, Young Master is worried about you not taking it.

224
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,180
That's why he told me not to mention anything.

225
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,030
If you don't believe me, you can ask Nanny Liu's daughter.

226
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,100
She is also pregnant, she can test it for you.

227
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,860
No, you don't need to do that.

228
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,460
So you will believe Young Master?

229
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,090
No matter if you're telling me the truth or not.

230
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,500
I won't eat or drink anything he delivered.

231
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,490
- Young Madam.
- Go away! Leave!

232
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,430
You also get out.

233
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,030
Get it.

234
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,770
Lady.

235
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,500
Young Master, Young Madam still refuses to drink the medicine. What should we do?

236
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,290
You will continue to deliver.

237
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,740
Oh, right!

238
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,380
Pay attention to Young Madam's dinner menu. Okay?

239
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,610
- Got it.
- You can leave now.

240
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,000
Lady, they are all for Sir Shen?

241
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,450
That's right. What?

242
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,470
But you haven't seen each other for a long time,

243
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,800
will they fit?

244
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,970
It’s my thoughts that count, not the size.

245
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,620
The most important thing is whenever I'm shopping for him, it makes me very happy.

246
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,220
Fine. As long as this Sir Shen is loved by our Forth Lady,

247
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,900
that’s his fortune.

248
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:09,970
I'm very happy. I’m so happy.

249
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,750
My Lady!

250
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,820
Third Brother.

251
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,460
Are you planning to ignore me for life?

252
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,110
I know you’re mad at me.

253
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,790
You don’t want to see me, do you?

254
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:55,600
You can marry me out, then you won’t see me anymore.

255
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,570
You can call it a day.

256
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,560
Third Brother. Eldest Brother Shen is back…

257
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,640
Are you planning to invite him over for dinner?

258
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,610
You forgot? When we celebrated New Year when we were young,

259
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,800
you fell into the lake. It was Brother Shen who saved you.

260
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,810
The water was ice cold, he almost lost his life.

261
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,650
He saved your life.

262
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,650
Now that he’s back, why don’t you pay him a visit?

263
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,220
When will he be back?

264
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,330
He’ll come in a few days.

265
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,990
I’ll meet him on my own terms. This has nothing to do with you.

266
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:42,460
Third Brother!

267
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,340
I know I did many bad things.

268
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,030
But you need to help me with Brother Shen’s matter.

269
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,540
I’ve been waiting for his return for many years.

270
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:54,060
I don’t care how many people point fingers at me.

271
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,820
I think since I like him,

272
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,130
I should love him all my life, I won’t put up with it.

273
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,620
Go ahead. Tell me what you want from me.

274
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,460
Invite him over for dinner tomorrow.

275
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,510
Fine, got it!

276
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,190
You may leave now…

277
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,260
Young Master, please.

278
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,500
- Beichen.
- Eldest Brother Shen.

279
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,200
You are really mean. You didn't tell me when you would be back.

280
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
As soon as I came back, our Xiao Sanshao was alarmed.

281
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Rightly so. We bid farewell many years ago.

282
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,600
I must be the first friend you have met after you came back.

283
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Let's drink well today.

284
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,800
Okay.

285
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,400
- This way.
- Come on.

286
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,200
- Seventh Aunt.
- Yanqing is here.

287
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Seventh Aunt, I brought a small gift for you. I hope you like it.

288
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Don't be formal to me. Even if you have the great ability out there,

289
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,000
you and Third Master grew up together.

290
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
In my eyes, you will always be the refined and educated second child of the Shen family.

291
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,200
I got it.

292
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Seventh Aunt, you are still quick with words.

293
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:37,000
By the way, where are Uncle Xiao, Beiyi, Beiwang, and Shuyi?

294
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,000
I haven't seen them in a long time.

295
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,020
Your Uncle Xiao, Beiyi, and Beiwang went to America.

296
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,300
As for Shuyi...

297
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,800
Where's this girl?

298
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,200
Third Master, the meal is ready.

299
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,000
- Okay, got it.
- This way, please.

300
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,200
Knowing that you will be back, Third Master properly prepared this meal.

301
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,000
Have a good time catching up with each other. I won't interfere.

302
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,500
Let's go. Try what I prepared for you.

303
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,200
I'm going then.

304
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,000
This way.

305
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,200
Follow me.

306
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
- Come, Beichen.
- Eldest Brother Shen.

307
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,600
- Here's a toast to you.
- Cheers.

308
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,600
I didn't imagine this place would still be the same. I remember when we were young,

309
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,200
we did many mischievous things.

310
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,300
Those days were really without any worries.

311
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,800
I heard you got married. Where's your wife?

312
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,300
She's pregnant. It's not convenient for her.

313
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,600
In my mind, you are still like a child.

314
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
I didn't imagine that. In a blink of an eye, you're going to be a father.

315
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,700
- Come.
- Congratulations.

316
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,900
- Drink up.
- Congratulations.

317
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,490
Hello, Eldest Brother Shen.

318
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,320
Shuyi?

319
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
Shuyi, you have grown so tall.

320
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,800
Brother Shen, you are finally back.

321
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,900
You don't even know me.

322
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,470
My Third Brother misses you very much.

323
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,600
By the way, I learned this from a great chef.

324
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,800
Try this.

325
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,350
Okay.

326
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
What dish is this?

327
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
This is stewed beef brisket with potatoes.

328
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,400
Here you go.

329
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Third Brother, here's yours.

330
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,200
It's tasty.

331
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,000
It's good that you like it.

332
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,370
Third Brother, is it good?

333
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:58,390
Very tasty.

334
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,200
This flavor,

335
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
your culinary skills

336
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,800
have improved a lot.

337
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Brother Shen, during all these years that you were abroad,

338
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,200
I have never heard of your admiration for any young ladies.

339
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,800
After graduation, I threw myself into the newspaper industry.

340
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,000
Frankly speaking, I needed to do everything on my own.

341
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Would I have the time for love?

342
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,800
I have also never met a woman I could fall in love with.

343
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,800
Brother, have some bread.

344
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,300
Brother Shen, you are wrong in saying this.

345
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,400
Since young,

346
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,800
you have never told me what kind of young ladies you like.

347
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,400
I want to introduce someone to you.

348
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,900
Talking about liking, I think,

349
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,000
she's not tacky, has her own opinions, and doesn't follow the trends.

350
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
A woman with a strength of character is worth being respected and loved.

351
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Brother Shen, have more food. I know the Southern, Northern,

352
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Chinese, or Western cuisines, I know how to cook if you want to eat.

353
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,600
Don’t stay at a hotel during this trip.

354
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,800
Stay here. There are so many rooms here.

355
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,400
Moreover, I can...

356
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,700
My Third Brother can chat with you.

357
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,400
Isn't that right, Third Brother?

358
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,800
That's right.

359
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Shuyi, thank you.

360
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,600
I fear I won't have this luck in having nice food.

361
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,200
Why?

362
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm back to settle my family's estate in Beixin.

363
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm going back when I'm done with it.

364
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,600
Are you saying you plan to settle down in Europe?

365
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Yes.

366
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,000
For the past two years, I rarely came back to Beixin.

367
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,800
Many of the family's estate and accounts were poorly managed.

368
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,900
I'm back to clean up these and visit the elders at the same time.

369
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,240
I thought you wouldn't leave again once you came back.

370
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,800
We were friends in childhood. We will eventually grow up to be adults.

371
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,400
When we give up things, no matter what,

372
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
the brotherhood between us will never change.

373
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,600
- Come.
- Cheers.

374
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,400
Why did you call me here late in the night?

375
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,880
Didn't Eldest Brother Shen have a meal at your manor?

376
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Your news really travels fast.

377
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,600
Did you try to get Shuyi closer to him?

378
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,000
Shuyi liked Eldest Brother Shen for so many years.

379
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
As an older brother, how can I not help her?

380
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,200
We are your brothers too. When Eldest Brother Shen is back,

381
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
you didn't care about me. Aren't you being biased?

382
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Shuyi and Eldest Brother Shen are not compatible.

383
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
What do you mean?

384
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
I will tell you honestly.

385
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,400
Shuyi is not the type that Brother Shen likes.

386
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,600
They can't be together.

387
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Is that so?

388
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,300
Third Brother,

389
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,600
can I have hope?

390
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,200
No.

391
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,600
- Have you read the stars?
- Stop talking nonsense.

392
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,000
You and Xiao Shuyi are just like the stars.

393
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It looks near from a distance and can never be touched.

394
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,300
What?

395
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
[Huaxing Hotel]

396
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,840
- Wait here for me.
- Okay.

397
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Sir Shen, I'm leaving.

398
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Goodbye.

399
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,300
Goodbye.

400
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,500
Eldest Brother Shen!

401
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,200
Why are you so secretive? I scared you.

402
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,300
What letter is that?

403
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,600
Is it a love letter from a girl?

404
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,500
Sending me a love letter early in the morning?

405
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,800
Such a solicitous young lady. Why wouldn't I meet her?

406
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,700
I'm just kidding.

407
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Why are you here?

408
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Eldest Brother Shen, you haven't been back for many years.

409
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,400
I believe you are no longer familiar with the streets and alleys.

410
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,500
I happen to have time in the afternoon and wanted to go shopping with you.

411
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,200
I have already hired the rickshaw.

412
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,100
We can take the rickshaw and look at the scenery along the way.

413
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,700
It will be more interesting than taking the car.

414
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,000
Too troublesome. I'm wasting your time.

415
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's not troublesome. I'm not afraid of wasting time.

416
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,200
I'm here early in the morning. Don't you tell me you can bear to decline me?

417
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,600
This...

418
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Enough. Let's go. The rickshaw is waiting outside for us.

419
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,200
Okay.

420
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Eldest Brother Shen, look at that.

421
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,400
I remember there's a bridge over there.

422
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,600
Yes. Isn't that place beautiful?

423
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,000
Yeah.

424
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,400
This place really hasn't changed at all.

425
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,000
Eldest Brother Shen, you still remember?

426
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,100
Of course, I do.

427
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,200
Do you remember that I raised a pet in the past?

428
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,600
I do.

429
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,200
I remember that you named it "Huapang."

430
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Seventh Madam's Mahjong friends fancied it and insisted on coming over.

431
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,200
When you found out, you even cried for a long time.

432
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,260
You have great a memory. No wonder you are good at studies.

433
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,800
That Huapang was really cute.

434
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,500
Is Huapang cute, or am I cute?

435
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,580
You both are cute.

436
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,500
Young Master, everything has been prepared according to your instructions.

437
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Okay, I get it.

438
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
You may leave.

439
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,400
Where's Third Master?

440
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,700
Hello, Miss Fengqi. Third Master is over there.

441
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,950
- Thank you, Sir.
- Let me help you.

442
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,070
You can go.

443
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,580
Shuyi, let me help you go inside.

444
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:20,250
You were so careless just now. Please take a few days of good rest when you arrive home.

445
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,180
Eldest Brother Shen, there's something I want to tell you.

446
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,880
What is it?

447
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,090
Are you really going to move to France?

448
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,790
Yes. What's wrong?

449
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,030
I want you to stay.

450
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,170
What do you mean?

451
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:47,890
Can you stay... for me?

452
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:54,280
I've been hiding these words in my heart for quite a long time.

453
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,380
So I have to get them out today.

454
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,570
Shen Yanqing, I like you.

455
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:09,090
Actually, since I was very young, my eyes and heart were full of you.

456
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:12,480
To me, no other boy can be better than you.

457
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,870
My family has been urging me to get married when you were abroad these years.

458
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,800
But I've always been waiting for you.

459
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,710
Shuyi, you suddenly said these to me today.

460
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,140
I'm really surprised.

461
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,890
But after all, I wasn't in Beixin these past few years.

462
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:32,600
We cannot say that we know each other well.

463
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,530
- And I never thought...
- It's not too late to start thinking now.

464
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:38,350
Neither of us is married, right?

465
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,200
Well, Shuyi. You're tired today. Let me get you inside and you can have some rest.

466
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,960
No! If you don't say yes, then I won't let you go today!

467
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,930
Shuyi! A relationship is not children playing house.

468
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,420
It's not something that can be achieved just by you thinking about it, either.

469
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,380
I know that it's nothing but your childhood affection towards me.

470
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,910
This is not love.

471
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:05,230
And... we're really not suitable.

472
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,740
Please don't waste your time on me.

473
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,410
I need to go now.

474
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,420
Eldest Brother Shen, I'm not wasting my time!

475
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,990
I will always be waiting for you!

476
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,930
Doctor, how is it?

477
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,570
Rest assured, Young Madam. The baby is saved.

478
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:59,030
But you've not been in a good condition lately.

479
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,860
Your body is weak. And I'm afraid this will affect the growth of the baby.

480
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,560
Then, what should I do?

481
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,510
How about this?

482
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:13,490
I will come here each week to give you an infusion

483
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,270
of antiabortifacient.

484
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,940
This will help invigorate your spleen, replenish your energy, calm your nerves, and help with your sleep.

485

The baby can only be healthy if the mother is well rested.

486
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,350
Then, I'll have to bother you.

487
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:31,150
Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

488
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:32,650
Cuckoo!

489
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,890
- Are you insane?
- Jin Xiang!

490
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,170
I'm not here for a secret meet-up!

491
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:42,110
I was afraid I'd bother Third Young Madam! This is for you.

492
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,740
What is this?

493
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,220
This is thirst-quenching sour plum soup.

494
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:48,690
Plum, osmanthus, liquorice, and rock sugar!

495
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,870
Stewed together for 12 hours!

496
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,860
Oh right, and this.

497
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,400
This is my gift for you.

498
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,920
What bad ideas are you up to?

499
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,370
Well, Third Master is worried that Third Young Madam has a bad appetite. He cares about her!

500
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,120
Don't you know? Third Master has been standing here every night,

501
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,060
and won't leave until the lights go off in Third Young Madam's room.

502
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,510
It really makes someone's heart hurt.

503
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:23,480
Sister Jin Xiang, how about you

504
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,100
just accept Third Master's token of love for Third Young Madam?

505
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,930
I...

506
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,130
I only listen to My Lady.

507
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,380
Lady, drink up. It's your favorite.

508
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,190
How did you think of making this for me? I was just thinking about it.

509
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,860
It's Master. He asked Xiao Rong to send this here.

510
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:04,400
Lady, are you really not going to forgive Master?

511
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,450
Lady, actually I think...

512
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:11,820
maybe Third Master is genuinely hoping to get back together with you.

513
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,020
You never drank the medicine he sent here. But he's still asking Xiao Rong to send it every day.

514
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:22,570
For several times, I saw him visiting the kitchen to give instructions about your food.

515
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,260
What matters the most between a husband and a wife, is trust.

516
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,420
He never really trusted me.

517
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,930
We're just torturing each other being together.

518
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,940
- Lady, in fact...
- It's enough. Don't talk anymore.

519
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm going to bed.

520
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,220
Lady.

525
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,830
They have the best wedding dresses in the whole province!

526
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,630
The quality is as good as foreign products.

527
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,340
- Fourth Lady, you're here.
- Yes.

528
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,760
I've prepared your orders for you.

529
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,640
Shuyi, why did you bring me here?

530
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,250
You'll know.

531
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,770
- Xiao Li, bring Fourth Lady in.
- Okay.

532
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,060
Fourth Lady, this way, please.

533
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,990
Sir, please have a seat.

534
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,620
Lady, slow down.

535
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,230
Jin Xiang, why did you bring me to this place?

536
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:17,240
Lady, wait a second.

537
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,720
I'll show you something cool!

538
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,070
Come on, come on.

539
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,900
Look.

540
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,120
Lady, I heard from Xiao Rongzi

541
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,780
that Third Master crafted the wooden horse by hand.

542
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,820
He also selected the best material in person.

543
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,510
He's been crafting it here for quite a few days.

544
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,560
Eldest Brother Shen, do I look nice?

545
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,050
Yes.

546
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:35,270
Brother Shen, I've prepared this suit for you. Go try it on.

547
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,230
Shuyi, I can't just wear the suit for no reason.

548
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:52,080
I mean... wedding dress and suit should only be worn by two people in love,

549
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,960
couples who are about to get married.

550
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,020
Then let's get married.

551
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:09,600
Brother Shen, I prepared this wedding dress and the suit especially for us.

552
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,560
The owner of the suit has to be you. It won't be anyone else.

553
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:20,540
Today, I, Xiao Shuyi, am going to propose to you!

554
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,530
Shuyi, get up now. This is not appropriate. Get up.

555
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,260
No! Say yes first.

556
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,230
Enough, Shuyi. Stop messing around. You can't force it.
