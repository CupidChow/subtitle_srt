00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,800
Because I think you know where the bottom line is.

163
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,940
At least, you know what's right and what's wrong.

164
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,810
But now,

165
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,870
I'm so disappointed in you.

166
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,090
Please let me know.

167
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,760
Is what's written here true?

168
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,600
I never expected...

169
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,460
that you would dare to investigate me behind my back!

170
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:39,620
And I never expected that the older brother I've been assisting, my brother who has gone through life and death with me,

171
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,650
is now colluding with the Japanese invaders!

172
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,850
Then, how about you? You're colluding with the Central Government!

173
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,100
You have such a wild ambition.

174
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,560
Are you going to put the Xiao name on the whole northern territory?

175
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,490
Is that so?

176
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,810
[The supreme good is like water]

177
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,890
Tell the Xiao family that Haishan was sacrificed on his way to Suiling

178
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,500
because he encountered bandits that outnumbered him.

179
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,660
Get rid of everyone around Haishan as well.

180
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,500
Be clean. Don't make them suffer.

181
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,270
He's my brother, anyway.

182
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,830
Yes, Sir.

183
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,140
Older Brother, don't be too sad.

184
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:34,170
Commander Xiao won't be lonely on his road to death.

185
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,400
In a short while, you two brothers

186
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,900
will be together again.

187
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,220
Are you rebelling against me as well?

188
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,790
Older Brother, that's not correct.

189
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,990
I wouldn't dare to rebel against you, even if I'm extremely daring.

190
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,620
Xiao Haishan is the one who revolted against you and killed you.

191
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,590
To get revenge for you, I kill him right on the spot,

192
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,550
and while on your deathbed, you appointed me.

193
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,610
I accepted to take over all your troops.

194
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,000
All the brothers here can be my witness.

195
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,240
Now I understand.

196
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,580
You're the one with the wild ambition. You've been deliberately planning to take my life!

197
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:28,190
Territories switch hands. Isn't that our fate?

198
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,840
The Japanese have long wanted to take over Manchuria.

199
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,500
I’ve devised so many plans for them.

200
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,000
But as long as you’re here, they’ll forget about me.

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,170
Older Brother, for the sake of your brother,

202
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:50,080
why don’t you sacrifice just a little bit?

203
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,670
Commander!

204
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,780
Haishan.

205
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,860
Nice.

206
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,170
How dramatic is your secret scheme.

207
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,010
How can we catch you if we don't make some effort?

208
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:34,490
You gave me everything.

209
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,320
I have no complaints if you kill me now. But I need to tell you,

210
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,400
if I die,

211
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,850
you won't be able to make your way out of this Ziyun Villa alive.

212
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,380
What do you mean?

213
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,630
If I die, isn't this the best opportunity for Kang Jingxiong to kill you?

214
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,420
That's too much of a worry. He only brought four guards.

215
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,780
On my way to Suiling,

216
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,560
I noticed at least five tracks of army trucks.

217
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,540
But outside of Ziyun Villa,

218
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,330
there's only one car. He brought so many soldiers,

219
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,510
where is he hiding them?

220
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,040
And when I first entered,

221
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,300
I smelled a strong smell of sandalwood

222
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,820
from your bodyguard.

223
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,970
Kang Jingxiong practices Buddhism. We all know that.

224
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,130
This is a unique smell that comes from his room.

225
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,170
That means your bodyguard has conspired with him

226
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,060
and they've talked for quite a long time.

227
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,820
If I'm not wrong,

228
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,740
it was his idea to have this meeting in Suiling.

229
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,640
This place is where the three armies converges,

230
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,220
and it's very easy to maneuver troops.

231
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,230
Older Brother, the Xiao family hasn't reached any agreement

232
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,550
with Cheng Ling or the Nanjing Government.

233
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,050
It's up to you to believe it or not.

234
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,700
It's easy for you to kill me now.

235
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,040
But Haishan is the only one who can save your life.

236
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,480
Let me deploy my troops. They're just nearby

237
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,620
waiting for my command at any time.

238
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:15,700
Soldiers! Expel his gun.

239
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,590
Don't move!

240
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:26,570
Commander Kang, I'll take your orders.

241
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,880
Adjutant Zheng, you've been following me for over a decade.

242
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,260
Yes. An insignificant role.

243
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,470
He's been lurking for over a decade, so at this critical moment

244
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,540
he can play a subversive role.

245
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,720
Adjutant Zhou has been very loyal. He's the most important spy

246
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,610
that I've arranged by your side.

247
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,470
Kang Jingxiong, don't make mistakes over and over.

248
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,450
If you put down your weapon and surrender,

249
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,690
Older Brother may spare your life

250
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,990
for the sake of our brotherhood in the past.

251
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,650
Bring her!

252
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,810
- Father!
- Rouke!

253
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:16,050
- Don't move.
- Father!

254
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,120
Ask them to put down their guns and get out.

255
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,510
I said, ask them to put down their guns and get out!

256
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,430
Haishan, ask them to get out.

257
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:43,010
Listen to my command. Put down your guns. Withdraw for now.

258
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:07,110
Kang Jingxiong, you are despicable.

259
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,560
What a deep love towards your daughter. Very moving indeed.

260
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,490
Back in the days, you wanted to constrain me

261
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,900
and sent my only son to join Xiao Haishan's army.

262
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,120
But what happens afterward? My son died in an explosion.

263
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,080
I didn't even see his whole body!

264
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,870
Kang Jingxiong!

265
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,120
You've fought a war. Guns and bullets have no mercy.

266
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,720
And Haotian's death was an accident!

267
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,490
Bring all your resentment on me!

268
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,150
Shut up!

269
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,880
If you didn't

270
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,120
send my son to the Ying Army, and if you didn't push my son to the frontline,

271
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,350
would he die?

272
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,680
New and old revenge, I'm getting them all back today!

273
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,810
I'll let you see with your eyes, your own daughter

274
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,750
dying in front of you.

275
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,650
How would it feel?

276
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,150
Surrender and put down your weapon!

277
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,000
Father.

278
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,920
What's going on? Go down and take a look.

279
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,410
Come down.

280
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,300
This way.

281
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,370
Commander Kang, it frightened you. I'm very sorry.

282
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,100
Who saves people this way?

283
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,880
It almost cost my life!

284
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,720
In order to drag out the time, I had no choice but to do something drastic.

285
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,470
It's too hard to turn things around once you get to court.

286
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,060
How?

287
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,120
Did Adjutant Zhou change what he said?

288
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,470
Mr. Zhou.

289
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,590
Commander Jin died because you were held hostage.

290
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:17,970
This is the truth with no doubt.

291
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,220
No matter how this matter is decided, I'm afraid

292
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,710
your death sentence is inevitable.

293
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,100
Since you are dying, why not do a favor for Commander Kang,

294
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,320
let the family have security for the second half of their lives.

295
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,540
Mr. Sato, I hope that from today onward, we

296
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,240
can trust each other and collaborate sincerely.

297
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,200
Like what you did earlier, don't let it happen again.

298
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,610
The matter about you overriding me and contacting Jin Cheng.

299
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:56,780
Commander Kang, please don't worry.

300
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,460
You are our most trusted friend forever.

301
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,520
This is the news release that was sent to the whole nation by Nanjing's military committee.

302
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,670
Because Jin Cheng's adjutant, Zhou Zhiping, was not used again for many years, he was resentful.

303
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:15,670
He attempted to murder Jin Cheng and frame it on Xiao Haishan.

304
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,450
Kang Jingxiong rushed there in time and wanted to save Jin Cheng.

305
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,850
He had a misunderstanding with Xiao Haishan.

306
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,470
In the chaos, Jin Cheng was killed by Zhou Zhiping.

307
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,880
Deliberately distorting the truth. A load of nonsense.

308
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,660
After news of Jin Cheng being killed spread,

309
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,610
everybody thought Xiao Haishan would replace Jin Cheng.

310
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,830
Our comrades in the south have also been listening to relevant personnel,

311
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:42,000
but they are all secretive and avoid talking about it.

312
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,460
Till just now, Kang Jingxiong was surprisingly transferred from Luanhe to Beixin.

313
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,430
He assumed the post of police commander.

314
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:58,240
After the incident happened, Kang Jingxiong was detained in prison.

315
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,090
The person who can help shift his ground within such a short period of time

316
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,160
is definitely a Japanese.

317
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,420
Yesterday, the organization called to say that they were afraid that we are at risk of exposure.

318
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,510
They want us to withdraw orderly.

319
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,650
Now it looks like it's still too early.

320
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,910
- Okay, okay, not drinking anymore.

Not drinking anymore, not drinking.

322
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,500
Father, Eldest Sister sent a telegram.

323
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,640
She said she has helped you to arrange everything properly. You can leave any time.

324
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Got it.

325
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,560
Commander, I'll go with you instead.

326
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,530
Didn't I tell you, this trip to America is to be re-examined.

327
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,180
At the same time, bring back Beiwang and Beiyi.

328
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,250
These two brats have too much Western influence. I'm afraid they will forget their ancestors.

329
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,310
Then isn't it just right that I go with you?

330
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,350
When you cannot persuade them, I can back you up.

331
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,850
You are afraid that if I get serious with them, you have to put out the fire. Right?

332
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,960
Look at what you're saying.

333
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,230
Okay, okay. Didn't I tell you?

334
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,470
Once I leave, you and the house cannot be separated.

335
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,970
Anyway, I can't beat you in stubbornness.

336
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,010
I'll go and warm up your medicine.

337
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,160
Originally, I wanted to persuade the governor to mend his ways.

338
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,440
I didn't expect it would cost him his life.

339
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,180
He was in the military his whole life, but landed in such an ending.

340
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,800
Father, you don't need to blame yourself for this matter.

341
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,980
Commander, Third Brother has sent people to watch over Miss Jin 24 hours a day.

342
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,170
As long as Miss Jin awakens and testifies, Kang Jingxiong will definitely be brought to justice.

343
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,950
You say this Kang Jingxiong, he has one leg over the gate of death.

344
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,210
He actually was saved by the Japanese and the pro-Japanese.

345
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,890
And he even changed suddenly and came to Beixin.

346
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,060
Now the situation is too messy.

347
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,710
They are aggressively capturing the Communist Party. I heard

348
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,990
there's almost not enough room at the prison in the Cheng Army.

349
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,080
But the majority confess to false charges under torture. To cheat money and show loyalty,

350
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,180
they can do anything.

351
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,190
So, our Ying Army is an anomaly in their eyes.

352
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,120
It's natural that Nanjing is worried about us.

353
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,630
They have always not wanted the local troops to dominate.

354
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,170
So they sent Kang Jingxiong over here to restrict us.

355
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,090
This is the usual trick that they use.

356
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,560
Yes.

357
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,980
Nowadays, the Japanese are eyeing us with hostility.

358
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,570
But Kang Jingxiong is good, deliberately distorting the truth.

359
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:43,070
The army is messy on the outside, the government is messy on the inside.

360
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,180
They just leave all these matters like that and don't care about it. They want to capture the Communist Party every day.

361
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,260
I think they are crazy.

362
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,910
Kang Jingxiong being like this,

363
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,980
it is difficult for us to maintain our integrity.

He often writes articles about peaceful reunification.

I don't understand what you're saying.

Back in the days when I attended the military academy,

394
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,900
I brought a book

395
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,400
of poems that were handwritten by my wife, Lin Hangjing.

396
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
There was this poem that says,

397
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,400
"Furong creates Qiuzhu,

398
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,400
the slit sleeve leaves Qingyong."

399
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,000
Qiuzhu and Qingyong. What a coincidence.

by Li Shanfu.

403

Ms. Sheng, I'm surprised that

404
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,200
you care a lot about children as well.

405

the shadows in the heart of the children,

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,300
and find a place where their childhood can be settled."

408
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,200
When my wife, Lin Hangjing, was residing in the Xiao Residence,

409
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
she wrote an article like this, too.

410
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,550
It's called "Unsettled Childhood."

411
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,600
So that letter...

412
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,040
you faked it?

413
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,400
That's right.

that you and I were separated in two different worlds.

But I still chose to believe that you would eventually come back to me one day.

When Sheng Hanjun returned,

the hope that had been hiding in my heart for five years was ignited again.

I'll never be the Lin Hangjing I used to be again.

464

And I don't want to be entangled with...

Even though all the misunderstandings are now clear,

but it's true that I was hurt in every part of me.

00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:13,400
♫ Who is afraid of heartbreak, denies the heartbeat? ♫

483
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,500
♫ Allow loneliness to smear the other’s protective coloration ♫

484
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,800
♫ Who would be willing to pass the other like this ♫

485
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,400
♫ I also want to be a shooting star to make you warm ♫

486
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,800
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

487
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,400
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

488
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,000
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

489
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,600
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

490
00:44:54,600 --> 00:45:00,400
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

491
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,000
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

492
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,600
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

493
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,200
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

494
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,900
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

495
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,200
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

496
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:36,000
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

497
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:48,410
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
