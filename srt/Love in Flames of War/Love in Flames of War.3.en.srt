Governor, please.

22

You still love making tea, Jingxiong.

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,910
It's just a hobby to kill time.

24
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,690
Tea tasting needs a peaceful state of mind.

25
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,880
I really hope one day I can completely drop the gun in my hand,

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,190
find a place far away, high in the mountains or near the sea,

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,680
practice meditation and Buddhism, and get away from the mundane world.

28
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,260
That state of mind is indeed precious.

29
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,880
But Jingxiong, I have one mundane affair to bother you with.

30
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,620
- What is it?
- If...

31
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,210
If Haishan betrayed me,

32
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,240
what should I do?

33
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,330
I'm not the right person to ask this question.

34
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,120
Why?

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,460
From an objective perspective, I trust that Xiao Haishan

36
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,700
is faithful and righteous. He won't work in the interest of our opposers at the expense of ourselves.

37
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,730
But from my personal perspective,

38
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,210
you clearly know that I will never forgive him

39
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,340
because of Lin'er's death.

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,110
So it's hard for me to judge him objectively.

41
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,230
You're honest.

42
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,430
I am a sheet of white paper in front of you, Governor.

43
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,470
There's nothing to hide.

44
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,800
Jingxiong, I respect you for being honest.

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,540
Frankly speaking, both you and Haishan are my right-hand men.

46
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,820
Naturally, I really hope Haishan will not betray me.

47
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,580
But what if he does?

48
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,660
I can't just do nothing about it.

49
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,330
You... have a plan already.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,420
Jingxiong, if Haishan does betray me,

51
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,940
I'm going to hand him over to you to deal with.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,290
Governor, if you trust Xiao Haishan,

53
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,800
then Xiao Haishan is my brother.

54
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,640
If Governor wants to get rid of him,

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,670
then he... is my enemy who killed my son.

I'll just forgive you for everything you did.

As for Concierge Liu, there is a maid who is close to Mrs. Zheng. She told Mrs. Zheng.

Madam Zheng exaggerated the details and told Commander Zheng about it.

00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,770
For harassing a woman in the streets, you will be whipped 12 times.

163
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,230
If the perpetrator is military, then the punishment will be doubled.

164
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,730
That's 24 times.

165
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,080
I don't think either of you, Young Masters, could bear that much.

166
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,710
Seriously, how would you know we're military?

167
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,720
Aren't you both wearing military boots?

168
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,210
If you two don't leave, I'll call the police.

169
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,350
I'm a witness to the harassment.

170
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,190
Okay. You're awesome.

171
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,920
You'll regret it.

172
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:16,520
I'll invite you to dance sometime.

173
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,220
Thank you so much.

174
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,140
How much are these kites? I'll pay you.

175
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,630
Miss, don't dirty your hands. I'll clean them up.

176
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,040
This road isn't safe. How about I find a car to take you home?

177
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,880
Rickshaw!

178
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,480
Can you please bring this young lady home?

179
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,880
Okay.

180
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,680
Are you a student of Shengyi Girls School?

181
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,870
This road isn't safe. It's best to ask your parents to accompany you.

182
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,350
Thank you.

183
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,970
It's nothing. Get on.

184
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,750
Seventh Madam, the school said Miss Lin did leave the school when classes were finished.

185
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,090
She didn't walk with anyone.

186
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,320
How come she's still not back? What about the people who went to find her?

187
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,440
They all went, but there's no news yet.

188
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,870
- You're finally back!
- You're back!

189
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,500
Hangjing, you're finally back. You scared me to death!

190
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,770
What happened? Where did you go?

191
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,450
I met two hooligans.

192
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,040
What?

193
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,000
Who's so brave? They even bully someone from the Xiao family?

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,890
Miss, are you okay?

195
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,370
I'm fine.

196
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,920
Didn't I tell you two to stop?

197
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,020
Yet you both went to scare her?

198
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,600
Hey, do you guys have any—

199
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,940
- Are you done...
- Hey!

200
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,250
Avoiding it? Kneel!

201
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,200
Look at you. All independent now, huh?

202
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,070
Bullying people, even your little sister!

203
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,390
How did I have such a bastard?

204
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,460
You bastard!

205
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,320
Deputy Official Guo, what's going on?

206
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,550
- The commander...
- I'll whip you to death!

207
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,550
Do you listen to my words?

208
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:11,050
- Commander, are you going to kill Beichen?
- Bastard!

209
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,580
How can I face Eldest Madam if you do this?

210
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,350
She's been so nice to me. You should kill me, too!

211
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,250
Finish everything.

212
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,730
Today,

213
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,670
I'll let you go because of your mother.

214
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,780
You still have enough audacity to mention my mother?

215
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,450
Bastard!

216
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,230
Let me tell you something, Xiao Beichen!

217
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,370
I'm going to send you to Xinting Military Academy.

218
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,270
I'll find the best instructor to teach you some manners!

219
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,940
Just because you say I have to go, then I have to go?

220
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,530
What? You want me to turn out like you?

221
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,700
Fighting and killing people out there all day. Fraternizing people,

222
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,760
and turning around to be their enemy instead.

223
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,680
You want me to go? I'm not going!

224
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,520
Bastard!

225
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,180
Let me tell you! You have no choice.

226
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,310
Get out there and grow up!

227
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:14,510
Once you've matured, then you can come home.

228
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,060
Get out!

229
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,880
Third Master...

230
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:46,690
Tell me.

231
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,660
What should I do with him?

232
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,490
Beichen has the temperament of a child.

233
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,570
He and Hangjing get along so well. How could he bully her?

234
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,150
All these years, I haven't disciplined him enough.

235
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,650
And you, look how you've spoiled him.

236
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,980
Isn't it because I care about him? He hasn't had a mother since he was young.

237
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,930
Don't you understand his suffering?

238
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,990
Talking about First Madam, he must have been so sad.

239
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,810
Beichen is a sentimental child.

240
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,470
I feel guilty about his mother.

241
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,400
But as a father, I'm responsible for him not being well-educated.

242
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,490
There's no discussion needed about the military academy. He must go.

243
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,800
Okay, I understand.

244
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,220
I'll try to plead with him.

245
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,880
Tomorrow morning, I have to go to the governor's mansion.

246
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,060
What are you doing there?

247
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,060
Did something happen?

248
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:21,120
No, no.

249
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,330
If you must know,

250
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,080
this...

251
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,810
The president and the premier are falling out.

252
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,220
Things are becoming more and more out of control.

253
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,960
The premier went to Jingmen.

254
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,460
I think he won't just let it go.

255
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,210
Before we know who wins and who loses, everyone feels imperiled.

256
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,780
I think the reason the governor asked me to go over this time

257
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,390
was to discuss this matter.

258
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,940
Really? You're not lying to me, are you?

259
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,180
What can I hide from you?

260
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm afraid the military will be in chaos.

261
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,820
Our little bit of land here is a bit peaceful.

262
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,060
But if Governor Jin gets involved with the higher authorities,

263
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,580
and starts fighting with other fractions...

264
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:12,650
Don't worry about how they'll fight.

265
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,440
I promise to protect Beixin City.

266
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,250
Regardless, be careful.

267
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,980
I'm not worried about me.

268
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,150
It's just that it'll be hard for you, during this time.

269
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,640
This big household...

270
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,490
You're still so formal with me.

271
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,470
Don't worry about the household.

272
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,840
Miss.

273
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,730
Miss, it's a great day today.

274
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,570
The devil is going to military school.

275
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,930
I got some red papers from Sister Yunyi. Let's make some paper cutting of swallows for fun.

276
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,440
Okay.

277
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,790
Miss, you've got such a pair of deft hands!

278
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
Look!

279
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,640
Come with me. Come.

280
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:43,200
You can't just hold my miss's hand.

281
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,160
Hangjing, you have to come with me.

282
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,750
You have to tell my father it wasn't me who ordered the two guys to harass you.

283
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,920
And... my father wants me to go to military school.

284
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,720
You talk to him. Ask him to give up the idea.

285
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,230
Even if you didn't order these people to harass me,

286
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,530
even if it was your friends who pretended they had your order,

287
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:04,250
the whole thing started from you, after all.

288
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:09,320
I think you should be sent to military school, to learn a lesson.

289
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,690
Why are you making things even worse for me?

290
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,520
Third Master Xiao, if you still think courtesy is important,

291
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,030
please get out of here right now.

292
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:19,140
Third Master, why are you still not leaving?

293
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,710
If you don't leave, I'll have Seventh Madam come here.

294
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,160
You have to come with me. Otherwise...

295
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,180
Be careful. Don't hurt your hands.

296
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,510
It's just a cup. It's not a big deal.

297
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,070
I'll just compensate you for it.

298
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,880
That cup was handmade by my miss and her parents together.

299
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,470
Her mother passed away at an early age.

300
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,570
It's the only memento that she left for my miss!

301
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,310
How can you compensate for the love between mother and daughter?

302
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,480
Leave!

303
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,500
Leave! Go away!

304
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,130
[Music in Heyday]
[Sound in Harmony]

305
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Her mother passed away at an early age.

306
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,830
It's the only memento that she left for my miss!

307
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,450
How can you compensate for the love between mother and daughter?

308
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:46,010
Mom.

309
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,140
I miss you.

310
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,860
Commander.

311
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,940
I think something is wrong.

312
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,090
Haishan.

313
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,980
Hey, Brother Kang.

314
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,690
Haishan, I haven't seen you for a few months.

315
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,670
You look smarter now.

316
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,460
I haven't congratulated you on your promotion in person!

317
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,040
Thanks to Governor's kind heart, the care for his subordinates, and promoting us often.

318
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,060
Haishan, you're not just good at wars, but speak nice words, too.

319
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,030
Conversing with you makes me lucky, too.

320
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,380
Thanks for your compliment, Brother Kang.

321
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,140
Everyone.

322
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,210

Everyone, we'll have a meeting in half an hour.

329

I'll speak to Haishan first.

330
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,790
Okay.

Rouke, take care of Uncle Kang for me.

333
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,330
Okay. Uncle Kang, this way.

334
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:49,640
Haishan, let's go to the study.

335

- After you.
- Please.

336

Haishan, you and I are brothers. We'll skip words of courtesy.

337
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,120
Shen Chenghe was secretly assassinated in Ziyun Hotel.

338
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,930
Are you aware of this?

339
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,870
Yes. I've sent people to investigate it.

340
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,600
But we didn't find who did it.

341
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,170
But you do not know why Shen Chenghe would show up in Ziyun Hotel.

342
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,370
Right?

343
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,930
That's true.

344
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,220
Then let me tell you now.

345
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,780
I sent Shen Chenghe to go on a secret trip down south.

346
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,180
To get a name list of the revolutionary party members who are spies at the central government.

348

Regarding this,

349
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,170
I've been thinking a lot, but there's one thing I don't understand.

350
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,630
Deputy Official Guo.

351
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,970
Deputy Officer Zhou.

352
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,630
Where are the bodyguards of Commander Xiao?

353
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,840
Don't let them wait outside.

354
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,880
We have good food and wine prepared in the side hall. Feel free to enjoy.

355
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,740
Thank you, Deputy Officer Zhou. Commander brought only me this time.

356
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,810
He did not bring a team of bodyguards.

357
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,900
The murderer seems to know Shen Changhe's itinerary very well.

358
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,550
And it was in your territory, Haishan,

359
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,320
that he was killed with no traces left behind.

360
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,480
It seems that the murderer is not just anybody.

361
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,980
Judging from what you said, Governor,

362
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,370
this is very strange indeed.

363
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,170
You can't be suspecting it was me.

364
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,700
Governor, think about it.

365
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,040
No matter how foolish and stupid I may be,

366
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,930
if I wanted to kill Counselor Shen, I wouldn't do it in my jurisdiction.

And with such obvious evidence left behind.

368

Besides, Counselor Shen and I

369
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,600
have no personal conflicts or anything to do with each other.

370

this is related to you.

But please understand.

374

In a position like mine,

375
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,680
I can't afford to bet

376

on people's loyalty.

So, it seems that I have made the right decision today.

379

Please review this, Governor.

382
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,250
Haishan, why are you doing this?

383
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:49,690
Governor, back in the day, it was you who incorporated the small forces of ours

384
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,560
and gave us the chance to achieve something and have a career.

385
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:58,150
I can say that without you, Governor, I wouldn't have achieved what I have now.

386
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,970
I'm very grateful for being trained by you. There's nothing I can do to show my gratitude.

I hope you can say yes to my request, Governor.

395
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,700
Haishan, look at you.

396
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,320
My words were a bit too serious just now.

397
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,130
Shen Changhe's death happened all of a sudden.

I wasn't blaming you for it at all.

there are no worthy people by my side.

401

All the guns have been removed. Has the Governor changed his mind about killing Xiao Haishan?

418
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,580
I'm not surprised. It's all just a staged show.

419

It's all bluff and bluster.

420

Not only did he test Xiao Haishan's loyalty,

but also intimidated everyone here.

00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:36,760
- Orphanage?
- Open an orphanage?

495
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,900
Why do you want to open an orphanage, all of a sudden?

496
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,530
I don't see the reason.

497
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,960
Of course, it's to

498
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,900
house the homeless kids.

499
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,680
Nonsense.

500
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:57,960
Third Brother, what made you suddenly become a saint?

501
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,940
Who did you get the idea from?

502
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,290
You know, since a young age, my heart has always been with the poor.

503
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,300
The reason I'm here today is to talk to you about those kids.

504
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm pleading with you to help those kids.

505
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,950
I do want to help, but you know my dad has all my money.

506
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,000
Big Fool Xu, you are up.

507
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,020
You.

508
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,780
- Your family is rich, right?
- I'm poor. He's the rich one.

509
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,890
Yeah, you're rich.

510
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,970
Come on, guys!

511
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,580
What's wrong with you?

512
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,420
All I asked is something in the mortal world.

513
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,280
Is it that hard?

514
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,360
How about this?

515
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,000
Though we seem to live a luxury life,

516
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,190
the truth is we are all jobless.

517
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,690
None of us has money, though we do spend a lot.

518
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:55,050
You see my pockets. It's as empty as it gets.

519
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,470
- We don't have any pocket money.
- None at all.

520
00:42:57,470 --> 00:42:59,170
He's right.

00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,280
Third Brother.

522
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,540
To be honest, even if we give all the money we have, it won't be enough to open an orphanage.

523
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,120
What you should do is tell your dad that you want to open an orphanage.

524
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,600
He will build three, even ten for you!

525
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,160
Yeah, that's right.

526
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,550
Without your family, you are nothing.
