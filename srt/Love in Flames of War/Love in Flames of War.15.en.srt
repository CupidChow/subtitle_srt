00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,670
This is our first day after the wedding. As the wife,

165
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,110
don't you think you should do something for your husband?

166
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,690
- Don't forget, we're just—
- Shush.

167
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,220
[Happiness]

168
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,990
The walls have ears.

169
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,500
What are you waiting for?

170
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,860
What are you doing?

171
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,020
You did the button wrong.

172
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,820
Please serve the tea.

173
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,070
Uncle Xiao, please have some tea.

174
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,000
Still calling me "uncle"?

175
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,030
Father.

176
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,390
Good.

177
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,410
Seventh Aunt, please have some tea.

178
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,380
Here.

179
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,620
As your father-in-law,

180
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,490
this is a present from me.

181
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,560
Remember, a harmonious family is a foundation for prosperity.

182
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,900
- Yes, Father.
- Thank you, Father.

183
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,850
I will keep it in mind.

184
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,310
Okay. You can get up now.

185
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,930
Beiyi. Beiwang. How do you feel about that?

186
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,270
Jealous of your brother?

187
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,650
Look at them. How sweet they are!

188
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,290
Lin Hangjing, you're a lucky woman, you know.

189
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,080
You caused us so much trouble and you still managed to marry my third brother.

190
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,350
Xiao Shuyi, don't you think you should change your address?

191
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,300
Change what address?

192
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,030
You have to call her sister-in-law.

193
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,100
No. I'm not used to it.

194
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,190
From now on, you have to change your address.

195
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,980
Why do you all help her bully me?

196
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,110
Have I become an outsider in this family?

197
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,530
Where are your manners?

198
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,740
Sister Shuyi, don't be angry.

199
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:32,880
You'll be a bride soon.

200
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,850
Who is the groom?

201
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,780
It's Brother Zijun, of course.

202
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,120
He is the only silly one.

203
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,420
Xiao Beiyi, what are you saying?

204
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,860
You naughty boys, enough.

205
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,800
- Yunyi, have you got the tea and snacks ready?
- They're ready, My Lady.

206
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,590
Let's go and have some food.

207
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,350
Let's go. Come with me.

208
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,540
Let's go.

209
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:05,950
There is no one around.

210
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,130
Well, it's not the evening yet.

211
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:19,760
From now on, you'd better keep your distance when there's no one around.

212
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
Yeah.

213
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,390
[Quarry. General Hills. A few households.]

214
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,300
Get up. Everyone, get up!

215
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,670
What happened?

216
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,870
What's going on?

217
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,950
It's the irregular search. If they find any extra items, they will kill you for it.

218
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,920
Search!

219
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,580
Where did you get it from? How dare you steal money!

220
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,010
- Report! The search is done.
- Go back to sleep!

221
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,940
I'm going back to the south. I will ask every one of my father's friends.

222
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,350
If there's really no way, I will beg Governor Cheng myself.

223
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,280
I'll go with you.

224
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,560
Hangjing, how are you now?

225
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,530
Is your father safe?

226
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,960
Hangjing, the men's wine table.

227
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,070
The women's Mahjong table.

228
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,620
Although it's a small table,

229
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,360
it entails every kind of

230
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,310
interaction and connection among people.

231
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,480
Now that you are married to Beichen,

232
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,940
and you have resigned from your job to write articles at home,

233
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,990
you still need to spend some time with the ladies.

234
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,060
They represent all kinds of forces.

235
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,740
This is the social activity you have to participate in as Third Young Madam.

236
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,940
But, Seventh Aunt, I really don't know how to play Mahjong.

237
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,480
How is this difficult? You will know how after a few rounds.

238
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,850
Come on.

239
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,350
Young Madam.

240
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,830
Come and save me.

241
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,060
- I'm the only losing one.
- Come and join us.

242
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,090
This is Hangjing's first time playing.

243
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,820
Teach her well.

244
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,270
I will make you all some tea.

245
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,790
- Okay.
- Thank you.

246
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,890
Come. Let's get started.

247
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,410
Seven.

248
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,190
Get one.

249
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,710
Have you heard?

250
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,200
The second young master of Old Wang has a mistress out there.

251
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,230
Really? Does his wife know about it?

252
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,110
Of course, she knows.

253
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,770
He bought her a house out there.

254
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,250
His wife broke into her place

255
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,690
and had her face covered in scratches.

256
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,070
She deserved it. Where has this wild weed come from

257
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,770
and tried to be a peony.

258
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,260
In my opinion, wild weeds like her,

259
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,330
who have their eyes on the title and property, deserve to be hit.

260
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,920
Why bother? In my opinion,

261
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,970
it's better to spend time on a trip to Paris and buying new jewelry,

262
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,770
clothes, or rings.

263
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,430
Madam Song, when did you buy the ring?

264
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,430
My husband

265
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:47,620
asked a friend and bought it off a Russian nobleman.

266
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,360
It's this big, so it's all right.

267
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,810
If you're wearing a diamond of ten carats,

268
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,020
you won't be able to play Mahjong.

269
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,670
I'll never get a compliment from you. If I can't play Mahjong,

270
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,670
you will have no one to play with.

271
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,110
I don't think so.

272
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,850
We have a new player now.

273
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,120
Third Madam, we should spend more time together.

274
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,280
- Yeah.
- We can always get together when you're free.

275
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,350
How fickle you are!

276
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,150
Third Madam is such a beautiful young woman.

277
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,610
We're very lucky to have her join us.

278
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,400
You're right.

279
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,310
Third Brother.

280
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,740
Come in.

281
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,740
- Third Brother.
- Good to see you.

282
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,780
Anything from Instructor Du?

283
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,720
There's intelligence about Kang Jingxiong.

284
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,910
There's a person who visits Kang's residence every half a month.

285
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:42,050
He's from a book club in Beixin called Knowledge Bookstore.

286
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,990
The bookstore may be...

287
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,690
the secret communication station between them and Kang Jingxiong.

288
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,400
I was saying.

289
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,890
I was saying no wonder we couldn't detect any peculiars on the phone calls or telegrams.

290
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,430
I have sent people to keep an eye on them.

291
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,310
Our intelligence shows the owner pays particular attention to the book storage room on the second floor.

292
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,340
It's quite suspicious.

293
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,810
Third Brother, you can leave the rest to us.

294
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,370
We'll catch them red-handed.

295
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,360
Don't be reckless.

296
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,090
The owner must be one of them.

297
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,120
We can't alert him.

298
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,190
- Okay.
- Got it.

299
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,480
Sister Hangjing, can I still get it?

300
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,190
I'm very close.

301
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,110
Sister Hangjing, a little further.

302
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,500
A little left.

303
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,250
A little further.

304
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,290
Third Brother, when did you come back?

305
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,420
I'm back in time.

306
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,810
Is it you two being naughty again?

307
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:02,030
How can you let your sister-in-law do such a dangerous task?

308
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,630
I volunteered.

309
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,420
You can't let her do such dangerous things again. Do you understand?

310
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,300
- I understand.
- I understand.

311
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,470
Let's go.

312
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,190
Third Brother, put me down.

313
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,520
How loving!

314
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,980
Here is the medicine.

315
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,900
Show me your ankle.

316
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,280
See, it's swollen.

317
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,950
It didn't hurt the bone. It's not a big deal.

318
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,060
Why did you climb so high for no reason?

319
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,920
It's just to get a toy.

320
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,310
You should have asked Xiao Rong to such things.

321
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,010
- Um, I think it's better for Jin Xiang to do it.
- Right, let me do it.

322
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,940
She is probably needed in the kitchen.

323
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,410
I can do it.

324
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,260
Rubbing it like this can help it ease the pain.

325
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,130
How is it? Does it still hurt?

326
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,880
It doesn't hurt anymore.

327
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,380
We haven't seen each other in so many years since graduation.

328
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,290
When did you come back?

329
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:09,700
I came back at the beginning of the year. But I was busy.

330
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,190
Hangjing, when we were at school, you and Third Master Xiao were known enemies.

331
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,180
How come you two are married now?

332
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,780
Who made the first move?

333
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,340
We've only just met and you started to make fun of me.

334
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,740
How have you been?

335
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,100
How do you enjoy life as the wife of an army chief?

336
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,410
I used to work at the newspaper office.

337
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,130
But after I got married, my family felt it was better for me

338
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,100
to resign to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

339
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,820
Now I'm only writing articles at home.

340
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,630
But I'm not very productive.

341
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,080
What do you do in your spare time?

342
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,860
My spare time... I have really become an idle person.

343
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,200
I feel I'm wasting my time.

344
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,330
That's great. You can come and help me!

345
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,450
Help you?

346
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,350
During my years in Europe, I had been thinking of opening a school for ordinary girls.

347
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,550
A school for ordinary girls?

348
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,090
That's right. I want to found a school just for girls from poor families.

349
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,380
They either start making a living at a young age

350
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,160
or get married at a young age. They have no chance to get an education.

351
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,870
My transfer student friends and I raised a fund

352
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,520
which can be used to rent a venue.

353
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,230
Since I returned home, my friends helped me get a teaching permit.

354
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,730
It was not easy at all.

355
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,480
But fortunately, we have built the school.

356
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,990
We're recruiting teachers. Would you be interested?

357
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,490
But I have to ask my family first.

358
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,100
And I have never studied abroad. I'm not sure if my teaching philosophy matches yours.

359
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,550
Come on. Stop rejecting. You are an author.

360
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,880
You're great at Chinese literature. I'm sure you will be a good teacher.

361
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,490
Hangjing, just come and help me.

362
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:56,150
Okay. But I still need to talk to my family first.

363
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,070
I will let you know if they approve.

364
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,460
I will be waiting for the good news from you.

365
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,230
Hangjing, you want to be a teacher at a girls school?

366
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:17,830
Father, now that I don't work at the newspaper office now, I have a lot of time to spare.

367
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,420
I want to do something.

368
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,070
Of course. You're an advocate for women's independence,

369
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,770
and women getting an education.

370
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,830
It's all great.

371
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,370
But you are a daughter-in-law of our family.

372
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,830
Everything you do will have an influence

373
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,150
on the image of the Xiao's family.

374
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,680
Right? If you make some mistakes...

375
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,020
I've never heard of any women going out right after getting married.

376
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,050
That's too wild.

377
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,140
Hangjing, you just said

378
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,730
the school is a school for girls from poor families.

379
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,290
I think it's very meaningful.

380
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,940
It's a very kind gesture.

381
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,840
But at the moment, what's more important is that

382
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,640
you and Beichen should

383
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,060
allow me and the commander to have a grandson.

384
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,110
Well, Beichen. What do you think?

385
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,720
I think you are right.

386
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,260
But—!

387
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:34,700
So, Hangjing,

388
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,280
you two have just gotten married.

389
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,660
As for your work,

390
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,860
we will talk about it specifically another time.

391
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,950
I understand.

392
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,200
It's late now. You should rest early.

393
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm not tired.

394
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
Are you mad at me?

395
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,300
No.

396
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,860
Just because I didn't help you in front of my father?

397
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,500
I said, I'm not.

398
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,700
Are you really so eager to teach at the girls school?

399
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,800
Even if I can't do that,

400
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
I want to help out as much as I can.

401
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,400
But it's really late right now.

402
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,400
You can go to bed first.

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,400
Third Brother, didn't we agree

404
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,600
that we'll be intimate during the day

405
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,200
and keep our distance at night?

406
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,700
There's nothing wrong for me to worry about my wife's health condition.

407
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,030
Thank you.

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Suggestion for you. If you don't want anything to happen,

409
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,000
be obedient and go to bed.

410
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,710
Come in.

411
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
Father. Seventh Aunt.

412
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,300
What is it?

413
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm glad you're both here.

414
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,600
I have something to discuss with you.

415
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,900
Then it must be a big matter.

416
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,400
You look so serious. Tell us about it.

417
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,700
Actually... I think allowing Hangjing to teach at the girls school

418
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,000
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

419
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,800
Well... tell us more about it.

420
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,000
Hangjing is the daughter-in-law of the Xiao Family.

421
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,400
If she helps children of poor families go to school,

422
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
teach them to read and write,

423
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,000
it represents the Xiao Family's attitude.

424
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,200
She can help the Xiao Family win the support of the people.

425
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,600
Commander, I think what Third Master said makes sense.

426
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,600
Girls nowadays are different.

427
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,400
They know the value of reading and writing.

428
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,200
If I were a few years younger, I'd want to go as well.

429
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,800
Father, Hangjing is pleased to do it.

430
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,700
And she can represent the Xiao Family to earn a good reputation.

431
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Isn't that wonderful?

432
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Okay. Okay. If you both agree,

433
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,500
then I will not object to it.

434
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:47,000
If Hangjing really wants to do it, then just let her.

435
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,100
Okay. Thank you, Father. Thank you, Seventh Aunt.

436
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,400
Don't let it delay you from giving us a grandson.

437
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,900
Okay.

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm looking for the English version.

488
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,400
English version?

489
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,800
But... oh, we don't have it down here. I'll look for it upstairs.

490
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,300
Boss! Boss!

491
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,700
It's not that urgent.

492
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,000
Sir, please bear with me a few seconds.

493
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,200
Where is Fox Mo?

494
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Found it. It's a bit dusty.

495
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,300
It's okay. The dust delays me from reading.

496
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Thank you.

[Universal Department Store]

498
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,400
I thought that such a prestigious family like the Xiao's would definitely stop you from doing it.

499
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,400
I didn't expect them to be so open-minded.

500
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,500
Yes. At first, Father and Seventh Aunt didn't agree.

501
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,800
But somehow they changed their minds.

502
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
No matter what, it's great that they said yes. We can work together now.

503
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,000
There's a cloth shop ahead. They sell beautiful curtains.

504
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,400
Miss Jiaman is here! Miss Jiaman!

505
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,300
Miss Jiaman!

506
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,000
Miss Jiaman!

507
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,200
Miss, can I have an autograph?

508
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,100
Thank you.

509
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,800
That person looks familiar.

510
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
I feel I've seen her somewhere.

511
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,600
- Miss Jiaman, can I have your autograph?
- Thank you, Miss Jiaman!

512
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,400
Right! She's Miss Jiaman!

513
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,000
Jiaman? Who is she?

514
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,400
She's very famous among transfer students.

515
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,600
She studied in France.

516
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,000
And she was an actress in French movies!

517
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

518
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,400
- Please sign your autograph here.
- Okay.

519
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,000
Thank you!

520
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,600
- It's done.
- Thank you.

521
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,600
That man is a thief! Catch him!

522
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,400
Stop!

523
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,100
Stop him!

524
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,500
Get up!

525
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,100
How dare you? Come with me!

526
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,000
Miss Jiaman, is this yours?

527
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,400
Yes. Thank you.

528
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,800
Thank you so much, Miss Jiaman.

529
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,700
You're welcome. I should be the one saying thank you.

530
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,400
I didn't expect that you two would be teachers at a girls' school!

531
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,800
It's my honor to meet you.

532
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,400
I hope we'll meet again. See you!

533
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
See you.
