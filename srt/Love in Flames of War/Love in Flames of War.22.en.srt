21
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,990
When did you come back?

22
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,470
And you're not afraid someone will see.

23
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,750
Just let me hug you for a while.

24
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,160
Just the way we're doing now.

25
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,590
Are you still worrying about Mo Weiyi's matter?

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,990
I heard that he doesn't want to return to the East Main Camp.

27
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,000
Weiyi was brought up by his father since he was a child.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,090
Now we haven't figured out the reason for Mo Xibai's death.

29
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,030
Of course, he's not willing to return.

30
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,850
Don't be too worried about it.

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,940
I believe the truth will be revealed one day.

32
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
It will.

33
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,900
The governor will visit Beixin next week with the 23th Regiment.

34
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,610
They will do military exercises with us for one month.

35
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:26,180
I'm assuming he will be discussing with me the option of having troops garrison at Suiling after that.

36
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,950
What is the governor planning to do?

37
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,650
Troops in the South want to go on an expedition to the North.

38
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,760
Expedition to the North? That will make everyone afraid.

39
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,930
The two divisions under Yan Laocu are already creating a disturbance.

40
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,800
Although they are not attacking in front of our doors yet, we have to be prepared in advance.

41
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,530
What if they are? We'll just fight them.

42
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:52,860
As far as I'm concerned, the governor is being too sensitive.

43
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,680
I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.

44
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,100
No matter what, we'll give him a reception at the highest standard.

45
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,660
We'll reinforce the security measures,

46
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,280
and for anything else, we'll just be adaptable.

47
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,530
Commander, the governor is suddenly suggesting a joint garrison by three sides,

48
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,250
and wants to garrison in Suiling.

49
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,260
Is he helping to strengthen the forces of the Ying Army, or is he aiming at something else?

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,640
I've replied to the governor.

51
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,560
He'll send a regiment, and I'll send a regiment, too.

52
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,600
I won't hesitate even just a bit.

53
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,910
Are we just sending a regiment to the Beixin City for nothing?

54
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,550
The governor is just taking the chance to eliminate their forces.

55
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,660
You mean... the governor wants to garrison at Suiling in the name of defending again the Northern Expedition,

56
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,810
but in fact, his target is the Ying Army of the Xiao family?

57
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,420
Say, when there's a big show, who will be the happiest?

58
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,570
People who watch the show, naturally.

59
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,120
That's why on this matter,

60
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,660
we can just be onlookers.

61
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,070

62
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,190
It was Young Third Madam.

that if we want to publish it again, we need permission from Mr. Lin.

Oh?

92

You've already contacted him? I thought Governor Cheng said that

93
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,880
no one can contact him.

94
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,190

00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,460
- Fengqi.
- Father.

162
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,940
Come with me.

163
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,310
Daughter, what brings you here?

164
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,190
Hangjing and Third Brother invited me.

165
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,090
How can I refuse their invitation?

166
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,250
Father, don't worry about me.

167
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,820
- I...
- Governor Jin is here!

168
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,930
- Beichen! Congratulations.
- Governor.

169
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,000
You've been promoted as the Deputy Commander of the Ying Army.

170
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,090
And you're the youngest deputy commander in the three armies.

171
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,860
I'm not talented. I look forward to receiving your guidance in the future.

172
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,720
You're young and have a promising future. You're the hope of older generations like us.

173
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,910
Thank you, Governor.

174
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,110
Let me introduce her to you. This is my daughter, Rouke.

175
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,340
You'd met her when you were much younger.

176
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,020
Now, do you still recognize each other?

177
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,180
Yes, we were only fifteen when we met. It's been a long time.

178
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,610
Nice to meet you again, Miss Rouke.

179
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,310
Is this Third Master's wife?

180
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,110
Miss Rouke.

181
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,830
I've heard that Third Master's wife was beautiful, talented, and elegant.

182
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,350
Now I get to meet you in person and those words are true.

183
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,860
Thank you for your compliment, Miss Rouke.

184
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,790
Let me introduce one more person. Mu Zizheng.

185
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,290
This is my new foster son.

186
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,750
He's the Head of Administration at the camp of the Governor's Office.

187
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,820
He's in charge of training soldiers.

188
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,680
Mu Zizheng?

189
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,150
Zizheng, meet with Third Master Xiao and his wife.

190
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,030
Nice to meet you.

191
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,300
Sir Mu.

192
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,930
Sir Mu must be extremely talented

193
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,900
to be Governor Jin's foster son.

194
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,270
Thank you for your compliment, Third Master.

195
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,230
I've long heard of your reputation.

196
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,170
All right. It's a wonderful night.

197
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,400
Everybody!

198
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,890
Dance and drink! Help yourselves!

199
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,660
Thank you, Governor!

200
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,110
I heard that the Northern Expeditionary Army

201
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:37,690
has assembled in Shaoguan.

202
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,770
I think it's quite crucial for us to build up a defense in Yaochong.

203
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,120
This time, we're uniting three sides

204
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,580
to garrison.

205
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,020
I've already asked Jingxiong to lead troops there first.

206
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,580
I’ll lead the 23rd Regiment.

207
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,840
And we'll practice joint military exercises with the East Main Camp together for a month.

208
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,760
When they're ready to fight together,

209
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,510
we'll move our troops to Suiling together.

210
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,970
Beichen, what do you think?

211
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:09,270
Beichen will definitely cooperate as much as I can.

212
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,910
I look forward to the outcome of this joint military exercise.

213
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,950
Everyone, we should congratulate the promotion

214
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,890
of Deputy Commander Xiao. Come!

215
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,260
Congratulations on your promotion, Deputy Commander Xiao.

216
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,090
Thank you, everyone.

217
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,900
Isn't my Third Master handsome?

218
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,170
Of course!

219
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,880
Yeah, they're a perfect match.

220
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,980
He became Deputy Commander at such a young age. What an achievement!

221
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,360
Hangjing, don't you think so?

222
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,180
Seventh Aunt, please excuse me for a moment.

223
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,890
Sure.

224
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,680
Governor, can you excuse me for a moment?

225
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,400
Please.

226
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,860
Beichen, can I ask you for a dance?

227
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,420
Beichen, you should be the host tonight.

228
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Please bring Rouke to a dance.

229
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,190
Miss Rouke.

230
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,710
[Restroom]

231
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,680
Zizheng, let go of me first!

232
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,820
Hangjing.

233
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,920
Why did you marry Xiao Beichen?

234
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,110
Why did you marry someone you don't love?

235
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,890
Zizheng, it's a long story. Tell me first...

236
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,040
Where did you go that day without saying goodbye?

237
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,940
And why did you become Governor Jin's foster son?

238
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,110
Do you remember when you asked me why I tried to assassinate Kang Jingxiong?

239
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,480
I joined the Youth Society very early on.

240
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,130
Youth Society?

241
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,010
Correct.

242
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,240
When?

243
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,660
Three years ago. When we were at a student rally,

244
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,750
the executive of Beixin Youth Association, Ding Rouyong, found me

245
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,690
and wished for me to join them.

246
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,070
Since then, he secretly trained me for half a year.

247
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,560
That's why you rarely showed up in the newspaper office for a period of time.

248
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,480
One day before we were about to take the ship to the south,

249
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,410
the organization gave me an urgent task.

250
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:59,390
I had to leave immediately. I had no time to explain it to you.

251
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,650
So I had Brother Yong...

252
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,090
but he didn't give the letter to you.

253
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,790
Then I was sent to a labor camp. It was impossible for me to get in contact with the outside world there.

254
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,760
Then a lot of things happened.

255
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,030
Now I've become the foster son of Jin Cheng.

256
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,200
After that,

257
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,080
I will tell you all about it in the future slowly.

258
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,100
You know what has happened now.

259
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:31,130
Then you tell me now how Xiao Beichen forced you to marry him.

260
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,010
Zizheng, it's not like what you think.

261
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,760
What is it like, then?

262
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,220
Hangjing, you don't need to be afraid of Xiao Beichen. I'm protected by the Governor and Sister Rouke.

263
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,290
She sees me as her biological brother. She will help us.

264
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,630
Zizheng.

265
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:49,270
No one forced me.

266
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,940
I married him willingly.

267
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,060
What are you saying?

268
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,260
That's impossible. Hangjing, you can tell me the truth.

269
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,370
Have you forgotten the days we were true to each other? Was that all fake?

270
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,490
You surely know how I feel about you.

271
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:19,080
You cared about me. You looked after me.

272
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,290
I know it. It's because you're blaming me for leaving without notice.

273
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,290
I apologize to you. I can do anything to make it up to you.

274
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,680
Zizheng, calm down.

275
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,050
A lot of things have happened while you were gone.

276
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,490
But seeing that you are safe, I am at ease.

277
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,200
I have been gone for quite a while. I need to go now.

278
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,340
What would you think if I told you that my leaving Beixin was Xiao Beichen's doing?

279
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,740
What did you say?

280
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,380
You won't believe it, right?

281
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,270
You said it was a mission given to you by the Youth Union.

282
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,310
Yes.

283
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,840
But Xiao Beichen plotted it.

284
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,650
He knew who I was when I was trying to kill Kang Jingxiong.

285
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,790
He sent people to keep an eye on me and the members of the Youth Union.

286
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:17,930
He knew that we had bought tickets to go to the south to save your father.

287
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,930
In order to separate us, he found Brother Yong.

288
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,770
He threatened Brother Yong with my life.

289
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,030
I don't believe it.

290
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,950
No, I don't believe it.

291
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,170
Hangjing, Xiao Beichen isn't as simple as you think.

292
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,580
Sir Mu, I see you're chatting with my wife.

293
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,510
Yes.

294
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,080
I don't know why I get along well with Third Young Madam.

295
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,260
Hangjing.

296
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,130
Let's go.

297
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,670
There you are.

298
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,610
Hangjing, there are some Madams and Misses that I don't know. Can you introduce me to them?

299
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,510
Of course I can.

300
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,640
I thought you left.

301
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,680
How come you're back?

302
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,710
You should know why I left.

303
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,100
You want to steal Hangjing from me?

304
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,360
Are you scared?

305
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,340
Hangjing is my lawful wife.

306
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:13,200
My Madam. I'm scared?

307
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,490
Xiao Beichen,

308
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,370
I don't care what despicable means you used to force Hangjing to marry you.

309
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,910
I will have her return to my side.

310
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,530
This time, I will make sure you see clearly that

311
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,890
the person Hangjing truly loves is me.

312
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,150
Okay. You can try.

313
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,460
You can ask me anything you want to ask.

314
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,980
I have nothing to ask about.

315
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,440
Mu Zizheng told you I made him leave Beixin, didn't he?

316
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,540
If there was another opportunity,

317
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,280
I would still do the same.

318
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,670
So you admit it?

319
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:59,460
Lin Hangjing, people are selfish when it comes to love.

320
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,700
I didn't threaten him with a gun on his head. He chose to leave himself.

00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:00,480
♫ At least the flight will be smooth ♫

481
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,130
♫ Waiting for a promise my whole life ♫

482
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,750
♫ I cherish even the short-lived happiness ♫

483
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:17,240
♫ Leave some tenderness to the years ♫

484
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,020
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

485
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:28,640
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫

486
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,270
♫ I draw your silhouette in the sky ♫

487
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:39,770
♫ Let me brighten your galaxy once again ♫

488
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:49,770
♫ If you still remember, when the next time a
shooting star passes ♫

489
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:59,820
♫ I used to miss your silhouette in the sky ♫
